DESCRIPTION

MB-6710: Check the file revid on retry of setVBucketState

There was a race condition here between the compactor and
couch-kvstore where a set vbucket state command would fail because
a later revid file was created and we still had the old revid. This
change checks for the file revid each time we try to set the vbucket
state.

Jin checked in a fix yesterday that also fixes this problem. We will put this up for review again if Jin's fix doesn't solve the issue.
