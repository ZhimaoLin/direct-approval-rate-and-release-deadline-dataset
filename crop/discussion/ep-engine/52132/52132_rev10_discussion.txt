DESCRIPTION

MB-9897: Providing APIs to stage cursor dropping (Producer)

Checkpointing:
    - Checkpoint::isEligibileToBeUnreferenced()
      (if persistence cursor is not on checkpoint)
    - CheckpointManager::getListOfCursorsToDrop()
      (estimates number of checkpoints to unreference
       and returns all cursors from those checkpoints)

ConnMap:
    - DcpConnMap::closeSpecificSlowStream()
      (Accepts vbucketId, stream name)

DcpProducer:
    - DcpProducer::closeSpecificSlowStream()
      (Accepts vbucketId, stream name)

Stream:
    - New END_STREAM reason: END_STREAM_SLOW

VbucketMap:
    - VBucketMap::getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem()
      (gets a vector of vbuckets sorted as per checkpoint
       manager's memory consumption)

(10 comments)

Line:120, src/dcp/stream.h -> const std::string &

Line:841, src/checkpoint.cc -> Please use 'size_t' instead of int.

Line:845, src/checkpoint.cc -> please avoid using type cast.

Line:856, src/checkpoint.cc -> Please use std::vector::insert function to copy all the cursors to the vector at once

Line:1028, src/connmap.cc -> I think we can use 'vbConns' list instead to get the list of streams for a given vbucket in a faster way.

Line:617, src/dcp/producer.cc -> please change the log level to NOTICE

Line:207, src/vbucket.h -> As checkpointManager is a public member variable of vbucket, I don't think we need to define the wrapper function here.

Line:101, src/dcp/producer.h -> Rename it to 'closeSlowStream'

Line:457, src/connmap.h -> Rename the function to 'closeSlowStream'

Line:135, src/vbucketmap.cc -> Can we use a vector and simply return the sorted vector to the caller?
