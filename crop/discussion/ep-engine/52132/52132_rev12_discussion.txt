DESCRIPTION

MB-9897: Providing APIs to stage cursor dropping (Producer)

Checkpointing:
- Checkpoint::isEligibileToBeUnreferenced()
    (if persistence cursor is not on checkpoint)
- CheckpointManager::getListOfCursorsToDrop()
    (estimates number of checkpoints to unreference
     and returns all cursors from those checkpoints)

ConnMap:
- DcpConnMap::closeSlowStream(vbid, name)
    (Accepts vbucketId, stream name)

DcpProducer:
- DcpProducer::closeSlowStream(vbid, name)
    (Accepts vbucketId, stream name)

Stream:
- New END_STREAM reason: END_STREAM_SLOW

VbucketMap:
- VBucketMap::getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem()
    (gets a vector of vbuckets sorted as per
     checkpoint manager's memory consumption)

I will upload the new patch set to address my comments

Line:1034, src/connmap.cc -> As 'vbConns' only manages the producer list, we can safely use static_cast instead, which is cheaper than dynamic_cast.

Line:619, src/dcp/producer.cc -> It would be useful to log the stream name as well. Please address it in a separate commit later.
