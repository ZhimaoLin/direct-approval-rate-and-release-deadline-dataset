      and returns all cursors from those
      checkpoints)

ConnMap:
    - DcpConnMap::closeSpecificSlowStream()
      (Accepts vbucketId, stream name)

DcpProducer:
    - DcpProducer::closeSpecificSlowStream()
      (Accepts vbucketId, stream name)

Stream:
    - New END_STREAM reason: (END_STREAM_SLOW)

      (gets a vector of vbuckets ordered as per
