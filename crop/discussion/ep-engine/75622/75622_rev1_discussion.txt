DESCRIPTION

MB-23435: Refactor vBucket aggregated stats

Move the code for outputting vBucket aggregated statistics from
EventuallyPersistentEngine to KVBucket. This is in preparation for
having the concrete subclasses of KVBucket - specificially
EphemeralBucket - add statistics specific to Ephemeral buckets.

This has no effect on the stats output, just a pure refactor.
