Mike,

I am not sure if this is good to gets performance.

Line:99, src/bgfetcher.cc -> You removed one fix that I put in here earlier - lh.unlock(). Again, it is to reduce mutex window to reduce concurrency limit in all frontend gets.

Line:1185, src/ep.cc -> All gets will be serialized here. I am not sure if this is good idea.

Line:57, src/bgfetcher.hh -> You removed one change that I put in here. It is used by logging only, so it is ok to do dirty read.

Line:85, src/bgfetcher.hh -> This change combines multiple per-vbucket queue into one big queue. This will serializes gets on different vbuckets into one single point of lock, and will hurt concurrency for sure.

Patch Set 1:

It looks like you removed those locks after I made this change in my branch. I will update my change.

Also, I tried to make as few changes as possible here. You mention that all gets are serialized by vbucket and this could create lock contention. I understand your concern however I don't see how what I am doing is different from what was done before. Let's discuss tomorrow so I can make sure that I understand what should be happening here.

Overall, I agreed to Roman Murillo's comments. This refactored code would increase lock contention as we have a single global lock for the global bg queue.

I suggest us to keep the current approach where each vbucket has its own queue and lock at this time.
