DESCRIPTION

MB-20751: Fix lock cycle (deadlock) during bucket delete & client disconnect

MB-20716 recently fixed an issue where idle DCP connections (in
EWOULDBLOCK state) would not be notified (woken up) in the frontend
when a bucket was deleted. The fix for this was to trigger a notify
(via producer->notifyPaused()) as part of ep-engine bucket delete.

Unfortunately this introduced a lock-order-inversion (deadlock)
between two mutxes, which caused memcached to hang during shutdown,
as one (or more) worker threads would never terminate.

The issue is between:

1. Frontend_worker thread mutex (threadLock)
2. ConnMap::connsLock

And at least two threads (although normally 3 in the wild):

T1: Frontend worker thread
T2: DestroyBucket thread
(optional T3: A NONIO thread running ConnManager)

During bucket delete, the follow sequence occurs which creates a cycle
between threadLock and connsLock:

T1<Worker>:
    event_handler() ... conn_pending_close()
      -> LOCK(threadLock)
    DcpConnMap::disconnect()
      -> ACQUIRE(connsLock)

T2<DeleteBucket>:
    EventuallyPersistentEngine::handleDeleteBucket() ...
    DcpConnMap::shutdownAllConnections()
      -> LOCK(connsLock)
    notifyIOComplete() ... DcpProducer::notifyPaused()
      -> ACQUIRE(threadLock)

Part of the issue here is that DcpProducer::notifyPaused() *must* be
called with schedule==false, as there is no longer a ConnNotifier task
running on another thread (which never acquires the connsLock and
hence avoids any deadlock), as the ConnNotifier has been shutdown in
DcpConnMap::shutdownAllConnections previously. Therefore we need to
use the variant of notifyPaused which calls notify_IO_complete in the
same thread.

The solution chosen is to essentially drop the connsLock in
shutdownAllConnections before calling notify. We achive this by taking
a _copy_ of the connections map (under connsLock), and then iterating
over this copy and calling notify etc. This is safe as the elements of
the map are all ref-counted pointers.

Patch Set 2:

I had to port this change to not run into the delete bucket problem in master for the forestdb integration effort. I pushed it into Jasmin Rangel given that I had ported it anyways. I shall abandon this, given that it is already taken care of.
