DESCRIPTION

Support the database schema upgrade for 1.7.z and 1.7

The new column checkpointId is added to "vbucket_stats" table
in Membase 1.7. As there are no schema changes in "kv" table
between 1.6.5 and 1.7, the DB upgrade tool simply copies the
1.6.5 source database files to the destination directory
for 1.7.
