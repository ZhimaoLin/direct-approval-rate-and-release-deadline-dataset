DESCRIPTION

MB-17289: Update existing temp item CAS to incoming CAS in deleteWithMeta

If the incoming CAS is non-zero, a comparison is made with an
existing item CAS to check if the delete can be done or not.
But in case a temp existing item has to be persisted, then
update the existing temp item CAS to the incoming CAS in order
to bypass the above-mentioned comparison
