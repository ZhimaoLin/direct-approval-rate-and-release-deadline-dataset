DESCRIPTION

MB-17301: Returning vb_uuid, last_seqno for setDriftCounterState

Return vb_uuid and last_seqno for a vbucket as part of response
of the setDriftCounterState API atomically. This can be done by
attempting to get the last high seqno of the vbucket after
acquring the lock for the failover table which would ensure
that no new uuid would be created during the time.
