Patch Set 4:

I think we need to decide exactly what this stat is supposed to mean. The docs say that it is the number of times an item was created/updated. If this is the case then if I stopped the flusher and inserted the same item 10 times and then restarted the flusher the stats would read 1 create and 1 update. From the description however it seems like the right answer should be 1 create and 9 updates. If the latter stats are correct then I think we should be able to make this change easily in the hashtable without adding another field to the StoredValue class. I'll defer the final decision here to Chiyoung.

Patch Set 4:

I think, this stat should be the number of times an item is set to Disk, the number of creations that go to disk, and the same story for updations.

Line:518, src/stored-value.h -> I would rather get this information from the underlying storage. Another problem is that adding this flag won't work with the full eviction that we're going to support in 3.0. However, Couchstore currently doesn't provide that information for us. I've already created a ticket for this. Once Couchstore supports it, let's address this issue in the ep-engine side.
