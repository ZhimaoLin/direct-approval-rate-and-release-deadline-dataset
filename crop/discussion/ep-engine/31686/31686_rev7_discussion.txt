Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:1571, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We shouldn't decrement "dels" counter here.

Line:1631, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We should pass the number of updates and creates to the vbucket instance that maintain those two stats, instead of updating the global stats.

Line:2589, src/ep.cc -> This is incorrect. We should not assign global stats to the vbucket stats. As I mentioned, we should update the vbucket stats based on the values from CouchKVStore.

Line:188, src/stats.h -> We don't need those global stats as we already maintain them per vbucket.
