DESCRIPTION

Schedule background fetch for non-existent items in getMetaData()

If the key being queried doesn't exist in memory, create a temporary
item and schedule a background fetch for its metadata from the
persistent store. Until the fetch completes, the temporary item will
be in meta_pending state during which further invocations of this
function will be blocked. After the fetch completes and the state has
transitioned to either meta_available or non_existent, the correct
state will be returned.

NOTE: We currently return ewouldblock in the meta_pending state This
isn't optimal from a performance point of view. This will change
shortly -- we will implement an asynchronous mechanism so that the
connection doesn't have to block until the fetch completes.
