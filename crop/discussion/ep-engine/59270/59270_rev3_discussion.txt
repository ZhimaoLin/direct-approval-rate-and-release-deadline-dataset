DESCRIPTION

MB-16262: Remove some DCP log messages which are of minimal value.

Remove two DCP log messages: the 'stream created!' message, and the
explicit 'Backfill task finsihed' message if the completion was normal
(clean).

Before:

  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Creating stream with start seqno 173 and end seqno 180
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) stream created!
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Sending disk snapshot with start seqno 173 and end seqno 181
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Backfill complete, 0 items read from disk, 4 from memory, last seqno read: 181
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Backfill task (174 to 180) finished
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Stream closing, 4 items sent from backfill phase, 0 items sent from memory phase, 181 was last seqno sent, reason: The stream ended due to all items being streamed

After:

  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Creating stream with start seqno 0 and end seqno 195
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Sending disk snapshot with start seqno 0 and end seqno 195
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Backfill complete, 0 items read from disk, 20 from memory, last seqno read: 195
  NOTICE (default) DCP (Producer) <stream name> - (vb 842) Stream closing, 20 items sent from backfill phase, 0 items sent from memory phase, 195 was last seqno sent, reason: The stream ended due to all items being streamed
