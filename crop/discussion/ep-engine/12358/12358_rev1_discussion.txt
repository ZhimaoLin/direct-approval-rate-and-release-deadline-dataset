DESCRIPTION

MB-4619 Set the empty open checkpoint id to the master's one.

If the slave has the empty open checkpoint and receives a new
open checkpoint id because of collapsing checkpoints in the
upstream master, the slave can simply set its open checkpoint
id to the new id from the master. This will prevent checkpoint
id missings in the incremental backup files.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Chiyoung, 

This code does what the commit message says, but I am still unsure exactly how it solves Zynga's incremental backup issue. Let's discuss tomorrow, but for now I think this is ok to push through.
