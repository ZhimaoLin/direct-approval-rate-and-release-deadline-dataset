DESCRIPTION

MB-19371: Exit warmup on OOM condition in valueOnly key loading phase

During the key loading phase of warmup for valueOnly eviction, there
is a possibility of hitting an out-of-memory condition. In that
case, we should not enable traffic and return ENOMEM.

Patch Set 1:

The current fix is not a complete one. This can be made a lot cleaner if there is a better way to propagate ENOMEM errors to ns_server from warmup. I have added this fix because it doesn't enable data traffic in the OOM case and the customer assumes that the data is lost.

Line:900, src/ep.h -> Please add a description to this function. Also - might be better to name it "is...." to convey to the reader it returns a bool.
