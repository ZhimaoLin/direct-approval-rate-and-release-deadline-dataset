DESCRIPTION

MB-19371: Exit warmup on OOM condition in valueOnly key loading phase

During the key loading phase of warmup for valueOnly eviction, there
is a possibility of hitting an out-of-memory condition. In that
case, we should not enable traffic and return ENOMEM.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Given we're getting close to Watson release, I think we should write the unit test for this to make sure that it works as expected.

For example, create a bucket with a full eviction mode and load items until keys and metadata overhead exceed the bucket memory quota and restart the bucket with a value-only eviction mode and check the error code from ENABLE_TRAFFIC_CMD
