DESCRIPTION

Fix to the memory over-accounting issue caused by shared pointers.

There was a memory over-accounting issue because we account the
memory usage of a value pointed by both hashtable and checkpoint
twice. This fixes the above issue by accounting the memory usage
of values in Blob constructor and deconstructor.
