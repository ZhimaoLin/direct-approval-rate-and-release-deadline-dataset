Line:317, configuration.json -> The parameter name sounds like generic one. We want to put the cap on the write queue size for tap-based replication. Please change the parameter name to something like "tap_throttle_write_queue_cap".

Line:323, ep_engine.cc -> You don't need to call the configuration's function here as the corresponding stat is updated right below.

Line:2393, ep_engine.cc -> The above "configuration.addStats(...)" actually exports this new stat. So, you don't need to add it here again.
