DESCRIPTION

MB-23263: Check refcount before reallocating

This patch adds the facility to check the refcount value of a
SingleThreadedRCPTR and uses this to ensure that the refcount of the
blob is less than 2 before the defragmenter reallocates it. This is to
ensure that we do not end up just creating a copy of the blob thus
increasing memory usage which would be the opposite of what you would
expect from the defragmenter.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:308, tests/module_tests/defragmenter_test.cc -> This (and others parts of the test) look c/p from existing tests. Please refactor into helper functions and call them from both.
