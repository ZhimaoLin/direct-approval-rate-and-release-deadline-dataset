DESCRIPTION

Remove default parameter from queueDirty

The EventuallyPersistentStore method queueDirty has a parameter called
notifyReplicator, which is defaulted to true.  The parameter is used
to specify whether or not to notify the replicator.

However the queueDirty method either uses the notifyReplicator default
of true, or is passed in true.

This patch removes the unrequired parameter from the queueDirty
definition and simpifies the body of the method.
