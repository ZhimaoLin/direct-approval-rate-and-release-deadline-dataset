DESCRIPTION

Remove default parameter from queueDirty

The EventuallyPersistentStore method queueDirty
has a parameter called notifyReplicator, which
is defaulted to true.  The parameter is used to
specify whether or not to notify the replicator.

However the queueDirty method either uses the
notifyReplicator default of true, or is passed
in true.

This patch removes the unrequired parameter from
the queueDirty definition and simpifies the body
of the method.
