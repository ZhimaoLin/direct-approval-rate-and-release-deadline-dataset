DESCRIPTION

Partial restore functionality in mbrestore.

Hey guys, I did some overhaul on our mbrestore script (find it attached).

I added options for:
  -k KEY, --key=KEY     Key name to restore
  -d DATA, --data=DATA  Server side value to match
  -i ID, --id=ID        vbucketID to restore
  -v VERBOSE, --verbose=VERBOSE
                        verbose logging

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Still has a bunch of commented out code, but most importantly has a strangely outdented chunk that will cause the program to behave as strange as it looks.  :)

Line:79, management/mbrestore -> This can't possibly be right.  It is way outdented.  Unclear what's meant here.

Line:97, management/mbrestore -> I'd go with just "if opts.verbose"
