DESCRIPTION

Partial restore functionality in mbrestore.

Hey guys, I did some overhaul on our mbrestore script (find it attached).

I added options for:
  -k KEY, --key=KEY     Key name to restore
  -d DATA, --data=DATA  Server side value to match
  -i ID, --id=ID        vbucketID to restore
  -v VERBOSE, --verbose=VERBOSE
                        verbose logging
