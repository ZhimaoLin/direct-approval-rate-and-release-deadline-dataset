DESCRIPTION

MB-24424: Pass correct parameters when making MutationResponse

The isKeyOnly parameter was missing when passed into make_unique. This
patch fixes this issue.  In addition it moves the creation of a
PassiveStream into a separate function.  This enables the function that
creates a PassiveStream to be overridden with one that creates a
MockPassiveStream, which is used in testing.
