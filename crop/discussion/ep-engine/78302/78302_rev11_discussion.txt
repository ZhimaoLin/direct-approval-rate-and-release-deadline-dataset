DESCRIPTION

MB-24424: Pass correct parameters when making MutationResponse

The isKeyOnly parameter was missing when passed into make_unique. This
patch fixes this issue.  In addition it moves the creation of a
PassiveStream into a separate function.  This enables the function that
creates a PassiveStream to be overridden with one that creates a
MockPassiveStream, which is used in testing.

Line:48, src/dcp/consumer.h -> many of our factory methods have used "make" as the prefix

Line:143, tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> I think this should be a reference to a unique_ptr as you're reseating the pointer (in this case dcpResponse is changed to nullptr) - https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-reseat

Line:48, src/dcp/consumer.h -> Done

Line:143, tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> I tried making it a reference, but also needed to change prototype in stream.h (as we want to overload the function and so need the same signature).  However on making the change it complains with the following "non-const lvalue reference to type 'unique_ptr<DcpResponse>' cannot bind to a temporary of type"

e.g.
/Users/danielowen/master/ep-engine/src/dcp/consumer.cc:290:43: error: non-const lvalue reference to type 'unique_ptr<DcpResponse>' cannot bind to a temporary of type 'unique_ptr<StreamEndResponse>'
            err = stream->messageReceived(std::make_unique<StreamEndResponse>(

Line:143, tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> That could be fixed by not creating a temporary, but given the actual reseat occurs in the mock, less of an issue
