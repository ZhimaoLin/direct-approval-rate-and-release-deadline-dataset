DESCRIPTION

MB-11948: Handle GetLastError() returning 0 condition

In windows, the GetLastError() call sometimes returns 0 instead of
the returning WSAEWOULDBLOCK. Either the error gets reset before
the invocation or it could be undefined behavior.

Patch Set 6:

I think the real issue might be that errmsg (which is what you do to diagnose problem) is initialized before your windows code that maps windows errors to errnos. If so then it's not fixed yet.
