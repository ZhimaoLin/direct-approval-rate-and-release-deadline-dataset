DESCRIPTION

MB-16178: Removing sanity check while adding TAP on DCP & vice versa

Removing the sanity check which would prevent:
- Adding a DCP passive stream for a vbucket when a TAP consumer is
  still connected.
- Adding a TAP consumer when a DCP passive stream is still connected
  for the vbucket.

Removing this sanity check as there is no real threat to the server
of it going into an inconsistent state during the upgrade.
