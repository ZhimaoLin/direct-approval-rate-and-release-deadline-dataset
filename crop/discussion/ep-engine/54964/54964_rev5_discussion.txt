DESCRIPTION

MB-16178: Removing sanity check while adding TAP on DCP & vice versa

Removing the sanity check which would prevent:
- Adding a DCP passive stream for a vbucket when a TAP consumer is
still connected.

Removing this sanity check as there is no real threat to the server
of it going into an inconsistent state during the upgrade.
