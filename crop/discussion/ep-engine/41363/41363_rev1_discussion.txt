DESCRIPTION

Fix deadlock in checkpoint persistence command

We need to release the hpChkMutex before notifying memcached in
order to prevent a deadlock. The deadlock occurs when the flusher
trys to notify memcached of checkpoint persistence at the same
time a memcached worker thread is trying to add a new checkpoint
persistence request.

Good catch and fix!

I think we will have the same issue in 3.0. We need to merge this fix into both 3.0.1 and master branch.
