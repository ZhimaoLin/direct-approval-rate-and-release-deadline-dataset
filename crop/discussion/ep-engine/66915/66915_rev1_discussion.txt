DESCRIPTION

MB-20598: AddressSanitizer problems

One leak and one stack overflow.

The forest-kvstore code should use dynamic_cast (like couch-kvstore)
else when the incoming callback is not a RememberingCallback, we will
access outside of the incoming object.

ep_testsuite has a leak in tap code where we must release items
during iteration.
