DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move setMaxCasAndTrackDrift() in a func that calls queueDirty()

setMaxCasAndTrackDrift() is called in setWithMeta and deleteWithMeta.
In the both the place it just precedes queueDirty(), and also has a
strict requirement that it must be just called before queueDirty().

Hence moving it to a separate function that calls queueDirty() immediately
after tracking cas drift is better for maintainance and also helps to keep
track of things if we want to move around queueDirty() calls.
