DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move setMaxCasAndTrackDrift() into VBucket::queueDirty()

setMaxCasAndTrackDrift() is called in setWithMeta and deleteWithMeta.
In the both the place it just precedes queueDirty(). Hence moving it
inside queueDirty() wherein other Cas related stuff is also handled
makes more sense.

It further helps to move around queueDirty() calls easily as this
setMaxCasAndTrackDrift() is related to other Cas related stuff done
inside queueDirty().

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This feel backwards to me - we are complicating an (already-complicated) function - queueDirty by adding more functionality to it.

Functions should do one thing well - we now have queueDirty up to 4 arguments. The previous code was much simpler - unless you cared about tracking CAS (only two out of N cases).

Moreover, you've increased the set of states of queueDirty by 2x - which again makes it harder to test. For example - does it make sense to set TrackDrift::Yes when GenerateCAS == No and Yes?

(Note it's not necessary to move /any/ common functionality down the call-stack - that way you end up with a small number or "god" functions which basically do too many things.

If you really want to make this common, I'd suggest you create a new function named queueDirtyAndTrackDrift which simply calls down to queueDirty and then calls setMaxDrift.

Patch Set 1:

Somehow Cas and seqno generation (hence queueDirty) are intertwined.
I intend to move around queueDirty in next 2 commits and there can be other cases where we want to do something cas, tracking draft. Hence thought will move it to the queueDirty() so that we do not miss things.

But as suggested, created a new function trackCasDriftAndQueueDirty() rather than passing a new argument
