DESCRIPTION

MB-9715: Add UPR Producer connection pausing

In the current code the upr thread continually calls the step
function for any producer connection. This change allows an UPR
Producer to notify the memcached layer when it does and does not
have data ready. It will fix the 100% cpu issue that occurs when
using an UPR Producer

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Line:216, src/upr-stream.cc -> Is this flag set to true for only backfill items?

Shouldn't we have like

itemsReady = response ? true : false;

Line:1019, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Using a single lock will cause high lock contention among memcached worker threads, which consequently causes higher latency and lower thoughput for SET operations. That's what I observed in my previous tests. Please refer to TapConnMap::notifyVBConnections. You may want to have something similar or better approach.

Line:355, src/upr-producer.cc -> This might cause too many notifications. Shouldn't we notify iff the producer is idle or "ready" list is empty?

Line:1019, src/tapconnmap.cc -> If you think it will require a fair amount of changes to address the above comment, let's address it in a separate commit and merge this change at this time. I will leave up to you.

Line:216, src/upr-stream.cc -> Yes, your correct here. This needs to be done for checkpoint items.

Line:1019, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I think it might and I was going to ask if I could do this in another change. When I went over this I even mentioned to Abhinav that I would likely need to use something similar to what you did for tap. I would prefer to merge this so QE can start testing and work on improving this in parallel.

Line:355, src/upr-producer.cc -> This was commented out by mistake. I'll fix this.
