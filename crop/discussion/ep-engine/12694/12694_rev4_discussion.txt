DESCRIPTION

Reorder items from checkpoints by their database shard id first.

The better write throughput can be achieved by reordering items
from checkpoints by their database shard ids first before sorting
them by their vbucket ids and (or) row ids.

From tests, we observed that this improved the write throughput
by 20-30%.
