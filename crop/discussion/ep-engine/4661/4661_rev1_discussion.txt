DESCRIPTION

Mb-3215 Add stats for read/write latency

In order to get read latency for hit, we need to add total elapse
time for get command.
In order to get general write latency, we need a total elapse time
for store command and arith command.

I don't quite understand what this does.  It seems to be averaging something, not adding.

I don't think it's going to measure the total time of the get, though, because we don't necessarily have when it started or when it ended.

Line:99, histo.hh -> This line is so long it even wraps within Jasmin Rangel. :/  Try to aim around 80.  No need for this method to be all on line line.

I think the following code measures the get operation though:

 ENGINE_ERROR_CODE get(const void* cookie,
                          item** item,
                          const void* key,
                          const int nkey,
                          uint16_t vbucket)
    {
        BlockTimer timer(&stats.getCmdHisto);
        ....

If we have a hit miss condition, then we cannot measure though

Patch Set 1:

That's really just the amount of time spent *in* the get call.  We really want end-to-end which can't really be done without something a lot more invasive.

We already have some stats from what we can see in here.  Discounting receiving a request, copying data in and out, and writing a response back over the network may be a bit too much to be useful, though.
