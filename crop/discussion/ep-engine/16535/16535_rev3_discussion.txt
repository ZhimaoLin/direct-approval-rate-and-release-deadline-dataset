DESCRIPTION

MB-5027 Avoid duplicated vbucket state settings

Vbuckets snapshots actually set vbuckets state even though state is
same as the new state. In ep-store, this redundant operations mean
extra wasted dispatcher works to kvstore; in couch-kvstore, this
would mean unnecessary couchstore new header position operations
and wasted notify_update to mccouch. All these performance waste
can be saved by a simple state check before setting new state.
