DESCRIPTION

MB-16337: Enable test_access_scanner unit test

This test was disabled few weeks ago as it failed on CV runs.
With latest builds the failure is not reproducable neither on
local AIX box, neither on Ubuntu container.
The failure is also not reproducable on jenkins runs.
Enabling this test on regular CV runs for now.
