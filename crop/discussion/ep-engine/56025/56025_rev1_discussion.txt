Line:131, src/kvstore.cc -> We can now remove these comments completely as the dependency between ep-engine KV store and the ns-server compaction manager was removed as of 3.x releases. However, we need to refactor this API as a separate commit later, so that we can persist the engine stats into ForestDB instead of writing them into a separate JSON file.
