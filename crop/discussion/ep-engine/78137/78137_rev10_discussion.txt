DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Add Collections Filter classes and test

Two classes exist for filtering.

Collections::Filter
Collections::VB::Filter

The idea is that a DCP producer will establish a Collections::Filter
that lives for the lifetime of the DCP producer.

As the DCP producer creates streams, a Collections::VB::Filter is
assigned to the stream which contains the real set of collections to
filter (and also the actual "filter" function).

Line:27, src/collections/filter.h -> Style: Should ideally have system includes after module includes (see https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-style).

I believe git clang-format should do it for you.

Line:108, src/collections/filter.h -> It looks like this doesn't change after object construction - can it be const?

Line:59, src/collections/filter.cc -> Is this not an input error (user specified no filter and there's no default collection?) - hence std::invalid_argument?

Line:75, src/collections/filter.cc -> Probably worth including the input data in the exception message - we don't expect it to be particulary large, and should help debugging.

Line:80, src/collections/filter.cc -> Same here.

Line:85, src/collections/filter.cc -> Also here.

Line:94, src/collections/filter.cc -> ditto

Line:108, src/collections/vbucket_filter.h -> Style: prefer Container for types (https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)

Line:82, src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> Where did 3 go? ;)
