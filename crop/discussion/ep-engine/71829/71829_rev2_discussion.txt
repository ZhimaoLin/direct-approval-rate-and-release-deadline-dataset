DESCRIPTION

Use uint64_t for the high seqno in test_del_with_item_eviction test

The vbucket high sequence number is a uint64_t and the test also
needs to use uint64_t to represent it.

Line:5227, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Style: This is actually a good example of why C++11 brace initialisation is useful (and also defining and declaring variables at the same time) - if the code was originally written:

 uint32_t high_seqno{get_ull_stat(h, h1, ...)};

then it would fail to compile as you can't perform narrowing conversions in brace initialisation:

 ep_testsuite.cc:5223:25: error: non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed
     from type 'uint64_t' (aka 'unsigned long long') to 'uint32_t' (aka
     'unsigned int') in initializer list [-Wc++11-narrowing]

Arguably even better, you can use `auto` and then you're guaranteed to always get the same type as what the function returns:

 auto high_seqno{get_ull_stat(h, h1, ...)};
