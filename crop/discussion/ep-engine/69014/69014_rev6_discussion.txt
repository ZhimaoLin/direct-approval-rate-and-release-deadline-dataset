DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [4/N]: Use named struct when moving cursors between checkpoints

Instead of an anonymous std::pair (which is hard to follow what the
two fields are), use a named struct `CursorPosition` and related
CursorIdToPositionMap map when recording cursor positions to move
between checkpoints.
