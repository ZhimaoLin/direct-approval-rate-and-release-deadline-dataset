DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite: Move remaining basic tests to ep_testsuite_basic

Following on from the previous patch, move the remaining 'basic' tests
from the generic ep_testsuite to the new ep_testsuite_basic.

There is now ~24s worth of tests originally from ep_testsuite moved
into ep_testsuite_basic (as measured on OS X locally); reducing the
wallclock test runtime by that same amount (as they can now be run
concurrently).
