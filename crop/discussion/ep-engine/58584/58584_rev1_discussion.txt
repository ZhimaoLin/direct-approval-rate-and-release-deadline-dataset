DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite: Move remaining basic tests to ep_testsuite_basic

Following on from the previous patch, move the remaining 'basic' tests
from the generic ep_testsuite to the new ep_testsuite_basic.

There is now ~24s worth of tests originally from ep_testsuite moved
into ep_testsuite_basic; reducing the wallclock test runtime by that
same amount (as they can now be run concurrently).
