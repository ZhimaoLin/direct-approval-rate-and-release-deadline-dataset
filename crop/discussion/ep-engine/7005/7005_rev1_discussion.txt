DESCRIPTION

Support for resetting the replication chain.

This change supports resetting the replication chain. For example,
for a given replication chain A->B->C, if A receives a
RESET_REPLICATION_CHAIN message from ns_server, A sends
INIT_VBUCKET_STREAM messages to B to reset its replica vbuckets, and
then backfills all items to B. Subsequently, B sends the same
sequence of messages to C.
