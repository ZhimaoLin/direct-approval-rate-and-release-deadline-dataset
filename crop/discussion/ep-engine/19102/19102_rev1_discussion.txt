Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Thanks for taking care of this. If find necessary, we may want to include a list of those tests being completely removed in the comment header?

Line:5128, ep_testsuite.cc -> Please do not remove this test case, but instead set skip to true at this time. We need to adapt this test case soon, so that it works with couchstore.

Line:5185, ep_testsuite.cc -> Same comments as above.

Patch Set 1:

Neither the bug report or the commit message tells me _why_ the tests should be removed. If we're going to drop the tests we should probably delete the _code_ as well? or do we want to keep code in there we're no longer testing?

Patch Set 1:

Based on the discussion with the mgmt team, we will deprecate and remove sqlite code in 2.0 soon.

Mike, as Trond suggested, please add a commit message.
