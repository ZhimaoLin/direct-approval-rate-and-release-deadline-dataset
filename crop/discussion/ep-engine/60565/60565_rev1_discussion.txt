DESCRIPTION

CMake: Reduce duplicate compilation

CMake will compile every source file once, *for each target it occurs
in*. This means that source files which occur in multiple targets will
be compiled multiple times. While this may be useful in cases where a
target defines different build flags, this isn't the case in
ep-engine.

Reduce this duplication by using object libraries, which allow a
logical grouping of source files which are built once and can then be
linked directly into multiple targets.

This reduces the build time of the ep-engine subdir from 399s to 322s
(user+sys), or ~20%.
