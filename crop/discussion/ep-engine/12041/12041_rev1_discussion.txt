DESCRIPTION

Added error message for membase connection failed in mbadm-tap-registration.

mbadm-tap-registration script was throwing socket connection pipe broken error
traceback when membase connection fails at the specified host:port. This
patch adds exception handling and prints proper error message and exits the tap
registration script.
