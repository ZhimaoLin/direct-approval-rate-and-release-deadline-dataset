DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Allow updates on sequential storage (linkedlist).

When an item in hashtable (in an Ephemeral vbucket) is updated, the
updated item must be placed in the right position (at the end) in the
sequential storage data structure, linkedlist.

If there are no range reads (backfills) during an update we just update
the hash table element and move the item to the end of the list. This is
somewhat similar (hashtable part) to what happens in current ep vbuckets.

However, in case of range reads (backfills), the behavior is different
w.r.t existing ep vbuckets. The range reads are basically point-in-time
snapshots and hence require the older (non updated) item to be there
in the range of the read. But the hashtable wants to store only the most
recent (updated) item. Hence, we mark the item as stale and transfer the
ownership of the item to the linkedlist from hashtable and add a new
item with the value of update in the hashtable and at the end of the list.

We have the module tests at the linkedlist level. Module tests at the
ephemeral vbucket level will follow soon in a future commit.
