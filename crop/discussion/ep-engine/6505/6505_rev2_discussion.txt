DESCRIPTION

Fix to the unit test failure in explicit TAP ack test.

Due to the fix (http://review.membase.org/#change,6404) to cleanning
up of 'dump' tap connections, the explicit TAP ack unit test failed.

The reason was that all the tap stats for a given named TAP
connection are reset after completing the dump operation.
