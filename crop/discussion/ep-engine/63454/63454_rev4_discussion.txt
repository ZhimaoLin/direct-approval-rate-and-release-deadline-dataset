DESCRIPTION

BGfetcher: Port to C++11 / simplify code

Update the BGFetcher code to C++11 style, and simplify code where
possible:

* Use more concise range-based for loops.
* Use auto where suitable.
* Remove totalfetches - can just use the size of the vector instead.
* Remove item2Fetch as a member variable - it can be a variable local
  to the run() method.
