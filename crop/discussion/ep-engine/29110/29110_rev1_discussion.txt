Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This change is more than adding checkpoint back to the testsuite. Can you split this commit into the two changes and explain why the bgfetcher change is required?

Patch Set 1:

The bgfetcher change is required because of dependencies. If I bring in the bgfetcher then I need to bring in the IOManger and then I end up having to include the rest of the ep-engine code base.

I can still split the change if you like, but the commit line would just be something like "Move bgfetcher dependency out of the VBucket class so I can re-include the checkpoint tests".

Let me know if you would still like me to do this.
