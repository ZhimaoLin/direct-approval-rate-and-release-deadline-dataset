Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

A few minor comments and then we can merge this.

Line:2542, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can you remove the check for ep_total_enqueued? It will only be 1 while the item is awaiting persistence and may cause this test to fail if the persistence happens before this line is executed. The verify_curr_items check above is sufficient to make sure things went ok.

Line:2564, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> created is unused and I don't think we need it in this test case. Please remove it.
