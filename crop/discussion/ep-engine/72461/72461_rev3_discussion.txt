DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Add queue_op::system_event

Add enum cases so the code compiles - with this commit
no one is creating Item's with this type so there are no more
functional changes added.

A set_system_event at this patch level is "inert"

- it is not marked as persisted
- it is not marked as replicated
- it is marked as a checkpoint meta item
- it is included in the same switch statement scope as
  set_vbucket_state which is correct (certainly for TAP).
