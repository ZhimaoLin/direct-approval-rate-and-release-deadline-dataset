Patch Set 2:

I still think this only tests a small subset of the notification code.  There are many things that can go wrong that aren't modeled here.  Removing the notification code is the only path I can see that will lead to any tolerable degree of safety.

Patch Set 2:

That is another question. This patch just adds the mock to the infrastructure. It doesn't implement the new commands used, nor any interface to trigger any of the problems we've been discussing.. My main concern is that we don't test _AT ALL_ any of the code writing stuff to disk, and that's troublesome for someone creating a database system...

This patch will move us in the direction where we at least can _start_ adding tests...

Patch Set 2:

I saw Trond referred this patch in Junyi's new test engine patch. At least have him included in the code reviewer so as to he remain relevant to this subject.

His new test suites are exercising many of CouchKVStore-Couchstore code paths (item read & write to underlying database files) but without emulating a stand alone mccouch (mock or real). For instance, get() does not require any presence of mccouch and his test code completely excise the entire code path from top to bottom.

Patch Set 2:

I think this is a good base allowing us to test the couchstore integration and add further tests for notifications and commands going over the tcp connection. Nice work Trond. I think we should integrate Junyi's tests with mock objects, then quickly add this work on top of it. Then begin adding tests for network failure scenarios using the mock server.

Patch Set 2:

If you flip it around you can drop a fair amount of the code from the other changeset (like the abstract engine stuff, have a dedicated named backend etc etc).
