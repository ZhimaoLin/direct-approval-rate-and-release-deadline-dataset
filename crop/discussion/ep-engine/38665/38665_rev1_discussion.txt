Patch Set 1:

This didn't come up in a dump from libumem, but from looking at the code it seems to be leaking here as well.. I do think the design would have been easier if we did the delete of the message in the function calling all of these processmessage functions (and ensure that we didn't introduce more memory leaks when adding new functions etc)
