DESCRIPTION

MB-8453 Maintain the TAP connection list for each vbucket

When we receive a mutation event for a given vbucket, we
should check if any of its replicator TAP connections is
in a paused state, and notify that event to the paused
TAP connections, so that they can immediately send it
to their replicas.

To address the above issue, this change maintains a
separate list of TAP connections for each vbucket.
The list gets updated when an TAP connection is closed or
an TAP connection's vbucket list is changed.

Abhinav,

I made some changes to avoid having tap connection list inside a vbucket. Please take a look at it and review together tomorrow. We need to verify it with your test script.

Patch Set 6:

I just want to note that we might need more than 8 vbucket queue locks, but we will find out if they are needed once some performance tests are run.

Abhinav,

Did you see any regression in ops/sec in the heavy write-only test case with this change?
