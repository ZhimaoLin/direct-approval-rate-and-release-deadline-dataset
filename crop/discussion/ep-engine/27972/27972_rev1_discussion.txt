Patch Set 1:

I ran a basic test here and saw a 1-5ms for replication so it looks like this change is making a difference in the replication times. One thing that you still need to do though is remove the cookie object from the vbucket list when a tap connection is close. You should also take a look at the change vbucket command since you will need to update the lists when this command is run. Good work so far.

Abhinav,

I think this change is different from what we discussed today. I saw some potential high lock contention, and unsynchronized accesses to the connection list. Let's discuss it more tomorrow.
