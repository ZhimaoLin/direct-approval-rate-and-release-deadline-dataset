Line:171, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Let's check for no backfills here so that if memory usage is too high we won't sleep.

if (activeBackfill.empty() && snoozingBackfills.empty()) {
    return backfill_finished;
}

Line:194, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> If activeBackfills is empty here then just return backfill_snooze. The check above will catch the finished case.

Line:221, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> No need to lock here since we don't need the code below.

Line:228, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Please remove this code. We will check to see if the task should be deleted when the task runs again.
