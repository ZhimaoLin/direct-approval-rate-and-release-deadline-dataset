Line:24, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Chiyoung doesn't want use to use defines like this anymore. Instead we should use static const variables.

Line:40, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> This variable is not used.

Line:185, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Use the static const sleepTime variable instead of a define.

Line:198, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I don't understand why we should move all of the snoozing backfills to the active list if the active list is empty.
