DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Simplify inflate logic in couch-kvstore

Replace the explicit use of cb_malloc+cb_free with a
unique_ptr and use our cb::compression version over
the C api to snappy.

The old version of the code did not handle allocation
failures nor any problems with inflation. This
patch results in bad_alloc or runtime_error being
thrown. (which is probably better than using a
nullpointer or operating on uninitialized data)
