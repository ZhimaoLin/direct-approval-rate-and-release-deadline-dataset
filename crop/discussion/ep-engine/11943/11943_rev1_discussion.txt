DESCRIPTION

MB-4551 Record the last closed checkpoint upon cursor registration.

When the cursor for the registered TAP client is activated in the
checkpoint datastructure, the last closed checkpoint id is recorded
in the cursor. If the client is only interested in receiving items
from closed checkpoints only, its cursor keeps wNathalie Landrying until
reaching to the end of that closed checkpoint, and then its TAP
connection will be closed.
