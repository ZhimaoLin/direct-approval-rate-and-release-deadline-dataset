Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There are still tight couplings between couchkvstore and erlang side. We will remove them over the time.

However, running memcached with ep-engine and couchstore only would cause lots of problems (e.g., no compaction) and can't be an option for 2.0.
