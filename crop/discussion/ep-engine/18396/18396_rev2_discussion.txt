DESCRIPTION

MB-5893 Wake up the idle bg fetcher upon getting bg fetch event

The bg fetcher is in idle state if there are no pending bg fetch
jobs. If we receive a new bg fetch event, we should wake up the
idle bg fetcher. To support this, the bg fetcher states (i.e.,
initializing, running, idle, stopped) are newly introduced.
