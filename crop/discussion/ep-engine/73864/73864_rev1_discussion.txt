DESCRIPTION

Always enforce 'VALUE_ONLY' eviction policy in EphemeralBuckets

In EphemeralBuckets we want only logic related to VALUE_ONLY eviction
policy. That is because a key not present in HashTable implies key not
present at all.

Note: This should not be confused with the eviction algorithm
      that we are going to use like NRU, FIFO etc.
