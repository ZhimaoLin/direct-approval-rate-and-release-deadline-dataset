DESCRIPTION

MB-16337: Fix for intermittent test_access_scanner failure

In the test_access_scanner test we explicitly invoke the access scanner
task from the test code. However, while the task is being invoked, if
the task was already running at its default expected run time, the
explicit request to run the task may get ignored due to race in
updating the snooze time for the access scanner task.

The fix makes sure that the default run time of the access scanner is
not near the current run time.

Note: Access scanner task is first initiated at 'alog_task_time' and
then at intervals of 'alog_sleep_time'.

Line:538, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_ETMPFAIL would be a more accurate description (assuming this means the scanner is already running).
