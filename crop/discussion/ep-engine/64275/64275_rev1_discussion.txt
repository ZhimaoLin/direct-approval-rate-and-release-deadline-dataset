Line:1030, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> There is already a vBucket ID in the header which identifies what needs compacting. If we introduce an additional argument then we have a pretty unclean API:

- If couchstore is the chosen backend then there's an unused field in the request (db_file_id)
- If forestdb is the chosen backend then I assume that `vbucket` in the header becomes meaningless.

I think it would be better if we either:

a) Renamed 'vbucket' in the header to 'file_id', then we don't need to add an additional field in the body (and have the ambiguity above)
b) Specify that if db_file_id is used (i.e. foresdb), then `vbucket` should be a known, specific value which is considered to be invalid (e.g. 0xffff)

Line:1030, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Thanks. We should also document the protocol here - please raise a patch to memcached to document that if vbucket in the header is 0xffff, then the database ID is contained in the db_file_id field.
