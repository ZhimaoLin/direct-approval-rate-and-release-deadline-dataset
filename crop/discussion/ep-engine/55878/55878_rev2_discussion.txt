Line:493, src/vbucket.h -> Showing the average queue wait time won't be useful that much. I think we should deprecate this stat soon, and provide the timing histogram for the dirty queue wait time.

Line:493, src/vbucket.h -> This makes sense, I'll merge this change in for now. I shall deprecate this stat and add a historgram after checking with ns_server to ensure that this stat is not being used for UI.
