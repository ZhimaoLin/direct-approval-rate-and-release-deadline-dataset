Just one thing to fix and then I will pull it out and write a pyupr test for it.

Line:255, src/upr-consumer.cc -> This looks like it needs to be fixed. Also what is the testsuite issue?

Line:255, src/upr-consumer.cc -> The test suite assumes that any opaque is "valid" (the upr consumer tests does not define the UPR channel before starting to consume the items)..

From our earlier discussions the UPR consumer should return errors on all messages arriving with an unknown opaque value.
