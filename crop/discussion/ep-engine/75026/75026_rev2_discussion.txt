Line:392, src/vbucket.h -> This is kinda pointless - without returning the result of CMPXCHG it will behave the same as a simple unconditional store(), in that ::backfill will have the value of backfillPhase.

If you're using CMGXCHG that implies you need to know if ::backfill was already the given state, and as such would need to return the result of compare_exchange_strong().
