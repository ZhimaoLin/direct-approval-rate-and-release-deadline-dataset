DESCRIPTION

OrderedStoredValue [1/4]: Remove 'key' from StoredValues members

To allow us to add next/prev pointers to StoredValues for Ephemeral
buckets, we want to be able to "subclass" the StoredValue class to
create a OrderedStoredValue class. This subclass would have the two
extra fields at the end of the object (compared to StoredValue).

However, to permit this we need to make the layout of
OrderedStoredValue be a superset of StoredValue - i.e.

    class StoredValue {
        // Fixed fields - value_t, next, cas, revSeqno, ...
        SerializedDocKey key; // - variable
    }

    class OrderedStoredValue : public StoredValue {
        StoredValue* next;
        StoredValue* prev;
    }

The issue with the code as it stands is that SerializedDocKey is a
variable-length member - we allocate extra memory "off the end" of the
StoredValue object which is used for SerializedDocKey. This means that
OrderedStoredValue can't directly inherit from StoredValue and have
next/prev in the place we think they are - the compiler doesn't know
about the variable-length and hence they would collide with the key.

We also want to try to keep the next/prev pointers towards the front
of the object - so they are ideally in the same cache-line, and at a
constant offset.

Therefore to permit this subclassing, we modify StoredValue to *not*
explicitly include SerialisedDocKey in the end of StoredValue.  It
would still physically lie at the end of that object (i.e. layout in
memory is the same), but it wouldn't be a member variable of
StoredValue - instead we would add a method which "Adrianna Holmesally" does the
appropriate pointer calculation to get the address of it.

The net result of this is that the two different classes should end up
laid out in memory as:

     StoredValue:

     0                    53          53 + KeyLen
     +--------------------+-----------+
     | StoredValue[fixed] | key bytes |
     +--------------------+-----------+

    OrderedStoredValue:

     0                    53     61     69          69 + KeyLen
     +--------------------+------+------+-----------+
     | StoredValue[fixed] | next | prev | key bytes |
     +--------------------+------+------+-----------+

The first step of this is to remove `key` from the member variables of
StoredValue, and Adrianna Holmesally allocate it at the end of StoredValue (and
in future) OrderedStoredValue.
