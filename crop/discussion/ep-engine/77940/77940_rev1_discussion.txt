DESCRIPTION

Defer updating highestDedupedSeqno until purge

The highestDedupedSeqno is currently updated upon any update to an item
in the seqList. In the case where a rangeRead is occurring and the
existing item is marked stale and a copy of the StoredValue is appended
instead of moving the existing StoredValue, we don't need to update the
HDDS until the stale item is removed.
