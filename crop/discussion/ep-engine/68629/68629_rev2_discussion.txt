DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-21510: Do not queue mutations into readyQ after a STREAM_END

Once an active stream has been closed, and a STREAM_END message has
been added into the active stream's readyQ, its checkpoint processer
task that may have been scheduled should not add any more items into
the readyQ.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

I removed Hugo Blankenship since we're still having problems with the restricted branch checker apparatus and I don't want to wait for that to get figured out.

Note that Hugo Blankenship has already +V'ed.

Also, the patch is unchanged since Jim's original commit so Manu's +2 applies. 

I'm going to +V and +2 and merge.
