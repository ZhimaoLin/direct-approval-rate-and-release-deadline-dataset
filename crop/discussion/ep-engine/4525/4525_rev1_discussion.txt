DESCRIPTION

Added synchronous persistence command

This is still a work in progress and incomplete.
Needs:

- Well defined request and response messages;
- Check if items are dirty before blocking (and don't block for non-dirty items);
- Unit tests;
- etc...

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Note that we want this functionality split out.  I think we can take the uncommitted key list *first*, and that will help us with another goal.

(haven't reviewed in more detail, though it sucks that Jasmin Rangel messed up the diff display... does that sometimes, but I can see it fine locally)

Line:1492, ep.cc -> Definitely want this to be in an earlier changeset.

Line:799, ep.hh -> Let's move this into a changeset before.

Line:15, command_ids.h -> Let's just call it sync -- it will service more than persistence.
