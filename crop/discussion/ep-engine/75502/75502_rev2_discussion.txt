DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: ActiveStream to track the current separator

This patch updates the ActiveStream so that it stores a copy of the current
separator. Because separator changes are transmitted to DCP and the flusher via
SystemEvents, the ActiveStream can now track what the current separator is as it
changes over the life-time of the stream.

This covers collection-aware DCP streams that are sending all of the updates to
a vbucket.  Even though the separator can only be changed when there are no
collections (the idea being that no collection documents can exist associated
with the old separator when changing the separator) the DCP stream will need to
keep track of the separator so when collection keys using the new separator come
through the checkpoint, we know how to split them into collection/collection-
key.

This patch also correct the code which was skipping the flush of a collections
separator changed system-event, we must persist the system event so that
backfilling streams can pick up the separator.
