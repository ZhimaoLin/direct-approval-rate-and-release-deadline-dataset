Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I'm really a -2 on this, but marking it as -1 since I don't know if this was the discussed "fix" for this issue.

In my opinion, this does not, unfortunately, fix the issue.  It mostly assumes that ep-engine is in complete control (or within 10%) over what is happening with that disk.  This definitely isn't true for within Couchbase, where indexes are in our system, and it's also definitely not true for everything running on the OS in general.

It might be useful to think about how you might test this to get the spirit of where I filed the issue.  Imagine setting up a moderate workload, then starting some other process filling the disk with garbage.  What happens when the disk is full?  The expected behavior would be TMPFAIL responses to clients, indexing processes that backoff and retry, logging that backs off and retries.  Once the garbage on that filesystem is removed, all should go back to normal.

I don't think this patchset moves us in that direction.

Patch Set 2:

Thanks Matt for the good comment.

If we want to have the consistent control for monitoring disk usage across all the components in Couchbase, I think that the right place will be a ns-server side. We support a separate disk volume for indexes, and the ep-engine doesn't have any idea about whether the index directory is also running out of disk.

The cluster manager should monitor both data and index disk volume usage (I think it already does), and then issue a separate commend to each of them if they're running out of space, so that they can block incoming mutation requests and log those errors although logging itself can fail due to disk full.

MB-8067 should clearly indicate what we should try to solve, and should be the cross-team effort.

Abandoned

We have the bug (MB-8067) opened for this and need to discuss how we can handle it in a cross-component way.
