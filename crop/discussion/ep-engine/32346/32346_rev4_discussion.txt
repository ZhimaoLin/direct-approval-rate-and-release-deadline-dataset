Patch Set 4:

I did a refactor of moving the code out of the header file and merged your content back in based upon the platform/random.h functionality.

THe only thing I'm curious about is if we should do more retries where we're trying to get the next random number... This may happen if we're requesting data too fast from the random generator and it is running out of data... I don't think it'll ever happen however ;-)

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

As getting the UUID is not a frequent operation, I think it should be okay.
