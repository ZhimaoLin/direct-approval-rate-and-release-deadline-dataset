Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Can you add the unit test for this?

Patch Set 1:

I tried adding unit test when I added the first alog_sleep_time parameter and it would timeout always. It is impossible to test alog_task_time because it requires alog_sleep_time be at least 1 hour and it is not feasible for unit test. I've tested alog_task_time Adrianna Holmesally and it works.

Patch Set 1:

You can use time_travel() to advance the time. Please look at some testsuite unit tests that use this function.
