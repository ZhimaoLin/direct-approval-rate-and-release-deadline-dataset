DESCRIPTION

MB-19843: Modify the end_seqno in DCP stream request after checking for rollback

During a DCP stream request, we will update the end seqno when flags
DCP_ADD_STREAM_FLAG_LATEST/DCP_ADD_STREAM_FLAG_DISKONLY are used.
Currently in some cases when a rollback is required, the end_seqno could become
less than start_seqno before we check if a rollback is needed, resulting in
rejection of stream request.

Hence we should modify the end_seqno (if required as per the flags) only after
checking if a rollback is needed.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Mostly looks good, just some minor comments.

Line:3635, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please don't use defaulted arguments when we already have such a long list of arguments! One isn't necessary so bad, but as soon as we get two it's a pita to tell which flag is which.

I'd also say it makes reading the code easier if you keep the argument order the same as stream_req - i.e. insert stream_flag before the vbucket argument.

Line:256, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Maybe expand the message to include the fact this is after applying flags, and what flags were requested - easier to understand issues without having to check the source code.

Line:263, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Nit: extra space.
