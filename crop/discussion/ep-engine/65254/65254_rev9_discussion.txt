DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Make task scheduling fairer

Create a wrapper around std::priority_queue
that enables the queue to be sorted by priority + 'time'

The code however does not rely on a real-time API
(e.g. gethrtime) because the brings problems e.g. clock
changes. So ReadyQueue has a monotonic atomic u64 integer
that acts as an 'age' value.

When tasks are pushed into the queue they are given
the current time value and then the compare function
uses the priority value + 'time' when comparing against
tasks in the queue.

This has the outcome that old tasks with low priority
will eventually move forward and 'beat' new tasks
with high priority, making it impossible for a task
to be overlooked indefinitley.

Remember that in terms of priority value, less is best.
