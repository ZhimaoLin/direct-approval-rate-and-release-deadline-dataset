DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Make task scheduling fairer

Give each task a priority that is a
time + it's priority. This ensures a task
can never be overlooked by higher priority
tasks as it will trickle forward with time.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

(4 comments)

Line:121, src/taskqueue.h -> This probably warrants a comment explaining its purpose.

Line:122, src/taskqueue.h -> Update this comment?

Line:620, src/executorpool.cc -> What do we actually need to bind from this? Can we drop it, or at least explicitly bind the members we need? (Makes it hard to see exactly what fields are used when we bind `this`)?

Line:569, src/tasks.h -> Comment needs updating
