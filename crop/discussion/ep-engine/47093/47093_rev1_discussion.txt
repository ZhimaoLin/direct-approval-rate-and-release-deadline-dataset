DESCRIPTION

MB-13479: Indicate rollback to DCP clients if purge_seqno > snap_start_seqno

The replica may not get all the items if there are purged items in the active
node. Hence this solution proposes to indicate a rollback to seqno 0 in case
the purge_seqno > snap_start_seqno.
Note: This may not be the best solution because it is likely that there maybe
      a rollback indication to 0 after every compaction
