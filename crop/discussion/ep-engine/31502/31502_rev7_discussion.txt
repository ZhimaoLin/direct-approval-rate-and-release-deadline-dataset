DESCRIPTION

Don't assign checkpoint start/end/dummy items a by sequence number

Assigning checkpoint meta items sequence numbers can make consumers
think that more items have been added to a vbucket when no new items
have actually been added. This change also makes it easier to predict
the high sequence number when inserting a given amount of items into
a vbucket.
