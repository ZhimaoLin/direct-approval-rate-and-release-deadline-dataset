DESCRIPTION

Don't assign checkpoint start/end/dummy items a by sequence number

Assigning checkpoint meta items sequence numbers can make consumers
think that more items have been added to a vbucket when no new items
have actually been added. This change also makes it easier to predict
the high sequence number when inserting a given amount of items into
a vbucket.

Line:253, src/checkpoint.h -> I'm not sure what you mean by this. At this point we have not made changes that require cursors to only be in the closed checkpoint so I think this is okay.

Line:253, src/checkpoint.h -> rbegin() will point to the last item in the checkpoint, which can be a regular SET or DEL item. As you increment the iterator, it won't return the highest seq number within that checkpoint.
