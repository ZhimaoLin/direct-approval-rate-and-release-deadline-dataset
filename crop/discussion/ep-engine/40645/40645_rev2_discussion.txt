DESCRIPTION

Fix the regression from the change for MB-11943

The change for MB-11943 caused the sporadic failure
in "vbucket deletion doesn't affect new data" unit test case.

This change makes sure that we have the same logic in maintaining
cachedVBState instance for a deleted vbucket.

Line:565, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Would it make more sense to add a vbucket_state here that was initialized to dead with a high seqno of 0 and so on?
