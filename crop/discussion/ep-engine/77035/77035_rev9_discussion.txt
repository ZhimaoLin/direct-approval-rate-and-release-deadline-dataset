DESCRIPTION

MB-23987: Ignore repeatedly scheduled tasks

A timeout was observed in a test when running against an ephemeral
bucket.

This arose during tear down from a deadlock between
ExecutorPool::_unregisterTaskable and ExecutorPool::_cancel.

Normally, this should not be possible, as _unregisterTaskable waits for
the task locator to be empty after cancelling each of the tasks,
indicating that all tasks have been taken up by a thead and cleaned up.

The problem developed from the ItemPager as used in ephemeral buckets.
KVBucket::enableItemPager cancels and schedules the same task object.
Cancelling a task simply marks it as dead; it must later be cleaned up
by a ExecutorThread.

ExecutorPool::_schedule was altered to reset dead tasks to running to
facilitate enableItemPager. Therefore, if a thread did not clean up the
task between the cancel and schedule, enableItemPager reduced down to
just a schedule. If the task was already scheduled, this would be a
duplicate schedule.

Duplicate scheduling does not adversely affect the taskLocator as it is
a map. However, the taskQueues /will/ have a second copy of the task
added.

Now, when unregisterTaskable finds the taskLocator to be empty, it is
still possible for a thread to take up the duplicate copy of the task.
The task is already marked dead, and so the thread immediately calls
_cancel to clean it up.

if _unregisterTaskable already holds the mutex, _cancel will block.
_unregisterTaskable will then join all the ExecutorThreads, deadlocking
when it reaches the thread blocked on _cancel.
