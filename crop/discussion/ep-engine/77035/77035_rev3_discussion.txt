DESCRIPTION

MB-23987: Ignore repeatedly scheduled tasks

A deadlock was being caused in some test cases in while unregistering a
taskable and joining the ExecutorThreads. The code assumed that no tasks
should be running - correctly, as it endeavours to ensure this
immediately prior. The issue arose when repeatedly scheduling the same
task; taskLocator is a map, and so repeated inserts won't duplicate the
entry here, but the taskQueues /will/ end up with multiple copies of the
task. _unregisterTaskable will wait until the taskLocator has been
emptied after cancelling all tasks, but the multiple copies of a task in
the taskQueue mean that a thread can still take up the task, and try to
clean it up, as all tasks have been cancelled. However, cancelling a
task needs the same lock as _unregisterTaskable... which is holding the
lock and trying to join the thread.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> "in while"? Maybe "in" or "while", both seems excessive...

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe re-read / re-phrase this - the information is in there, but it's somewhat dense and hard to follow.

Maybe set out the observed problem (deadlock), then describe the details of what causes it. Finally describe /how/ this patch addresses the problem.
