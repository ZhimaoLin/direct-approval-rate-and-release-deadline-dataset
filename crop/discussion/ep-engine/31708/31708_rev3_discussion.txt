Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:30, src/upr-stream.cc -> RCPtr<ActiveStream> &s

Line:57, src/upr-stream.cc -> Same as above

Line:64, src/upr-stream.cc -> ENOMEM doesn't make sense to me. Do we have a better return code?

Line:74, src/upr-stream.cc -> Same as the first comment.

Line:118, src/upr-producer.h -> We don't need RCPtr which causes more overhead, but can use SingleThreadedRCPtr instead. This should be totally safe. You may want to do "typedef  SingleThreadedRCPtr<ActiveStream> active_stream_t" to shorten the type name.
