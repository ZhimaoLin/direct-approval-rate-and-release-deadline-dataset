DESCRIPTION

MB-24470: Handle short lived 'temp' item correctly in sequence list

In certain cases of delete_with_meta() we add a short lived temp item
in the hashtable and then immediately generate a valid seqno to it,
hence making it a non-temp item. In Ephemeral buckets, this item
while temp is put onto the sequence list with a negative seqno (temp
items have negative seqno in ep-engine).

So,
1. While putting this temp item onto the sequence list, we must NOT
   change the highSeqno of the list to a negative value.
2. Range iterator, tombstone purger must handle the 'range of read'
   and ignore temp items.

This commit implements the above and also adds test cases for the
same. Further it also enables certain xdcr tests that we disabled
in ephemeral due to temp item handling.
