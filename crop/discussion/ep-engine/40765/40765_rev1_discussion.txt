DESCRIPTION

MB-11973: Only grab items from the chk manager one chk at a time

We should only grab a single checkpoint at a time from the checkpoint
manager in order to make sure that the replica vbuckets cannot move
into the open checkpoint. This will also help make sure we don't
copy too make items into an upr stream.

Line:923, src/checkpoint.cc -> hmm, this can cause the cursor to sit at the end of the closed checkpoint for some time, which might cause the unnecessary memory overhead. If we want to grab a single checkpoint at a time, then we can change the logic as follows:

if (qi->getOperation() == queue_op_checkpoint_end) {
    moveCursorToNextCheckpoint(it->second);
    break;
}

This should be okay because moveCursorToNextCheckpoint() moves the cursor to the next checkpoint iff the next checkpoint exists.

In addition, if we only need to grab items whose seq num values <= endSeqno, it can be checked right after pushing an item into the list above.
