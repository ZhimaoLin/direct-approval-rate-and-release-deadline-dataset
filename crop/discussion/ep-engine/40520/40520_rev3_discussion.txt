DESCRIPTION

MB-11912 Monitor workload pattern for dynamic compaction scheduling.

This change allows us to monitor workload pattern (i.e.,
read_heavy, write_heavy, mixed) at runtime and use the monitored
workload pattern to adjust the number of concurrent compaction
tasks dynamically at runtime. If the workload pattern is read-heavy,
then only one compaction task is executed at a time.

Note that we plan to keep improving this area for better I/O
scheduling.

Line:2721, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> time travel does not work with ep-engine's executor pool since it directly does gettimeofday, it only works where ep_real_time() is called. Might need to use real sleeps to avoid false negatives. thanks

Line:2734, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> time travel use here as above. thanks

Line:2747, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> minor comment - might be good to have check() function here as it will tell us the reason for the failure
