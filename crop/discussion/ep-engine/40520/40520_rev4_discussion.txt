DESCRIPTION

MB-11912 Monitor workload pattern for dynamic compaction scheduling.

This change allows us to monitor workload pattern (i.e.,
read_heavy, write_heavy, mixed) at runtime and use the monitored
workload pattern to adjust the number of concurrent compaction
tasks dynamically at runtime. If the workload pattern is read-heavy,
then only one compaction task is executed at a time.

Note that we plan to keep improving this area for better I/O
scheduling.
