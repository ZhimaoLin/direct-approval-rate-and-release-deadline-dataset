Patch Set 10:

Trond, just one more thought that could be a separate commit. Even after we enable the traffic from the client, the flusher is still doing the batch disk fetches for the remaining items from the access log. If the number of items from the access log is large (or bulk disk fetches are slow because of the high fragmentation) and most of incoming traffics are mutations, the checkpoint queue size (ep_queue_size) would be quite large.

One thing we can consider is to stop doing further batch disk fetches by the flusher and let the flusher start writing items into disk if the checkpoint queue size (ep_queue_size) is larger than the threshold.
