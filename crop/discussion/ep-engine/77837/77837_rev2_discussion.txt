DESCRIPTION

MB-24066/MB-22178: Set opencheckpointid to 1 after rollback

An opencheckpoint of 0 has the special meaning of being in a backfill
phase.

Therefore after performing a rollback we must ensure the
opencheckpointid is reset to 1.  This is the value used when the
vbucket is originally intialised.
