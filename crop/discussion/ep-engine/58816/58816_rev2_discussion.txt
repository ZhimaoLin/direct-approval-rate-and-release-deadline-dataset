DESCRIPTION

Update total items using item count from the underlying KVStore

In different eviction scenarios, it gets tricky to update the
exact number of items in the database. The KV store maintains
the item count for each vbucket file on disk. Update the total
vbucket item count with that value.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:3119, src/ep.cc -> This will change a way of maintaining item counter per vbucket for the value eviction mode. Value-eviction mode is a cache-oriented approach that maintains a vbucket's item counter that includes new insertions that are not persisted on disk yet. On the other hand, full-eviction mode is disk-oriented and its vbucket item counter should be based on the stats on disk.

Line:236, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> It seems to me that cachedDocCount can be declared in the parent class KVStore and its updates should be done in the child KVStore classes. If so, then getItemCount can be implemented in KVStore as a non-virtual function.

Line:3119, src/ep.cc -> Fair enough. This will only get updated for full eviction then. Also I have filed MB-17542 which ep-engine would require from ForestDB in order to differentiate if a db_set is an update or an insert. Until that is available, ep-engine can't update the stats accurately.

Line:236, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Done
