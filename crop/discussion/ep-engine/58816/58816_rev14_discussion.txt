DESCRIPTION

Update total items using item count from the underlying KVStore

In the case of full eviction, we need to update number of items
with the total number of items in the underlying data store.
The KV store maintains the item count for each vbucket file on disk.
Update the total vbucket item count with that value.

Patch Set 14: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:2309, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Safer to use cachedDocCount.at() instead of array notation - that'll perform a range check for you and throw an exception if the argument is invalid.

Line:2314, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Same here.

Line:412, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Could you expand this comment - make it clear exactly how this function differs from getNumItems().

Line:3531, src/ep.cc -> Use a C++11 range-based for loop.

Line:1437, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Again, safer to use vector.at()
