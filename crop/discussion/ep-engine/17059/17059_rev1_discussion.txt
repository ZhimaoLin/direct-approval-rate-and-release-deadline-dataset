Please hold this change as I need to make sure that the main trunk is currently green.

Line:1152, ep.cc -> We should not call "clear()" function here.

Line:217, ep.cc -> const RCPtr<VBucket> &vb

Line:1111, ep.cc -> We don't need to define the additional function. Please move this function logic to "scheduleVBDeletion"

Line:1145, ep.cc -> we don't need to get the instance again as we already have the vb pointer above.

Line:1184, ep.cc -> This is not correct. We need to create a new vbucket instance and reset its checkpoint cursors to the beginning of the open checkpoint and then schedule VB deletion task by passing the old reference pointer.
