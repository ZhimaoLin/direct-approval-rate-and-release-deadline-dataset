Line:31, management/cbcompact -> Can you not just do `long(kwargs.pop('purgeBeforeTs', 0))`here?

Line:31, management/cbcompact -> I thought that last time I saw this pattern - IIRC when I changed it to that in cbstats and co it broke because sometimes the key /was/ in the dictionary, but was an empty string - it was in a valid case but I can't remember what caused it. The pattern here was to circumvent that - may document it as it took me longer than I'd like to remember the reason there. TBH it may have just been c/p'd here in the past and doesn't apply anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Line:31, management/cbcompact -> If you want to keep it, that's fine, there probably is a reason. A comment would be good to avoid this exchange in future though, because it's non-obvious.

Line:31, management/cbcompact -> OHHHH I've remembered - if I /now/ recall correctly, added options will always be present in kwargs, but possibly as a None value - I do not think the default here does anything. Will comment as such. A slightly better change would be to actually use optparse default values - may do that in a follow-up patch

Line:31, management/cbcompact -> Ongoing vacillation - may be clearest to leave the desired default values here, but would be cleaner to use optparse default args.

Either way, removing the default arg to pop and explaining the "or" pattern should reduce the confusion
