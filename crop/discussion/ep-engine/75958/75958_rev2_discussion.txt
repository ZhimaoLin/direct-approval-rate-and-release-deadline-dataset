DESCRIPTION

Modify access scanner memory benchmark

This change changes, slightly, what we are measuring with the benchmark.
We now record the maximum overhead per item actually stored in the
access scanner at any one time (the alog_max_stored_items) rather than
than the maximum overhead per item for all the items set during the
test. This is so we can more closely monitor the changes in memory
overhead for each item stored.
