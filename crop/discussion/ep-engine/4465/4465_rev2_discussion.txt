Patch Set 2:

Can you get a merge log in here?  You can have that happen by default by adding it into your global git config:

git config --global merge.log true

It'd just be good to see what you actually merged here.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Should be pretty easy to get that in since it's roughly the same thing you have here, but with a more descriptive commit message.
