DESCRIPTION

MB-17517: Regenerate CAS for TAP/DCP mutations with invalid CAS

When receiving mutations via TAP or DCP, validate the CAS and if
invalid generate a new one.

This is instead of the simply dropping the mutation (returning an
error to the producer), as by dropping the mutation we could cause
data loss.

Line:2173, src/tapconnection.cc -> I think it would be useful to log a key string too, so that we (and customer) hitting this issue can know which key has a CAS corruption.

Line:1297, src/dcp-stream.cc -> We don't need the same check for deletion?

Line:1277, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Same comment as the one in TAP

Line:2173, src/tapconnection.cc -> I spoke to DavidH about this - there's generally a desire that we *don't* log potentially sensitive user information (including keys) - there's been a few MBs in the past when data has been spotted to remove it.

That's why I included the seqno instead - that should (in theory) be enough to uniquely identify the mutation affected.

Line:1297, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Good spot. Will add.
