DESCRIPTION

MB-17517: Regenerate CAS for TAP/DCP mutations with invalid CAS

When receiving mutations via TAP or DCP, validate the CAS if invalid
generate a new one.

This is instead of the simply dropping the mutaiton (returning an
error to the producer), as by dropping the mutation we could cause
data loss.
