DESCRIPTION

CBD-337 Set exptime to now when persisting deletes

We also only read exptime as 0 for metadata fetches, to keep this from
propagating via XDCR. This will be used for purging deletions from
storage.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi Aaron,

I understand that you want timestamp the persisted deletion to do some optimization in storage. 

But the thing is information in metadata is property of the key and should be consistent in both memory and storage layer acrosss different data centers, along with data and other metadata like seqno, CAS and flag.  

Your latests change will mask the difference and return exptime = 0 to clients for all deleted items but XDCR at source node does not call ep_engine code at all and will still try to replicate the non-zero exptime in storage to remote cluster.

And CAPI at target will be confused since the local exptime is always 0 returned by getMeta from ep_engine.


IHMO, it would be better to use a different or create a new metadata to record the timestamp of persisted deletion, instead of using exptime, which has a very different semantics from what you want.

Patch Set 2:

The information you need is very local, while from perspective of XDCR, the metadata including exp time is globally consistent across data centers. 

You may want to create a new element in itemMetaData, say, 
timeStampLastOps to record local timestamp of last operations like persisted deletion.

I think we can figure this problem out closer to when we decide how to handle purges. I'll table this for now.

Aaron,

Thanks so much for understanding my concern. Yes, we can definitely figure it out a better way to record the time stamp of deletion with Chiyoung. At this time, it is important to keep XDCR stable.
