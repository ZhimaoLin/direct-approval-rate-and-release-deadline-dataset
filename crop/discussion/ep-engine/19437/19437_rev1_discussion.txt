Junyi, please take a look at this change to see if it doesn't break XDCR functionality.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

It will break XDCR. This change-set will make the exptime at source and target inconsistent, and failed all metadata checking in XDCR tests.

Why do we need set the exp-time to now when we persist it?

Patch Set 1:

If my understand correctly, the metadata should be only handled in ep_engine. Storage (including couchkvstore) should persist whatever metadata from upper ep_engine layer, but should not change it.

Patch Set 1:

Whoops, forgot to deal with the read-back path. This is kind of Couchstore specific. This is just to timestamp deletes on disk, so that later we can remove the deletion record entirely if we're confident it's been long enough that the deletion has propagated to everyone important.
