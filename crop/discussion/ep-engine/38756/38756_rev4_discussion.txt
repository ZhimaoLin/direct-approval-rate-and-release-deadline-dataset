DESCRIPTION

MB-11405 Wake only as many threads as ready tasks

+ If a thread has uncovered only one ready task then do not
  wake more threads, since current thread will suffice.
+ Only signal threads if they are sleeping.
+ cond_broadcast and wake all threads if we have more ready tasks
  than sleeping threads
+ Aggregate and signal threads to avoid repeated mutex contentions
