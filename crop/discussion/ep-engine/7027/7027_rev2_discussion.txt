DESCRIPTION

Send a backfill completion message per vbucket to the destination

As a given TAP consumer instance might be closed and instantiated
again to connect to the named TAP producer, we should not maintain
the list of backfilled vbuckets in the TAP consumer instance.
For this, the named TAP producer should send a backfill completion
message per vbucket to the TAP consumer.
