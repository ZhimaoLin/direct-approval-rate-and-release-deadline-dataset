DESCRIPTION

MB-3465 Fix to the slow vbucket chunk deletion on 1.6.5.3

We supports a separate table per vbucket from 1.6.5.3. However,
there was a bug in the vbucket chunk deletion, which each chunk
deletion task scans all the tables instead of its corresponding
single table. This consequently slows down the performance of
each chunk deletion significantly.
