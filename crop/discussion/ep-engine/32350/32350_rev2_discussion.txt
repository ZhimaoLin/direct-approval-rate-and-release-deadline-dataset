Line:67, src/upr-consumer.cc -> The opaque is used to uniquely identify a stream. For example, what if we create a stream for vb 0 opaque 1, and then close it. Then we create another stream for vb 0 with opaque 2. If a close message comes with vb 0 and opaque 1, then we should not close the vbucket stream.

Line:200, src/upr-producer.cc -> It is not used yet and this is a bug. I will submit a change soon that makes use of this parameter.

Line:67, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I understand it, but what i meant is that we should pass the opaque parameter to find(...). I realized that you did in another patch.
