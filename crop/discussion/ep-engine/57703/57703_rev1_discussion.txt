Line:151, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> From what I can tell `files` is never modified after assignment at line 79. Therefore you can move the check of its size down to here, keeping all the code related to readVBState() in one place.

(While you're at it you can make `files` const at line 79 so it's explicit it's never changed).
