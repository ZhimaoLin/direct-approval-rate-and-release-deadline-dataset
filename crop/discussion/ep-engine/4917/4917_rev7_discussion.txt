DESCRIPTION

Synchronize checkpoints between the master and slave nodes.

This supports a couple of new TAP commands (TAP_CHECKPOINT_START and
TAP_CHECKPOINT_END) to synchronize checkpoints between the TAP
producer and consumer. One thing that is still missing is the
synchronization of backfill and checkpoint operations. This will
be supported in the subsequent commit.
