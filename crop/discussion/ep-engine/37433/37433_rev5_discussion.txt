DESCRIPTION

The StoredValue objects should be accounted for

We should account for the memory used for the StoredValue in
what we assume is the current dataset.

The StoredValue object is the holder document containing the
key, metadata and possibly the value. We have millions of these
objects so they occupy a significant of memory.

Line:116, src/objectregistry.cc -> This stat (i.e., ep_value_size) is used to show the memory usage of blob value instances only, but not key and its metadata overhead. I think we shouldn't update this stat in these two functions.
