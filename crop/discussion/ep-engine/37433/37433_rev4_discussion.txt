DESCRIPTION

The StoredValue objects should be accounted for

We should account for the memory used for the StoredValue in
what we assume is the current dataset.

The StoredValue object is the holder document containing the
key, metadata and possibly the value. We have millions of these
objects so they occupy a significant of memory.

We also need to update "stats.org" doc to reflect the new stats.

Line:497, src/stored-value.h -> As we already account StoredValue overhead in this function, this will cause the memory overhead to be accounted twice. I think we can replace this function with the one that you defined below.

Line:497, src/stored-value.h -> In the same way, we can replace reduceMetaDataSize with the one that you added to ObjectRegistry class.

Line:497, src/stored-value.h -> I see that this one updated the hashtable as well, so for now I just dropped the increment in my method.. I'll reiterate on this at a later time to clean up more..
