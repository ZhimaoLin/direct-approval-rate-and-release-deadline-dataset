Patch Set 3: Fails

This has been consistently failing the following test for me over numerous runs:

    Running expiry... Assertion failed: (0 == get_int_stat(h, h1, "ep_expired")), function test_expiry, file ep_testsuite.cc, line 1854.

Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Never mind.  It appears to be failing *before* this change, too.  *sigh*
