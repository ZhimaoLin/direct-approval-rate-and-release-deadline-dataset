DESCRIPTION

Remove VBucketVisitorTask and replace usage with VBCBAdaptor

The VBucketVisitorTask and VBCBAdaptor perform very similar tasks
and share most of their code. The primary difference that
the VBCBAdaptor has is it filters out the visited vbuckets to a
single shard. Given that the visitors they are given can filter out
vbuckets themselves (Using a VBucketFilter) it makes more sense
to do the filtering in one place.

This therefore updates the AccessScannerVisitor to use the
VBCBAdaptor instead of the VBucketVisitorTask and removes the
VBucketVisitorTask.
