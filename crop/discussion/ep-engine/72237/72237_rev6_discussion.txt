DESCRIPTION

Modernize KVShard implementation

This modernizes the KVShard implementation (ie. mostly just the cc
file) to use unique_ptrs, reduce redundant code, initialise in the
initializer list where possible and use range-for.

It also renames some member variables in advance of another patch
which introduces new shorter / less confusing names for member
functions.

This patch should also resolve the coverity warnings for the
KVShard constructor (MB-22227).
