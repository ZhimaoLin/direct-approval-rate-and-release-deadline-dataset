DESCRIPTION

CBD-225 ep_engine has a unique system generated token

Add a system generated token intialized at each time ep_engine
starts up after the warmup process completed. This token is used
by XDCR to detect if any ep engine crash/recover happens in XDC
replication.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)



Line:2502, ep.cc -> We don't need to initialize it here.

Line:1154, ep_engine.cc -> Using epoch time should be enough. Please initialize it by using epoch time here:
startupTime(ep_real_time())

Line:33, docs/stats.org -> Please change the stat name to something more meaningful. I would suggest "ep_startup_time"

Line:780, ep_engine.h -> time_t type should be enough

Line:2502, ep.cc -> As we discussed, the start up time is at the  end of warming up. Is my understanding correct?

Line:1154, ep_engine.cc -> I think we probably need to set 0 here to allow the XDCR at remote node to know that we are in warming up, and the remote node should probably wait until warming up finishes before any XDCR operation.

I still prefer hrtime instead of epoch time, because what if the system crashed and recovered in one second (assume we have a very good recovery component) in future? :-)

Line:33, docs/stats.org -> Good suggestion. Will change to ep_startup_time

Line:780, ep_engine.h -> Please see my comment in ep_engine.cc

Line:2502, ep.cc -> It doesn't need to be. This stat simply indicates when the engine is instantiated and started.

Line:1154, ep_engine.cc -> Warmup complete should be detected by the warmup stat. I don't think the system can be recovered in one second in the real scenario.

Line:1154, ep_engine.cc -> Looks like ep_real_time is NOT ready to use when the constructor is called.  I tried it and all tests failed.
