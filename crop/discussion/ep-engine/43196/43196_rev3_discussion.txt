Line:88, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> managerTask.cancel();

managerTask.snooze(0);

This will prevent us from having to grab locks in the ExecutorPool.

Line:103, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> managerTask.snooze(0);

Line:152, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> managerTask.snooze(0);

Line:190, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> You need to delete the task here.

Line:209, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> managerTask.snooze(0);

Line:1157, src/connmap.cc -> You need to hold the connsLock.

Line:71, src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> We should have a variable that checks to see if the memory usage is over the high watermark when this task starts and only call the notifyBackfillManagerTasks() function if this variable is set to true. We might run this task when the memory usage is below the high watermark and this will prevent use from calling this function in that case.

Line:170, src/item_pager.cc -> We should have a variable that checks to see if the memory usage is over the high watermark when this task starts and only call the notifyBackfillManagerTasks() function if this variable is set to true. We might run this task when the memory usage is below the high watermark and this will prevent use from calling this function in that case.
