DESCRIPTION

MB-11192: Wake up backfillManagerTasks at the soonest possible

Wake up backfillManagerTasks when memory is freed in the
following scenarios:
    - ItemPagerTask evicts items
    - CheckpointRemoverTask removes closed unref. checkpoints
Also wake up the backfillManagerTasks when the desired seqno
becomes available.

Please also break this change into two separate changes. One for the memory usage task wakeup and one for the persisted seqno task wakeup.

Line:1156, src/connmap.cc -> This is incorrect. You only need to notify the connection once. Here you are doing it per vbucket. You just need to iterate map_.

Line:719, src/ep.h -> We can make this more generic by using callbacks. Then in the future we can use it for other features. I'll discuss this with you later today.

Line:2922, src/ep.cc -> This will notify all connections instead of just notifying the one we want.

Line:140, src/dcp-producer.h -> Can you remove this function and just call getBackfillManager()->wakeUpTask().
