Line:102, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> We don't need to check that the task is dead because the managerTask will always be NULL is there is no task. My guess is that you needed this because you weren't resetting the managerTask.

Line:192, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> We need to set the managerTask to NULL here

Line:211, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> We don't need to check the state of the task before doing this. My guess is that you needed this because you weren't resetting the managerTask.

Line:54, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> We need to have this in the item pager and checkpoint remover because what we are trying to avoid is getting the connLock in the DcpConnMap and waking up connections when they will just sleep again.
