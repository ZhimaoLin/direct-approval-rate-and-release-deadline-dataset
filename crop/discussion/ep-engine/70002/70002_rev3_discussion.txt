DESCRIPTION

Drop building forestdb as part of KV commit validation

ForestDB won't be used as the backend for Spock so we can speed
up the commit validation builds by not build it.

Patch Set 3:

I've toggled the flags, and made the change less intrusive. I don't know the speedup as it depends on a lot of different factors (did the ccache kick in, what was the load of the system etc). But locally on my machine a fresh build of forestdb on my box takes some time. Given that it is (currently) not used I don't see why we should build it...
