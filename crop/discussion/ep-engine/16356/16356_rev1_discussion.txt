DESCRIPTION

CBD-120 Add XDCR ep engine stats

The stats added in ep engine will allow user and UI to monitor
different XDCR activities, namely, 1) get metadata for an item; 2)
set an item with metadata; 3) delete an item with metadata.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:1367, ep.cc -> opsGetMeta?

Line:5321, ep_testsuite.cc -> I think test coverage look great, thanks for adding these new test cases. However, considering growing number of unit test cases in ep_testsuites, I think we'd better incorporate above test cases into existing unit tests for del/set_with_meta?

Line:78, docs/stats.org -> I think these new stats can be considered general stats (not only for xdcr) for ep. Please change them to ep_num_ops_get/set/del_meta.

Line:5321, ep_testsuite.cc -> IHMO, the current unit tests for del/set_with meta were poorly written. The protocol are all hardcoded and magic numbers are everywhere, e.g., it took me a bit time to figure out why the nb=22 in these tests :) Think in future if we change any element in itemMetaData, how many unit tests we have to modify.:-)

I made these two help functions because 

1.  My test used them multiple times.
2   They will free my test and any future xdcr tests (I expect a lot more xdcr tests would come, and these two functions will be called over and over) from worrying about these complicated memcached protocol layout.

Line:78, docs/stats.org -> What is the benefit to make it more generic stats of ep? They are only used by XDCR and normal workload will never touch them. Also, in future, we would remove them from engine stats and create a subcategory of ep stats for xdcr, like kvstore, vbucket, and other stats categories. Leaving the name xdcr in parameter names sounds making more sense to me.

Line:5321, ep_testsuite.cc -> If the current unit tests are poorly written, please enhance it as a separate task, but I still disagree to creating similar test cases again.

Line:78, docs/stats.org -> I'm not tNathalie Landrying about the benefits. Although those functions are now only used by the XDCR, we may need to extend those functions later to support other use cases.

Line:5321, ep_testsuite.cc -> They are not similar test cases at all. What I am saying is we need to extract building memcached protocol from unit tests, otherwise it would be hard to maintain them. 

I will polish other current XCDR unit tests to remove protocol building code, but probably it would be in another commit, not this one.

Line:78, docs/stats.org -> If I remember our discussion correctly, due to performance issues, we will create a stat category for xdcr and put these stats into that category to reduce stats collection overhead. If other use cases will use ep_engine APIs, they are no longer xdcr stats. 

What use cases other than xdcr will use these set/del with meta API? Thanks.

Patch Set 1:

If that matters I'm with Chiyoung on stat names. This commands are not named: set_xdcr. But rather more generically set_with_meta
