DESCRIPTION

MB-16159: DCP consumer to explicitly notify memcached to get flow ctl buffer ack

In DCP consumer, when sufficient bytes are drained it is good to notify
memcached to get the flow control out. Previous method of waiting for Connection
Manager daemon task to notify memcached will cause delays while streaming
large items.
