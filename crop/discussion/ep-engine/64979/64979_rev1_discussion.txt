DESCRIPTION

Backport ep-engine_unit_tests from watson to 3.0.x

In Watson we have created a set of 'unit' (i.e. class-level) tests for
ep-engine. To assist in backporting bug fixes, and specifically their
unit tests (to demonstrate they are correct), this patch backports the
test infrastructure itself, along with regression tests for Mb-19503.

Note these tests require GTest, so the CMake changes necessary for it
have also been included.
