General approach looks ok, as you say still needs changes to bring up to coding spec (+ tests).

Line:58, src/dcp/backfill.h -> Can probably make this method const.

Line:152, src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> If you fail to promote to a shared_ptr, that means the vBucket has gone away (been deleted say). As such I'd cancel the backfill.

Line:95, src/dcp/backfill_memory.h -> sequence list?

Line:119, src/dcp/backfill_memory.h -> That is known from reading the definition ;) Better to describe /why/ it's a weak pointer.
