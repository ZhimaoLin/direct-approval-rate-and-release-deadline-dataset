DESCRIPTION

Simplify common.h: Remove unnecessary headers [3/3]

Remove all #includes which arn't actually needed by the file including
them (aka "include what you use").

Reduces build time down from before this patch series from:

       31.82 real       222.13 user        16.09 sys

down to:

       26.95 real       188.54 user        13.29 sys

giving a 15% speedup in (user+sys).
