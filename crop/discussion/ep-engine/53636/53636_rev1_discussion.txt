DESCRIPTION

[Unittest-slowdisk] Fix to test_exp_persisted_set_del

Rather than waiting for curr items to become zero
(which is updated by persistence callback - flusher),
wait for expired items to become 1 (set by the expiry
pager / by access).

Sorry, I merged this change by accident :(

I was trying to give -1 to this change.

Line:11810, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Note that the purpose of this test is to make sure that a given item to be expired was successfully deleted in both cache and disk. If we get the timeout on this test due to very slow disk operations (e.g, docker instance inside a low-end VM), then we may need to increase the timeout.

However, we should rather run our CV jobs on a high-end VM at least (I guess our build team is already working on the migration), so that the CV jobs shouldn't take so much time.

Line:11810, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> That makes sense Chiyoung, I'll push in another patch with the wait time increased soon.
