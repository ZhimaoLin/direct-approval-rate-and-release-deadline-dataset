DESCRIPTION

Abort SYNC requests if they take too long

If a SYNC request takes too long, it will uncessarily hold on a connection, which
is a precious resource. MB-3818 suggests a timeout of 2.5 seconds after which a
SYNC request should be aborted, freeing up the respective connection.

Patch Set 1:

There are 2 things I'm unsure about:

1) The priority of the dispatcher's sync abort task. I don't enough experience/knowledge of ep_engine and membase deployments to have a good judgement about the best value for it;

2) The timeout, 2.5 seconds, is defined as a constant in the code. Probably it should be made configurable, as # of ms, as an engine parameter?

At this point I'm more concerned about correctness of the patch.

I agree that the constant time is going to be less than ideal.  Making it configurable will at least allow the test to run longer, but I would hope any timeout could be user specified.

Dustin,

So we need an extra field in the request message. Will this not require the existing client libs to be updated as well?
Where, within the request message, would this field be placed? (32 bits?)

Line:516, ep_engine.cc -> Is ETMPFAIL the right thing to use here?  See the note on MB-3718 on possibly having other error codes.

Matt, I don't see anything in the ticket's discussion about which error code to use. I choose that one since none of the alternatives seemed better to me:

What do you suggest?

Patch Set 1:

In response to your question, I guess I'm okay with ETMPFAIL here as long as MB-3817 (return a "can't do this") is implemented.  The client concern is can the client discern the difference between "something's wrong and should be working" versus "I asked for the impossible".
