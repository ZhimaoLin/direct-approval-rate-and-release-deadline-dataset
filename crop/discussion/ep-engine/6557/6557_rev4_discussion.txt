DESCRIPTION

Abort SYNC requests if they take too long

If a SYNC request takes too long, it will uncessarily
hold on a connection, which is a precious resource.
MB-3818 suggests a default timeout of 2.5 seconds after
which a SYNC request should be aborted, freeing up the
respective connection.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I don't see any tests of the negative cases.  I'm not going to -1 it owing to the time constraints, but shouldn't we verify the other return values when we request things unsupported, etc.?

Line:5007, ep_testsuite.cc -> If this test passes, I think it's a bit of a problem.  The issue is that our default OOTB bucket configuration is replica of 1, even though we don't force more than one node, we just warn.  

I guess it's okay though for now, since I can't think of a better approach.  I feel kind of bad shipping in a mode where we'll timeout with sync OOTB.  :(

I got my concerns about the negative cases clarified, but am slightly concerned on the validation of the param.

Line:284, ep_engine.cc -> Should probably validate against something smaller.  Maybe a 60 sec max?
