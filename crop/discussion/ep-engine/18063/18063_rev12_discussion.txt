Line:237, command_ids.h -> This code will not work without this attribute because the alignment will be incorrect. In the following commit this is removed since it becomes unnecessary. Do you have any problem with adding it in this commit and then removing it in the next so that this commit compiles and passes tests?

Line:237, command_ids.h -> Please fix it in this commit as it's not merged yet. Basically, every commit should not cause any major build failures.

Line:237, command_ids.h -> I am unaware of a better way to deal with struct packing outside of reordering the fields. Can anyone suggest something I can do here? Otherwise I would rather squash the next change with this one.
