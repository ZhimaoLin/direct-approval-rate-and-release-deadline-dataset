Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I saw that there are some confusions on hton ntoh in the unit tests. Some of them use hton, while the others use ntoh. Please correct them.

Line:5856, ep_testsuite.cc -> Then, this should be ntohs

Line:5857, ep_testsuite.cc -> should be ntohl
