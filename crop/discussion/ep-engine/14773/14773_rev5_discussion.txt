DESCRIPTION

MB-5010 Reset the thread local data whenever leaving a bucket.

thread enters into that bucket for supporting the memory
accounting per bucket. This means that the thread local data
should be reset when the thread leaves from its bucket.

Patch Set 5: Verified; No score

Mike, I think this is ready for review. I was stupidly stuck in a very simple one. I didn't see anymore seg faults with this change and memory accounting is still correct.
