DESCRIPTION

MB-24034: VBucketTest: addOne/setOne to return Add/MutationStatus

Change VBucketTest::addOne() & setOne() to return the result of the
operation, instead of passing in the expected value and having the
function itself (addOne/setOne) check it.

This was done for two reasons:

1. Sometimes addOne() is used in setup code, where an ASSERT_EQ() is
   more appropriate to check the result.

2. If the EXPECT does fail, then in the previous code the GTest error
   message would point at the implementation of addOne(), which
   generally isn't very helpful - normally you want to see the
   call-site of addOne.
