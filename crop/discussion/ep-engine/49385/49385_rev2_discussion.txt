I prefer to fix this windows issue instead of reverting it unless it blocks any QE or other tests (I guess not because it is the master branch).

It currently blocks building all the other commit-validation jobs on master - so for example memcached, tlm, etc.

Anyone who needs the patch locally to develop can simply cherry-pick it; but having it upstream in master is blocking anyone else from building master on windows.

Patch Set 2:

(cont) I recall the problems we had early on in Sherlock due to the Windows build getting broken and taking longer than expected to fix the bad patch.

I **strongly** request we back this out in a simple revert, and then Sriram can take as much time as necessary to fix for all supported platforms.
