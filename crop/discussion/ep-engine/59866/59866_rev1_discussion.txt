Line:599, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I think this should be a deque in sherlock (unless I'm getting mixed up in the merge order) - given we read from one end and write to the other it should be more efficient).

Line:599, src/dcp-stream.cc -> So in the checkpoint code, if you see getAllItemsForCursor, it was for some reason changed to vector from deque in sherlock. I haven't added this anew.
