DESCRIPTION

MB-14041: Ensure objectregistry has an engine when
deleting the VBucketMemoryDeletionTask.

If the vbucket is still referenced (and is the last reference) we
may assert deleting the VBucket as Blob deletion etc... fails
to account because of the lack of an engine.

Patch Set 2:

Not sure if this is the correct branch if this fix is desired for Sherlock (got an error pushing to refs/for/sherlock)

Let me know if it needs moving.

Commit message seems too long and should be within 80 columns. If this fix is for Sherlock, then please push it into sherlock branch.

Line:162, src/ep.cc -> I think we should configure this task as 'must be executed before engine destroy or shutdown'. There is a bool parameter in GlobalTask that allows us to pass this option.

Will give that a go and re-run the failing test.
