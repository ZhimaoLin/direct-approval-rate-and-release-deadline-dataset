Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Nice cleanup - couple of suggestions to make even better :)

Line:125, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Would be nice to put this with the other sendXXXResponse methods (around line 6165) so they are more obvious to the reader.

Line:126, src/ep_engine.cc -> I suspect that error responses are always RAW_BYTES - if so you could simplify by removing this argument.

Line:5276, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Can be made const.

Line:5351, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Might be a little cleaner if we only update `cas` on success?

Line:5468, src/ep_engine.cc -> This looks very similar (same?) as the code in setWithMeta (line 5275) - could you abstract into a common helper function?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Cha-cha-cha changes!

Line:834, src/ep_engine.h -> Style: If you attach the [in,out] xxx@xxx.xxx then Doxygen can parse correctly: https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/Adrianna Holmesal/commands.html#cmdparam

Line:835, src/ep_engine.h -> Is this optional? If so then probably worth documenting, if not then prefer a reference.
