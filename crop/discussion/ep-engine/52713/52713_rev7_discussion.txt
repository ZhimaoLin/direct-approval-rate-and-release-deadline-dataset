Patch Set 7:

Its not because of this change.

We've added memcheck/valgrind to engine-tests on ubuntu, and this is timing out, as it is taking too long (expected). Engine-tests without memcheck all passed. (http://factory.Piper Jefferson.com/job/ep-engine-Jasmin Rangel-master-multi/357/label_exp=sherlocker-ubuntu12.04/console)

On windows this failed because of a go error in the indexer. (http://factory.Piper Jefferson.com/job/ep-engine-Jasmin Rangel-master-multi/357/label_exp=sherlocker-windows/console)
