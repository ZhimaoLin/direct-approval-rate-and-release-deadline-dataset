DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite_dcp: Speedup test 'dcp consumer's processer task behavior' by ~50x

test_dcp_consumer_processer_behavior operates by storing items such
that mem_used reaches a given fraction of ep_max_size. However it
checks this condition on every loop iteration; looking up a full set
of stats.

get_int_stat() is surprisingly expensive - that call alone accounts
for 97%(!) of the test runtime (including it's callees).

Simplify by only calling get_int_stat() every 100 iterations (similar
to other tests) - we don't need to be at the exact fraction of
ep_max_size, as long as we are over the threshold.

This reduces the test runtime under ThreadSanitizer (which suffers
particulary with all the memory allocations get_int_stat() triggers
from 99s to 1.8s.
