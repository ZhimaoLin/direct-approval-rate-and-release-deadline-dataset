DESCRIPTION

Prevent race conditions on SYNC persistence and replication

Don't allow the SyncRegistry to notifyIOComplete before we return
ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK to the engine. Only allow it after we checked all
the StoredValue instances and if the SyncListener is not yet complete.
Otherwise return ENGINE_SUCCESS and remove the listener from the
registry explicitly.
