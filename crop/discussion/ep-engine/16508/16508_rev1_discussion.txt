DESCRIPTION

MB-5401 Reopen database upon failures from the database layer

Failures from the underlying database layer can happen by various
reasons. For example, if a database file is deleted by mistake or
a database directory is mounted to the NFS that sometimes has a
connection issue, there would be failures from the underlying
database layer. In this case, we should reopen database to get
a new handle.
