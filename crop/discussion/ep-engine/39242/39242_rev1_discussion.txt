DESCRIPTION

MB-11676: Properly set the end seqno for disk only streams

It's possible that if there were no persisted disk items that we
would not schedule a backfill and go straight to the in-memory
phase which is incorrect for a disk only stream. This change also
makes sure that the end seqno is reported correctly in the stats
for a disk only stream.

Line:649, src/upr-stream.cc -> hmm, I'm not sure if this new logic is correct or not. Let's assume the following case:

lastReadSeqno = 0;

end_seqno = 10; (items up to seqno 10 were persisted)

backfillStart = 1;

If the checkpoint manager still has items with seqno 1 ~ 10, then curChkSeqno will be set to 1 and consequently backfillEnd is still 0.

In this case, we won't schedule a disk backfill task even if there are some persisted items on disks.
