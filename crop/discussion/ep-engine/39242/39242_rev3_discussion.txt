DESCRIPTION

MB-11676: Properly set the end seqno for disk only streams

It's possible that if there were no persisted disk items that we
would not schedule a backfill and go straight to the in-memory
phase which is incorrect for a disk only stream. This change also
makes sure that the end seqno is reported correctly in the stats
for a disk only stream.
