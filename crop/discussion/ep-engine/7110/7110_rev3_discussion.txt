DESCRIPTION

Refactor: rename the methods in the change callbacks

Unfortunately the compiler didn't like if I subclassed the parent
class and only created an implementation for one of the methods
(that would cause the other ones to be hidden). By using unique
method names I can override one of them in my subclass.
