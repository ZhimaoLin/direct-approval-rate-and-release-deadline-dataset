Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Let's move this to post 2.0.2. I agree that the mutation log and compactor should be deprecated. As the access log is based on the mutation log implementation, we should rename the mutation log classes to the access log related ones.

I have already moved this to 2.1 since I won't be able to get consensus an the removal right now.
