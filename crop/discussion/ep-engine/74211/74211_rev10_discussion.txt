DESCRIPTION

MB-22620: Check for datatypes in conflict resolution of META commands

During conflict resolution of set/delete_with_meta commands,
if one of the datatypes happens to the xattr and the other is not,
the one with xattrs wins the conflict. In such cases, a bg fetch
is required to fetch the datatype from disk, if required

Patch Set 10: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:51, src/conflict_resolution.h -> Nit: Probably easier for the reader if these are in the same order as the main metadata.

Line:1214, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Message is misleading - please update.

Line:1238, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> ditto

Line:1309, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Misleading message.

Shouldn't we check somewhere that we /can/ successfully delete it?

Line:1309, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> The possibility of a delete with meta succeeding this case if the incoming datatype is XATTR. AFAIK, we don't support using XATTR payload in delete_with_meta, given that a delete_with_meta is just going to delete the existing item.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1309, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> How are we planning to have XDCR replicate deleted Documents with non-zero bodies (e.g. the mobile convergence documents)?
