DESCRIPTION

MB-22620: Check for datatypes in conflict resolution of META commands

During conflict resolution of set/delete_with_meta commands,
if one of the datatypes happens to the xattr and the other is not,
the one with xattrs wins the conflict. In such cases, a bg fetch
is required to fetch the datatype from disk, if required

I guess deleteWithMeta needs to support a body like regular deletes. It will have to be a separate commit.

That's fine, as long as we have a plan for it. I'll review again shortly.

Line:27, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> Need to update the comment to include datatype.

Line:64, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> Same here

Line:929, src/vbucket.cc -> Shouldn't this always be true? i.e. if we've just done the isResident() check at line 916, then `value` must be non-null here?

(same in delete code below).

Line:929, src/vbucket.cc -> Fair point - however we /do/ need to handle the deleted-and-has-value case (as discussed earlier.
