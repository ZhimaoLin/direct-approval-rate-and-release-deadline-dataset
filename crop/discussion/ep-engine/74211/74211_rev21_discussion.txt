DESCRIPTION

MB-22620: Check for datatypes in conflict resolution of META commands

During conflict resolution of set/delete_with_meta commands,
if one of the datatypes happens to the xattr and the other is not,
the one with xattrs wins the conflict. In such cases, a bg fetch
is required to fetch the datatype from disk, if required

Line:921, src/vbucket.cc -> I guess I would probably have renamed the variable to "metadataOnly" and added a comment above it describing why we need the full value as a comment..
