DESCRIPTION

MB-22620: Check for datatypes in conflict resolution of META commands

During conflict resolution of set/delete_with_meta commands,
if one of the datatypes happens to the xattr and the other is not,
the one with xattrs wins the conflict. In such cases, a bg fetch
is required to fetch the datatype from disk, if required
