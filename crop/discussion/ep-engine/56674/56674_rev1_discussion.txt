DESCRIPTION

Refactor/simplify getLocked handling

The current getLocked code uses a combination of a bool and a
Callback<GetValue> to return the result from EPStore back to
EPEngine. This is over-complex:

a) The Callback<> is unnecessary *and* inefficient - the object is
   only ever used from a single thread, and yet we also pay the cost
   of creating and then signalling on a ConditionVariable

b) The bool is redundent - the GetValue's status code is sufficient to
   determine if the operation succeeded and the return value to pass back
   to the client.

Remove the Callback<>, and simply return a GetValue directly
