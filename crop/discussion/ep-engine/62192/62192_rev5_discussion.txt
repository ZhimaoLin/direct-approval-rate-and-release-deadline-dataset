DESCRIPTION

Add logger injection to CouchKVStore

This adds the necessary changes to allow a test (or something else)
to inject a logger object into a new CouchKVStore instance via the
KVStoreConfig. By default it currently uses the global logger.

When creating a KVStoreConfig the Logger can be set as follows:

    Logger logger;
    auto config = KVStoreConfig( .. ).setLogger(logger);

The purpose of this is to allow, in a future commit, verifying
logging output from injected errors into couchstore.
