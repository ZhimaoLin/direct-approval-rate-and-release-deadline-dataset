DESCRIPTION

Add logger injection to CouchKVStore

This adds the necessary changes to allow a test (or something else)
to inject a logger object into a new CouchKVStore instance via the
KVStoreConfig. By default it currently uses the global logger.

When creating a KVStoreConfig the Logger can be set as follows:

    Logger logger;
    auto config = KVStoreConfig( .. ).setLogger(logger);

The purpose of this is to allow, in a future commit, verifying
logging output from injected errors into couchstore.

Patch Set 3:

(2 comments)

Line:35, src/kvstore.h -> I don't know why you need this in the header for kvstore - and moreover we /shouldn't/ expose any implementation details (i.e. couchstore vs forestdb) to the interface. (Not that this should cause your problem...)

Line:33, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> #include <> should only be used for system or other component headers - stick with #include "" for headers which are part of ep-engine.

Line:35, src/kvstore.h -> This was meant to go in the later patch to add file ops to the config.
