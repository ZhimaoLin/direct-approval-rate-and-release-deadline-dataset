DESCRIPTION

CBD-49 Test non-ASCII keys for store and get in ep-engine

In ep_testsuite, store keys that cannot be represented by ASCII,
e.g. keys in Chinese, Korean, or Russian language. Ep-engine
should treat them just as binary byte array.

Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

This is just a basic test, but I still think ep-engine shouldn't be bothered by the encoding scheme used for key.
