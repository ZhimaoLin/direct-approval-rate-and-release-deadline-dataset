Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I agree with the reason for doing this, but I personally don't like having 2 stats that mean the same thing. Can we mark mem_used as deprecated in 1.8.1?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm not sure how to go about deprecating other than in documentation (which needs to be updated here) :)
