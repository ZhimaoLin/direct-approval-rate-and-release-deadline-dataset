DESCRIPTION

DefragmenterTest: Fix missing populate phase

During previous migration of the Defragmenter benchmark tests to
GTest, we inadvertantly lost the actual population of the data they
need to act on. As such the various tests (Visit, DefragAlways,
DefragAge10, DefragAge10_20ms) essentially were invalid.

Fix this by restoring a populateVbucket() call.
