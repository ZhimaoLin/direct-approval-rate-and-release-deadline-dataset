Line:281, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Check the vb existence. In addition, when do we persist this new failover logs into disk? I don't see that part in this commit. I know we do it as part of "snapshotVBState", but is it always guarantted that the new logs is persisted?

Line:281, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I actually have that in another commit. When I originally did the sequence I had some other stuff that needed fixing before I added that line of code. I'll rearrange the sequence to add that line to this commit.
