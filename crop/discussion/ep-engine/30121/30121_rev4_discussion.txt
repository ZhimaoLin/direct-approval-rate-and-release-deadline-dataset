DESCRIPTION

MB-9453: Parallelize accesslog loading phase

Warmup's accessLog loading phase can take
advantage of GIO. To do so, access scanner will
need to set up a shard number of access logs
rather than the one complete log. There by access
scanner will also run access scanning phase
at shard level parallely.

Now in the warmup's accessLog loading phase
seperate threads are set to take on each access
log.

Please also rebase your change with the master branch.

Line:74, src/access_scanner.cc -> This won't work. If the number of shards is 4, then the largest shard id will be 3. In addition, this code doesn't seem to guarantee that the task with the largest shard id is always completed as the last task.

Line:132, src/access_scanner.cc -> We don't need to check the shard id here. Please call resetAccessScannerTasktime() one time before for loop.

Line:155, src/ep.cc -> please simplify it by calling push_back(...)
