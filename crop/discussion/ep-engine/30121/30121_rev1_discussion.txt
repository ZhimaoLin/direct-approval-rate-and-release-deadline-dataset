DESCRIPTION

MB-9453: Parallelize accesslog loading phase

Warmup's accessLog loading phase can take
advantage of GIO. To do so, access scanner will
need to set up a shard number of access logs
rather than the one complete log. There by access
scanner will also run access scanning phase
at shard level parallely.

Hi Abhinav, just a few comments from me..
thanks

Line:37, src/access_scanner.cc -> For backward compatibility, should we maybe keep the 0th shard file without a .shardid extension?

Line:543, src/warmup.cc -> should we just deprecate this variable allVbStates completely?

Line:576, src/warmup.cc -> why can't we set estimated warmup count to 0?

Line:154, src/ep.cc -> What about backward compatibility? what if there is already a file without the .<shardid> name present, should we assign it to one of the shards maybe?

Line:71, src/access_scanner.cc -> This won't work correctly anymore because we split it into multiple sub tasks.

Line:37, src/access_scanner.cc -> As mentioned, it should be okay to not consider a backward compatibility.

Line:499, src/warmup.cc -> size_t

Line:570, src/warmup.cc -> Why do we need to add it four times?

Line:149, src/ep.cc -> Please use std::list<MuationLog *> and then create MutationLog instance per shard and add it to the list.

Line:154, src/ep.cc -> Sundar, that's valid point. But, we don't transfer the access log file during the online / offline upgrade. So, it should be okay.

Line:345, src/ep.cc -> Please simply iterate the list and free each MutationLog instance.
