DESCRIPTION

MB-16915: Use refcounted pointers on producer/consumer

Prevents a race/crash occuring when the DcpProducer is destroyed
and there are backfill tasks running/pending.

The test case reveals the probem when run under valgrind as
a series of invalid reads of freed memory. E.g.

Patch Set 2:

dcp-strea in Sherlock is also using the producer from ~ActiveStream. So need to remove the cyclic dependency and ensure 1) logging doesn't touch producer if DEAD and 2) destructor doesn't touch producer if DEAD
