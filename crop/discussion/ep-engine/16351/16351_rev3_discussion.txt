DESCRIPTION

MB-5367 Make select bucket command synchronous

The select_bucket command should be syncrhonous. If it didn't
succeed, subsequent commands wouldn't succeed either. With
async select_bucket, out-of-sequence responses scenario is
possible and mc-engine handleResponse would abort because
select_bucket has no implicitResponse. The change is to make
resetConnection try selectBucket only for other commands and
selectBucket itself will re-send the command until succeeded.
The function waitOnce is added to be used by select_bucket
for re-send code path.
