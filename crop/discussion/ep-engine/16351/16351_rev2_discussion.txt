DESCRIPTION

MB-5367 Make select bucket command synchronous

The select_bucket command should be syncrhonous. If it didn't
succeed, subsequent commands wouldn't succeed either. With
async select_bucket, out-of-sequence responses scenario is
possible and mc-engine handleResponse would abort because
select_bucket has no implicitResponse. The change is to make
resetConnection try selectBucket only for other commands and
selectBucket itself will re-send the command until succeeded.

The function waitOnce is added to be used by select_bucket.
In follow-up commits, it will be used by notify_update,
deleteVBucket, and flush so that they can use the same
re-send code path. The old function wait() will be used for
mc-kvstore specific commands.

The function clearConnection is to separate connection
clearing from the attempt to select bucket. The use of Mutex
is for clearing connection incl. response handler queue etc.
The other alternative is to keep resetConnection but move
clearing code and mutex lock holder to a inner scope within
resetConnection.

Line:1356, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> We probably add debug/warning log when retry case either in waitOnce() or after sendCommand. This will help debug where selecBucket hangs in case of repeating sendCommand   .

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The commit message body is too much detailed. We don't need to describe it at the level of a function. I think the first paragraph is already enough for a commit message.

Line:588, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> If we don't define clearConnection(), you can unlock the lock by calling lh.unlock() here before calling selectBucket()

Line:565, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> I don't think it's necessary to define clearConnection unless clearConnection is invoked by other parts in addition to resetConnection.

Patch Set 2:

is is possible to write a few unit test cases to verify that select bucket is now synchronous?
