Abhinav, Sundar,

Can you please create a toy build by checking out this change? I want Pavel to retest MB-11405 with the toy build.

Patch Set 5:

Hi Chiyoung, the latest patch set would conform to what we discussed but it will override user set configuration option and make the system non-tunable.
Wouldn't it be better for performance testing if we just pick user specified option for readers, writers, auxio,nonio if it is non-zero and use current logic if it is zero?
Can I upload a simplified patch set over this in a couple of minutes? thanks
