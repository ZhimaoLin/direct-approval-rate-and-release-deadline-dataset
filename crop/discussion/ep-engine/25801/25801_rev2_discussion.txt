DESCRIPTION

Add pendingMutation for monitoring incoming mutation requests

This synchronization variable is for better handling of snoozing
and waking up individual flusher based on incoming mutation for
its shard. This avoids waking up and snoozing all the flushers
uniformly based on the global diskQueueSize stat
