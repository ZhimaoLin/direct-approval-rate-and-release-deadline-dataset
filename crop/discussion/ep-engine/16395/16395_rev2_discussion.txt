DESCRIPTION

MB-5380 Reduce engine paramter couch_response_time to 5 seconds

time to wait for response from mccouch.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Someone should modify ns_server so that it's passing old value as engine parameter. Otherwise 5 seconds is too short for real world usage. We've seen swapping causing way more latency.

Patch Set 2:
