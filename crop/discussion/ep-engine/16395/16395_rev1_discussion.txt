DESCRIPTION

MB-5380 Reduce engine paramter couch_response_time to 5 seconds

The paramater value is 10 minutes, and it's not a reasonable
time to wait for response from mccouch.

Patch Set 1:

The reason we set this value to be very large was because if we are storing a batch of large items then it could potentially take more than 5 seconds for couchdb to respond. I know a lot of things have changed around persistence, but I just want to make sure that the reason we set this to be very high is no longer valid.

We no longer send a large number of mutations asynchronously although I really want to get rid of mc-engine dependency of couchKVStore.

This is a good point, Mike. We will ensure that the change won't inadvertently break any existing test cases with huge number of item inserts.
