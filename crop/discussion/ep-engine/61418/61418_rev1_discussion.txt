DESCRIPTION

MB-18650: Optimize get_stat() calls in ep_test_apis

The get_{str,int,bool,...}_stat() functions in ep_test_apis currently
constuct a map of every stat returned back from ep_engine, and then
find the one stat the user requested at the end. This is one of the
main reasons why the get_XXX_stat calls are expensive, and for example
we have tried to minimise their use in tight loops by only checking
stats every N iterations.

While there are some cases where tests need multiple stats in a given
stat group, the vast majority of use-cases only care about a single
stat. This patch thefore:

* Optimize the get_XXX_stat functions to use a callback which checks
  the key, and only records the result for the requested key. This
  speeds them up, particulary when running under tools like Valgrind
  or ThreadSanitizer.

* For use-cases where all stats from a given group are needed, a new
  get_all_stats() function has been added; which returns a map of the
  stats so the test can check multiple keys.
