File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be helpful to expand the commit message - what is "reset" - why do we need it? - is there an associated MB?

Line:216, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> vbid is uint16_t; use PRIu16 instead of %d.

Line:230, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same

Line:238, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> same

Line:244, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> same

Line:254, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> same

Line:261, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Do these partition docs ("partitionXXX") have their own namespace? What would happen if a user created a document with the same key?

Line:272, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: You might prefer reversing the if() / else() clauses as then you can immediately throw the error and then continue with the "normal" oath unindented, meaning less need for line wrapping - i.e.

 if (!state) {
     throw std::invalid_argument(...);
 }
 
 // Normal path continues here.
