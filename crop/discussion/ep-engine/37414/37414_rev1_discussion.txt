DESCRIPTION

MB-11016 Deal with byte order of UPR mutation flag

This change allows UPR client to use TAP_CONNECT_TAP_FIX_FLAG_BYTEORDER
to tell upr-producer to send 'flags' in the mutation in network
byte-order. This is the same way as how we deal with TAP so refactor
the TAP code.

there is no need to use the TAP way since it's used for a special case and won't be applicable any more.
