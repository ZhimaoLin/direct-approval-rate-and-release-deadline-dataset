DESCRIPTION

CBD-485: Make CMD_COMPACT_DB call synchronous

NS-Server needs the CMD_COMPACT_DB command to block in ep-engine
until the compaction actually completes.
So this change blocks the connection in EWOULDBLOCK state and
the connection, on compaction completion, gets notified to return SUCCESS
This is in anticipation of the removal of the MCCouch notification

Sundar,

The latest patch doesn't address my comments. Can you please take a look at them?

Line:1062, src/ep.cc -> This will be always true. If you want to make synchronous compaction optional, you may need to define an additional parameter in a request packet. If they only want to have synchronous compaction, you simply returns ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK at the end of this function.

Line:1108, src/ep.cc -> We should set engine_specific to NULL here.

Line:1111, src/ep.cc -> Same as above.

Thanks Chiyoung for the patch set. From what I understood from Artem, ns-server only plans to use the synchronous CMD_COMPACT_DB command.
