DESCRIPTION

CBD-485: Make COMPACT_DB call synchronous

NS-Server needs the COMPACT_DB command to block in ep-engine
until the compaction actually completes

So this change blocks the connection in EWOULDBLOCK state and
makes the compaction completion notify and return SUCCESS

This is in anticipation of the removal of the MCCouch notification
