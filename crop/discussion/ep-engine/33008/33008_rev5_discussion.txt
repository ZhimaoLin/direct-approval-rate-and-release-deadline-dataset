DESCRIPTION

CBD-485: Make CMD_COMPACT_DB call synchronous

NS-Server needs the CMD_COMPACT_DB command to block in ep-engine
until the compaction actually completes.
So this change blocks the connection in EWOULDBLOCK state and
the connection, on compaction completion, gets notified to return SUCCESS
This is in anticipation of the removal of the MCCouch notification
