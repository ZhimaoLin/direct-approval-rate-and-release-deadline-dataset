DESCRIPTION

MB-23590: Update del_with_meta to accept a value (xattrs)

Clients need to be able to perform del_with_meta with an xattr value
i.e. delete the document, but leave the xattrs.

This commit adds the simple functionality of setting a value but does
not add more extensive functionality where we need to consider pruning
user xattrs from the deleted document.

This commit is also flawed in that a subsequent set with cas following
the delete may succeed when it should not as the del_with_meta(xattr)
leaves the StoredValue in the HT marked as isDeleted where a
del_with_meta would remove it from the HT, giving a different result
to the subsequent set.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

(2 comments)

Line:5444, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Given this is the same in the setWithMeta case, nice to abstract it to a local variable.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> See also: MB-23530 (and James' proposed patch) - I think that's the same issue you describe here.
