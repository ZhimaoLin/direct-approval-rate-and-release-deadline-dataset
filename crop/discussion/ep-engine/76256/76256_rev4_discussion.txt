DESCRIPTION

MB-23590: Update del_with_meta to accept a value (xattrs)

Clients need to be able to perform del_with_meta with an xattr value
i.e. delete the document, but leave the xattrs.

This commit adds the simple functionality of setting a value but does
not add more extensive functionality where we need to consider pruning
user xattrs from the deleted document.

This commit is also flawed in that a subsequent set with cas following
the delete may succeed when it should not as the del_with_meta(xattr)
leaves the StoredValue in the HT marked as isDeleted where a
del_with_meta would remove it from the HT, giving a different result
to the subsequent set.
