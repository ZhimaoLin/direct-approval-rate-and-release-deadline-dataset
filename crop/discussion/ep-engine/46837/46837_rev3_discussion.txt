DESCRIPTION

MB-10370: Account for value size for mutation threshold

While estimating if a mutation will cause memory usage
to go over the mutation_memory_threshold, account for
value size, as large value sizes will easily push the
memory usage much over the threshold.

Line:636, src/stored-value.cc -> StoredValue only contains the pointer to the blob instance. Therefore while processing a SET, we will need to account for the value size along with the key size and the overhead to see if we'll go over the threshold.

Line:636, src/stored-value.cc -> I still don't think this will do anything. The blob has already been allocated and is accounted for in total memory used. We aren't copying anything since the pointer is ref counted. This is different from the key which is actually copied from the Item.

Line:636, src/stored-value.cc -> Abhinav,

I agree with Mike's comment. The value blob was already created and accounted in mem_used. So, I don't think we need this change.

Abandoned

This change is not necessary as memory is already accounted for the blob upon creation.
