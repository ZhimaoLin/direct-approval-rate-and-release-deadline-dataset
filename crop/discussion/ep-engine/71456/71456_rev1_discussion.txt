DESCRIPTION

MB-22145: Add missing cookie lock from EPStoreEvictionTest:MB_21976

The EPStoreEvictionTest:MB_21976 test changes the status of the cookie
to ENGINE_E2BIG so we can determine if notify is called (which will
change the status to ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET).

Changing the status of the cookie must be done with the cookie lock
held.
