DESCRIPTION

MB-17497: PersistenceCallback to delete an item only when required

When the persistence callback for a deleted item is
invoked by the flusher, the item in the hash table
that was soft deleted previously needs to be deleted
iff:
    1. Item that is existent in hash table has deleted flag set to true
    2. Item in hash table has seqno equal to the queued item in the
       persistence callback

I was going to comment that the commit message could do with expanding on this issue, discussing what the actual consequence of this bug is (items deleted which shouldn't be? Wrong sequence number in hashTable?) but it's already been submitted :(

Can you also create a unit test for this?

Patch Set 3:

A unit test is already in place: test_del_ret_meta, it just needs to be run in full eviction mode. I'm already in the process of editing CMakeLists to run the entire test suite in full eviction mode as part of "make test".
