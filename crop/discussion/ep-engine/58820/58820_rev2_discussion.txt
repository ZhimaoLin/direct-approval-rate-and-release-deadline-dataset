DESCRIPTION

MB-17497: PersistenceCallback to delete an item only when required

When the persistence callback for a deleted item is
invoked by the flusher, the item in the hash table
that was soft deleted previously needs to be deleted
iff:
    1. Item that is existent in hash table has deleted flag set to true
    2. Item in hash table has seqno equal to the queued item in the
       persistence callback
