DESCRIPTION

CBD 226 ep_engine has stat to monitor number of completed flush

This stat is used by XDCR with other ep_engine stat to check
if all XDCR items in check point queue have been persisted.
Starting with 0 at the time engine startsup, the stat increments
each time the flusher thread completes flushing all items
from check point queue.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:4154, ep_testsuite.cc -> Instead of restarting the engine here, you may want to perform more SET operations and then wait for flusher to complete and then check the stat to make sure that it should be greater than its previous value.

Line:58, docs/stats.org -> Description is not clear. Please give it a little more details. For example, "Number of times the flusher completes persisting all the items from checkpoint queues"

Line:116, flusher.hh -> Please move this to stats.hh as it makes more sense to be maintained in the engine stats class. Please also change its type to size_t
