DESCRIPTION

CBD 226 ep_engine has stat to monitor number of completed flush

This stat is used by XDCR with other ep_engine stat to check
if all XDCR items in check point queue have been persisted.
Starting with 0 at the time engine startsup, the stat increments
each time the flusher thread completes flushing all items
from check point queue.
