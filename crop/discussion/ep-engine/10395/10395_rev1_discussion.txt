does that needs to be abandoned ? Or it's still relevant?

Patch Set 1:

It's still relevant. Issue can be easily reproduced using mc_bin_client as follows. Set some item with flags=0x11223344. Get the revision using getRev. Then do setWithRev on the same item with the same value, flags=0x11223344 and revision returned on previous step. Memcached will return einval error. But if you pass flags=0x44332211 to setWithRev then it will succeed.

Line:328, item.hh -> Wouldn't this also affect decodeMeta? and probably also in setwithmeta where we do the conversion?

Line:328, item.hh -> decodeMeta converts flags to host byte order. This value is used only in setWithMeta. And it's compared there with flags from message body (also converted to host byte order). In other places it's just ignored. So it seems to be correct. But I can also make decodeMeta to not convert flags to host by order for consistency.
