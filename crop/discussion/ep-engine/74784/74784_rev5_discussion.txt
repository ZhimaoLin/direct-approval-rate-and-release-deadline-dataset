DESCRIPTION

MB-21488: DcpConsumer retry stream requests with previous FT entry

Add support to the DcpConsumer so that in the case it receives
a rollback to 0 request and there is more than 1 entry in the failover
table (FT), retry the stream request with the next entry in the table.

Stop retrying and do the rollback when:
1) Receive a non-zero rollback request or
2) Only 1 entry remains in the FT, rollback to where we're told.

Looks good - just a few minor comments.

Line:313, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Style: You can save yourself a few characters here by using `auto` - the type should be clear to the reader from the RHS.

Line:490, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Do we also need to verify that the VBucket *has* correctly been rolled back (and invalid data discarded?) - or is this handled elsewhere?

Line:228, src/dcp/consumer.h -> Nit: Probably more accurate to say producer (in theory one could have chained replicas).

Line:708, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Might be worth logging this case (if it isn't already) to help us debug any invalid responses.

Line:715, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Maybe just expand this to explicitly mention that we are retrying with the previous failover table entry?

Line:490, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Not quite that detailed in this test, I'll update though to see if I can verify some keys are now gone
