DESCRIPTION

MB-21488: DcpConsumer retry stream requests with previous FT entry

Add support to the DcpConsumer so that in the case it receives
a rollback to 0 request and there is more than 1 entry in the failover
table (FT), retry the stream request with the next entry in the table.

Stop retrying and do the rollback when:
1) Receive a non-zero rollback request or
2) Only 1 entry remains in the FT, rollback to where we're told.
