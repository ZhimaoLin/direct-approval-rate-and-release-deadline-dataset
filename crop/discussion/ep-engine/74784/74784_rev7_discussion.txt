DESCRIPTION

MB-21488: DcpConsumer retry stream requests with previous FT entry

Add support to the DcpConsumer so that in the case it receives
a rollback to 0 request and there is more than 1 entry in the failover
table (FT), retry the stream request with the next entry in the table.

Stop retrying and do the rollback when:
1) Receive a non-zero rollback request or
2) Only 1 entry remains in the FT, rollback to where we're told.

Removing +2 to take this off my "ready" list (as it needs rebasing).

Line:33, tests/mock/mock_synchronous_ep_engine.cc -> why 5?

Line:424, src/failover-table.cc -> should the R be inside double quotes?

Line:1435, src/dcp/stream.cc -> pass in lh, to enforce the function is only called with streamMutex held.
Also can then change name to just streamRequest.

Line:1462, src/dcp/stream.cc -> pass in lh to streamMutex

Line:523, src/dcp/stream.h -> pass in lh for streamRequest?

Line:33, tests/mock/mock_synchronous_ep_engine.cc -> Hi Jim, I did read the comment above, however wondered why you arrived at 5, and why this is sufficient room, i.e. why not 3 or 10?
