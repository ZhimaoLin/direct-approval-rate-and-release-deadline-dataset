DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Reduce printing of keys

This commit removes a number of places where the key was being
printed (to logs).

This commit also tidies some logging and makes some logging
more consistent and useful (print function names for example).

Upstream changes identified places where we print the key because
std::string was replaced.

1) It's a bad idea to print the keys as it's the user data.
2) A users key may not be printable or zero terminated (although
   std::string::c_str fixes the zero termination)

Any warning/info message should not print the key, debug level is ok
as that has to be enabled.

Where possible, a seqno/vb is printed instead of the raw key.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

We do have some cases here where we now just print that something is wrong (without including any information on how to locate the problematic key). What are "we" and support going to do when we see such an entry in the logs? Are all of those printouts "harmless" in the sense that we don't have to do further investigations?

Would it be better to have a special formatting of keys and include them in such cases, and given their format we can XXX them out before uploading the logs to us?

Line:1888, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't it be vb: ?

Line:1843, src/ep.cc -> but that may change in the future... It would probably be a good idea if we made a special format for how the keys would be written so that our scripts could "strip" them out before they're handed to us (and... are we sure the key is printable?

Line:282, src/checkpoint.cc -> So... If I ever find this message in the log... what will it tell me? (except that "something" is wrong)...

In general, it looks like a lot of the couch-kvstore logging is overkill, nearly every single error case has a LOG, we can probably get away with fewer messages and  use proper error return values and allow the upper code to log/retry etc...

Line:1888, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1843, src/ep.cc -> yeah, key: would be useful. Although turning on INFO in the future, we'll have plenty of other issues then, logs will probably be wrapped with some other messages :D

Line:282, src/checkpoint.cc -> This error feels like it should actually throw or return an error for the caller to handle, as in this case it returns 0 and i bet no caller checks for that. I wonder what will break higher up if this ever happened?
