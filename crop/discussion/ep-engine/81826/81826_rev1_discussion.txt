DESCRIPTION

MB-25509: Support calling fsync() peroidically during compaction

Add a new config param 'fsync_after_every_n_bytes_written'. When set
to a non-null value, configures couchstore to issue a sync() after
every N bytes of compaction data is written.

The default value has been set at 16MB - local testing with 1.5GB
vBucket files suggests this is a good tradeoff between bg fetch
latency and compaction write throughput:

    avg_bg_wait_time (no compaction):    50-100μs
    avg_bg_wait_time (compaction, 16MB): 50-200μs

For comparision, when run with no automatic sync():

    avg_bg_wait_time (compactionB): 100,000-300,000μs

The value can be configured at runtime via epctl - for example to set
a 1MB period:

    cbepctl -u Administrator -p asdasd localhost:12000 -b <bucket> set flush_param fsync_after_every_n_bytes_written 1048576

Note: Only the compactor is currently affected - other writers (access
log, flusher) don't yet use this parameter.
