DESCRIPTION

MB-3672 Fix to missing replica items caused by flush.

When the slave receives CHECKPOINT_START message with a new checkpoint
id c1, it should first locate the checkpoint from the checkpoint
list, whose id >= c1. If it exists, remove all the checkpoints from
there and then insert the new checkpoint with id c1.
