Patch Set 6:

(2 comments)

Line:810, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Slightly cheaper to take a reference instead of copying the string.

Line:6554, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Any chance you can read this from the configuration.json file?

Otherwise you'll have to Adrianna Holmesally update this test if/when the default value is changed. Ditto for the other thresholds below.
