DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: MB-23734: Handle DCP backfill failures

When a DCP backfill task is run there could be failures. We must handle
the failures gracefully.

This commit handles any failures in DCP backfill in Ephemeral buckets.
Upon a failure we close the stream and the DCP client can retry at
a later time.
