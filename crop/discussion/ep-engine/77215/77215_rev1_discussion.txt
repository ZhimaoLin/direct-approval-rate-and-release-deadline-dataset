DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: MB-23734: Handle DCP backfill failures

When a backfill task is run there could be failures in the DCP
backfill. We must handle the failures gracefully.

This commit handles any failures in DCP backfill in Ephemeral buckets.
Upon a failure we close the stream and the DCP client can retry at
a later time.
