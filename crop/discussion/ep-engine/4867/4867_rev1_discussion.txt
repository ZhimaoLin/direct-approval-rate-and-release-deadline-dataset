DESCRIPTION

Add all SYNC operations to the Python binary client

Now the mc_bin_client.MemcachedClient class has methods that
support all the SYNC command operations.
Key specifications are a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
represents a key specification and has the properties 'cas',
'vbucket', 'key' and 'event' (for responses only).
