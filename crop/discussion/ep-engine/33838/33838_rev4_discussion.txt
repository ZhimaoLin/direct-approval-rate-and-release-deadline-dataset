DESCRIPTION

Handle rollbacking back to zero

If a consumer needs to rollback to 0 then we return KEY_ENOENT. This
error code was not handled in the current code. When we see it we
now reset the vbucket that the stream request was sent for.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I didn't realize I push another patch-set. -1 until I resolve this. The enoent thing has been part of the protocol for a while, but I doubt people are really handling it. I think rollback to 0 makes more sense too so I'll change it and notify people.
