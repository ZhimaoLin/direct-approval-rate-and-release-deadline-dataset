DESCRIPTION

Handle rollbacking back to zero

If a consumer needs to rollback to 0 then we return KEY_ENOENT. This
error code was not handled in the current code. When we see it we
now reset the vbucket that the stream request was sent for.

Line:299, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I don't think this return code makes sense. If we want the client to rollback to zero, then we should have status "ENGINE_ROLLBACK" and rollback_seq_num 0
