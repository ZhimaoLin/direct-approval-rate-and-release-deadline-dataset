DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary RCPtr<> from CheckpointManager methods

There are a number of CheckpointManager methods which take parameters
via RCPtr<VBucket> where the method doesn't need a ref-counted pointer
- the lifetime of the object is not extended or changed in any way.

As per C++ Core Guidelines[1] R.30, don't use a smart pointer in these
cases. This also makes it easier for subclasses of VBucket
(e.g. EphemeralVBucket) to be passed to these methods.
