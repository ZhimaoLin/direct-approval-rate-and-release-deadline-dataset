DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite: Add a maximum wait time to wait_for...

For the various wait_for_stat_{to_be,changed} etc methods, add a
maximum time to wait for, defaulting to 60s. If the stat does not
reach the desired value in that time, abort() the test.

This makes it quicker to detect test failures - instead of waiting
forever (and having to hit some external whole test run timeout).
