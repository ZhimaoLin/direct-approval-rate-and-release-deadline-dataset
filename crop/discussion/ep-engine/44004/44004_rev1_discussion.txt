DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite: Add a maximum wait time to wait_for...

For the various wait_for_stat_{to_be,changed} etc method, add a
maximum time to wait for (defaulting to 60s). If the stat does not
reach the desired value in that time, abort().

This makes it quicker to detect test failures - instead of waiting
forever (and having to hit some external whole test run timeout).
