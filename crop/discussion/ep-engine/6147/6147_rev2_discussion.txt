DESCRIPTION

Log disconnected transfer streams at a higher level.

These are important and should be visible in the in-product logs.

Alternatively, we should have more granular logging control.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

We should have another kind of category for such kinds of notifications... Looks "weird" with a warning for something that is normal to do...

Patch Set 2:

I agree it looks weird.  Maybe we should adjust everything down so we can run at INFO normally.  Then it'd be INFO/DEBUG instead of WARN/INFO.  It's definitely not a warning, but well worth logging.

Yeah.. that would also affect the memcached core, but it's only source :)
