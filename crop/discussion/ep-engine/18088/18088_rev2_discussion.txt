Patch Set 2: (4 inline comments)



Line:272, stats.hh -> rename it to tapRefItems?

Line:2039, ep.cc -> I expect this function should be invoked from the access scanner, but looks like it isn't.

Line:207, docs/stats.org -> Please change the stat name to vb_active_num_ref_items as "nru" stands for "never recently used". Same to the rest of new stats.

Line:306, docs/stats.org -> I don't think we need this stat because replica ref stats already show the ref bit is propagated. We should be more conservative in adding new stats as they are all overhead.
