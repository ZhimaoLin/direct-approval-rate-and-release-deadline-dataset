Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Roman Murillo, please look at my comments. I think it will be better to merge this change with your new item paging algorithm later. Please also remove the tap ref stat when this change is ready for review and merge.

Line:86, stored-value.hh -> Please move this function body to the source file and decrement the nru stats if reset is passed as true.

Line:1533, stored-value.hh -> We don't need this function. The nru stats should be decremented whenever an item's ref bit is reset to false.

Line:689, ep.hh -> We don't need this function.

Line:48, access_scanner.cc -> I think this is wrong. We shouldn't reset the nru stats here, but need to decrement the nru stats within StoredValue::isRefereneced function.
