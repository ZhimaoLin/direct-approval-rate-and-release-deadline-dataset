Line:3629, src/ep.cc -> Shouldn't this type of thing happen in the clear() function?

Line:3629, src/ep.cc -> If you mean to ask that if it isn't already in the current implementation, I don't see where we are doing it currently.

Or if you mean to say that, that is where I should be adding this code, I'll need to pass the vbucket object to checkpoint manager. I thought this looked more cleaner.

Also this fix solved the problem.

Line:3629, src/ep.cc -> Even I think decrement should happen in clear().

Currently seems like the only other place where we call clear(), is in ep reset() and there we call vb->resetStats() immediately afterwards.

In future we may have multiple code locations calling checkpointManager.clear(). It would be better to have 
vb->decrDirtyQueueSize(currentDqSize);
stats.decrDiskQueueSize(currentDqSize);
inside the clear func than have them subsequently at every place.
(This approach would also be less prone to bugs due to oversight)
