Line:485, src/checkpoint.h -> Maybe a good thing to update this clear() as well

Line:485, src/checkpoint.h -> Reset calls this clear(), and then calls resetStats() right after. Now since we already clear the diskWriteQueue as part of that it would make it redundant if I add code to clear the diskWriteQueue here.

On the other hand, I don't think all the code from resetStats should be added here, as clearing the checkpoints would only be affecting the diskWriteQueue and not the stats that are reset as part of resetStats.
