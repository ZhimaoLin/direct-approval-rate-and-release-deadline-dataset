DESCRIPTION

MB-22163: Keep the items datatype in the StoredValue object

This allows get_if to create partial items with the datatype
set to the actal value without having to fetch the actual
value off disk.

This patch does not try to change the actual item representation
of the datatype, as that would require on-disk format changes
and upgrade tasks.
