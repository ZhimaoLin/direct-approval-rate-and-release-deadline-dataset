DESCRIPTION

MB-19627: Log the actual last seqno sent before closing the stream.

When a DCP stream closes, we log the last sent seqno at the time when
stream transitions to dead state. However, we further stream items in
the readyQ from  dead state as well. This commit adds the correct
last seqno sent.

Line:899, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Can we find out the last seq no that will be sent? Remaining items is less useful. If the other message is always sent regardless then perhaps it doesn't matter so much - would be good if you can comment on that.

Line:899, src/dcp/stream.cc -> The other message is always sent regardless.
It may not be very clean to get the last sequence always, as the last item in the DCP readyQ may not have seqno at times. Then we will have to read the readyQ backwards to find the lastSentSeqno.

Line:899, src/dcp/stream.cc -> OK - in that case I think it's fine. The other message is way more important than this one frankly. I really care about the full report of the sent snapshot; this intermediate update at the time we enode end stream is less interesting and I think what you have here is fine. Will let the other guys +2 you for correctness.

Line:899, src/dcp/stream.cc -> I question whether we need to keep this log message since the new one does exactly what this one was intended to do and we already print a lot of DCP log messages as it as. Can you provide a reason for when this might be useful during debugging?

Line:899, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Will be useful to debug only if we make an error in streaming items from dead state.

I retried it a few times got consistent Windows failures. I'm currently checking out and building on my local Windows VM...

Line:902, src/dcp/stream.cc -> %z (for size_t) isn't supported on MSVC. You'll need to cast remaining items to uint64_t and use PRIu64.

Will keep it in mind for future changes.
