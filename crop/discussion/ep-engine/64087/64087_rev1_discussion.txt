DESCRIPTION

MB-19627: Log the actual last seqno sent before closing the stream.

When a DCP stream closes, we log the last sent seqno at the time when
stream transitions to dead state. However, we further stream items in
the readyQ from  dead state as well. This commit adds the correct
last seqno sent.

Line:527, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Can we add information similar to what's included in the logging done in endStream()? That is. how many backfill and memory items were sent.

Line:895, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Can we make this message less misleading? We should definitely tell folks what the last sequence number we're planning to send is. Good to leave what the last seq number actually sent was. Not sure if the # of items sent from backfill and # of items sent from memory are very valuable if they're better logged in deadPhase(), but probably ok to leave.
