DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move bgFetch and queueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::queueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto checkpoint
after it is inserted into hash table. Both hash table and checkpoint are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

BgFetch is scheduled in full eviction mode when there is a miss in hash
table lookup. As hash table is contained in VBucket it is more appropriate
to implement this function in VBucket class.

Implementing these functions in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.
