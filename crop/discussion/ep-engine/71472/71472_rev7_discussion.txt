DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move bgFetch() from KVBucket to VBucket

BgFetch is scheduled in full eviction mode when there is a miss in hash
table lookup. As hash table is contained in VBucket it is more appropriate
to implement this function in VBucket class.

Implementing this function in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:799, src/vbucket.cc -> Follow-up: this should probably be a owning pointer (unique_ptr<>) which is passed into queueBGFetchItem - and then have bgfetch_itm_ctx.bgfetched_list be a container of unique_ptrs<>

Line:813, src/vbucket.cc -> Given both the engine and bgFetchDelay arguments to the VBucket constructor only exist for this one call (to create this Task), it would probably be cleaner to instead pass in a lambda capture to the constructor - something like createSingleBGFetcherTask() - which encapsulates this logic.

Line:558, src/vbucket.h -> Nit: extra whitespace.

Line:813, src/vbucket.cc -> Actually, ignore this (for now) - I see some follow-up patches also use engine to create other tasks.

We should probably think if VBucket is the best place to create such background tasks though...

Line:799, src/vbucket.cc -> ok will do in next commit

Line:813, src/vbucket.cc -> I think VBucket is the right place. 
Actually engine is not necessary to create tasks. Just 'Taskable' is enough

Line:558, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:799, src/vbucket.cc -> Actually not next commit, vb_bgfetch_item_ctx_t is in more places than just vbucket.cc.
So will refactor in future
