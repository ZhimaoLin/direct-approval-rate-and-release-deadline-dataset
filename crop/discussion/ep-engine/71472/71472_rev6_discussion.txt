DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move bgFetch() from KVBucket to VBucket

BgFetch is scheduled in full eviction mode when there is a miss in hash
table lookup. As hash table is contained in VBucket it is more appropriate
to implement this function in VBucket class.

Implementing this function in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Line:132, src/vbucket.cc -> No need to add another argument to VBucket - just use the kvshard argument to figure it out in the class constructor:

 kvshard->getROUnderlying->getStorageProperties.hasEfficientGet();
