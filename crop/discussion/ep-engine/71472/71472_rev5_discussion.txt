DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move bgFetch and queueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

BgFetch is scheduled in full eviction mode when there is a miss in hash
table lookup. As hash table is contained in VBucket it is more appropriate
to implement this function in VBucket class.

Implementing this function in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Line:628, src/vbucket.h -> Just turn this into a const member (variable) and set it in the constructor - it will never change once the VBucket is created.
