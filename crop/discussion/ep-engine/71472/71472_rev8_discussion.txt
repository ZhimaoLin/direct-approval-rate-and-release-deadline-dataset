DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move bgFetch() from KVBucket to VBucket

BgFetch is scheduled in full eviction mode when there is a miss in hash
table lookup. As hash table is contained in VBucket it is more appropriate
to implement this function in VBucket class.

Implementing this function in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Line:186, src/vbucket.cc -> This is kinda ugly. I suspect it's what clang formats produced but sometimes you can trick it into producing something more sane by explicitly inserting line breaks early. Just a guess, but sticking the first `kvshard` immediately onto the line below might result in something less messy. If it won't produce anything else then it's probably ok.

Line:802, src/vbucket.cc -> Do you need to check if `shard` is null? I think every other usage of `shard` in vbucket checks it since some unit tests don't give the vbucket a shard (not that calling this method makes much sense if it doesn't have a shard).

As per Will's comment, I think we need the nullptr check on shard or we would seg.

Line:802, src/vbucket.cc -> +1

Line:186, src/vbucket.cc -> This was indeed by clang-formating.
It is not allowing me another way easily.

Line:802, src/vbucket.cc -> Done
