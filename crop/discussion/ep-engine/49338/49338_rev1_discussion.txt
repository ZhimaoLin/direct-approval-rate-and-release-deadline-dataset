Line:30, src/kvstore.h -> I think we can move these inclusions to kvstore.cc as the header file doesn't refer any functions defined in these header files.

Line:621, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Why is this field moved here? This will break the order of field initialization in constructors.
