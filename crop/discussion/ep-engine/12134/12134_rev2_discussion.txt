DESCRIPTION

Don't create a dummy value for each item backfilled from memory.

The value of an item backfilled from memory is actually retrieved
from hash table when it is replicated. Therefore, we don't need to
create its dummy value instance when pushed into the TAP queue.
Creation of a dummy value instance consumes 8 bytes.
