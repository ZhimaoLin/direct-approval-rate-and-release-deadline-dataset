DESCRIPTION

MB-4461 collapse multiple closed checkpoints into one checkpoint.

If persistence or replication is very slow on replica vbuckets,
this would cause memory usage to grow continuously because the
number of checkpoints can increase over the time. To address
this issue, this change supports merging multiple checkpoints
into one checkpoint on replica vbuckets.
