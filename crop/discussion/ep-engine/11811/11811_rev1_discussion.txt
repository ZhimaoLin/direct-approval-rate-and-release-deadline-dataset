DESCRIPTION

MB-4461 collapse multiple closed checkpoints into one checkpoint.

If persistence or replication is very slow on replica vbuckets,
this would cause memory usage to grow continuously because the
number of checkpoints can increase over the time. To address
this issue, this change supports merging multiple checkpoints
into one checkpoint on replica vbuckets.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Two minor things I noticed. One is a performance improvement and the other is to possibly save us from introducing a bug in the future. Overall though this looks good.

Line:116, checkpoint.cc -> I feel like this can cause errors in the future if we introduce more meta items to a checkpoint. I'd like to suggest this is done more intelligently (eg. iterate until we don't have a meta item). I'm okay either way though.

Line:593, checkpoint.cc -> Note: This seems like it would perform better if we collapsed checkpoints in the opposite direction. For example, if we collapsed cp2 into cp1 and then cp3 into (cp1/cp2) then we would almost always be moving less items around plus we wouldn't have to move the checkpoint cursors.

+2'ing since it looks like I'm the only reviewer.

Line:116, checkpoint.cc -> Good suggestion. I will adapt it now.

Line:593, checkpoint.cc -> I understand what you mentioned here. But, that doesn't always reduce the overhead. We merge the previous checkpoint c2 into the current checkpoint c3 by prepending the unique items from c2 into c3 and then repositioning  all the cursors sitting on c2 to the beginning of C2 so that they can first send the checkpoint_start c3 to the destination.
