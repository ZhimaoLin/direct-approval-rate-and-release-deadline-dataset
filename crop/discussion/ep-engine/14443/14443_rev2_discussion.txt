Patch Set 2:

But ns_server can already poll this data.  You're just rolling it up a bit.  Providing the raw data only means that the consumer can decide the window(s) at which we want to understand the rates.

Regarding metrics, Boundary released "folsom" which implements that such that we can drop our raw stats into it and report on 1, 5, 15 minute rates pretty much out of the box.  In his demo, he also showed instantaneous vectors showing how much worse (or better) a particular metric is getting over the designated timeslot. https://github.com/boundary/folsom

But most importantly, you can't do this from a rolling average.

Patch Set 2:

Yeah, the ns-server can get the histograms and use them for showing some useful metrics. Folsom looks interesting, and definitely can be used in the ns-server. Let me drop this change as the ns-server can easily calculate it.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

Drop this change as it can be also extracted from the ns-server by polling histograms.
