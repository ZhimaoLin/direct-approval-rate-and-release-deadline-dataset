fragmentation.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Histogram already tracks this data, so you just need a new method.

However, I don't think it's very useful for this task because it's a global average and loses relevance before it helps with fragmentation.

I think looking into Coda Hale's "metrics" as a model for how to help our stats out would be quite beneficial.

Patch Set 1:

Thanks for good comments. I definitely agree that the global average seek distance won't provide the accurate indication for the sqlite fragmentation.

As one of the alternatives, I was thinking that the fragmentation can be roughly estimated by measuring the read data size and read seek distance while a vbucket table is scanned for backfill. But, obviously, this approach has some limitations as well.

Anyway, this change just allows the ns-server to poll and display the average read/write seek distance over the time to help them understand what's going on sqlite write paths. I'm not familiar with Coda Hale metrics, but will look at it to see if we can leverage it easily. Given that the code complete for 1.8.1 is today, we can consider Codahale metrics for 1.8.2 release.

If you think this change doesn't give us any values for 1.8.1, I'm totally fine with abandoning it.
