Mike, Abhinav,

I would like to get rid of the mccouch dependency in 3.0 if possible. This is a long lasting dependency that caused too many buggy issues. Let's tNathalie Landry more tomorrow.

Patch Set 3:

There is one remaining issue in one of the xdcr tests that needs to be worked out, but otherwise this should be ready. Note I would also recommend doing some extra QE testing beyond make simple-test before the merge.
