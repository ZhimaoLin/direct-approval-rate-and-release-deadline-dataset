DESCRIPTION

Add 'exp_pager_enabled' configuration option

Currently the expiry pager can only be disabled by setting
exp_pager_stime to zero - as this value is special-cased to mean
"never run". However it is sometimes helpful (e.g. in unit tests) to
be able to specify an actual sleep time of zero, so the that the
expiry pager /always/ runs.

Therefore add a new option 'exp_pager_enabled' to explicitly
enable/disable the expiry pager; this then frees up the 'magic' zero
value to actually be used to set the sleep time to zero.
