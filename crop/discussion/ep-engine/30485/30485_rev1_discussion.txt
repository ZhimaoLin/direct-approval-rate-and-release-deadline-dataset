DESCRIPTION

MB-9585: Add support for upr stats

This change refactors the TAP stats related functions and added
UPR support. Client such as cbstats should be able to retrieve
"upr" or "upragg" stats. We'll add comprehensive stats for UPR
later on. Also modified some upr test cases that depends on stats.

Line:3450, src/ep_engine.cc -> It seems to me that this function is mostly same as the above doTapAggStats(...). Can we have only one function like "doConnAggStats(...)" and pass the connection type (TAP or UPR) if necessary?

Line:36, src/common.h -> This might be conflict with the fix from Trond. Please check it again.
