Line:576, ep_engine.h -> One concern here is that if we run "memcached + ep_engine" as a standalone process without ns-server management, the engine can't process any requests from the client until we Adrianna Holmesally send ENABLE_TRAFFIC command to the engine. We need to provide a way of enabling it for the standalone engine.
