Line:40, src/common.h -> I personally consider it bad practice to have "using" clauses in header files - as it means that #including a file can change what scope things in the .cc file have.

I know the existing code does this (and I'm not suggesting you change all that in this patch), but I would suggest not adding any more "using" clauses to headers if at all possible.
