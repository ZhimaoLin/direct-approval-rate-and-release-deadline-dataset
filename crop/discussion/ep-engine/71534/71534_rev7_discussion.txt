DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move tapQueueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::tapQueueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto vb queue
after it is inserted into hash table. Since hash table and vb queue are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:937, src/kv_bucket.h -> Nit: Seems pretty unnecessary to pass a uint16_t as a const reference - you're passing something as a 8 byte value which is only 2 bytes in size! Would be simpler to just pass as uint_16_t.
