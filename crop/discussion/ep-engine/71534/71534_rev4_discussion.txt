DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move tapQueueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::tapQueueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto vb queue
after it is inserted into hash table. Since hash table and vb queue are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

Line:764, src/vbucket.cc -> Nit: I'd probably just inline this into the callback() call directly (not sure it gives much adding an extra line).
