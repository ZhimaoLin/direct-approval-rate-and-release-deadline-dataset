DESCRIPTION

Add factory method createVBucket()

vbucket approprate for the object's bucket type. For KVBucket
(EPBucket) this is simply 'VBucket'; for ephemeral bucket this will be
a different class.

(5 comments)

Line:4021, src/kv_bucket.cc -> I recommend chucking this through `git-clang-format` (should be included with `brew install clang-format`) as I think the clang-format config dictates one argument per line.

Line:965, src/kv_bucket.h -> nit: Prefer two asterisks '/**' to open a docblock describing a function as otherwise doxygen ignores it.

Line:967, src/kv_bucket.h -> nit: In C++ terminology the preferred word is probably 'make' rather than 'create'

Line:970, src/kv_bucket.h -> One parameter per line please

Line:976, src/kv_bucket.h -> Should this be a virtual method?

Line:965, src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:967, src/kv_bucket.h -> Prefer DaveR or JimW or Trond to second this.
(Since you have said "probably" and also I wasn't able to verify it upon googling)

Line:970, src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:976, src/kv_bucket.h -> Not yet.
Made virtual in a subsequent commit where child classes do createVBucket in different ways.
Actually will define this as a virtual method in kv_bucket_iface.h file
