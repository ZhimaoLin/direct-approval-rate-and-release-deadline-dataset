DESCRIPTION

Add factory method makeVBucket()

Add a new method to KVBucket  named makeVBucket(), which creates a
vbucket approprate for the object's bucket type. For KVBucket
(EPBucket) this is simply 'VBucket'; for ephemeral bucket this will be
a different class.

Note: Version with two versions of makeVBucket().

Patch Set 9:

v10 goes back to the single makeVBucket() method (after v9 experiment). This is my proposed impl going forward.
