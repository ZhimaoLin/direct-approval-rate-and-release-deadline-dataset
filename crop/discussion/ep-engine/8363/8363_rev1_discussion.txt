DESCRIPTION

Send NOOP messages if the time since the last message sent exceeds

Instead of sending NOOP messages periodically, we can schedule NOOP
messages and send them to the downstream server if the time since
the last message sent exceeds the TAP noop interval.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

We should probably also move the ownership of the tap noop interval variable to tapconmap at some point.

I will rebase and adapt your commit and push it later. Thanks!
