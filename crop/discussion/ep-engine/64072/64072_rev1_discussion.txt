DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Fix ConnMap so notifications don't go missing.

Previous patch[1] cleared the isNotificationScheduled flag
at the wrong place and meant things could then never
again get scheduled.

This is because we only cleared the flag if tp->isPaused()
yet we still pop the notification from the queue, so we
left tp->isNotificationScheduled yet the queue is empty.
Now no more notifications will ever get scheduled!

So we need to clear the notification scheduled boolean
unconditionally of the other flags on tp.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: The title is identical to the previous patch - maybe add a [2] or similar to make it easier for us to distinguish them in `git hist` etc.

Is there a test for this? (In an upstream branch?)

Line:257, src/connmap.cc -> note that i'm not using the return val here in the next if statement, because i'm assuming that if you're in the pendingNotifications queue you want a notification...
