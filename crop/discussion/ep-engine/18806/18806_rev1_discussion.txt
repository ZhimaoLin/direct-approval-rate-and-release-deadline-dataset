Line:3827, ep_engine.cc -> I was just looking what's going to be changed here and spotted this.

Apparently you want this sent back and perhaps logged. But sending it to stdout is apparently outlawed in this part of the code. No?

Thanks for pointing this out. Also this isn't ready for review yet.

Patch Set 1:

I've already explained to Mike that I'm massively confused by that.

My guess is we're trying to move conflict resolution into ep-engine and instead of get-meta we wan't "do you want this revision" command. Or something like that.

I'm nobody to object against overloading get-meta with different meaning. But I cannot implement new get-meta in ns_server without being able to understand and, most importantly, test.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Mike, 

Change in ep_engine.cc seems unrelated to CBD-359. Also, why do we use standard output to dump error msg? 


Chnages in ep_testsuit seems more like a refactoring. Is it better to put it another commit?   Thanks.
