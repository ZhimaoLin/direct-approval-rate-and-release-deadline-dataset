Consider this a late -2 :)

Please raise a follow-up to fix the time unit problems.

Line:2225, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Similar, should be microseconds.

Line:68, src/bgfetcher.cc -> This is incorrect - gethrtime() returns time in nanoseconds, not microseconds. As such you've changed the unit of the value printed here.

(Admittedly this is only a debug log message so doesn't really matter, but see below...)

Line:89, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Incorrect - the previous value was in microseconds.
