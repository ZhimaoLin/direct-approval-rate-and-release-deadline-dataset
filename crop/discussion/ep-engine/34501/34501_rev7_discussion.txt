Line:352, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> If there is no cached VBucket state at this point then we should create one.

Line:389, src/vbucket.h -> I know this is a minor comment, but I would prefer to keep functions above variable declarations in classes. Otherwise it might end up being hard to locate all of the variable declarations since I usually look at the end of the class.

Line:931, src/ep.cc -> No need to unlock. This will happen automatically when we break out of the loop.

Line:940, src/ep.cc -> Don't need to unlock here either since we will automatically unlock when we change scope.

Line:1122, src/ep.cc -> vbid is no longer used

Line:2550, src/ep.cc -> No need to unlock. This will happen automatically.

Line:10654, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we remove this comment?
