DESCRIPTION

CBD-471 Allow JSON values, not only JSON objects

The cJSON parser we use will accept any JSON value already, so we only
need to remove the check for {.

Patch Set 1:

I think this code lacks check of premature 0 byte. Which will incorrectly mark some blobs as json.

Patch Set 1:

Ah, true. This code will accept <valid JSON><NUL><arbitrary blob> as a JSON value. I think the old code would've had this problem too though.

Not sure the best way to fix this. We could scan the input for 0 bytes and mark it non-JSON if we see any. Which is probably fine as long as noone expects us to accept UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoded JSON.
