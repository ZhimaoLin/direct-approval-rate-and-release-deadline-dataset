DESCRIPTION

Move BG Fetch related logic to EPVBucket from VBucket

BG(background) Fetch is an operation needed only in persistant bucket
and mostly with full_eviction policy. Ephemeral buckets do not have
BF fetch hence do not support functions related to BG fetch.

This commit only moves the BG Fetch related logic in VBucket to
EPVBucket. There maybe other modules like 'KVBucket' class which will
be handled later.
