DESCRIPTION

Add a buffer lock to the backfill manager to lower lock contention

When doing changes to the buffer size we only need to lock when
actually changing the buffer. This removes a potential issue in
doing somehting incorrect with a backfill while it is running
because we no longer need to lock and unlock it to run it.
