DESCRIPTION

MB-20105: Ensure purge_seq is not reset when no items are purged in a compaction

When a compaction request is made, we initially set the purge_seqno in the req
to 0, hoping to update it when we purge items. However, if there are no purged
items in a compaction call, then we end up reseting the purge_seqno
(correct one) set by the previous compaction call.

This commit addresses the problem by setting the purge seqno in the request
to current purge seqno in the ep-engine.
