DESCRIPTION

MB-20105: Ensure purge_seq is not reset when no items are purged in a compaction

When a compaction request is made, we initially set the purge_seqno in the req
to 0, hoping to update it when we purge items. However, if there are no purged
items in a compaction call, then we end up reseting the purge_seqno
(correct one) set by the previous compaction call.

This commit addresses the problem by setting the purge seqno in the request
to current purge seqno in the ep-engine.

Line:2630, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This test is now getting pretty long (over 100 lines). It would be preferred to split this into two cases - the original case, and a second "compact when nothing is purged" case. 

(In general a single testcase could try to test just one thing).

Final note: We /do/ now have the class-level unit tests - evp_store_test - in 3.0.x. If you wish (I'll let you decide) you could instead make the new test use that. This would givie you richer GTest-style tests, and will probably be faster to execute also...

Line:1225, src/ep.cc -> I think it would be better (have weaker coupling) if we modified VBucket::setPurgeSeqno() to only update if the new value is higher - i.e. rename to `updatePurgeSeqno` and make it set `purge_seqno` to std::max(current_purge_seqno, new_value).

I think this is especially true when considering forward-merges (and forestDB), as in master there isn't a single max_purge_seqno the compaction_ctx, but instead one per vbucket_id.

(Or another way to look at it - the compaction process itself *is* correctly reporting the maximum purge seqno it happened to find during a single compaction scan - but we should interpret that value correctly when updating the running total per vBucket).

Line:1225, src/ep.cc -> This has one caveat.
http://10.5.2.251/source/xref/3.x/ep-engine/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc#720
We will have to update the correct max_purged_seqno in the db header here. Otherwise after compaction_with_purge ==> compaction_without_purge ==> warmup, we will end up resetting the purge_seqno of a particular vb.

That can be fixed in 
1) Have another callback to ep_store/vbucket and get correct purge_seqno
2) Modify couchstore (http://10.5.2.251/source/xref/3.x/couchstore/src/db_compact.cc#312) appropriately so that there is no decrease in the purge seqno.

Should we go with (1) or (2) or with the currently proposed way ?
