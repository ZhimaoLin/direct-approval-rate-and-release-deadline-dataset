DESCRIPTION

MB-8581

Added a loadingData step after loadingAccessLog to meet warmup watermarks.
In the loadingAccessLog phase we save the keys of the items that are warmedup
and pass them to the loadingData phase. We then only load items that are
not already loaded earlier.

Added a test case for this feature.

Line:515, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Please remove tap white spaces.

Line:1346, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> After reviewing this change carefully, I realized that the memory overhead of the map instance will be quite huge if the node has a large number of items before warmup. I think we can mitigate this issue by simply looking up the vbucket hash table to see if a given item is already loaded or not.

For this, we need to define "isLoaded(const std::string &key, uint16_t vbid)" to LoadStorageKVPairCallback class and call that function within this if clause. We need to explicit cast the callback instance to LoadStorageKVPairCallback.
