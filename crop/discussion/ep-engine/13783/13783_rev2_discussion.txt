DESCRIPTION

mb-4857 avoid accessing uninitialized map data

A map table in InvalidItemDbPager class is not initialized correctly
during warmup phase. The table is supposed to be populated if data
are rebalanced from other nodes. Since it is a brand new cluster without
any data, the map table should not be processed.
