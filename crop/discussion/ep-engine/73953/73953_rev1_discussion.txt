DESCRIPTION

MB-22513: Only calculate hash bucket once

In codepaths that call HashTable::unlocked_addNewStoredValue, we often
find the hash bucket at some point earlier in the path and then again in
HashTable::unlocked_addNewStoredValue. Therefore we end up calculating
the hash twice.

We change HashTable::unlocked_addNewStoredValue to not calculate the
hash bucket and instead have it passed in as an argument. This requires
some changes earlier in the call path which is what the bulk of this
commit is.
