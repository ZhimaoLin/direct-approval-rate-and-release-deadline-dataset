Line:71, src/failover-table.cc -> Why do we need to decrement it by "-1"?

Line:86, src/failover-table.cc -> It seems to me that we just need to set the upper to cur_seqno if I understand this logic correctly.

Line:71, src/failover-table.cc -> That got left in on accident. I have remove this line.

Line:86, src/failover-table.cc -> This isn't always true because if the vbucket uuid is at the current sequence number is different then we may need to roll the other side back further. We can discuss this more is you would like.
