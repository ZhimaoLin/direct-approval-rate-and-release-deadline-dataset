Honestly, this failover-table is quite bad in terms of design and implementation. I don't understand exactly what we're trying to do it with this table.

Line:48, src/failover-table.cc -> This function is very vulnerable because it requires the caller to invoke "needRollback()" first.

Line:79, src/failover-table.cc -> This won't be true at all

Line:89, src/failover-table.cc -> I'm quite confused with this logic with the above findRollbackPoint function. Can we consolidate these two functions in a simple and concise manner so that we can understand it easily?
