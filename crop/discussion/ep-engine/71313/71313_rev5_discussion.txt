DESCRIPTION

MB-16337: Fix for intermittent test_access_scanner failure (followup)

The original fix for this MB (d06d7adc) made an error in setting the
alog_task_time - it set it just before the engine was reloaded, where
the config will get re-parsed again and hence the updated value is ignored.

Fix by passing the new alog_task_time as part of the config string
when reloading the engine.
