DESCRIPTION

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose values are
resident in memory. This limitation is because, at present, the
datatypes are stored with the values.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(8 comments)

Line:2937, src/ep_engine.cc -> we generally use "ii" so that easier if searching

Line:2937, src/ep_engine.cc -> why 8?

Line:3552, src/ep_engine.cc -> see comments above

Line:72, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> state what you are checking..e.g. checking that they are initialised to zero?

Line:263, src/hash_table.h -> make a WARNING if not supposed to ever happen.
What about throwing an exception?

Line:268, src/hash_table.h -> could you simplify the while loop?
maybe:

bool decremented = false;
while (!decremented) {
    count = datatypeCounts[datatype].load();
    decremented = datatypeCounts[datatype].compare_exchange_strong(count,  count - 1)
}

Line:595, src/hash_table.h -> why 8?

Line:206, src/ep_engine.h -> why 8?

Line:263, src/hash_table.h -> I've matched this to the other methods already present such as decrNumNonRedidentItems, decrNumItems, etc
I think if we change one we should change the others to maintain consistency
