DESCRIPTION

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose values are
resident in memory. This limitation is because, at present, the
datatypes are stored with the values.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.
