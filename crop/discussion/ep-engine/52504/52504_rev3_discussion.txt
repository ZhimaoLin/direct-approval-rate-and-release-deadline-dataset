Line:4460, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please get the threshold from the engine stats instead of hard-coding it here.

Line:4486, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> What "4" means in a flag? If we already have a macro for this, can we use it instead?

Patch Set 3:

(2 comments)

Line:4460, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This is no specific threshold. The intention is to load data until 90% of the mem quota is used.

Line:4486, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> 4 indicates END_STREAM_SLOW, enum declared in dcp/stream.h, I didn't want to include dcp/stream.h in the testsuite context.
