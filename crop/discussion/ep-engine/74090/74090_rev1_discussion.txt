DESCRIPTION

MB-22938: Wake threads before joining them

Dynamically changing the number of threads involved setting their state
to stopped and then joining them - we should also wake them to avoid
having to block while the thread sleeps for MIN_SLEEP_TIME before
rechecking its status.

Do we create a simple unit test for this?

Patch Set 1:

Unsure of the best way to unit test this - checking for "real" time duration would catch the obvious case but feels vulnerable to false negatives - and could fail if MIN_SLEEP_TIME is changed; could check that the mutex the threads are waiting on gets notify_all'd - I'd guess that would then need a multithreaded test, but seems cleanest
