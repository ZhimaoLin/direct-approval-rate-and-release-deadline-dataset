DESCRIPTION

StoredValue: record deleted time for OSVs

For OrderedStoredValues, record the time when they are deleted, so
deleted OSVs can later be purged (completely deleted) when they reach
a certain age.

To avoid adding another 4bytes to OSV, the lock_expiry member is
re-used to also be used for the deleted time (deleted items cannot be
locked and hence this is otherwise unused once items enter that
state).
