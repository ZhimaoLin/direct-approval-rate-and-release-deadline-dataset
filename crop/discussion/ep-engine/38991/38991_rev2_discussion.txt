Line:387, src/upr-consumer.cc -> This is the only one-time message that we don't need to check in step function. Can we send it to the producer as part of stream establishment?

Line:387, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Then, can we send it to the producer when the producer / consumer are established? It is not good to check it for every step function.

Line:387, src/upr-consumer.cc -> It has to happen in the step function because that's the only place we get the producers callbacks. The alternative would be to have some sort of message queue for control messages. I can also add the flow control message to this queue, but at the end of the day we would still need to check to see if the queue was empty each time we called the step function.

I disagree and don't understand why "step" is the only place for producer callbacks. We can change the internal UPR APIs without breaking anythings.

My concern is that the step function will be disorganized if we keep adding this kind of stuffs in the future. Now, we check the flow control, and then noop, and then finally check the message queue, which will make it the code difficult to understand and maintain in the future.
