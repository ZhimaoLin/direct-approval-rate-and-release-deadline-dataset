DESCRIPTION

Add synchronous EPStoreTests - GetKeyStats tests

Add tests for EPStore::getKeyStats, both for full eviction and value
eviction.

These tests use a new Test base class (EventuallyPersistentStoreTest)
and mocks which set up EPEngine / Store in a synchronous mode, so
normally background tasks can be explicitly triggered as desired.

This allows testing of things like a 2nd request for a non-resident
key (triggering EWOULDBLOCK) without the non-determinism of the
BGFetcher task running in the background and interfering.
