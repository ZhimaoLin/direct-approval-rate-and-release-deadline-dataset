DESCRIPTION

Add a stats call to just get disk stats

This was requested by the ns_server team in order to reduce the
amount of stats they would have to get sicne before they were
just using 'stats all'. This commit also adds the ability to get
detailed disk stats which shows file sizes per bucket.

looks like data size and file size are flipped

when I query all stats I get this:
{<<"ep_db_file_size">>,<<"12687360">>}
{<<"ep_db_data_size">>,<<"148899">>}

when I use key diskinfo I get this:
{ok,[{<<"ep_db_file_size">>,<<"148899">>},
     {<<"ep_db_data_size">>,<<"12687360">>}]}

Line:4053, src/ep_engine.cc -> We would prefer these stats to appear among the stats that we query without key.
