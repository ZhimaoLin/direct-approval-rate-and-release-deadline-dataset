DESCRIPTION

CBD-131 Add mccouch mock server randomized failure tests

Add randomized failures test to mccouch mock server. In this merge,
6 failures are added, drop response, garbage response, ignore to
accept socket connection, close socket, etmpfail, and slow response.

At this point, it exposes 2 mc-engine bugs. So, randomized failure
is disabled by default for ep_testsuite. To enable Adrianna Holmesally, modify
McCouchMockServer constructor to set "randomFailure" to true.

The engine parameter "response_timeout" is reduced from 10 mins to
5 seconds.

The test_timeout paramter is increased form 30 to 60 seconds.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good. Just a few comments
 
1. Is it possible to add a few unit tests to test the code? 
2. how about make "randomFailure" an engine parameter so we do not have to modify and rebuild the binary to turn on the feature?

They do not have to be in this commit.

Patch Set 1: No score

Response to Junyi's comments -

1, The plan is to add some unit tests that exercise certain deterministic failures to ensure ep-engine code paths are exercised.

2, Great suggestion with engine paramter. I was thinking of adding new make target. But, a engine parameter is probably easier to add and use. Will explore that in followup.
