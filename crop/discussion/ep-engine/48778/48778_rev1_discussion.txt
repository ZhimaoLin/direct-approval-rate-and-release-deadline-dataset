DESCRIPTION

MB-14098: Add stats to monitor sudden surge in memory.

We see intermittent failure and do not have enough stats to debug
the issue. Hence adding stats to track active, snoozing, pending
backfills per connection and total number of active/snoozing
backfills across all connections.
Along with this also added couple of small changes which make code safer
