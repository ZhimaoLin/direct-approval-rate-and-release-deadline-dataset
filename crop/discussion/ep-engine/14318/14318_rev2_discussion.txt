DESCRIPTION

don't assume ETIMEDOUT is 110

There's a problem in windows headers and/or pthreads for windows with
different values of ETIMEDOUT. Previous solution was a bit naive and
broken. It just defined 110 as CB_ETIMEDOUT and added extra case.

My compiler (quite correctly) have warning there so I was forced to
fix.

New fix hides this sad fact of two ETIMEDOUT values inside inline
wrapper for pthread_cond_timedwait. Without making assumption that 110
is ETIMEDOUT on all platforms.
