DESCRIPTION

MB-19273: Fix data race on PassiveStream::buffer.{bytes,items}

As reported by ThreadSanitizer (see below), there is a dirty read on
{{buffer.items}} & {{buffer.bytes}} during stat writing, due to
PassiveStream::addStats not acquiring the {{bufMutex}} lock before
reading.

This appears benign as the stat is only user sent to users, not used
by ns_server etc for any calculation.
