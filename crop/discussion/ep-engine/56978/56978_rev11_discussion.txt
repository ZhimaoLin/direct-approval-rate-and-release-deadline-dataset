DESCRIPTION

MB-16357: Create a variable to get correct locking scope

A mistake in 495e00acc24 means that no variable is
created for the ReaderLockHolder, the compiler either
optimises away the lock constructor/destructor or the lock
scope is wrong.

Either way we need to create a variable.

Includes some lock ordering changes as per ThreadSantitiser
warnings.
