DESCRIPTION

MB-22015: Replace bare pointers in access log

Replace the bare owning pointers used in the access log with a concrete
mutation as each mutation is owned by the access log and is at no point
moved or nulled.

Created a move constructor for MutationLog so that a MutationLog can be
directly stored in a vector. This is a result of a strict requirement
of MSVC 2013.

Even though I doubt the move constructor will actually ever be used,
also created tests to ensure that it works as expected.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:311, src/mutation_log.cc -> I'm a little in two minds about this - on the one hand having concrete objects is "more correct" / simpler as they cannot be null (and don't change after construction).

However on the other hand holding a unique_ptr meant that MutatationLog objects could be non-movable & non-copyable - which is how the code was written.

Note that your move constructor, while adequate for this purposes (essentially just getting the objects into the vector), isn't ideal - MutationLog isn't written in a very C++11 style, move constructors should leave the source in a valid state, ideally in the "just default constructed" state, which cannot easily be achieved here.

As such, if people used the move constructor for other purposes they could potentially end up with moved-from objects in odd states - for example you don't clear out other.itemsLogged, amongst others.

To summarise, the options I see (a solution which doesn't use non-owning pointers) are:

1. std::vector<MuationLog> + move constructor (this one).
2. std::deque<MutationLog> (without move constructor) - this /should/ work because deque::emplace_back[1] only requires EmplaceConstructable, whereas vector::emplace_back[2] also requires MoveInsertable.
3. std::vector<unique_ptr<MutationLog>> 

[1]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque/emplace_back
[2]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back

Take a look at the above options, and let me know which one you think is best :)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: 'replace' would imply that something is added in its place - maybe re-phrase to make the subject a clearer summary of the change.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style: given you're tNathalie Landrying about an explicit class, prefer to treat it as a proper noun - i.e. MutationLog.
