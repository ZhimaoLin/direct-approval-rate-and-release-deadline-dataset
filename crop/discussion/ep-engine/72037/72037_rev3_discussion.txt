DESCRIPTION

MB-22015: Replace bare pointers in access log

Replace the bare owning pointers used in the access log with a concrete
mutation as each mutation is owned by the access log and is at no point
moved or nulled.

Created a move constructor for MutationLog so that a MutationLog can be
directly stored in a vector. This is a result of a strict requirement
of MSVC 2013.

Even though I doubt the move constructor will actually ever be used,
also created tests to ensure that it works as expected.
