Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:356, src/kv_bucket.cc -> nit: when dealing with containers of unique_ptrs it's technically preferred to use push back and make_unique because if emplace_back throws an exception you'll leak the object you're attempting to add to the vector. There's no efficiency advantage to using emplace_back with unique_ptrs because there's no cost associated with moving a unique_ptr.

Line:918, src/kv_bucket.h -> Since ownership of the MutationLogs never changes you can actually just have a vector of mutation logs and remove the indirection.

    std::vector<MutationLog> accessLog;

You'll additionally need to do a small fixup in the warmup code to switch from `->` to `.`.
