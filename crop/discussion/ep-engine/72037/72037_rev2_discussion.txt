Line:359, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Style: Given you already have a reference to `config` you can simplify to use that, and also use std::to_string() for the string -> int:

    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < config.getMaxNumShards(); i++) {
        accessLog.push_back(std::make_unique<MutationLog>(
                config.getAlogPath() + std::to_string(i) +
                config.getAlogBlockSize()));
    }

Line:918, src/kv_bucket.h -> I think Will's suggestion of just making it a direct container of MutationLog objects is a good one - given we never change the number of elements in here there's no need for the (unique) pointer indirection.
