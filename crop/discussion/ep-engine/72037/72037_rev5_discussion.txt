DESCRIPTION

MB-22015: Replace bare pointers in access log

Replace the bare owning pointers used in the access log with a concrete
mutation as each mutation is owned by the access log and is at no point
moved or nulled.

The accessLog has been changed to a std::deque rather than a std::vector as to use
emplace_back on  std::deque, T only needs to be EmplaceConstructible rather
than the CopyConstructible required by std::vector. This means that a
move constructor is not needed for MutationLog, which is useful as a
move constructor does not quite fit the semantics of MutationLog.
Furthermore the anticiapted performance of std::deque is not expected to
differ much from std::vector.
