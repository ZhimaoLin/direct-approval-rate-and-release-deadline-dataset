DESCRIPTION

CBD-1097: GIO can Limit num of threads on a Queue

GIO Manager can now put a limit on the number of threads which can
pick up Tasks from specific queues. This feature is currently used to
ensure that at most 1 thread ends up picking up tasks from the AuxIO
queue so that we don't end up in a case where all the threads are working
on the long running cron jobs of the AuxIO queue while there are other higher
priority tasks waiting to run.
Added AuxIO to GIO manager
Also removed Medium Priority Q as it was not adding any benefit

Sundar,

Please see my comments. Most of them are minor ones. Please also limit the number of columns to 80 in a commit body message.

Line:55, src/scheduler.h -> Can we define the enum type for this?

Line:102, src/scheduler.h -> whitespace

Line:314, src/scheduler.cc -> Can we define the const variable for this?

Line:603, src/scheduler.cc -> Please define the const for this instead of hard-coding the wait time.
