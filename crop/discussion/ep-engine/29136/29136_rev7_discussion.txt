CBD-1097: GIO can Limit num of threads on a Queue

GIO Manager can now put a limit on the number of threads which can
pick up Tasks from specific queues. This feature is currently used to
ensure that at most 1 thread ends up picking up tasks from the AuxIO
queue so that we don't end up in a case where all the threads are working
on the long running cron jobs of the AuxIO queue while there are other higher
priority tasks waiting to run.
