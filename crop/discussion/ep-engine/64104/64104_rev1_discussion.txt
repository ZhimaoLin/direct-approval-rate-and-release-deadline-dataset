DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Expand ConnMap notify unit test for unpaused case

Expand the unit/regression test for MB-19503 to check for the case
where notifyAllPausedConnections() is called when a connection is not
paused.

Checks for the case where:

1. notifyAllPausedConnections() is called on unpaused connection
2. the connection is later re-paused.
3. notifyPausedConnection() is called

We fail to correctly add a pending notification, meaning a subsequent
notifyAllPausedConnections() does not notify.
