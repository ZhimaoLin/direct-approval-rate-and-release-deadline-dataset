DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Improved logging for handle slow stream & scheduling backfill

An example of the cause of the issue reported in MB-22451 is provided
below:

1/ DCP (Producer) xxx@xxx.xxx - (vb 399) Creating stream with start seqno 0 and end seqno 18446744073709551615
2/ DCP (Producer) xxx@xxx.xxx - (vb 399)  Producer is handling slow stream; state:in-memory lastReadSeqno:548720 lastSentSeqno:538712
3/ DCP (Producer) xxx@xxx.xxx - (vb 399) Scheduling backfill from 548721 to 573764, reschedule flag : True
4/ DCP (Producer) xxx@xxx.xxx - (vb 399) Sending disk snapshot with start seqno 0 and end seqno 573764
5/ DCP (Producer) xxx@xxx.xxx - (vb 399)  Producer is handling slow stream; state:backfilling lastReadSeqno:549860 lastSentSeqno:549140
6/ DCP (Producer) xxx@xxx.xxx - (vb 399) Backfill complete, 3989 items read from disk, 21055 from memory, last seqno read: 573764

A backfill is scheduled (step 3) and then before it completes, another
call is made to handle slow stream (step 5). This should result in
setting the pendingBackfill flag to true and then when the backfill
completes (step 6) it should schedule another backfill.
However this second backfill is not scheduled.

This patches adds improved logging which will provide the additional
information needed to debug this and similar issues.
