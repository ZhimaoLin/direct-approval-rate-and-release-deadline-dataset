DESCRIPTION

cache FailoverTable in JSON, thread-safe pruneEntries()

FailoverTable isn't modified during normal run, but it is
saved to disk on every vbucket snapshot making the call toJSON()
very CPU intensive. caching the JSON version on change saves over
82% of CPU call made in snapshotVBuckets
