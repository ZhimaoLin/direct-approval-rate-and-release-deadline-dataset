Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:39, src/sizes.cc -> Looking at the usage here, it would probably be simpler if this continue to take the same type - i.e. just a raw poster to the HistogramBin<> - as suggested in http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-smartptrparam

(that way you wouldn't even need to change the code here  - the decision to use unique_ptr to manage Histogram's resource becomes purely an implementation detail which isn't exposed in the API).
