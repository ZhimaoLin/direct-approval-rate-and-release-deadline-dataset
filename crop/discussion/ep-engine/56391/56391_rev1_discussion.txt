DESCRIPTION

Allow BlockTimer to report "slow" blocks

Enhance BlockTimer to allow reporting to the log file blocks which
take longer than a given threshold to execute.

BlockTimer is now implemented in terms of GenericBlockTimer, a
template class which has template paramters to specify if slow blocks
should be logged, and if so how many nanoseconds constitutes a "slow"
block. Note this mode isn't enabled by default to minimise the
overhead of BlockTimer (and also to prevent log spam).

To enable for a single BlockTimer, simply change the type of your
BlockTimer variable to:

    GenericBlockTimer<true> timer(&histo, "block name");

And all blocks which take longer than the default threshold will be
reported - note the block name is required for the block to be logger.

To enable globally for *all* BlockTimers, simply change the definition
of BlockTimer (in histo.h) to:

typedef GenericBlockTimer<true> BlockTimer;
