DESCRIPTION

MB-24426: Use virtual destructors for some of the DCP classes

DCP classes like 'DCPProducer', 'DCPConsumer', 'Consumer',
'ActiveStream' and 'PassiveStream' have subclasses derived from them.
It is appropriate to use virtual destructors to avoid any memory
leaks during object deletion.
