DESCRIPTION

Replace RingBuffer with cb::RingBuffer from platform

To reduce the amount of code we keep around. Also cb::RingBuffer
behaves more like an STL container.

Line:197, src/executorthread.h -> Considering TASK_LOG_SIZE is 80 and the impl. is using std::array you might want to make this a pointer? the old impl used a different block for storage, but it's embedded here.

Line:197, src/executorthread.h -> I did consider that, but the ring buffers gets created when the object is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed and they're located at the end of the object (so they won't cause cache issues for the other member variables). The only real difference is that there is 1 allocation rather than 3.

Line:96, src/executorthread.h -> Nit: Given all the other elements are on their own line, could you also move currTaskType to its own given these lines are getting changed anyways.
