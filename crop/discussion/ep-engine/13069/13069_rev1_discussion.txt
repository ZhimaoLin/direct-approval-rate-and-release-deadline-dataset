DESCRIPTION

Don't reschedule checkpoint items only for the registered TAP.

If the TAP connection is for the registered client that is only
interested in items from the closed checkpoints, only checkpoint
items should not be rescheduled because its cursor is going to
be reset to the beginning of its current checkpoint upon
the reconnection. On the other hand, other TAP opaque messages
should be rescheduled for the registered client.
