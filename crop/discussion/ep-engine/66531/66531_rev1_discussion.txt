DESCRIPTION

MB-20425: Remove default options parameter from get functions

The ep_engine get function defaults the option parameter.
The ep_store get function also defaults the option parameter.

These multiple levels of defaulting has made it difficult to
track the value of the options parameter for different calls.
Therefore the use of defaults are removed for these cases.

This will make the change that addresses the regression of
MB-20425 much easier to understand.
