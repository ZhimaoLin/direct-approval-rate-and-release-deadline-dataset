DESCRIPTION

Update test_flush_stats to remove mem_used checks

When accurate memory tracking is enabled, there is too many
allocations going on 'under the hood' to be able to check that
mem_used increases relative to a baseline when only two small keys are
added. Therefore just remove the mem_used checks from this testcase.
