DESCRIPTION

MB-23573: Add full eviction defragment benchmarks

Enables the defragmenter benchmarks for full eviction. This required
changing the processAdd to be called with maybeExists = false, otherwise
the response would always be to schedule a bgfetch and not add the item
to the hash table.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

There's probably another EXPECT() check needed somewhere in the DefragmenterTests which checks the add succeeded (and didn't return bgfetch).

Line:149, tests/module_tests/vbucket_test.cc -> This arguably changes the semantics of other existing tests. Can we change the defrag tests to use set() instead (which should avoid the bgfetch)?
