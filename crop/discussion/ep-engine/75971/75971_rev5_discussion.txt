DESCRIPTION

MB-23573: Add full eviction defragment benchmarks

Enables the defragmenter benchmarks for full eviction. This required
changing the populate phase to use processSet rather than processAdd as
processAdd would check respond with bgFetch needed.

As a result of changing to processSet, when testing mapped memory we
need to clear the checkpointManager so that the memory gets released. I
also found that I was able to reduce the fuzz factor from 1.3 to 1.05.
