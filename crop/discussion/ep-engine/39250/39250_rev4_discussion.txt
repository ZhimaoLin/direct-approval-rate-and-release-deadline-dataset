DESCRIPTION

MB-10962 Don't snooze the connection notifier unnecessarily.

There is a race in pausing and resuming the connection
notifier upon receiving a new mutation. To address this issue,
This change adds a flag that indicates if there is a pending
notification event for any TAP connections.

Note that this change was originally merged in 2.5.0 branch to
address the sporadic high latency issue in TAP-based replication.

We still need to address it in the UPR-based replication
separately.
