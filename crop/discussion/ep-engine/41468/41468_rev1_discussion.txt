DESCRIPTION

MB-11999 Warmup: Load 60% active and 40% replica

Before warmup, if the system were in DGM, then
during warmup, while iterating over all the vbuckets
on a node, load active vbuckets 60% of the time and
replica vbuckets 40% of the time.

Example:
In a 4 node cluster, approximate resident ratios:
1. Before warmup
    active:     36%     34%     42%     53%
    replica:    32%     34%     26%     15%
2. After warmup
    active:     41%     44%     41%     43%
    replica:    28%     25%     28%     27%

This change is too invasive. As I mentioned, we just need to adapt "LoadStorageKVPairCallback::callback(GetValue &val)" function" to eject an active or replica item with 4:6 ratio, respectively.

Line:563, src/warmup.cc -> If we use the reference, it will make "shardActiveVbIds" contain the replica vbukcets too, which seems wrong.

Line:1064, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't think that's what we discussed. This logic has an issue of not loading some active or replica vbuckets completely. 

Instead, we just need to adapt "LoadStorageKVPairCallback::callback(GetValue &val)" function, so that we can eject active and replicat items with the 4:6 ratio. Please determine whether a given active or replica item should be ejected before calling the hashtable insert function.

Line:563, src/warmup.cc -> That is true, my mistake.
