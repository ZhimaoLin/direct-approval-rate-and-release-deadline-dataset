Line:242, sync_registry.cc -> No need to update the keyspec instance with the latest CAS value?

See inline reply :)

Line:242, sync_registry.cc -> Good observation. In fact like in the PERSIST switch case, it should add the original CAS specified in the SYNC request body, since when the sync registry is notified that a key was persisted (committed to disk) we get a QueuedItem which has no CAS information. The next patch set fixes this by adding the same behaviour as the PERSIST case.

Also, the change http://review.membase.org/#change,4855 adds the latest CAS of each key before replying to the client. But this one is a separate change that I prefer to be in a separate git commit.
