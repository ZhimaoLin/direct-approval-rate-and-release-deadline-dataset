Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(7 comments)

Line:3, tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc -> 2017

Line:3, src/collections/manifest.h -> 2017

Line:73, src/collections/manifest.h -> Can simplify to:

 return std::find(begin(), end(), collection);

Line:77, src/collections/manifest.h -> Useful to describe what this checks for.

Line:20, src/collections/collections_types.cc -> Might be helpful to add a comment describing what this is used for.

Line:22, src/collections/collections_types.h -> Not actually using this.

Line:28, src/collections/collections_types.h -> Nicer to use a static const. I think if we are going to use #defines then should be uppercase for consistency.
