Line:41, src/ephemeral.h -> a) This has to be in the private section to actually do anything (or to at least be helpful as you'll get confusing link errors instead)

b) The modern way to do this is to actually delete the functions instead:

    EphemeralBucket(const& EphemeralBucket) = delete;
    void operator=(const EphemeralBucket&) = delete;

c) You probably can't copy or assign anyway as EPBucket probably contains a mutex
