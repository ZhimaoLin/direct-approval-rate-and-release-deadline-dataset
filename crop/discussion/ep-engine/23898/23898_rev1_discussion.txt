Patch Set 1: (10 inline comments)

This isn't finished yet, but it is almost there and not meant for review. I have added some comments for myself that denote things I need to fix and some topics that I want to have some discussion about. All unit tests pass for this change.

Line:2727, src/ep_engine.cc -> Should this stat be per vbucket?

Line:583, src/ep.hh -> This function I think will go away. It might also be good to have a reject queue size stat.

Line:588, src/ep.hh -> I need to implement this, but it is more complicated once we have multiple writers.

Line:1812, src/ep.cc -> Why do we need this if statement below?

Line:1956, src/ep.cc -> I didn't implement having a max transaction size yet. The reason is that I think the two function calls below should have a max items parameter. This parameter would say how many items the function could put into the items vector so that we don't overflow it if there are a lot of items. I am open to other suggestions though.

Line:1961, src/ep.cc -> How should we handle calling the begin() function? The previous code just kept calling it until it succeeded, but that didn't seem like a good solution to me. My current thoughts are to just throw all of the items into the reject queue.

Line:1995, src/ep.cc -> How should we handle commit failures? I tNathalie Landryed to the couchstore team and they said implementing a rollback feature in couchstore wouldn't be a lot of effort. This way if a commit failed we could put all of the items into the reject queue. This is another thing I think we should discuss.

Line:73, src/stats.hh -> This is the new "ep_queue_size" stat. It will actually only be 0 once everything has been persisted unlike the other stat. QE can also now solely use this stat to monitor persistence.

Line:205, src/flusher.cc -> This sleep is only here for testing.

Line:215, src/flusher.cc -> This clearly won't work and I will need to fix this up. On another note the checkpoint persistence command doesn't actually prioritize anything either.
