DESCRIPTION

Make VBucket abstract class. Define virtual funcs in derived classes

Virtual functions updateStoredValue(), addNewStoredValue() and
softDeleteStoredValue() are implemented in EPVBucket and EphemeralVBucket
classes. They are made abstract functions in base class VBucket.

Due to this, an object of the abstract class VBucket cannot be created
anymore. So in unit test code we should create objects of EPVBucket and
EphemeralVBucket and run tests on them.

This commit, in unit testing, creates only the objects of EPVBucket and
runs tests on them. EphemeralVBucket to follow soon.
