DESCRIPTION

Part 1: Add DCP tests and convert existing tests to C+11

Added two new tests:
test_dcp_notifier_open: Tests the opening of a DCP
notifier connection, and also ensures that the number
of connections is correct.

test_dcp_notifier_equal_to_number_of_items: Tests that
a notifier request equal to the number of operations
does not result in a STREAM_END command being received.

In addition existing tests from
test_dcp_vbtakeover_stat_no_stream to (and including)
test_dcp_consumer_noop have been converted to C+11
simplify the tests and adding additional checks
where possible.
