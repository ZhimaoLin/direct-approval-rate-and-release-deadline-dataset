DESCRIPTION

Part 1: Add DCP tests and convert existing tests to C+11

Added two new tests:
test_dcp_notifier_open: Tests the opening of a DCP
notifier connection, and also ensures that the number
of connections is correct.  This test make use of two
new stats: ep_dcp_conn_count_list and ep_dcp_conn_count_map

test_dcp_notifier_equal_to_number_of_items: Tests that
a notifier request equal to the number of operations
does not result in a STREAM_END command being received.

In addition existing tests from
test_dcp_vbtakeover_stat_no_stream up to (and including)
test_dcp_consumer_noop have been converted to C+11,
simplifying the tests and adding additional checks
where possible.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1

It would be better if the adding new tests and converting existing tests to C++11 are checkedin as separate commits.
