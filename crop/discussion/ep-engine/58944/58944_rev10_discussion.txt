additional checks where possible.

(23 comments)

Line:524, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Still have the double line spacing.

Line:537, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> It's probably more idiomatic to change this to a std::string, then you don't need the explicit strlen() call (can use .size() instead).

Line:541, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Careful with auto - you're probably ok with small numbers like this, but this will actually create `int` types which isn't the expected type for the bulk of these calls.

Line:548, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Missing increment of the opaque here.

Line:595, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Again, std::string is probably preferred here.

Line:628, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Same

Line:636, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Duplication - it was probably clearer before when this was constructed from the DCP connection name.

Line:647, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string

Line:657, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> As above

Line:668, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string

Line:683, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> ditto

Line:699, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> ditto

Line:752, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Given you have a constant above, should use that instead of repeated literal.

Line:753, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> ditto

Line:757, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string

Line:768, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> as previous

Line:845, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string

Line:876, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string

Line:885, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Replace literal with derived number (I assume strlen("connection_buffer_size")

Line:905, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> As discussed, I think we needs to be reverted as you sometimes get zeros before any data is ready.

Line:915, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string

Line:941, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> As above, there's the possibility of dcp_last_op being zero.

Line:953, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> std::string
