DESCRIPTION

MB-19695: Always persist VBstate when resetting VB

During tapNotify / TAP_OPAQUE_INITIAL_VBUCKET_STREAM - when we are
setting up a replica vBucket which is populated by TAP - the vbucket
is reset. This deletes the current database file from disk, and
creates a new file.

Both the delete and create are done asynchronously via our Task
mechanism (on a writer thread). It has been obsersed that the vbucket
file is sometimes not re-created, which can result in the following
exception being thrown which disconnects the connection:

    WARNING 47: exception occurred in runloop - closing connection:
    CouchKVStore::getNumPersistedDeletes:Failed to open database
    file for vBucket = 96 rev = 1 with error:no such file

Interestingly this isn't a simple case of the filesystem being slow -
cbcollect logs taken ~5minutes later still show the vbucket file not
existing.

This appears to be caused by an optimization in
EventuallyPersistentStore::scheduleVBStatePersist - which the method
used to schedule a new VBstate to be saved (and in turn create the vb
file on disk). The optimization is to not schedule a persist if one is
already scheduled.

However, there exists the possibility that a VBStatePersistTask
already exists (causing us not to create one during resetVBucket(),
*and* the existing VBStatePersistTask is scheduled before the
delete. This results in the file being deleted, and not re-created as
part of the reset process.

The solution is to forcefully persist the VBState during resetVBucket,
essentially disabling the optimization in this case and ensuring the
file is created. Full unit regression test to follow in separate patch
(it needs test infrastructure which doesn't yet exist).

(Note: the vbucket datafile file /will/ be created upon the next write
to the vbucket, but in the case of a vbucket with zero items this may
take some time).
