Patch Set 2: Verified

Jin, I uploaded patch set 2 according your comments. Also, I feel it might be unecessarily to clear the stat the beginning of saveDocs(), because if the doc saving is not successful (early return from this function), it should be treated as the "# of docs committed in the last time", in this case, we should just keep the old value.
