minor comments, please take a look at them.

Line:1114, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This looks good but also you can try as follows (so we can keep the original codes with less {}s), thanks.

setDocsCommitted(0); // at the beginning before the while loop.
:
:
setDocsCommitted(docCount); // at the end before return errCode.

Line:183, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> You may want to initialize it within the constructer, thanks.
