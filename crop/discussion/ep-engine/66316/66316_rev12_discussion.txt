Patch Set 12: Code-Review+1

(1 comment)

Line:504, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> It might be better to use the C++11 style code from the original (pre-backport) version: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/65520/8/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc

I'm very confident that's correct; the SyncObject usage here (with the adjustments to where locks are taken etc) would need re-validating - unless you're confident that everything is correct here...

ah that's what i had previously looked for, although that version has some deadlocks which are now addressed in the uploaded version. E.g. if the new thread runs , it will take the backfill lock and call signal before the main thread gets to wait, so main thread waits forever. The same can happen on the destroy cv too. So will still need work to merge and make right

Ah ok - if you're happy with the current version that's fine by me.
