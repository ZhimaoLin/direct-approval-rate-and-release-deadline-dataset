Line:50, src/atomicqueue.h -> This is admittedly pretty terrible documentation, but is there a compelling reason to remove it?

Could you check the merge of http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/65626 ?

Line:1361, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Same here - I think this should be included in the merge.

Line:1529, src/ep.cc -> This looks wrong - this code was only recently added (by http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/65626) - I think this should still be included in the merge.

Line:23, src/atomicqueue.h -> IIRC this is wrong - <queue> is used by some non-MSVC code in this file.
