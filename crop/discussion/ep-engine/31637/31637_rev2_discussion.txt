DESCRIPTION

Initailize tap stat "sent_from_vb" to 0 for all vbuckets

On some platforms sometimes the integer values may not be initailized
to 0 by default. So explicitly do it to the vector 'transmitted'
in the TapProducer contructor.

This fix the sporadic failure from est_vb_move test which depends on
the stat.
