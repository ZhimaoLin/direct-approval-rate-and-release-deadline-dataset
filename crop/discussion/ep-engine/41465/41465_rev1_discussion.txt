DESCRIPTION

MB-11999 Warmup: Load 60% active and 40% replica

Before warmup, if the system were in DGM, then
during warmup, while iterating over all the vbuckets
on a node, load active vbuckets 60% of the time and
replica vbuckets 40% of the time.

Example:
In a 4 node cluster, approximate resident ratios:
1. Before warmup
    active:     36%     34%     42%     53%
    replica:    32%     34%     26%     15%
2. After warmup
    active:     44%     43%     44%     43%
    replica:    26%     27%     26%     26%
