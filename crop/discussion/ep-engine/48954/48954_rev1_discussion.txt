Is there a warning generated? I was hoping to add this callback back into the code in the master branch which is why I didn't remove this. I don't mind ether way though.

Patch Set 1:

No I didn't see a warning, I was going to comment on the previous change, but it was already merged in, so I just raised this patch. I don't understand why you'll be adding this back into master?

I only removed it because I didn't want to make a larger change in sherlock. For master I don't have to worry as much about breaking stuff.

Patch Set 1:

There's actually other code that we could remove too. For example, we could also get rid of the place in the vbucket class where we add these callbacks.

Patch Set 1:

Ok, in that case, let me know if you plan to re-use this in master, and you'd rather keep this around, in which case i can just abandon this.
