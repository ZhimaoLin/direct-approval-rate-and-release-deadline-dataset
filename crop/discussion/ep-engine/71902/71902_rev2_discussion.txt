DESCRIPTION

Return ENOENT for 'warmup' stats if warmup disabled

ns_server checks the value of the 'warmup' stats group when
determining if a bucket is read - see ns_memcached/check_started. It
expects this to:

a) return 'ENOENT' - when warmup is not applicable (historically
   memcached buckets).

b) include a 'ep_warmup_thread' key - if so then it will wait until
   this has the value 'complete' before marking the bucket as ready.

So ep-engine acts as ns_server expects, if warmup is disabled (and
hence the Warmup task does not exist), return ENOENT if the 'warmup'
set of stats is requested. This means that ns_server will consider the
bucket ready and activate it.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:978, src/warmup.cc -> Seems awfully implicit to rely on passing NULL as not adding a suffix - also not using nullptr.

Line:61, tests/module_tests/warmup_test.cc -> Do you need to verify this returns ENOENT?

Line:978, src/warmup.cc -> The git blame for this line is already trashed, still no reason not to fix it to nullptr.
