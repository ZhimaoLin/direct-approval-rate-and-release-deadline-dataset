DESCRIPTION

MB-8861: Release bucket lock before queueing a dirty item

When we queue a dirty item we notify any tap connections that
are streaming items from the vbucket the item was added to. If we
don't release the lock then we can cause a deadlock on the
notifySync and queueLock variables in the tap replicator.
