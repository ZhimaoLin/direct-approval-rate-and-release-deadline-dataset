DESCRIPTION

MB-15910: Fix potential segfaults on WIN32 due to incorrect log format strings

Fix mismatch between LOG() formatting strings and the arguments. The
common pattern here is format strings which:

1) contain a char* (%s) formatter
2) preceded by a mis-sized integer formatter.

This results in printf() on 32bit Windows reading too much (or too
little) from the stack for the integer argument; meaning that when it
attempts to handle the following %s formatter and read the char* it
dereferences an invalid pointer.

Patch Set 2:

Note this is essentially a selective backport of the changes in http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/53874/ - I selected only those mismatches which I believe could trigger an actual invalid memory access.
