DESCRIPTION

MB-22749: Update item count correctly in the case of full eviction

This commit handles the following cases

(i) Ensuring that updates on a deleted item doesn't affect the item
    count. This is done by marking a stored value as an update on a delete

(ii) Ensuring that the total item count remains accurate in the case
     of full eviction. This is handled in the persistence callback
     when the mutation is effectively an update instead of a new item
     to the bucket
