DESCRIPTION

MB-22749: Decrement item count for updates in full eviction

Decrement the item count from the hashtable in case of an update
in full eviction mode. Reading the total item count from the
underlying store results in a slowdown in updating the item
count in the hash table.

(2 comments)

Line:1846, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Shouldn't we doing the same for the deletes as well ?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you please explain why this will result in the correct count ?
(As opposed to setting the item count to the count on disk)

Patch Set 4:

(2 comments)

Line:1846, src/kv_bucket.cc -> The stats update for deletes takes place in deletedOnDiskCbk in the vbucket object.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> In the case of full eviction, if the item has been evicted to disk, we insert a new cache item in the hash table. But after checking the disk, we realise that this item already exists in the database. So, this would count as a update of an existing item and we need to decrement the total item count.
