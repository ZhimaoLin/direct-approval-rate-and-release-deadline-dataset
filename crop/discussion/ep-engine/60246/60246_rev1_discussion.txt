DESCRIPTION

MB-18135: Ensure dead connections are cleaned-up

Dead connections are usually cleaned-up by manageConnections.
manageconnections is invoked in the run() of ConnTask,
which is a NONIO Task.  The task has a MIN_SLEEP_TIME of 2s,
which means dead connections will only be clean-up at most
every 2s.  Therefore if we delete a bucket it is possible
that dead connections exist.  This causes the function
responsible for destroying a bucket to wait indefinitely
for the dead connections to be disconnected.

Therefore before deleting a bucket we need to ensure that
all dead connections are cleaned-up.

Could you also add a unit test for the error case, to verify this fixes it correctly.

Line:1035, src/connmap.cc -> s/ConnTask/ConnManager/

Line:1047, src/connmap.cc -> Wouldn't it be simpler to just call manageConnections() here, which already has the correct logic for cleaning everything up?
