DESCRIPTION

MB-18135: Ensure dead connections are cleaned-up

Dead connections are usually cleaned-up by manageConnections.
manageconnections is invoked in the run() of ConnTask,
which is a NONIO Task.  The task has a MIN_SLEEP_TIME of 2s,
which means dead connections will only be clean-up at most
every 2s.  Therefore if we delete a bucket it is possible
that dead connections exist.  This causes the function
responsible for destroying a bucket to wait indefinitely
for the dead connections to be disconnected.

Therefore before deleting a bucket we need to ensure that
all dead connections are cleaned-up.
