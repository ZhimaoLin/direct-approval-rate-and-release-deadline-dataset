DESCRIPTION

Create a new checkpoint more frequently for high memory usage.

This change allows the checkpoint remover to close the current
open checkpoint and open a new one for a given vbucket if any
of the following condition is true:

1) current memory usage > memory high water mark (75% of bucket
memory size) AND number of items in the open checkpoint >=
MIN_CHECKPOINT_ITEMS (500)
2) current memory usage > 90% of bucket memory size AND
number of items in the open checkpoint > 0

The checkpoint remover is periodically scheduled every five
seconds. In this way, more closed checkpoints can be considered
by the item pager for eviction in high memory usage, and
consequently DGM can be supported in a more flexible way.

Line:406, checkpoint.cc -> If the memory usage is getting beyond the bucket quota, any new requests will be rejected even before being pushed into the hash table. I don't think we need to worry about this here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:406, checkpoint.cc -> If the memory is over the threshold, is it more effective to just reject requests than to frequently create/close checkpoints?
