Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is there an MB number for this?

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> You should remove all the old Reviewed-By/on etc tags so there isn't confusion over which Jasmin Rangel patch this is.

(If you want to leave a reference to the original commit SHA that's fine, but add it in the body of the description).
