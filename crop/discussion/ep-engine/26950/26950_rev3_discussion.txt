DESCRIPTION

MB-8467 Don't snapshot VB states for every checkpoint change.

We don't need to schedule the VB state snapshot task for
every checkpoint change. It causes too much unnececssary
overhead that slows down the flusher performance.
Instead, it is enough to snapshot the VB states including
checkpoint changes periodically.
