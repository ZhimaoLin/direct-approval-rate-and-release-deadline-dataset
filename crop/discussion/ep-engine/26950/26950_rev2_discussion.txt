DESCRIPTION

MB-8467 Don't snapshot VB states for checkpoint changes only.

We don't need to schedule the VB state snapshot task for
checkpoint changes only. It causes too much unnececssary
overhead that slows down the flusher performance.
Instead, it is enough to snapshot the VB states including
checkpoint changes during shutdown.
