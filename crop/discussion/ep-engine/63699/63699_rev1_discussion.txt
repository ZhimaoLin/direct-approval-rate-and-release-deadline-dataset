DESCRIPTION

Remove default arguments from HashTable::unlocked_add

HashTable::unlocked_add() has four defaulted boolean arguments; which
can be confusing to the reader as to which option is set to
what.

Given that one of these arguments always have the same value
(storedVal is always true), make the flags explicit in the callers to
assist in refactoring / simplification.
