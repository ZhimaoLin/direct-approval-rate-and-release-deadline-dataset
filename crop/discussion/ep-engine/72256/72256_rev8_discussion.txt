DESCRIPTION

Retain the value for datatype PROTOCOL_BINARY_DATATYPE_XATTR on expiry

On expiry of an item with a body containing value, user xattrs and
system xattrs, instead of deleting the body, the body is being
retained because mobile clients can still query for the system xattrs
of deleted/expired items. Note that this is still inefficient as the
whole body is being retained instead of just the system xattrs.
