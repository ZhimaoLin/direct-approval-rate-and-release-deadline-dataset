DESCRIPTION

Retain the value for datatype PROTOCOL_BINARY_DATATYPE_XATTR on expiry

On expiry of an item with a body containing value, user xattrs and
system xattrs, the whole body is retained because mobile clients
can still query for the system xattrs. This is still inefficient
as the whole body is being retained instead of just the system
xattrs.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(7 comments)

Line:821, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Aren't both of these of type `DocumentState`? I don't see the point in the cast.

Line:833, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> expired

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is somewhat ambiguously worded, it's not entirely clear whether this was already the case or something you've fixed.

Line:205, src/stored-value.h -> StoredValue is massive and included from a lot of different files. I think all new functions should have their body in the cc unless there's a compelling perf argument to be made.

Line:591, src/hash_table.cc -> SingleThreadedRCPtr has a boolean conversion so you can just simplify this to:

    if (value && ...)

Line:592, src/hash_table.cc -> Datatypes are flags, not specific values so this is invalid if the datatype is e.g. JSON with xattr.

You should use the helper functions in <memcached/protocol_binary.h> instead:

    mcbp::datatype::is_xattr(value->getDatatype())

Line:595, src/hash_table.cc -> This is a very confusing way of structuring this code. It's not obvious without looking at StoredValue that `markDeleted` turns `del` into a no-op.

I suggest sticking the `del` in an else block.

Line:821, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Leaving it as is causes compilation issues:

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/../include/c++/v1/ostream:207:20: note: 
      candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'DocumentState' to 'const void *' for
      1st argument; take the address of the argument with &
    basic_ostream& operator<<(const void* __p);
