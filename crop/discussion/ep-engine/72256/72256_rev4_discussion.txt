DESCRIPTION

Retain the value for datatype PROTOCOL_BINARY_DATATYPE_XATTR on expiry

On expiry of an item with a body containing value, user xattrs and
system xattrs, the whole body is being retained because mobile clients
can still query for the system xattrs. This is still inefficient
as the whole body is being retained instead of just the system
xattrs.
