DESCRIPTION

Retain the value for datatype PROTOCOL_BINARY_DATATYPE_XATTR on expiry

On expiry of an item with a body containing value, user xattrs and
system xattrs, instead of deleting the body, the body is being retained
because mobile clients can still query for the system xattrs of deleted/expired
items. Note that this is still inefficient as the whole body is being retained
instead of just the system xattrs.

(3 comments)

Line:833, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can you also check (here or in a different test) that a get with DocumentState::Deleted still succeeds?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: wrap at 72 chars (http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Line:588, src/hash_table.cc -> Maybe add a "TODO: perf" or similar comment that we only /need/ to keep the system XATTRs, and this is inefficient (but functionally correct).
