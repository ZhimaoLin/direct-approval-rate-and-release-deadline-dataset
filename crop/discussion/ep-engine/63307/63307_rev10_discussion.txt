DESCRIPTION

MB-19255: Record time for all DCP consumer messages

The DCP documentation states that the consumer should see
some sort of message or a No-Op message in a period
equal to twice the noop interval otherwise it should close
its connection.  See documentation/commands/no-op.md in
https://github.com/Piper Jeffersonlabs/dcp-documentation

This patch changes from checking only the receival of a
no-op message to check for recieving the following messages
- deletion
- add stream
- close stream
- deletion
- expiration
- flush
- mutation
- set VBucket state
- snapshot Marker
- stream end
