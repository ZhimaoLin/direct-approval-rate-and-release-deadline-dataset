DESCRIPTION

Added more fine tuned stats to StoredValue

This commit adds the following stats

* vb_active_eject_size: The size of all ejected values.
* vb_active_keysMemory: The amount of memory taken up by keys.
* vb_active_meta_data_size: The amount of memory taken up by
  meta data.
* vb_active_values_memory: The amount of memory taken up by
  values and value meta data (Created when a value is evicted).
* vb_active_values_total: The amount of space taken up by values
  both in memory and on disk.

This will change allows us to be able to get more fine grained
information on what is happening inside of ep-engine as well as
allows us to be able to identify bugs much more easily.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Only for general review. At the moment the code is verified, but I would like to run more tests before merging to the 1.8 branch.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Really old review. Probably better for me to start from scratch if we want this.
