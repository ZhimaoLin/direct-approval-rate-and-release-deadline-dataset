DESCRIPTION

MB-5804: count getMeta ops if key is non-existent

This change-set will make ep_engine stat ep_num_ops_get_meta count
the getMeta operation even if the key is non-existent, in which case
we schedule a background fetch to get the metadata from storage. But
today we do not count such operation which is incorrect.
