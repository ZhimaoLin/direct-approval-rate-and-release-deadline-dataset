DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Create and BeginDelete collection against a VB.

Update the VB::Manifest to now drive an event through a
VBucket.

The VBucket can then generate a JSON manifest from the
system-event item. This is achieved by serialising a
VB::Manifest into the system-event value so that at
flushing time the correct JSON represntation can be
produced.

Line:56, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Prefer `stoi()` and friends - they throw an exception on failing to convert.

Line:66, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Might be more explicit with std::tie - can name the fields.

Line:231, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Not sure the numbering here makes much sense currently...

Line:235, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Any value in changing the API of SystemEventFactory::make to actually pass in a sized_buf for the actual data it should contain? Would remove the need for this const cast.

Line:257, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Can this be const?

Line:259, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Style: Could be more terse / clearer if ManifestEntry had an operator== and that was just used here.

Line:280, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> const?

Line:283, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> As above - operator== would be nicer.

Line:290, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> I think it would be better if this was encapsulated into a static method on SerializedManifestEntry - keeps the code relating to these dynamically sized objects in one place.

Line:805, src/vbucket.h -> Is this permitted to be null? If not prefer reference.

Line:165, tests/module_tests/collections/vbucket_manifest_test.cc -> const ref?

Line:18, src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.h -> I think you want config.h included before this.

Line:116, src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.h -> Nit: you can just implement this in terms of the non-const nextEntry().

Line:137, src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.h -> Nit: If you remove the default case and just put the return outside the switch then any new SystemEvents added will flag a warning (see https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#dont-use-default-labels-in-fully-covered-switches-over-enumerations)

Line:143, src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.h -> Nit: strictly more correct to say 'exception'

Line:231, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Done - used to be a bigger function...

Line:235, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> It's like this to remove the need for an intermediate local buffer. The Item can only normally be written to via copy-in from another buffer, so to remove the const_cast we need to allocate a local buf, populate the local buf, then pass the local to the Item who will copy it to the value

Line:116, src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.h -> There's an approach from Meyers which i'll upload, it's a bit ugly though but Meyers?! must be right
