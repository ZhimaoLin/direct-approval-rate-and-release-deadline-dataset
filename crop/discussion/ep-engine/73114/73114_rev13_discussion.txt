DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Create and BeginDelete collection against a VB.

Update the VB::Manifest to now drive an event through a
VBucket.

The VBucket can then generate a JSON manifest from the
system-event item. This is achieved by serialising a
VB::Manifest into the system-event value so that at
flushing time the correct JSON represntation can be
produced.
