DESCRIPTION

MB-8922: Add a persisted cursor

Adds another cursor to the checkpoint manager called the
persisted cursor which is always set to the last item that
has been persisted to disk. The reason for adding this cusor
is that when we grab items for persistence we need to move
the persistence cursor and that means that for a given period
of time the persistence cursor will not reflect which items
are actually written to disk.

This change also causes new replication cursors to be inserted
at the beginning of the checkpoint that contains the persisted
cursor.
