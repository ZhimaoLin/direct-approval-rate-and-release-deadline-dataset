Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

Just one comment from me, thanks

Line:980, src/ep_engine.cc -> This should be something like..
void *storage_data = (void *)opcode;
e->storeEngineSpecific(cookie, storage_data);
otherwise you would be storing the address of a stack variable and that won't be the same as an opcode when retrieved in handleDisconnect()

Line:980, src/ep_engine.cc -> I am not using this opcode value in handleDisconnect anyway, I just check for a not-NULL value.
