Line:64, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Looking at the test you probably want to record the fact that this callback was / wasn't called, which you can assert the correct behaviour in the test.

Line:146, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Just use std::to_string() (as per previous review comments :)

Line:64, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This callback would be invoked but there's no use of it in this context, similar to how we do things during warmup.
