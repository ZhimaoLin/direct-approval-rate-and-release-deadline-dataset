DESCRIPTION

Fix for DecrementalRestorer fails to close sqlite file descriptor

DecrementalRestorer does not use sqlite3_finalize() on sqlite
statements after all statements are processed using sqlite3_step().
Calling sqlite3_close() without doing a sqlite_finalize(statement)
is causing failure in closing sqlite file descriptor. This patch
adds sqlite3_finalize() statements before doing close().
