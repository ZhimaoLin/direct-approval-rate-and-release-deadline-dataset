Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This is just for verifying test cases for active item loss, and should not be merged.

Patch Set 1:

Keith, Farshid,

Get the toy build and pull out "ep_num_new_insertions" stat through moxi, and compare this stat with the number of unique items that your test case inserted successfully.

If these two numbers are equal, then it's an ep-engine issue. Otherwise, there are some other places that might get this test go wrong.
