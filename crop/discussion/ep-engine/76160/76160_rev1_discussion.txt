DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: Don't support CHECKPOINT_PERSISTENCE; serialize SEQNO_PERSISTENCE

In ephemeral buckets we don't need to handle CMD_CHECKPOINT_PERSISTENCE
as there is no persistence. Hence we return not supported in the
response.

Also, this commit serializes the CMD_SEQNO_PERSISTENCE request w.r.t seqno
generation in ephemeral vbuckets because we must not queue up stale
requests. In regular Piper Jefferson vbuckets this is not a problem because
of cold runs of flusher task periodically. But in ephemeral we might end
up in a scenario wherein stale requests may never get notified as
there is no new sequence number triggering the notification.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Feels like this patch is doing to things (good sign of this - using "and" in the subject - which you deftly avoid by instead using ";").

Could you split into two patches please?

Patch Set 1:

Yes it does 2 things.. semi colon i thought would be more explicit than "and" in saying that. Will split the commit into 2 anyways
