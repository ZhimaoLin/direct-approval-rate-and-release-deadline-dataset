DESCRIPTION

MB-12271: Set noop interval individually for dcp connections

We need to do this because it might be the case that two servers
have their respective noop intervals set to different values. If
they are this can cause the connections to be disconnected because
each side is expecting to see a noop at different times.

Line:696, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> Can we use std::stringstream?

Line:63, src/dcp-producer.cc -> What is this magic number? Can we put the comment at least?

Line:356, src/dcp-producer.cc -> We may need to be more defendable by checking if all the characters are digits or not. You can use "isdigit()" for this.

Line:696, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> I used snprintf here for consistency with the rest of the dcp code. I think for consistency we should have a standard on what to use in ep-engine since we use both ways in different places of the code.

Line:63, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Done

Line:356, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Done

Line:696, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> And if we do want to have a stringsteam as the standard I would prefer to change it in another patch so I can change it in all places where it is used in the dcp code.

Line:696, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> No worries, it was a minor comment. As you said, we can address it in a separate commit.
