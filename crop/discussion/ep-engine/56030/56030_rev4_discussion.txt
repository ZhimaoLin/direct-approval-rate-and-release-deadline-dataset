DESCRIPTION

Remove check for previous vbucket states in test_setup

After warmup, we need not necessarily check that there are no
previous states in order to set the vbucket state to active.
CouchKVStore doesn't populate any vbucket states in memory but
ForestKVStore does initialize to dead state.
