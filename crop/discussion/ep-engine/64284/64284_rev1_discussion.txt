DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-19695: Always persist VBstate when resetting VB"

This reverts commit cb6c7141366d533874c63cb9bc0a144f9ab0347c.

While the commit does address one possible edge-case in a vBucket file
not being recreated after resetVBucket(), it is incomplete (the bug
still occurs), and having this partial fix only complicates the code.

Reverting the fix and solving the issue in a different way in
follow-up.
