DESCRIPTION

Don't create a checkpoint if the checkpoint with the same ID exists

When the replica vbucket receives CHECKPOINT_START message, this
change does not allow the replica vbucket to create a new
checkpoint if the checkpoint with the same ID already exists. But,
it still removes all the checkpoints with their IDs greater than
the ID of the checkpoint to be created.
