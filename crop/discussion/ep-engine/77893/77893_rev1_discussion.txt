DESCRIPTION

CTest: Increase maximum output size recorded to 1MB

While tests run via Jenkins record the output of each test, the size
recorded is extremely limited - only 1KB for test which pass. This can
be problematic when (for example) one is trying to analyse which tests
in a suite were slow - for many of our test programs we run many
(sometimes hundreds) of tests, and hence 1024 characters quickly cuts
off interesting data.

As such, increase the limit to 1MB.
