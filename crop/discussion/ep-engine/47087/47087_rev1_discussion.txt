DESCRIPTION

Get the DCP next snapshot if there are meta items, but no mutations

If we only get a snapshot end message when we call getItemsForCursor
then we will consider the snapshot to be empty and pause the stream.
Since a snapshot end message can only be in a closed checkpoint this
means that it's possible that we are pausing the stream for no
reason.
