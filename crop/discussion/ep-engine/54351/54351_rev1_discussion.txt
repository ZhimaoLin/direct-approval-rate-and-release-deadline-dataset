DESCRIPTION

setTakeoverBackedUpState to not use compare_exchange

The function setTakeoverBackUpState does not return a value,
however it uses compare_exchange which has the possibility
of not setting the variable takeover_backed_up to the new
value.

The function needs to do an atomic store of the new value,
which will always succeed.

Abandoned

Because the set is for a boolean, then the only time the cmpxchg fails is when trying to set true and it's already true, or trying to set false and it's already false.  Therefore it does not matter.

In fact it has been pointed out that the cmpchg is probably more efficient because it won't dirty the cache line for the cases when the cmp fails.
