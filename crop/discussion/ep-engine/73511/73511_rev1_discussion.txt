DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [6/N]: Change default worker count calculation

At the moment, the default number of reader, writer, auxIO and nonIO
threads is dependent upon the current value of the others.

This could lead to situations in which a user increases (e.g.) both the
writer and nonIO threads from the default, but later wish to return the
writers to the default (dynamically or statically) only to find they
change to a new, different value.
While not overly problematic, now users can change the number of threads
dynamically, this may seem like unexpected behaviour
