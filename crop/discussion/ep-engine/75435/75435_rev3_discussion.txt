DESCRIPTION

Change GlobalTask::getDescription to return cb::const_char_buffer

The pure virtual method GlobalTask::getDescription() returns a
std::string object. This method is actually called very frequently by
the ExecutorThreads (to log task execution / slow tasks), and hence
passing a concrete object is potentially costly, requiring an
allocation (and then deletion) for each call.

Given that the description is mostly constant for the lifetime of a
Task, change the method to return cb::const_char_buffer - i.e. a
read-only non-owning view. This reduces to passing essentially two
words, removing all memory allocation.
