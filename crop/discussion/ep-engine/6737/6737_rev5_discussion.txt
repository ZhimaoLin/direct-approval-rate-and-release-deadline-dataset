DESCRIPTION

Close TAP connections that replicate a vbucket to be backfilled

If a given vbucket on a replica node requires backfill from
another node, we should temporarily close all TAP connections on
that node, which are currently replicating that vbucket to
other replica nodes. ns-server will make a connection again when
the backfill is completed.
