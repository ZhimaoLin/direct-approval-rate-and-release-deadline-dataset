DESCRIPTION

MB-11010: reduce lock contention in processBufferedItems()

In processBufferedItems(), responses are processed one at a time
from a particular stream's buffer. This leads to a lot of contention
on the streamMutex protecting the stream. Reduce the contention by
batch-processing the responses. Currently the batch size is arbitrarily
set to 10.

Patch Set 1:

I don't have a good way of verifying beforehand if processing the batch of mutations would exceed the memory high watermark. If there are concerns, we can tNathalie Landry about it on Tuesday.
