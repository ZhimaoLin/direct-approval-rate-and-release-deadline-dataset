DESCRIPTION

MB-11010: reduce lock contention in processBufferedItems()

In processBufferedItems(), responses are processed one at a time
from a particular stream's buffer. This leads to a lot of
contention on the streamMutex protecting the stream. Reduce the
contention by batch-processing the responses. Currently the batch
size is arbitrarily set to 10.

Line:894, src/upr-stream.cc -> hmm, I realized that this becomes a problem if we can't process UPR_MUTATION when we're running of memory temporarily. This issue still happens with this new change. We need to address this issue separately.
