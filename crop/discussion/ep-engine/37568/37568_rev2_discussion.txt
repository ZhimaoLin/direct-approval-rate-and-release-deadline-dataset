DESCRIPTION

MB-11010: reduce lock contention in processBufferedItems()

In processBufferedItems(), responses are processed one at a time
from a particular stream's buffer. This leads to a lot of contention
on the streamMutex protecting the stream. Reduce the contention by
batch-processing the responses. Currently the batch size is arbitrarily
set to 10.
