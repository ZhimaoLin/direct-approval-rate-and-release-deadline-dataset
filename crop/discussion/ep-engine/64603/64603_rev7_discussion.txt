DESCRIPTION

MB-18452: Force DcpConsumer processor task to yield

Introduce a config tunable that limits how many iterations
a core loop of the Processor task can perform. This
prevents the task from sitting an running for as long
as there's data without allowing another task to run.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Couple more comments.

Changes in general look good; I like the test framework enhancements. One suggestion would be to split this into two patches - one with the refactoring / extra framework features, and the other for the actual yield fix+it's regression test. This would also make it easier for us to backport to 4.1.x if necessary in future.

Line:38, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Please move these up to the "include" paragraph

Line:93, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> I don't think you're actually using any local variables; do the wildcard capture '=' isn't necessary.

fair point, uploading split patches next

Line:38, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Done

Line:93, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> 'this' pointer is captured, without it gives a compiler error trying to call runNextTask. Without [=] " error: 'this' cannot be implicitly captured in this context"

Line:93, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> It should be possible to explicitly capture this (see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda). 

(I just think it's clearer to understand lambda functions if you can see what variables are being used).
