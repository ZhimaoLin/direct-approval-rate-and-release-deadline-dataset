DESCRIPTION

MB-20585: Fix three memory leaks

Recent changes have snuck some leaks in.

1) CouchKVStore refactoring allocated two buffers when a single
larger buffer should be used. The second buffer never gets freed.
Also a new/free mistmatch between couchstore/ep-engine is fixed.

Introduced by - 8350175

2) The watson -> master merge fixed a TSAN issue, but introduced a leak
in DcpConsumer code.

Introduced by - 7ed33aa

3) Changes in connmap mean test code can now leak cookies because the
cleanup task runs every second allowing a test to finish with an
allocated cookie.

Patch Set 2:

Sorry was attempting to add comment - but pressed submit by mistake.  I was trying to comment on the manageConnections call.

I wanted to say...
Would it be better to modify the ConnManager run function so that it just returned true if "  !connmap->isAllEmpty() || !connmap->isDeadConnectionsEmpty()"
(i.e. remove the  !engine->getEpStats().isShutdown)
