DESCRIPTION

Implement hot reload for checkpoint management

The engine can process the following commands:
. CMD_ONLINE_UPDATE_START
  The current checkpoint will be closed and new checkpoint created.
  The persistenceCursor will be blocked in the new checkpoint. As result,
  no mutations will be persisted to disk. However, an item called
  queue_op_online_update_start will be propogated via tap streams.
. CMD_ONLINE_UPDATE_COMPLETE
  The current checkpoint will be closed to mark the end of online update.
  The blocked persistenceCursor will proceed as usual. All queued items
  will be persisted since then. An item called queue_op_online_update_end
  will be propogated to slaves via tap streams.
. CMD_ONLINE_UPDATE_REVERT
  The current checkpoint will be closed to mark the end of online update.
  And hot reload process will start to revert all queued mutations during
  online update. New items will be deleted. All updated and deleted items
  will be marked as evicted in memory. An item called
  queue_op_online_update_revert will be propogated to slaves with tap streams.

Patch Set 5: (6 inline comments)



Line:229, checkpoint.cc -> Shouldn't we update TAP cursors' offset values too?

Line:284, checkpoint.cc -> The same comment as above.

Line:493, checkpoint.cc -> This function is almost the same as getAllItemsFromCurrentPosition. I think we can consolidate them into one function.

Line:588, ep.cc -> I don't see any code that notifies the hot reload completion to the client connection in the memcached engine. If you return "EWOULDBLOCK", you should notify the hot reload completion to the corresponding client connection later.

Line:1529, ep.cc -> This does not delete a k-v pair from hashtable completely. You should use vb->ht.unlocked_del(..) to perform the complete deletion.

Line:1006, tapconnection.cc -> Shouldn't we pass the checkpoint Id to the replica node so that the replica node can perform the hot reload on the same checkpoint?
