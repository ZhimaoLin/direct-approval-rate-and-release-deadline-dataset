DESCRIPTION

Defragmenter: Reduce usage of gethrtime()

The defragmenter task calls gethrtime() after each visit to check if it has yet reached the time limit for a chunk of defragmentation. However, gethrtime() can be an expensive call, especially in virtualized environments.

Add a ProgressTracker class to the Defragmenter, which monitors the rate at which the defragmenter is visiting items and hence only makes call to gethrtime() occasionally. This increases the rate at which items can be visited - on AWS (c3.4xl) increases the visted items/s from XXXXX to YYYYY
