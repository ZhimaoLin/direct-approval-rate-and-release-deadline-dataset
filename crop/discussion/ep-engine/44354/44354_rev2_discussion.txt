DESCRIPTION

Defragmenter: Reduce usage of gethrtime()

The defragmenter task calls gethrtime() after each visit to check if
it has yet reached the time limit for a chunk of
defragmentation. However, gethrtime() can be an expensive call,
especially in virtualized environments.

Add a ProgressTracker class to the Defragmenter, which monitors the
rate at which the defragmenter is visiting items and hence only makes
call to gethrtime() occasionally. This increases the rate at which
items can be visited - on AWS (c3.4xl) increases the visted rate from
3.3M items/sec to 5.6M items/sec.

Line:31, src/defragmenter_visitor.cc -> Using size_t as the type here (and others in the class) doesn't seem to fit the usage.

Line:31, src/defragmenter_visitor.cc -> As discussed offline, the get_visted_count() method returns size_t so I think it's ok to use it here.
