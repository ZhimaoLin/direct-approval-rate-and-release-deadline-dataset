DESCRIPTION

Fix ep_testsuite leaks due to ignored return values

Fix leaks in the ep_testsuite resulting from the return value of
resource-allocating functions being ignored. To assist in tracking
these issues down make use of the CB_MUST_USE_RESULT macro (which is
implemented via the 'warn_unused_result' function attribute).
