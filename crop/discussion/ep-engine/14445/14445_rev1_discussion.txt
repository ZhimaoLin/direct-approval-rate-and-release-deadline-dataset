DESCRIPTION

MB-4986: fix MC-engine stat and add backend type stat for CouchKVStore

The old stat namely "type=mccouch" indeed refers to type of Memcache engine which
can be confused with "backend type". Rename the stat from "type" to "mcengine_type"
and add new stat "backend_type" for CouchKVStore.

Thanks for this change. Everything looks good but you also need to modify/add changes in ~/ep_engine/doc/stats.doc.

Line:1483, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> You may want to also verify with QE about this change. And, I think it should be mcengine_type (instead of mcengine-typ)?
