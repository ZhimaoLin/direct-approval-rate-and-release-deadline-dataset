DESCRIPTION

MB-4986: fix MC-engine stat and add backend type stat for CouchKVStore

The old stat namely "type=mccouch" indeed refers to type of Memcache engine which
can be confused with "backend type". Rename the stat from "type" to "mcengine_type"
and add new stat "backend_type" for CouchKVStore.
