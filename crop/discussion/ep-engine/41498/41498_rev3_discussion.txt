DESCRIPTION

MB-10496 [5/6]: pause/resume visitor support for epStore & HashTable

Add new visiting methods to HashTable and EventuallyPersistentStore to
allow a client to pause the visit at a particular position, and then
resume from approximately the same position at a later time.

The methods operate in a similar way to the existing visit() /
visitDepth() methods, with the addition of a start_pos parameter to
specify where to start at, and returning the position the visitation
got to.

Clients would typically call pauseResumeVisit() with a default
Position initially (to start from the beginning), and then when they
want to pause they return false from their visit() method.

Line:531, src/stored-value.cc -> I think we need to add the following check here:

if (!paused) {
    break;
}

Otherwise, we will skip the rest of hash buckets for the current lock completely because "lock" is incremented in line 508.

Line:531, src/stored-value.cc -> Ok, but I think you mean:

if (paused) {
   break;
}

We only want to break out if the visitor *did* pause us, right?
