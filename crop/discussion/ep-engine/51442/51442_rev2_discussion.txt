DESCRIPTION

Fix race between thread create/shutdown.

Random hangs occuring on a small VM were caused by the
executorthread code not handling shutdown whilst threads
are still starting up.

Fix is to remove the create state and construct ExecutorThread
objects in the running state so there's no need to switch
from create to running, overriding a shutdown.

Normally:
---------
T1 start          |
state = CREATING  |
pthread_create    |
                  | T2 start
                  | state = RUNNING
                  |
                  | if state == RUNNING then state = SLEEPING else exit
                  | if state == SLEEPING then state = RUNNING else exit
                  |
state = SHUTDOWN  |
pthread_join      | exit
exit              |

Broken, T1 blocks forever in pthread_join:
--------
T1 start          |
state = CREATING  |
pthread_create    |
                  | T2 start
state = SHUTDOWN  |
                  | state = RUNNING
pthread_join      |
                  | if state == RUNNING then state = SLEEPING else exit
                  | if state == SLEEPING then state = RUNNING else exit
                  | ...

Fixed:
---------
T1 start          |
state = RUNNING   |
pthread_create    |
                  | T2 start
state = SHUTDOWN  |
                  |
pthread_join      |
                  | if state == RUNNING then state = SLEEPING else exit
                  | exit
