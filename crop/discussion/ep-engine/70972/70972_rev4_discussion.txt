Patch Set 4:

Dave, I was toying around with the idea of making the vbucket visitors use a unique_ptr instead of shared last night since none of them actually need shared ownership, I also consolidated the VBCBAdaptor and the VBVisitorTask since they did near enough the same thing. Is this a useful refactor?

I've also noticed that all the BackfillTask does is start another task (asynchronously) so I'm tempted to remove and it replace its usage with just spawning the real task.

I thought that the Visitor etc tasks would need to have at (least) a weak_ptr as the underlying VBucket object could be deleted (removed from the vbmap) while the background task was running - unless that's just the PauseResume  visitor?

That probably makes sense - I can't think of a good reason off the top of my head for just spinning up another task.

Ah, I think I mis-understood - I thought you were referring to a the ownership of the VBucket being visited, not the Visitor object. In which case I agree - I don't see why they need to be shared.

Patch Set 4:

Ok, I'll look at splitting this patch in two and removing the backfill duplication as well.
