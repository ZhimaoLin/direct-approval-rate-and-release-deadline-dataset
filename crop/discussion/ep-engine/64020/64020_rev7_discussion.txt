not so keen on the way we try/catch and don't return anything (of course because void return on all of addStats). I guess if it happens we at least log a warning so can probably figure out if it triggered something  failing in the caller (ns_server etc..)

Line:2500, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> hmm another silent failure from callers view, but this function is full of them :(

Line:1799, src/checkpoint.cc -> hmm, a silent failure from the callers perspective?
