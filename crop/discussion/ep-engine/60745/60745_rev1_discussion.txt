DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-17517: Regenerate CAS for TAP/DCP mutations with invalid CAS

When receiving mutations via TAP or DCP, validate the CAS if invalid
generate a new one.

This is instead of the simply dropping the mutaiton (returning an
error to the producer), as by dropping the mutation we could cause
data loss.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Thanks for raising the three patches for the backport to 4.1.0-MP1 Iâ€™ve taken the liberty of re-raising them, this time with:

a) The same ChangeId as the original patch (so they link through in Roselyn Villegas) and
b) With a link to the SHA they were cherry-picked from (to aid in tracking):

http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/60775/1
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/60776/1
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/60777/1

Please consider this alternate patch set instead.
