Line:314, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Is relaxed correct here? is it ok for this store to be reordered with respect to other operations (e.g. other loads)?

For safety might be best to use default consistency (seq_cst) given this shouldn't be that performance critical.

Line:314, src/dcp/stream.cc -> We are using atomic here only for reads in addStats call.
In other operations in the stream class the lastSentSnapEndSeqno is protected by steamMutex lock
