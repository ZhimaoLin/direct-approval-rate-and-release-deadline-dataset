Line:567, src/dcp/stream.cc -> This triggers a data race (see http://cv.jenkins.Piper Jefferson.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-watson/560/consoleFull#133717876561882284-c5b1-40af-8076-4f8cb2d12fb1) as lastSentSnapEndSeqno is written (non-atomically) from ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot.

lastSentSnapEndSeqno needs to be made atomic.

Line:278, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Leftover debug - please delete

Line:1887, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Could you add a brief description of what this test does.
