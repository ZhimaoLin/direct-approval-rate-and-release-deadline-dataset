DESCRIPTION

MB-18580 [1/2]: Unify CouchKVStore::{getItemCount,getDbFileInfo}

CouchKVStore::getItemCount and getDbFileInfo do virtally the same
thing - open a couchstore file, read the header information and then
return some subset of that information to the caller.

Given this, we can implement both in terms of a new helper function -
getDbInfo - which removes all of the code duplication between the two
(mostly error-handling).
