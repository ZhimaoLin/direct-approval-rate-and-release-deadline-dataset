DESCRIPTION

MB-19222: Fix race condition in TaskQueue shutdown

There is a bug in the use of ExecutorThread.state when sleeping a
TaskQueue - TaskQueue::_doSleep() doesn't atomically transition the
state from RUNNING -> SLEEPING. This can cause a deadlock when
shutting down a ExecutorThread:

    Thread A:                           Thread B:
    --------------------------------    ------------------------------
    if (t.state == RUNNING) {  // true
                                        t.state = SHUTDOWN
        t.state = SLEEPING              cb_join_thread(Thread A)
                                        // wait forever
    ...
    if (t.state == SHUTDOWN) { // FALSE
      exit(0) // NEVER REACHED
    }

Fix by changing ExecutorThread.state to be an AtomicValue, and use
compare-and-exchange to move from RUNNING -> SLEEPING (and SLEEPING ->
RUNNING).
