DESCRIPTION

Set open checkpoint ID to the one from the source after backfill

When the backfill is started, the destination sets its current open
checkpoint ID to 0 in order to indicate the backfill phase. After
backfill, the destination receives CHECKPOINT_START message with
the new ID from the source. Therefore, the destination should then
simply set its current open checkpoint ID to the one from the source.
