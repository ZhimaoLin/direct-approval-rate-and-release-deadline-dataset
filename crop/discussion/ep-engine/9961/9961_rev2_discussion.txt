DESCRIPTION

Added hook for stats observe

This stats command will print out the state of keys
in a selected watch set. This commit simply adds a hook
that prints out a single dummy stat:

operation observe <observe_set_name>

Future commits will tie it into the underlying observe
set table.

Line:3240, ep_engine.cc -> Why "operation"?  The signature says statname, and we don't want this to be in the stats as "operation".

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)



Line:3240, ep_engine.cc -> I can see the concern here, but let me try to put this into perspective. The code is just adding hooks and you can test to make sure that you are getting back responses. The line of code in question is a "dummy" line of code. The next commit will remove it an print out the items that are actually being observed and there will be no "observe" string (eg. it will match the spec).

This is a good thing to bring up, but I want to mention that in this review and in others there might be minor temporary things that are added in for the sake of getting something working correctly. This allows me to test things incrementally and paint a clear picture of what I am trying to do.

In the future I will try to mark them in the reviews.

Patch Set 2: No score

I'm -0 on this now.  This is why I thought a feature branch made sense.  

Steve or Dustin's call though.
