Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Please add the description of "alog_sleep_time" engine parameter to docs/engine-params.org and the description of "ep_num_access_scanner_runs" to docs/stats.org.

Line:23, configuration.json -> The dynamic should be set to true

Line:27, configuration.json -> The max should be more than one day. Let's set the max to 3 days.

Line:23, configuration.json -> Actually this has to be false for dynamically tunable parameter. It used to be true but no setAlogSleepTime function was ever generated.

Line:27, configuration.json -> Done
