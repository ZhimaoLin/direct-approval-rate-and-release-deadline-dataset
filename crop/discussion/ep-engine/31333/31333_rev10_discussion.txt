DESCRIPTION

Move towards using C++11 atomics

Start by renamimg all use of Atomics that doesn't "break" by
switching to std::atomic to AtomicValue (when the transition
is done we'll rename everything back).

Good work! Trond,

I have only one clarification question in atomic.h

Line:243, src/atomic.h -> Shouldn't it be "#ifndef USE_CXX11_ATOMIC" because CouchbaseAtomic is used only if C++11 is not supported?

Line:243, src/atomic.h -> Hehe, THis one is actually never used ;-) That's why I didn't detect that one.. I was using it in a transition period.. Nuking it..
