DESCRIPTION

MB-11107: Ack at least every 5 secs to clear the upr flow ctl buffer

When there are no more ops being sent through replication we should
still ack whatever we have processed. If nothing has been acked
for 5 seconds we should send an ack.

Line:361, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Can you explain why we need 5 sec ACK interval? Is it similar to the TAP_NOOP message?

Line:361, src/upr-consumer.cc -> As discussed, the reason is that if the consumer has some bytes that it has processed and no more items are being sent to the consumer then we want to let the producer know that they have been processed. In terms of functionality this is not a must, but it makes it easier when debugging a cluster to see that the buffer has been fully drained. This means that if we see a cluster with bytes that have not been acked and the cluster is in steady state then there is likely a problem.

Also, note that we only ack if there are buffer bytes and 5 seconds is a random number I chose.
