DESCRIPTION

couch-kvstore: Use vector instead of unordered_map for cached counts

CouchKVStore has a map of vbucketID to counts of deleted/non-deleted
documents. These are currently implemented using std::unordered_map,
however we pre-populate them up to the maximum number of vBuckets
supported. Therefore we might as well just use a flat std::vector and
save the hash lookup cost each time.
