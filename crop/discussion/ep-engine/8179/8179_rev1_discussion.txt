DESCRIPTION

Support backward compatibility to 1.7 version for TAP backfill.

1.7 TAP producer does not send BACKFILL_END messages for individual
vbuckets. This causes the backward compatibility issues in 1.7.1
TAP consumer. Therefore, the 1.7.1. TAP consumer should detect the
backfill completion for each vbucket by looking at checkpoint_start
messages recevied from 1.7 TAP producer.
