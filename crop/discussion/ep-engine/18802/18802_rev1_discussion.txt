DESCRIPTION

MB-5624 Use TAP producer's creation time as its connection token

As a memcached's connection instance is reused for future
incomming TAP connection requests, it should not be used for the
TAP producer's connection token that is used to determine if a
bg fetched item is still valid and should be pushed into the queue
or not.

This change uses the TAP producer's creation time as its
connection token instead.
