DESCRIPTION

MB-5790 Move the existing dirty item to the end of open checkpoint

Previously, we performed the deduplication by removing the
existing item and appending the new item to the end of the open
checkpoint. This might cause some more memory overhead because
the old existing item might be still referenced by the flusher or
the TAP producer.

This change simply moves the existing dirty item to the end of open
checkpoint for deduplication.
