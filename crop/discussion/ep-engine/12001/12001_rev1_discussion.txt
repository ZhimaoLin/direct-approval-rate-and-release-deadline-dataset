DESCRIPTION

MB-4553 Support delete operations during online restore.

For fast recovery, we allow the online restore to be interleaved
with delete as well as set operations. For this, deletions of
existing or non-existing keys, which are received from the upstream
master via TAP or the normal clients, are maintained to skip the
same keys from the restore backup files.

Upon the restore completion, the list of keys deleted will be
removed.

Mike, I think your original fix to the deletion issue turns out that it can incur inconsistent replication for items deleted. We should fix that bug in a different manner instead of simply putting items returned with NOT_FOUND into the checkpoint datastructure.

I'm going to hold off on scoring this until I get a little bit more context. Let me know if it's an urgent change.

One minor thing

Line:1354, ep.cc -> Other places in the code that use INVALID_CAS end up returning ENGINE_KEY_EEXISTS.

Line:1354, ep.cc -> For deletion, it should still return ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT instead of ENGINE_KEY_EEXISTS. ENGINE_KEY_EEXISTS stands for "The key already exists" and used to indicate the update failure due to invalid cas values.
