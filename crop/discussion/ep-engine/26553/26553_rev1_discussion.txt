DESCRIPTION

MB-8323 add ExecutorPool::endTask() for better job termination

This commit is mainly for better syncronization among still
running tasks and bucket deletion. This change adds the new
method, endTask(), to differentiate between task cancellation
by request (cancel()) and task termincation after completion.
With this each bucket/thread know how many tasks are currently
running and can properly shutdown during the bucket deleteion.
