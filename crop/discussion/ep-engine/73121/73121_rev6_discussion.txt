DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Ensure isBackfillTaskRunning is correctly set

In ActiveStream::completeBackfill if in STREAM_BACKFILLING state and
pendingBackfill is true then we will schedule another backfill.  This
will cause isBackfillTaskRunning to be set to true.  The flag should
remain true on exit of the completeBackfill function.

(7 comments)

Line:27, tests/module_tests/mock_stream.h -> Nit: reference symbol needs to be closer to the type rather than the variable.

Line:35, tests/module_tests/mock_stream.h -> same here

Line:80, tests/module_tests/mock_stream.h -> same here

Line:124, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> This should be "vbid".

Line:426, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Nit: typo on isBackfillTaskRunng.

Line:264, src/dcp/stream.h -> Curious to know as to why the commenting style is different compared to the others in the same class.

Line:57, src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Nit: Indent seems more compared to the rest of the code in the function.

Line:420, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Shouldn't we do this ?
    inverse = false;
    if (itemsReady.compare_exchange_strong(inverse, true)) {
        producer->notifyStreamReady(vb_);
    }
