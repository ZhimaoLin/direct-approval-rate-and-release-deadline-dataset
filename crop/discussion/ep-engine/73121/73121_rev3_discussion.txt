DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Ensure isBackfillTaskRunning is correctly set

In ActiveStream::completeBackfill if in STREAM_BACKFILLING state and
pendingBackfill is true then we will schedule another backfill.  This
will cause isBackfillTaskRunning to be set to true.  The flag should
remain true on exit of the completeBackfill function.

Line:420, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Again, this is a slightly contrived way to formulate atomic exchange:

    if (!itemsReady.exchange(true)) {
    //

Line:277, src/dcp/stream.h -> bit of an odd way to achieve atomic assignment, why not just:

    isBackfillTaskRunning = b;

?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:420, src/dcp/stream.cc -> realised can actually just be itemsReady = true;
