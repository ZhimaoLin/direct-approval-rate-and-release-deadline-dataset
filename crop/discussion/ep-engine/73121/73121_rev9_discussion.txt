DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Ensure isBackfillTaskRunning is correctly set

In ActiveStream::completeBackfill if in STREAM_BACKFILLING state and
pendingBackfill is true then we will schedule another backfill.  This
will cause isBackfillTaskRunning to be set to true.  The flag should
remain true on exit of the completeBackfill function.

Line:30, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Nit: Should be ordered with the order directory-level includes ("" vs <>)

Line:167, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Delete these.

Line:283, src/dcp/stream.h -> I think it's preferable to remove these and just have the Mock inherit and add the methods it needs - better to keep the actual production interface as simple as possible.
