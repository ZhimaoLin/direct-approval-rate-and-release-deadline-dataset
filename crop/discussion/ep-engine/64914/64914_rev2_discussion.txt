DESCRIPTION

MB-19833: Set a minimum boundary for config param bfilter_key_count

We can have a 'divide by zero' error if we have bfilter_key_count set
to 0 in configuration. Further it does not make sense to have the
param, which expects estimated key count per vbucket, to be set to 0.

This commit hence adds a validator to the config param to make sure
it is not below 1.
