DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Filters with deleted collections

Upstream integration revealed an issue with the VB::Filter.
If we construct a filter with a collection "X" and "X" is actually
marked as deleted, "X" should not be part of the filter.

We fix this by replacing VB::Manifest::doesCollectionExist with
VB::Manifest::isCollectionOpen which performs the correct checks.

Tests updated to cover this case.
