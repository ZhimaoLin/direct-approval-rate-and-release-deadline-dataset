DESCRIPTION

Set the last sent seqno as the backfill end when backfill finishes

When we do backfill we might ask for all items up to certain seqno,
but the last backfilled item will be less than this seqno. This
happens when items before the backfill end seqno have been
deduplicated and can result in the stream not closing if the end
seqno is the same as the backfill end seqno because the stream
might think it still has more items to send.
