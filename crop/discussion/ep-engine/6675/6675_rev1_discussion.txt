DESCRIPTION

Don't push any backfill items into the current open checkpoint.

We observed that pushing all backfill items into the current open
checkpoint causes OOM in the destination node in heavy DGM during
or after rebalance. This change fixes this issue by having a
separate backfill queue per vbucket and pushing all backfill items
directly into the outgoing persistence queue.
