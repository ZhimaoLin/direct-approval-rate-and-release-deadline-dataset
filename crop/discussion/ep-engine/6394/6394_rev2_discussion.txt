DESCRIPTION

Provide what VB's last state was right before the cluster went down

This change provides what the last recorded state of each vbucket
was right before the cluster was down due to some unexpected issues
or normal shutdown. This stat can be used for restoring the entire
cluster in different machines.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I think this looks good, but for a couple tiny naming things.

Line:175, vbucket.hh -> The inverse of this is in toString.  Perhaps it'd make sense to call this fromString?

Line:210, vbucket.hh -> Why not just prevState?  getPrevStateOnWarmup sounds like you want to know if it will get the previous state while warming up.

I suppose prevState sounds like whatever the state was immediately prior to the old state.  How about initialState?

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Did a quick pass through test and is exactly what I need, major thanks for getting through this so quickly.
