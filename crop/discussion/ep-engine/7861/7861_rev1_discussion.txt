DESCRIPTION

Don't allow the "backfill items" in the same batch as the other items

The "backfill items" for a vbucket is not part of the deduplication logic
we've got for the items to store, so that we might have duplicate entries
for the same key in the same transaction. The way we've implemented the
transaction in mccouch this won't work. By adding a commit we'll ensure
that we don't have duplicates of the same key in the current transaction
and the data we're adding (but there _may_ be duplicates in the list
we're adding).

I need to sync up with Chiyoung why these items aren't part of the
deduplication logic. (This patch make it a bit less likely we'll run
into the problematic situation, but it does not completely remove it)

Patch Set 1: Fails

Seems like a lot of the test counts the number of items in the flusher queue :(
