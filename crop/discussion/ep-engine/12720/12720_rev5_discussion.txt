DESCRIPTION

MB-4714: Reset connection if mccouch stops responding

If mccouch crashes after we send a request and before we receive
a response then ep-engine will wait forever for a response that
won't come. This change introduces a new parameter called
couch_response_timeout that will cause ep-engine to re-establish
a connection to mccouch if it a request doesn't come back for the
given amount of time specified in couch_response_timeout. By
default this parameter is set to 10 minute.
