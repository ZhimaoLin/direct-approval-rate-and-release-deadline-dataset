DESCRIPTION

MB-4693: Reset connection if mccouch stops responding

If mccouch crashes after we send a request and before we receive
a response then ep-engine will wait forever for a response that
won't come. This change introduces a new parameter called
couch_response_timeout that will cause ep-engine to re-establish
a connection to mccouch if it a request doesn't come back for the
given amount of time specified in couch_response_timeout. By
default this parameter is set to 1 minute.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

at least units... but I didn't read it in huge detail.

Line:52, docs/engine-params.org -> units

Line:93, configuration.json -> Probably worth pointing out this is milliseconds (or just make it seconds -- I don't know that we need this type of granularity).  I don't know what else is common in here, though.

Line:94, configuration.json -> Says dynamic false, but looks like you added dynamic update support for it?  Did I read that wrong.

Line:52, docs/engine-params.org -> Done

Line:93, configuration.json -> Done

Line:94, configuration.json -> I set it to true and the set function disappeared for this value so I made it false.
