DESCRIPTION

MB-4693: Reset connection if mccouch stops responding

If mccouch crashes after we send a request and before we receive
a response then ep-engine will wait forever for a response that
won't come. This change introduces a new parameter called
couch_response_timeout that will cause ep-engine to re-establish
a connection to mccouch if it a request doesn't come back for the
given amount of time specified in couch_response_timeout. By
default this parameter is set to 5 minute.

Patch Set 4:

I addressed Chiyoung's change about removing the dynamic field. I will try to fix that bug later. I also raised the timeout to 5 minutes. Please let me know if it should be higher than this, but we need to get this change in soon since the code freeze is today. Also, I think due to the fact mccouch can crash like this it seems like a bad idea to submit things for persistence that we know will take a long time to commit. Maybe that should be another change on top of this.

Personally I'd set this timer to 15 minutes+. This isn't a problem we're expecting to see, but it will prevent us from being locked up forever. I'd rather have us wait a bit too much if we're having a problem than aborting a transaction just because the system was under heavy load.. (followed with a huge alarm we would monitor for.

How about 30 minutes. Is anyone opposed to this?

Patch Set 4:

This is getting pretty far out there.  At 30 minutes, it starts to be a lot less useful, perhaps even 15 minutes.  Do we have any idea how long things are taking on the long side on these tests?  I don't think we should be tuned for transactions taking 10 minutes or so to commit.

Patch Set 4:

Ok, I'm not going to propose any more default timeouts for this since I don't have much experience with how long this usually takes. Trond, Dustin, Chiyoung, please come to agreement on what a good value is so that I can update this commit.

Patch Set 4:

Let's just throw in 10 minutes as the default, get it wrong, and update the config later.

(note that you have the default timeout described in the commit message as well)

Noah Dean: do you expect this to happen often since you think waiting those extra minutes will make a lot of difference? if so id say we should fix the other issue ;)

Patch Set 4:

I don't expect it to happen often, and I do think we should fix the other issue as well.  This is is the core of the timeout on the ep-engine side and we're just down to the default value, so I think we shouldn't worry about it too much right now.  We should just push something through and reconfigure it later.  I think having it be adaptive is a good idea, and probably not all that hard, but a bit out of scope right now.

Mike: can you update the timeout to 10 minutes so we can push this through?
