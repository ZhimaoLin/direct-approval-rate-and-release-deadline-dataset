Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Removed the goto, wasn't aware this was a policy. Is this documented somewhere?

There are no other goths in our source code except for libcouchstore, but that followed a completely different coding style.

Using goto is something a lot of programmers try to avoid and dislike since it makes it harder. To figure out where the code came from (in a core file for instance). Add c++ in there with constructors etc you might have a hard time figuring out what happened. If you also add macros that sets members and jupm it's a complete mess to look at in a core file...
