DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-16632: As part of queueDirty schedule a DCP connections notifier task"

This reverts commit fa17728e7ca0c637c84a2208b5decfe7ba7e54f1.

Performance testing of the current branch revealed that performance was down and
it was identified that commit fa17728 was the cause.

A number of attempts have been made to fix the regression, and even though performance
can be improved it has been found that performance is at its best without fa17728.
