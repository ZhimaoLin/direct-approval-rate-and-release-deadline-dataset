DESCRIPTION

Only record and item as deleted for its persistence callback

We increment the stat for an item being deleted from a vbucket
when after we pass the callback to the kvstore. This will cause
the count to get screwed up if the delete fails and the delete
has to be retried. This stat should be incremented when the
delete actually succeeds.

Line:2437, ep.cc -> I think we should do the same thing for set as well. Let's do it as a separate commit.

Patch Set 1: Verified

I think the set function is actually done correctly, but I'll double check.
