DESCRIPTION

Update mccouch batch size upon receiving a new transaction size

As the mccouch batch size is determined by dividing the
transaction size by the max number of concurrent mccouch workers
allowed, it should be updated if a transaction size is changed.

Line:243, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to notify this batch size change to mccouch because the batch size only matters to ep-engine. mccouch will create a new worker when it sees an item with the new vbucket Id.
