DESCRIPTION

MB-23767: Notify vb high priority requests in a separate task

Vbucket high priority requests are made by ns server during rebalance
wherein it expects a notification when the vbucket receives upto a
particular seqno.

We must send this notification in a separate task rather than in
front end thread to avoid deadlocks due to lock inversion.
That is, a front end thread generally makes call down the stack and
acquires locks in the order top to down (in our software stack).
But a notification path is up the software stack and hence must be
done as a separate task.

The current deadlock that was hit is captured in MB-23767.
