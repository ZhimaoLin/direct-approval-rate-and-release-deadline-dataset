DESCRIPTION

MB-18580: Fix failing CV testcase "tap_filter_stream"

Testcase fails with segv with the following error message:
"CouchKVStore::getDbFileInfo: Failed to open database file
for vBucket = 1 rev = 1 with error:no such file"
The reason of this failure is race condition between thread
which creates couch-db and thread which opens this file for
read operation (to get DbFileInfo).
Fix for the failure:
1. prevents core dump if couch-db has not been created
 at the time when it is being opened for read;
2. reschedules VBucket backfill task requesting to open
couch-db if task to create couch-db has been scheduled already;
3. issues proper error message that couch-db does not exist
and cancels VBucket backfill task requesting to open couch-db
if task to create couch-db has not been scheduled already.
