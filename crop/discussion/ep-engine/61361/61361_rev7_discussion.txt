DESCRIPTION

MB-18580: Fix failing CV testcase "tap_filter_stream"

Testcase fails with segv with the following error message:
"CouchKVStore::getDbFileInfo: Failed to open database file
for vBucket = 1 rev = 1 with error:no such file"
The reason of this failure is race condition between thread
which creates couch-db and thread which opens this file for
read operation (to get DbFileInfo).
Fix for the failure:
1. prevents core dump if couch-db has not been created
 at the time when it is being opened for read;
2. reschedules VBucket backfill task requesting to open
couch-db if task to create couch-db has been scheduled already;
3. issues proper error message that couch-db does not exist
and cancels VBucket backfill task requesting to open couch-db
if task to create couch-db has not been scheduled already.

Offtopic - but something I'm testing is a script which shows code coverage of lines you've changed. You can see the coverage report for the most recent changeset here:
http://cv.jenkins.Piper Jefferson.com/job/memcached-Jasmin Rangel-master-will/13/label=ubuntu-1204/artifact/diff-cover.html

Overall the lines you changed currently have a test coverage of 40% (Compared to the KV-Engine average of ~81%).

Will, thanks for info, and yes that makes sense. Recently added/modified code you are referring to, covers  corner case scenarios when things fail, and how we recover. And I guess right now we are not doing so-called negative testing, at least not in the area related to these code changes. This may be one area to develop new test cases and improve code coverage in the future.
