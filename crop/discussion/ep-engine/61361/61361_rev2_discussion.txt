DESCRIPTION

MB-18580: Fix failing CV testcase "tap_filter_stream"

Testcase fails with segv with the following error message:
"CouchKVStore::getDbFileInfo: Failed to open database file
for vBucket = 1 rev = 1 with error:no such file"
The reason of this failure is race condition between thread
which creates couch-db and thread which opens this file for
read operation (to get DbFileInfo).
Fix for the failure:
1. prevents core dump if couch-db has not been created
 at the time when it is being opened for read;
2. reschedules VBucket backfill task requesting to open
couch-db if task to create couch-db has been scheduled already;
3. issues proper error message that couch-db does not exist
and cancels VBucket backfill task requesting to open couch-db
if task to create couch-db has not been scheduled already.

Line:547, src/warmup.cc -> Watch out for white spaces.

Line:266, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Aren't you deprecating this with this change, I suggest keeping the above comments however.

Line:544, src/warmup.cc -> Make return type couchstore_error_t and check if != COUCHSTORE_SUCCESS ?

Line:2226, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why not make the return type couchstore_error_t?

Line:119, src/backfill.cc -> Make return type couchstore_error_t and check if err_code != COUCHSTORE_SUCCESS, this way you could put a log with the returned error code in case of failure.

Line:266, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> I was trying to minimize changes on forest-kvstore side for not, but I agree, this is minor. I'l' change this as well.

Line:119, src/backfill.cc -> Here are few reasons "uint16_t" is used as a return type and not a couchstore_error_t:
- couch-kvstore and forest-kvstore have different types for error handling: couchstore_error_t vs fdb_status. So casting to "uint16_t" will allow to support both of them.
- type couchstore_error_t is not available at ep-engine/src level at this point, and it's my understanding that was done intentionally to hide implementation of underlying store from ep-engine level. Is not it?
- in one of the future projects (kvstore error/warning improvement project) I believe we should have same set of error messages (same enum) for couch_kvstore as well as forest_kvstore, and at that time we should expose return value of error code to application at ep-engine/src level.

Line:266, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Replacing the above function with the one below is what you're doing in this change, so this would need to be done.

Line:119, src/backfill.cc -> You'll need to add a common function in kvstore that would decipher error messages from couch-kvstore or forest-kvstore.
This means that you'd need to invoke the new kvstore api, that would call into the couchkvstore or the forestkvstore api based on the underlying store.

p.s couchstore_error_t should be available to use.
