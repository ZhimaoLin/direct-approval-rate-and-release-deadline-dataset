DESCRIPTION

MB-18580: Fix failing CV testcase "tap_filter_stream"

Testcase fails with segv with the following error message:
"CouchKVStore::getDbFileInfo: Failed to open database file
for vBucket = 1 rev = 1 with error:no such file"
The reason of this failure is race condition between thread
which creates couch-db and thread which opens this file for
read operation (to get DbFileInfo).
Fix for the failure:
1. prevents core dump if couch-db has not been created
 at the time when it is being opened for read;
2. reschedules VBucket backfill task requesting to open
couch-db if task to create couch-db has been scheduled already;
3. issues proper error message that couch-db does not exist
and cancels VBucket backfill task requesting to open couch-db
if task to create couch-db has not been scheduled already.

Patch Set 5:

Patch Set #5 incorporates code improvements in the proc CouchKVStore::getDbFileInfo suggested in previous review by Dave R., as well as rebased version of the code to the latest on the master branch (it would not compiled otherwise without merging code with the latest).

Line:610, src/kvstore.h -> As per Abhinav;'s comment, returning a uint16_t is essentially meaningless, given you actually use per-instance constants (COUCH_XXX, FOREST_YYY) in the subclasses. How is a caller supposed to know how to interpret the error code (and act on the result) - they have no idea what the subclass is.

This would be solved if you changed to use exceptions for the error handling case.

Line:129, src/backfill.cc -> This should probably be at least NOTICE level, and maybe even WARNING - note that INFO level isn't printed to the log file by default.

Line:610, src/kvstore.h -> Yes agree, this will be changed to use exceptions as part of KV-store error handling improvement project, and getDbFileInfo is not the only low level proc which will be impacted by that change. And that's why it makes sense to introduce this new feature (I have already started class KVStoreException and several error code type specific classes derived from it) consistently all over the code and not one proc at a time. Also it was my understanding that the goal of this commit was to fix failing regr test case vs improving error handling, and that was the target of the code changes submitted. I think the caller should not be aware about underlying subclass, this way it will be consistent with OO design, and keep caller/engine independent from underlying/specific storage implementation. And I hope to support this independence between caller and storage layer as part of KV-store error handling improvement project. Right now, with current implementation caller just needs to know if return result of the call is success/failure, and based on that as well as get_vbstate_persist it decides to cancel the backfill task or to reschedule it.

Line:129, src/backfill.cc -> Changed type to WARNING. It had type INFO because message just few lines above regarding backfill task temporary suspension had type INFO as well.
