Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

I'm seeing whitespace-only changes which means that git doesn't know the code has just been moved - please could you revert these.

What I did to detect this was run all your changes through "git blame" - which shows the last commit to change a line, with move & copy detection enabled - i.e. git should be able to detect that actually a line wasn't changed by a given commit, but simply was moved.

The command I used was:

 git show --stat <SHA> |grep \||cut -f 2 -d ' '| xargs -n1 git blame -M -C | grep <SHA>

Where <SHA> is the SHA of the commit I'm analysing (e.g. 7c8aa164).

This prints who is to "blame" for all lines, and then greps those lines which git identifies as coming from your commit (even with move detection enabled). For convenience the full output is at: https://gist.github.com/daverigby/565426e0b50cefcd106e

Basically you want this to only output stuff which you actually changed (e.g. new headers, includes etc).

Line:302, src/tapconnmap.cc -> You've changed the formatting of this (see my top-level comment for more details).

Line:319, src/tapconnmap.cc -> You've changed the formatting of this (see my top-level comment for more details).
