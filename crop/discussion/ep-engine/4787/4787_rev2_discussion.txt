Patch Set 2:

Is there a specification of this command in the membase wiki?

If sync is always a per-key operation, why not use one of the bits in flags with existing mutation commands like add/set/delete? If sync-persistence or sync-replication was requested along with the mutation itself, then there is no need to keep extra variables to StoredValue.

Is there a strong reason for sync(k) as a separate operation independent of the mutation op itself? Does it justify the cost of increased StoredValue size?

Patch Set 2:

Sync is an independent operation from the mutations just as it is with filesystems.  You can perform a lot of operations, but choose a subset of them you want to sync, and do them in different ways.

You may have a few keys you want to sync on replication and others you want to sync on persistence.

Documentation is forthcoming, but there's a bit of an old writeup here:  https://gist.github.com/039d4b16b3fb96554df1

Thanks for the gist link. I'll leave my further comments there as my thoughts are around protocol itself.
