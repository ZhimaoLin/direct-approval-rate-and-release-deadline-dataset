DESCRIPTION

MB-5908 sort flushing items by descending order of vb

This simple write optimization reduces disk contention by distributing
CouchKVStore's write I/Os in descending order of vb, which is opposite
order of Couchstore's Compactor. The compactor distributes its I/Os in
ascending order of vb.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This is not correct. I think we should reorder them in couchkvstore at the time of commit because we sort dirty items per vbucket in optimizeWrites(). Sorry for the confusion.

No prob. I should have been more clear about it.
