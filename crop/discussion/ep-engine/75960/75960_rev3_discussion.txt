Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

TAP code is the only real issue.

Line:2743, src/ep_engine.cc -> If this code is truly TAP-only, then I don't think we should be allowing XATTRs here.

Line:5134, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: long line.

Line:5639, src/ep_engine.cc -> Might be worth pulling this code into a simple helper function seeing as we have a few instances of it.
