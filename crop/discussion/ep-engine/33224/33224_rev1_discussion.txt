MB-10122: Handle stream response with no failover log

This will allow us to be able to return an error instead of
crashing the entire program later down the execution path.

Line:238, src/upr-consumer.cc -> If we return ENGINE_ENINVAL here, then what will happen in the producer side? Does the producer close the connection? Or Does the consumer send a stream request again?

Line:238, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Good point. In this case this would indicate a bug in ep-engine since a failover log must be received. I think in this case we should probably just close the connection. Let me know if you think doing something different would be better. Also note that the old behavior was to crash the server.

Line:238, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Then, we should close the connection by returning ENGINE_DISCONNECT.
