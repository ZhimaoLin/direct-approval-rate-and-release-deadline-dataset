DESCRIPTION

Introduces set_meta operation in kvstore and SQLite layer

This change-set introduces a new kvstore level operation, namely
setMeta() to enable client to update a subset of columns, e.g.,
key metadata,  without writing a complete row including value
column to db file. It also implements SQLite support for
operation setMeta().

Patch Set 6:

We don't have unit tests for kvstore, and will provide the separate unit test module to test kvstore API implementations later.

Patch Set 6:

Probably we need a unit test for all KVStore operations, not just set_meta.

Patch Set 6: (2 inline comments)

Yeah, there are some design problems in kvstore that prevent it from being directly testable enough.  Much of that is my fault.  I discovered it recently when trying to build a simple scripting interface over kvstore and finding that it has some inexcusable layer violations that make testing hard.

In general, if something's hard to test, it's because of a design flaw.  The test suite for ep-engine grew after the initial prototype, so we didn't notice it at the right level.  Fixing this won't be particularly hard, but it will do great good.

Of course, all kvstore implementations will need to support this forever.  A bit of history:  We started with kvstore as an abstraction and then pulled it because the support requirements of kvstore frontend and the backend were too difficult.  We brought them back when it stabilized.

Do note that master has four kvstore backends, and I'm likely to need to write a sixth fairly soon (I have already written a fifth).  Of all of them, only SQLite even has the ability to express a partial update, and we're planning on killing it off in the long term.

Line:206, kvstore.hh -> It's not clear what this method does, but I don't think it's what the doc says it does.

Line:208, sqlite-pst.hh -> this looks aligned incorrectly

Line:126, sqlite-kvstore.cc -> Please align them with the same way of other codes

Line:206, kvstore.hh -> Junyi, please address the comment from Dustin here. The comments isn't clear. It should be something "Update the meta fields of a key in the kv store"
