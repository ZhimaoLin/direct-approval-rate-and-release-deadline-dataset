DESCRIPTION

MB-5013: tap/gat command does not go persistent

This change-set fixes the bug by making expiration time persistent.
Itintroduces a new kvstore level operation namely setkey() to
enable client to update a sunset of columns, e.g., key metadata
without writing a complete row including value column to db file.
It also implements SQLite support for operation setkey() and a
CouchStore level implementation is required if we forward merge
this fix to 2.0.
