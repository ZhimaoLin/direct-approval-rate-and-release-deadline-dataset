as opposed to hard coding in the length.

Line:824, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I rather define these const strings as static const std::string variables in DcpConsumer and then pass their pointers and string.size() values.

Line:823, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> C++ std::string for these is certainly the neatest.  You could also be slightly optimal here and do sizeof("string")+1 which can be 'compiler optimised' to the same value that the runtime strlen will return. But go for Chiyoung's suggestion as the compiler vs runtime saving are minimal :)
