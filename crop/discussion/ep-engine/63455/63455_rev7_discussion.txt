DESCRIPTION

VBucket: optimize getBGFetchItems() from O(n) to O(1)

VBucket::getBGFetchItems returns an unordered map of all pending
bgfetches, by copying all elements from pendingBGFetches into the
return value, and then clearing pendingBGFetches.

However given the return value and getBGFetchItems are the same type,
just use the swap() method to exchange them.

In a simple unit test (added with this patch, this speeds up adding
and then retrieving 50,000 items from 174s to 103ms - a 69% speedup.

Line:340, src/vbucket.cc -> Its been so long ago since I looked at the logic here, but are we sure that the fetches map is empty at this stage? (in the previous version fetches could contain items and would grow with the new content)
