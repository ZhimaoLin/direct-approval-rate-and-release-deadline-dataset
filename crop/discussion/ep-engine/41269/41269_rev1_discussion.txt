DESCRIPTION

MB-12137: Use the disk seqno if it's greater than the max persist seqno

It's possible that if an operation fails to be persisted then it may
be persisted out of order at a later time. As a result we need to
use the disk persistence seqno if it is greater thn the max persist
seqno of the items in the batch that we're writing to disk.

Line:2750, src/ep.cc -> If this out-of-order issue happen, then it means that we have some serious bugs in the flusher path (e.g., racing between vbucket delete / recreate and the flusher). I don't think this will fix the root cause completely.

Line:2750, src/ep.cc -> I agree that there is likely something else going on here. In the case of the active vbucket the snap start/end numbers are essentially meaningless since they are always the same as the high seqno. What I saw happening in Perry's test was that the high seqno was was 1 greater than the snap start/end seqno's when the node was gracefully shut down. When it came back up  for delta recovery the vbucket transitioned to replica state and due to the incorrect seqno replication couldn't be started.

Given that this issue is difficult to reproduce I was hoping to work around the issue and given that the snap start/end seqno is not important for the active vbucket I figured this would be a reasonable fix.

I'd like to leave this change in review for now and will continue to work with Perry and Parag today.

Also, another potential workaround fix for this would be to correct the error for active vbucket during warmup. Note that I don't particularly like either of these changes and plan on improving the handling of the snap start/end seqno post 3.0 since the current implementation has been quite error prone.

Abandoned

Makes the issue happen much less, but doesn't fix the problem.
