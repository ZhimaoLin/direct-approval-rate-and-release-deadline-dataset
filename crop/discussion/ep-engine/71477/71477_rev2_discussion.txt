DESCRIPTION

MB-21889: Reduce stats test iterations & remove unrequired test variant

On local development machine the runtime of ep_perfsuite run three
times is:

1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   44.47 sec
1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   35.02 sec
1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   41.61 sec

By reducing the number of iterations of the stats tests by an
order-of-magnitude (fast stats 1000 to 100, slow stats 100 to 10)
and by removing the single vbucket variant of stats calls with sets
being performed on a background thread (the 100 vbucket variant
remains) the run-time is reduced to the following:

1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   30.24 sec
1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   21.36 sec
1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   19.88 sec

The time contributed by the stats call is now small.  As show by the
results of the following experiment where all the stats test were
temporarily removed from the ep_persuite:

1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   19.55 sec
1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   18.61 sec
1/1 Test #27: ep_perfsuite.value_eviction ......   Passed   26.44 sec
