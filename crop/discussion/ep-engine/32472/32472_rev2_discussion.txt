DESCRIPTION

MB-9693 Return ENGINE_SUCCESS if an item is updated during bg fetch

If an item (that might not exist before) is inserted while we are
processing a bg fetch request for its metadata, we should not
return any error codes, but instead ENGNINE_SUCCESS, so that the
memcached worker thread can return that item's metadata to the
client.
