Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

The "Style" comments don't need to be changed, just suggestions.

Line:520, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I'd use a switch here with a case for WRITER and READER. This is then future-proofed in case we add some third access type as the compiler will error that there's an unhanded case.

Line:729, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> DBFileInfo already has a default constructor (which initialises it's member variables to zero), so this memset is unnecessary.

Line:830, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: You might find it more readble to use `auto` for the declaration of itr here.

Line:853, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I'd probably drop the default case here and explicitly handle ONLY_DELETES (with the same code you have for the default case presently). Then add a check after the switch that you had a valid filter (e.g. bool validFilter), and throw another exception there if it wasn't valid.

The rationale is the same as the above comment - as / when we add a new filter type you'll get a compile error if it's not handled in the switch (and you don't have a default case).

Line:944, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: Again here, you might find `auto` simpler / clearer.

Line:302, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Might be worth adding some comments here - specifically what backfillLock is used to guard (just backfills? also some other members?)
