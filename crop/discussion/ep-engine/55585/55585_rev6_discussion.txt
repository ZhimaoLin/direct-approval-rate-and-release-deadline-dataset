Line:380, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Add a comment here perhaps, indicating why this would always need to return 1 for the couchstore path.

Line:229, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Since key dump supported isn't configurable, and this essentially always returns true always, you could just get rid of this functionality?

Line:233, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> A comment here as well, to indicate that this would return the number of read-only kv instances.
