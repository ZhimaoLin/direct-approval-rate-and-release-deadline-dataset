Line:999, src/warmup.cc -> Minor comment: It is probably better to move the first comment line to the function definition in a header file and the rest of lines to the function body.

Line:1017, src/warmup.cc -> It seems to me that we don't need to maintain 'allVbStates' as a member variable of warmup, but instead can simply declare it as a local container within this function.

Line:760, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Can we move this function to the line after 777, so that we don't need free fdb_kvs_name_list  in the failures of geKvsHandle() and fdb_get_kvs_info() below.

Line:763, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Minor comment: please log 'status' error string value by calling fdb_error_msg().

Line:775, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ditto

Line:836, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please log 'status' error string by calling fdb_error_msg API
