DESCRIPTION

MB-19746: Add xml output to ep_perfsuite

- The new performance commit validation, CBNT, requires input data
  in XML format which mirrors that of the GTest XML output
- This commit adds this functionality to ep_perfsuite, providing
  the ability to output the results in textual format or xml
- It can be invoked by using the new `-f` flag, followed by either
  `xml` or `text`, if this flag is not specified then the default
  behaviour of textual output is assumed

(3 comments)

Line:40, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> alphabetical order?

Line:85, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> const int?

Line:1015, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> as you are moving the code, can you move item_count onto the same line?

Line:1015, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Given this is a cherry-pick of code already in master, I'd prefer to keep it the same to minimise differences between the branches, so I'm going to leave fixing these "minor" issues.
