Chiyoung,

Let me know if you think my comments make sense.

Line:40, src/upr-producer.cc -> I don't think we need this. Since the stream_t is reference counted it will be cleaned up automatically in the destructor.

Line:268, src/upr-producer.cc -> Add
streams.remove(vbucket);

Line:273, src/upr-producer.cc -> Let's add.

streams.remove(vbucket);
ready.remove(vbucket);
