DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Split atomic.h into multiple files

The AtomicQueue is only used in one place, and the ThreadLocal
is also just two places. This is the first step trying to
minimize their scope.

Can #include atomic.h be removed from any other files now?

Line:3, src/threadlocal.h -> Same again

Line:3, src/atomicqueue.h -> Update copyright for the new year? :)
