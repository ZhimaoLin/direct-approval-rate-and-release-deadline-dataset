(14 comments)

Line:30, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Why "extern C" ? This is a function with static visibility in a C++ file; I don't see why it needs C linkage.

Line:553, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This is Sparta^WC++ - please use static_cast<>

Line:635, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I find this (and `cl`) below pretty terse / non-obvious names - both are callbacks so naming one `cb` isn't very helpful.

How about something like `getval_cb` and `lookup_cb` ?

Line:639, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> If these are never changed make them const.

Line:647, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> What about all the other potential errors? The code as it stands isn't very defensive.

I'd suggest re-structuring so you explicitly check for ENGINE_SUCCESS (which I assume if the expected value), and the "expected" error cases (EEXISTS and ENOMEM) and handle as you have, and in the else case throw an exception or similar. 

(Restructuring into a switch statement is also probably worthwhile).

Line:683, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same here - it's not very defensive. Explicitly check for success, and fail if anything else is found.

Line:767, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This seems a pointless change; given the fixed string in the format ("partition") is non-zero in length you'll always get at least that length in the success case; so less than zero is what you want for the error-case.

Line:1305, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Safer to use a switch statement here, then you're explicitly testing each possible enum value (and if another enum is added it'll be easier to spot / edit).

Line:1320, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please update to include the method name (ForestKVStore::scan)

Line:1589, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Don't need \n in log messages, it's appended automatically.

Line:1600, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Include function name in log message.

Line:1602, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Use PRIu16 for vbucket ids

Line:1629, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto (function name in message, use PRIu16 for vbucket id, no \n)

Line:1637, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Again

Line:683, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We are to return FDB_CHANGES_CANCEL only in case of ENOMEM, for every other case we would just need to return FDB_CHANGES_CLEAN.

Line:767, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I'll undo this change as it isn't related to this commit, there is a warning with the existing code today "comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false", should be address separately.
