Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Line:624, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Might as well move this down to when it's first used (line 677 or so)  - easier to follow the code then.

Line:679, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We should still be defensive here - what if someone changed the code so a new error could come from the getval_cb? As it stands it would just silently "succeed".

Please explicitly check for the success case and if we get anything else then report an error.

Line:692, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ptr on wrong side (it's part of the type, not the variable).

Line:992, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> same

Line:1335, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> probably simpler to just switch, and have cases for SUCCESS, CANCELLED and default.

Line:1570, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: this is a pretty long function (almost 100 lines). Consider if it can be split to aid readability.

Line:624, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:679, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:692, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Oops, think I undid the previous change by accident.

Line:1335, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1570, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> The size of this function has already been trimmed down with this change. But you're right - it is still slightly long, however most of those lines are log messages. But otherwise most of the functionality in use here is quite specific to the rollback operation.
