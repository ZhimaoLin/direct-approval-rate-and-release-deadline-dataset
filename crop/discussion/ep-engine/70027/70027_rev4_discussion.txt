MB-20079: Ensure updateWaketimeIfLessThan performs a compare_exchange

The patch MB-20079: Use std::chrono::steady_clock (ProcessClock) with
changeID: I2fc9688abb782fe2c9e80efb6da840be3643d4a5 introduced a bug
where the waketime could be incorrectly updated, due to not performing
a compare_exchange_strong.

This patch reverts to using a compare_exchange_strong, ensuring that
waketime is only updated if it is less than the input time_point.
