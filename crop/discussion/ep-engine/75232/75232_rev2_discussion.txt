DESCRIPTION

Create a backfill obj with the subclass ActiveStream rather than Stream

Backfills are scheduled for only active streams. It is appropriate to
create a backfill object with ptr to sub class ActiveStream rather than
creating it with a ptr to Stream and then casting to ActiveStream ptr.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:50, src/dcp/dcp-types.h -> I believe from the new coding standard type names need to start with an upper-case letter (e.g. ActiveStreamRCPtr).

Worth checking with DaveR whether I have got this correct.

Line:75, src/dcp/backfill.h -> Active

Line:50, src/dcp/dcp-types.h -> Will wait for DaveR's comment on whether we stick with this old way of naming things to be similar to others here or go with the new naming standards

Line:75, src/dcp/backfill.h -> Will fix

Line:50, src/dcp/dcp-types.h -> I think either way could be argued - although the Golden Rule would suggest we keep consistent with the existing code: https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#introduction
