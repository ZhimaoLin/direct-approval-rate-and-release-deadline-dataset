DESCRIPTION

Fix occasional parallel make failures.

ep_engine.h includes generated_configuration.h (via
configuration.h). So every target that builds something that uses
ep_engine.h must also depend on ${CONFIG_SOURCE}.

See my comment on the commit message. If that's OK then feel free to publish, as the code itself seems correct.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> CONFIG_SOURCE actually contains generated_configuration.cc. I think the change you did is probably correct, but the commit message is misleading, isn't it?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah, but both generated_configuration.cc and generated_configuration.h are generated in a single step.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok... do be aware that by putting CONFIG_SOURCE in your ADD_EXECUTABLE(), you'll actually be linking generated_configuration.o into the executable. I assume that's OK?
