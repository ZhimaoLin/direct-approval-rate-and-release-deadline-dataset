DESCRIPTION

MB-19153: Break circular dependency while deleting bucket

As part of unregistering the last bucket, when stopTaskGroup
is invoked, all the running threads will cancelled. In this
issue reported, when DcpBackfill was closed, the ref count of
the DcpProducer whose reference it was holding on to became
zero, causing its destructor to be invoked. In the DcpProducer's
destructor, an attempt was made to cancel the checkpoint creator
task which needed to acquire the executorpool's tMutex that
unregisterBucket had already acquired.

Reproduction steps:
<delete_bucket> --> <unregister_bucket> --> <stop_task_group>
    --> <acquire tMutex> --> .. --> <cancel DcpBackfill> -->
    --> <destroy DcpBackfill> --> <destroy DcpProducer>
    --> <cancel Checkpoint creator task> --> [tries to acquire tMutex]

The fix here would be to not attempt to kill the task within
the DcpProducer's destructor, but to do so when the producer is
being disconnected.

Line:1059, src/connmap.cc -> I think we can consolidate clearCheckpointProcessorTaskQueues() and cancelCheckpointCreatorTask() into one function like "cancelCheckpointProcessorTask()", as they can be treated as a single cleanup function.

Line:1094, src/connmap.cc -> Ditto.

I t think we can think of the following case for the unit test:

1) Create a DCP producer
2) Load some items (probably not small number of items) into active vbuckets, to make the DCP producer's checkpointing task active
3) Destroy the bucket

Patch Set 1:

We can spawn a separate thread for a bucket deletion while the main thread is still loading items into active vbuckets.

Patch Set 1:

So the way bucket deletion is mocked in unit tests, is with test termination.
I was able to reproduce the hang at a unit test level however.
