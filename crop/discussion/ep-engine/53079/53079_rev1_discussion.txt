DESCRIPTION

MB-15634: Fix memory leak in setFlushParam

The msg parameter used to return an error message isn't freed by the
caller, as it is expected to only point to a statically-allocated
string.

Dave, I think the plan is to merge this change to sherlock. Sundar has already raised your commit to the sherlock branch here: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/53083/. We should perhaps abandon this change and just merge the sherlock commit and merge it into master.

Abandoned

Abandoning master version as we've already cherry-picked to sherlock branch (and that will be merged back to master).
