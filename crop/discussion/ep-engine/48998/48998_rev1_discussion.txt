DESCRIPTION

MB-14205: Delete backfill tasks upon closeStream

When a stream is create and closed continuously with
the connection alive, I observed a memory leak, as the
backfill task for the stream was never deleted.

Scenario:
Step1: Create a connection
Step2: Open a stream and close 500 times

Track memUsed, before step2 and after step2:

Without Change:
memUsed before: 44015152
memUsed after: 53081456

With Change:
memUsed before: 44013520
memUsed after: 44131608

Line:151, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I think you need to release the lock here and then delete the backfills

Abhinav,

I fixed the issue of the the backfills not getting deelted and the problem had to do with ref counting the DcpProducer. I actually tried out a canceling change a few weeks ago and there were deadlock issues so I would prefer that this wasn't merged without extensive testing. I also think this issue should be resolved i the latest code so please have Andrei rerun the test to see if we still need to make more changes.
