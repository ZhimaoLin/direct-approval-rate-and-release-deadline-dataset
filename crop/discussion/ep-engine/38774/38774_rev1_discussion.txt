Line:2383, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Is this the only field to be updated? How about purge_seqno?

Line:2383, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I was really only thinking about fixing the high seqno in this case, but I will fix them all here. I think the purge seqno, doc count, and deleted doc count are the only ones that should be updated here.
