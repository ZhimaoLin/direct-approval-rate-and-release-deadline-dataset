DESCRIPTION

MB-5709 Track warmup item counts (key/value) per warmup phase

Removed warmedUpMeta count that was seperately tracking total count of
items being loaded during access log key and data dump. Instead
both warmup_key_count and warmup_value_count now track the progress of
warmup counts based on warmup state (phase).
