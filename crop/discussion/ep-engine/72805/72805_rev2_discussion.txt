DESCRIPTION

Move Flusher methods to EPBucket and make no-ops for Ephemeral

The set of methods to control the flusher -
{start,stop,pause,resume,wakeUp}Flusher() - should only do anything
for persistent buckets.

As such, move their implementations either:

1. To empty virtual methods on KVBucket, with the previous
   implementation into EPBucket overrides (if they need to be called
   on any KVBucket object).
2. To non-virtual methods on EPBucket directly, if they are not called
   outside that class.
