Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The indentation looks wrong in here.

I *think* it's mostly right, but this feels wrong:

   new item comes in
   clients = true
   list updated

   item removed
   new item comes in
   clients = true
   clients = list_size
   list += new_item

I think if the above happens, we'll just not look at the data (or I read something wrong).

I think the code generally looks good, but I think there are a few things aren't quite in the right place. It looks like we are trying to bypass the observe registry when there is nothing in it.

Line:45, observe_registry.cc -> Don't need this here. Since you have this line of code in addObserveSet then clients will always be true as long as we have an observe set in the registry

Line:61, observe_registry.cc -> Move this line of code to removeObserveSet.

Line:94, observe_registry.hh -> This doesn't appear to be initialized. Should be false. Is that the default?

Line:45, observe_registry.cc -> Commenting above the lines that you are tNathalie Landrying about makes for really confusing review emails.  :)

Line:94, observe_registry.hh -> The intel atomics don't have initializers, but ours initialize to 0.
