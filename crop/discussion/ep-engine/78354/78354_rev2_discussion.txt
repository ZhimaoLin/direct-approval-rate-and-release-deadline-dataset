DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Map SystemEvent to mcbp::systemevent

This commit maps the ep-engine SystemEvent enum value to mcbp ones.
Not all SystemEvent entries are things we replicate using dcp and
changes to SystemEvent shouldn't result in changes to the values
we transit.

This is a linked memcached/ep-engine commit
