DESCRIPTION

MB-15926: Create new snapshot on consumer when necessary

Create a new snapshot on the replica if the open checkpoint
had no items in it, as its possible that the snapshot_start
wouldn't be updated correctly in the scenario where the
new producer sends a snapshot marker for a bunch of
mutations from within 1 single checkpoint.
