DESCRIPTION

MB-12928: GetMeta to return confResMode if requested

GetMeta request will be extended where extras can
contain 1 byte indicating if extended meta data
will need to be sent. If this 1 byte were 0x01, we
will ship the conflict resolution mode along with the
rest of the metadata for the particular key.
