Line:210, src/warmup.h -> why three "/"?

Also "array of vector of VBucket IDs" is hard to process.  What about... 

Pointer to an array of vectors (one vector per shard). ...

Line:206, src/warmup.h -> Also what about documenting this one?

Line:210, src/warmup.h -> three "/" is the convention for documentation rather than just a comment so doxygen picks it up. although I think it would make more sense to use the '/**' style, especially for a multiline.

Also the necessitation of a comment suggests that the type information is insufficient (a vector of vectors would be more appropriate). From the iso guidelines "Types are the simplest and best documentation".

Agreed - I have an MB open to use an actual std::vector. However as it stands you can't tell from the type if it's a single vector or actually a vector (hence the comment) ;)
