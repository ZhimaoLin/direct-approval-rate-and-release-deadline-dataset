Line:29, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> Can we use "swtich" and return the corresponding string?

Line:97, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> Instead of calling it recursively, can we simply return "true" so that it can be scheduled again with a new state? I don't think it will cause any significant impact on the performance.

Line:146, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> I'm not sure if this will support pausable backfill or not. It seems to me that it scans all the items required in a single run.

Line:97, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> Done

Line:146, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> This will not support pausing backfills. I have one more change that I haven't put in review that allows us to pause. I haven't added it yet since I want to make one more change to the way it works, but have been busy with 3.0.1 stuff. I'll add it as a WIP so you can see what I did.
