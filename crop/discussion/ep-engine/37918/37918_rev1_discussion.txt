to account for it as freed bytes.

Line:160, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I don't think it's a good idea to create a instance even if an error occurs. We can get the size of message from static messageSize variable or calculate it using parameters (e.g., nkey, nvalue,).

This can be applied to all the other changes below.
