Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:163, src/executorthread.cc -> As hrtime_t is 64bits, '%llu' should be used instead.

Line:94, src/taskqueue.cc -> We will lose the granularity of wait. For example 999999999 / 1000000000 will wait for 0 secs, which can cause some perf regressions. You can type-cast these parameters to double (i.e., static_cast<double>(snooze_nsecs) / 100000000.0) or add the new wait(hrtime_t nanosces) to SyncObject.
