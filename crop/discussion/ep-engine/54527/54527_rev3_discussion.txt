Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:240, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> C++ throws std::bad_alloc if it fails to allocate memory. See http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/bad_alloc Replace with:

    try {
       response = new StreamEnd...();
    } catch (std::bad_alloc&) {
       return ENGINE_ENOMEM;
    }

Line:969, src/dcp-stream.cc -> you don't need to grab the mutex to check the input parameter so it could be moved one line up. I personally find it easier to read:

    if (resp == nullptr) {
        return ENGINE_EINVAL;
    }

(but thats my personal taste)
