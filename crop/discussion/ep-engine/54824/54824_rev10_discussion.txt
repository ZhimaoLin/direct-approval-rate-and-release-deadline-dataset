Line:49, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think these numbers need to be checked - I'm surprises uncompressed and compressed are identical...

Line:49, /COMMIT_MSG -> Documests were shipped as is (un-compressed) based on the current logic because, the compressed length was greater than  the original length.

Line:49, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well in that case the current BINARY_RAND payload isn't really very useful as it's never compressed :)

Having said that, It's perhaps arguable that having a "worst case" payload which doesn't compress is useful to look at the effect DCP compression has on latency when we can't compress the document.

How about you keep this benchmark for now to help with reducing the worst-case cost - however it's probably worth adding a comment in the code that compression (by design) fails on this input - to save any future questions like I had! :)
