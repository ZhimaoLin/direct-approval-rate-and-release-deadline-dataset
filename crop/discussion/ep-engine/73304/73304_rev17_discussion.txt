DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [3/N]: Allow dynamic changes to number of threads

Reader, Writer, AuxIO and NonIO threads can now be dynamically stopped
and started using the interface previously used to set the maximum
number of these threads - i.e., setMaxReaders.

The behaviour is outwardly the same - the max controls how many tasks of
a given type can be run concurrently, but this can now be dynamically
tuned both upwards and downwards.

Patch Set 17: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Line:166, src/executorpool.cc -> did clang-format add the spaces? Not needed

Line:181, src/executorpool.cc -> nit: whilst here can you line up the [] on 181 please :)

Line:494, src/executorpool.cc -> can you make this a new to_string method in-case we need it anywhere else, why not just return worker_writer_ as well (remove some further down appends).

Line:518, src/executorpool.cc -> this function feels like some more comments of what is happening would be useful

Line:123, src/executorpool.h -> nit: "the for which" ? do you mean "for which"

Line:126, src/executorpool.h -> desired_count makes me think that I ask for 20, but the code might not honour it. A different name on the variable will make the API a little more readable. Also note we use camelCase
