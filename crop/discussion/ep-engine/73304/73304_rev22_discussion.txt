DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [3/N]: Allow dynamic changes to number of threads

Reader, Writer, AuxIO and NonIO threads can now be dynamically stopped
and started using the interface previously used to set the maximum
number of these threads - i.e., setMaxReaders.

The behaviour is outwardly the same - the max controls how many tasks of
a given type can be run concurrently, but this can now be dynamically
tuned both upwards and downwards.
