DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Collections DcpProducer

1. Enable SystemEvent Items in "Item::shouldReplicate"
2. Update DcpProducer so that it grabs the various bits of collection
   data for the transferred events and calls through the engine's dcp
   system_event callback

An update synchrounous engine test now links a MockDcpConsumer to
a MockDcpProducer and drives events from one to the other.
