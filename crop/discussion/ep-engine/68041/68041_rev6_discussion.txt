DESCRIPTION

MB-20623: MutationLog: Remove unused Delete and Uncommitted functionality

The MutationLog (when actually used for Mutations) could record
Deletes (in addition to 'adds') of keys, and return a list of
'uncommitted' keys.  However this functionality has long been unused
(since March 2013, http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/26943).

Remove this unused code to simplify the way the MutationLog class is
now used - for the access log.
