DESCRIPTION

ObjectRegistry: reset to default upon destroying engine

Add an ObjectRegistry::reset() method which restores the state to that
before initialize() was called. This ensures unit tests which call
getAllocSize() will get consistent results irrespective of if previous
unit tests created any engine objects or not.
