DESCRIPTION

MB-3568 Synchronize checkpoint_start between the master and slave.

In addition to the checkpoint_end message, the checkpoint_start
message should be synchronized between the master and slave so that
the master can transmit mutations after confirming an ACK for
checkpoint_start message.
