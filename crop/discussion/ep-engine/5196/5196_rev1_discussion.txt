DESCRIPTION

fixed bug found by GCC -Werror

GCC suggested to parenthesize && and failed because of -Werror. Closer
inspection revealed that we _do_ want to return not-my-vbucket for
missing vbuckets otherwise we'll face SIGSEGV of death. So we want to
put parenthesis around ||, but I decided to simplify expression by
applying De Morgan's law and 'pushing down' negation through
conditions.
