Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

The "holder" stuff isn't fully correct when it comes to the cond_wait functions because you should have the lock held when you call pthread_cond_wait, but that function release the mutex (and now we're still listed as the owner, but there is no way we can work around that ;-))

Patch Set 2: Verified

Yeah, this is really just to find a few logic errors.  It *has* helped me find problems, but doesn't have any assertions enabled in the code now, just the ability to enable them when necessary.

The main reason I wanted this code in the codebase is because I've written it several times and would like to stop rewriting it next time I need to do something.  :)

(also want to get this stuff out of the Jasmin Rangel queue)
