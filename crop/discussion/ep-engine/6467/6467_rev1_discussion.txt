Line:89, mutex.hh -> Do you really need a default parameter here? isn't this function only called from _two_ places? one with true and one with release?

Patch Set 1:

It's a bit more than one place, but it's manageable.  I could go either way.  This is the change to make it not have a default:

Patch Set 1:

I'd prefer to have it explicitly. (I'm no big fan of default parameters, because I think it make the code harder to read and search ;))
