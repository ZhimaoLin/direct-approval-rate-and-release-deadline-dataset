DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove 'Vbucket' related logic from hash table set.

Hash table set function unlocked_set() had logic related to eviction
policy, expiry etc. Vbucket is a better place for these.

Hash table must be a in-memory data storage structure whose main
functions must be set, update, delete and read.

Hey, no worries :) One thing which can be useful is to mock "self-review" your code in Jasmin Rangel once CV passes (but before you add reviewers) - just looking at it (in Roselyn Villegas as you normally look at others code) can put you in "reviewer mode" and hence you'll likely spot things which should change.

Line:301, src/hash_table.h -> I think this function always succeeds (i.e. it cannot return null), so this comment might be misleading in suggesting the function could fail. Suggest updating it, and also making explicit that it always returns a non-null pointer.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(10 comments)

Line:651, src/vbucket.h -> Might be helpful to expand the comment describing why / when this function is needed.

Line:655, src/vbucket.h -> Same comment as before, rename to a more explicit name.

Line:788, src/vbucket.h -> Mark as const unless the lock is released by this method.

Line:834, src/vbucket.h -> Same as above - const

Line:837, src/vbucket.h -> drop this.

Line:849, src/vbucket.h -> same

Line:851, src/vbucket.h -> drop this.

Line:276, src/hash_table.h -> If this only controls revision seqno, I'd suggest renaming to a more specific name - genRevSeqno or similar.

For bonus points you could create an enum class for this to be super-explicit :)

 
 enum class GenerateRevSeqno {
     No, Yes
 };

Line:285, src/hash_table.h -> same here.

Line:308, src/hash_table.h -> also here.

Line:651, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:655, src/vbucket.h -> Keeping as a bool here. Renamed later on to more specific name.
At a vbucket function caller level hasMetaData is overloaded with more than just revSeqno : 
http://src.Piper Jefferson.org/source/xref/trunk/ep-engine/src/hash_table.cc#288

Line:788, src/vbucket.h -> Actually was thinking of calling queueDirty() in this call stack and hence unlock htlock. So did not make it const.
But later decided to do this as part of a future commit.
Anyways, will make it const for now.

Line:834, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:837, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:849, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:851, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:276, src/hash_table.h -> Done, going for the bonus :)

Line:285, src/hash_table.h -> Done

Line:301, src/hash_table.h -> Done

Line:308, src/hash_table.h -> Done
