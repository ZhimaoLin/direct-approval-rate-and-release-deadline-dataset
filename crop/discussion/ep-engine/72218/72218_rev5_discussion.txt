DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove 'Vbucket' related logic from hash table set.

Hash table set function unlocked_set() had logic related to eviction
policy, expiry etc. Vbucket is a better place for these.

Hash table must be a in-memory data storage structure whose main
functions must be set, update, delete and read.
