DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move enums mutation_type_t and add_type_t to hash_table.h file

Enums mutation_type_t and add_type_t indicate the result of hash table
opeartion and hence hash_table.h is the correct place.

Also, chance these to safer 'enum class' rather than just enum.

Line:32, src/hash_table.h -> I'm not sure `Type` is a particularly accurate name for these - even if it was already called type. Perhaps we can use this opportunity to use something less confusing (e.g. MutationStatus)

Line:45, src/hash_table.h -> ditto
