DESCRIPTION

MB-11658 compactor must purge tombstones if drop_deletes set

This must be done unconditionally. Current logic will not
purge any tombstones if ns_server does not set the drop_delete flag.
However in 2.5 the expectations is that if
drop_delete flag in compactor is set, delete all tombstones unconditionally
if drop_delete flag is not set, purge tombstones based on purge_seqno value
