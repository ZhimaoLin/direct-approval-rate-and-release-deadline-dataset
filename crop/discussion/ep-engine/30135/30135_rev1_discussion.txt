DESCRIPTION

Start migrate the API for our Atomics to look like std::atomic

This patch change the Atomic class CouchbaseAtomic, and change
the API so that:
  get() => load()
  set() => store()
  cas() => compare_exchange_strong()

and move some of methods that used to be members as
template functions.

Looks good overall. As you mentioned, more changes are needed to complete this migration. We can merge this change as a starting point. You may need to rebase it.
