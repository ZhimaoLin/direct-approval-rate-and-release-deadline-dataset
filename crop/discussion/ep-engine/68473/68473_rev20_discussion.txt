DESCRIPTION

Use == and compare instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug where we attempting
to string compare for 'hash' however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4
into strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with == and string::compare.
It also clean-ups some of the code, whilst maintaing the same logic.

Patch Set 20: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Line:4782, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nicer to use `sizeof("diskinfo")` - it's self-documenting what the 9 represents (and makes it obvious what to change if the stat key ("diskinfo" ) itself ever needs changing.

Same for the 6 - `sizeof("detail")`

Line:327, src/ep_engine.h -> (perhaps as a follow-up patch) This doesn't really have anything to do with EPEngine - it can just be a free function which can use used by any code - string_utils.cc/h sees a sensible place.
