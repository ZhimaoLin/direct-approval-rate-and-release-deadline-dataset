DESCRIPTION

User find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.

Line:4768, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'd actually just simplify these straight to the top level as `statKey == "diskinfo"` and `statKey == "diskinfo-detail" (it's also technically broken at the moment as it accept a wildcard between 'diskinfo' and 'detail') as it's easier to understand the intent then.

Line:4769, src/ep_engine.cc -> I know this was a previous patch, but this should be ENGINE_ENOENT

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Use

Line:4768, src/ep_engine.cc -> I want to keep functionality exactly the same.  And as you correctly say currently a wildcard is accepted between disking and detail.  Therefore keeping the same behaviour.

Line:4769, src/ep_engine.cc -> Similar to the previous comment - want to keep functionality identical and therefore want to return ENGINE_EINVAL.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
