DESCRIPTION

Use == and compare instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug where we attempting
to string compare for 'hash' however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4
into strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with == and string::compare.
It also clean-ups some of the code, whilst maintaing the same logic.

Line:41, src/string_utils.h -> what about moving all of these functions (later on) to platform and put them in cb::string:: 

(seems like some could be useful elsewhere?)

Line:41, src/string_utils.h -> Yes agreed - seems like string utilities need not been ep-engine specific - will chat with Dave.

Line:30, src/string_utils.cc -> It's generally considered bad form to put the type of a variable into the variable name ('Str'). 

Also 'compared' and 'comparing' are overly similar making the function harder to read, they also give zero indication as to which is the prefix and which one is being checked for a prefix (Having read the function body I'm still unsure which one is the prefix). I would suggest calling one of them 'prefix' instead.

Line:36, src/string_utils.cc -> Can be simplified to
```
return comparedStr.compare(comparingStr) == 0;
```

Patch Set 24:

Jim requested the following: the stats patch seems to be getting lots of churn, i'm reading that code though and thinking it should be data driven rather than having the huge if/else if/else if with all the compares, can we define a table of data with strings, lengths and function pointers to the handlers, then just have the code wNathalie Landry iterate the table and call the handler?

Therefore will work on changing to data-driven approach
