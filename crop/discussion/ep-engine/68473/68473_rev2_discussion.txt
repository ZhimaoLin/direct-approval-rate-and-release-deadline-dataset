DESCRIPTION

User find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.

Line:4659, src/ep_engine.cc -> nit: const

Line:4668, src/ep_engine.cc -> Ones where the whole key must match could probably just be done as `statKey == "tap"`. I don't know if this area represents enough of a bottleneck to justify the string length check.

If it is enough of a bottleneck then you can actually get C++ to be smart enough to work out the string literal length via a utility function with some clever templating. I've written an example of how this may work here:

Patch Set 2:

Will make the const change.
To keep the semantics exactly the same, we need to keep the string length check.
Otherwise xxxtap would match as would tapxxx.

I checkout your templating approach
