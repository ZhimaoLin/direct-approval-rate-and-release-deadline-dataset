DESCRIPTION

User find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.

Patch Set 4:

I dpn't think the templating is necessary as I don't think there is a bottleneck on identifying the stat.  The cost is the stats collections, which in quite a few stats is very high.

I have opened up the review to others, to get their thoughts.

Line:4657, src/ep_engine.cc -> This is bad - you'll pass a null string to printf(). I know we shouldn't have a null stat_key and non-zero nkey, but /if/ that was passed we'd crash here. 

Better to leave as it was IMHO.

Line:4664, src/ep_engine.cc -> This in incorrect - we need to check that the key /starts/ with the given string, not it contains it anywhere. You need to use `== 0` instead of `!= std::string::npos` - to see if the string starts with it.

I'd also suggest dropping all the key == X checks, they are redundant now.

Line:4677, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think this separate check for the prefix and suffix is over-complicated. Just check for the whole key (and then you don't need to have hard-coded offsets to start from).
