DESCRIPTION

Use == and compare instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug where we attempting
to string compare for 'hash' however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4
into strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with == and string::compare.
It also clean-ups some of the code, whilst maintaing the same logic.

Line:4641, src/ep_engine.cc -> Don't pass by value - if you're copying the strings you're kinda defeating the point of optimising this :)

Line:4643, src/ep_engine.cc -> Not trying to bike shed, but I think this could be improved:

1) It's not clear from the name (to me) exactly what this does (as per string::compare isn't clear). Maybe rename to 

 isPrefix(key, "dcp")

2) The start_position is (mostly) 0 in your usages - again probably worth defaulting that argument (and hence move that to the end).

Line:4653, src/ep_engine.cc -> Why the catch? I can't see why this will throw...
