DESCRIPTION

User find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.
