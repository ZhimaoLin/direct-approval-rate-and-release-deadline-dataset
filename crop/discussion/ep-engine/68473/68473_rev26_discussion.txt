DESCRIPTION

Use == and compare instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug where we attempting
to string compare for 'hash' however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4
into strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with == and string::compare.
It also clean-ups some of the code, whilst maintaing the same logic.

Patch Set 26:

Jim,  After tNathalie Landrying to Dave, we decided to leave the code as is.  Although it probably would be cleaner being data-driven, this function has not been shown to be a performance bottleneck.  And its probably best I invest my time in looking in more detail into the actual stats.  Hopefully your OK with this, and at least this patch is a little improvement on what we had before.
