DESCRIPTION

User find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.

Patch Set 3:

>To keep the semantics exactly the same, we need to keep the string length check. Otherwise xxxtap would match as would tapxxx.

It shouldn't be necessary if you do a direct comparison (ie. `std::string("dcp") == "dcp"` as that requires an exact match.
