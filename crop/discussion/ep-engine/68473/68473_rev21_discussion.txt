DESCRIPTION

Use == and compare instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug where we attempting
to string compare for 'hash' however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4
into strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with == and string::compare.
It also clean-ups some of the code, whilst maintaing the same logic.
