DESCRIPTION

Use find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.

Line:4575, src/ep_engine.cc -> can we not just use == throughout?

Line:4593, src/ep_engine.cc -> why is this one find?

Line:4575, src/ep_engine.cc -> Because sometimes we want more than an identical match.
For example in the tappagg we are looking for a string "tapagg ???" where the ??? is additional text.

Similar for the dcpagg.

Line:4593, src/ep_engine.cc -> Similar to comment above

Line:4575, src/ep_engine.cc -> find is going to be inefficient for prefix lookup then, it will search the entire string, when you could stop on a single byte compare.

Line:4575, src/ep_engine.cc -> Fair point.

If we care about the performance of this (I don't know if it's here or elsewhere we spend time in stats), I'd suggest using string::compare (which does only compare the needed bytes) - maybe wrapping it in a starts_with() method for brevity.
