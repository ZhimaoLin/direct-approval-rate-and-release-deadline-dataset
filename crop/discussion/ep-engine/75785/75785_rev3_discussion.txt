DESCRIPTION

MB-23550: return NULL from initScanContext() on failure

The callers of this function treat a NULL return value as an error
(which is handled), however we currenlty throw an exception from it on
error, which isn't caught. Change to use the same method of
propagating the failure and simply return NULL (after logging the
failure).
