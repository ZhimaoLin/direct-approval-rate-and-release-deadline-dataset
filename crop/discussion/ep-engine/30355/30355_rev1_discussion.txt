DESCRIPTION

MB-9559 Don't collect expired items on replica vbuckets.

Expired items are identified on active vbuckets and replicated
to the replica vbuckets. Therefore, we don't need to collect the
list of expired items on replica vbuckets and push them into the
flusher queue. This will be also conflict with the UPR seqno
based replication.

Line:62, src/item_pager.cc -> Should we keep this commented code here? Otherwise this looks like the same logic as before.

Line:523, src/ep.cc -> We are no longer using queueExpired anymore so we should remove it from the function args.

Line:62, src/item_pager.cc -> I forgot to uncomment checking the active vbucket. I will upload the new patch.

Line:523, src/ep.cc -> We still use it in flushOneDelOrSet(...). We should not soft-delete or queue the deletion of an expired item from the flusher.

Line:523, src/ep.cc -> Sorry about that. For some reason I thought that variable got deleted.
