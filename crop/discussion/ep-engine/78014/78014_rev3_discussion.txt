DESCRIPTION

MB-24244: Prevent duplicate items in an inMemoryBackfill

Have rangeRead ignore stale items if their replacement also appears in
the requested range, for example

 A₁  B₂  C₃           Initial items
[A₁  B₂  C₃]          rangeRead 1-3
[A₁  B₂  C₃] B₄       Update B
 A₁  B₂  C₃  B₄       RR ends
[A₁  B₂  C₃  B₄]      new RR 1-4, B₂ should be ignored because B₄ is
also in the snapshot
[A₁  B₂  C₃  B₄] B₅   Another update, but B₄ must still be sent as B₅ is
not in the range
 A₁  B₂  C₃  B₄  B₅   RR ends

To achieve this, when marking items as stale, we store in it a pointer
to its replacement. To avoid bloating the OSV, we reuse the UniquePtr
which points to the items successor when in the HashTable. Once the item
is stale, it will never be used for that purpose again, leaving it free
for reuse.

This is a basic solution. It would be better to not have to take the
writeLock, but improvements of that form will be done in a separate
patch.

Looks good overall

Line:152, src/linked_list.cc -> From the commit message:
do you have any thoughts on how you can escape with holding this 'writeLock' ?

Line:152, src/linked_list.cc -> Given that the stale flag is already an atomic, and is the last thing changed when an item is transitioning to stale, we /might/ be able to just not hold the lock in this case.
a. We already have a rangeRead, if this is not stale, or just becoming stale then we will need to return it anyway.
b. once the stale flag is true the replacement has already been set.
