DESCRIPTION

MB-8530 Non-blocking checkpoint stats call for all vbuckets

We saw that the timings of checkpoint stats call for all vbuckets
was ranged from 16ms to 262ms, which seems quite high. These
checkpoint stats are frequently requested by the cluster manager
during cluster rebalance. This change supports the non-blocking
checkpoint stats call for all vbuckets, so that the worker threads
can process other requests while the stats call is being processed
by the NON-IO dispatcher.
