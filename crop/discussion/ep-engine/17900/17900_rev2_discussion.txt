Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Line:294, checkpoint.cc -> It is very minor but I think you can simplify nested else statements by consolidating them into a single if (!not_moved_to_next_checkpoint) statement.

Patch Set 2: Verified

I can't do two passes at 40M, but I'm on my 28th at 30M so far, so I think the bulk of this is good.  Thanks a ton.
