DESCRIPTION

MB-16632: Replace std::list with std:deque in DCP checkpoint processing

The algorithm does not need a std::list when it is implementing
nothing more than an queue.

This change brings some performance improvement to snaphot marker
creation.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:669, src/dcp-stream.cc -> deque instance "items" should be cleared before returning from this function. Otherwise, the next snapshot will include the items from the previous snapshot (Please see the line 628 above)

Line:619, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Minor one: To avoid the copy constructor call on queued_item, we can use the reference instead:

queued_item &qi = *itemItr;

Line:669, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I think this is fine, as `items` is only called from nextCheckpointItem(), where it's a local variable which is destructed once that function returns.

(Admittedly it is perhaps a bit clearer if we just clear()'d it here after iteratorating, but it's not incorrect.

Patch Set 4: -Code-Review

(1 comment)

Line:669, src/dcp-stream.cc -> If CheckpointManager::getAllItemsForCursor() in line 604 returns more than one checkpoints, then the issue that I mention can happen. However, I confirmed that getAllItemsForCursor() returns only one checkpoint at most. Therefore, we don't need to clear up "items" deque instance in the current implementation.
