Line:2525, src/ep.cc -> Could it be a race that we're querying the uuid after we got the seqno?

Line:2525, src/ep.cc -> I am not sure I understand what the race is though. If you can illustrate potential race scenario, it might help clarify.

Line:2525, src/ep.cc -> Can the the UUID for the vbucket change after we got the seqno and we request the UUID (so that we return a seqno for an incorrect UUID). The likelihood is probably really really small, but...

Line:2525, src/ep.cc -> The UUID that we are getting is this case is the cached version of the current vbucket. As far as I know, the uuid can change due to a crash or a hard failover. If any of those things happen, then the operation would still be incomplete and we won't be returning anything, correct? Unless I am missing something.

Line:2525, src/ep.cc -> Trond, I looked through the code last night and this should be okay. We only change the vbucket uuid when changing the vbucket state from non-active to active. Since we can only write to active vbuckets there shouldn't be any race here.
