(7 comments)

Here are the initial comments, but  I had other more comments and will push them soon.

Line:1143, src/ep.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:1433, src/ep.cc -> release lock after setBySeqno(...)

Line:474, src/ep.cc -> Please release the partition lock after this.

Line:581, src/ep.cc -> We can still do Set without invoking unlocked_find twice. Please pass the reference to StoredValue pointer to unlocked_set(...)

Line:635, src/ep.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:1101, src/ep.cc -> this should be released after setting the seq no below.

Line:1387, src/ep.cc -> Please avoid the second unlocked_find(..) call.
