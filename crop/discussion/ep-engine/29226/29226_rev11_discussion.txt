Line:145, src/vbucket.h -> looks like numHpChks(0) is missed out?

Line:59, src/kvstore.h -> just curious, where is this variable used now?

Line:227, src/checkpoint.h -> just for completeness, can we also have an explanation of the new field bySeqno ? thanks

Line:372, src/checkpoint.h -> an explanation here too of the new param please? thanks

Line:979, src/stored-value.h -> do we need two interfaces? If there is just one caller of this interface, perhaps we can just change that to use just the one below? thanks

Mike,

Please address comments from Sundar. I know your change might cause some conflicts with the full eviction change, but I will take care of rebasing this change with the full eviction.

Line:145, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:59, src/kvstore.h -> This variable is used during warmup because we need to set the start sequence number for each vbucket based on whatever the last one is on disk.

Line:227, src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:372, src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:979, src/stored-value.h -> This was called from one other place, but I will remove it so we can have just one unlocked_add function.
