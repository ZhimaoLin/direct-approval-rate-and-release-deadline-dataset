DESCRIPTION

Increase the default checkpoint creation interval.

10 minute time bound or 5000 unique items per checkpoint can
cause a new checkpoint to be created more frequently. Note that
these parameters can be changed at runtime. Also, we don't create
a new checkpoint if persistence or replication cursor is slow
even if the above time bound or max items per checkpoint is
reached.
