DESCRIPTION

Added histogram to represent the time objects are paged out.

We track the time an object is evicted and update the histogram when
the object is needed again from disk.  Object replacement is not
considered here (e.g. if an object is evicted and then a new value is
set, we just ignore the time).

Patch Set 1: Verified

Breaking my self-verification rule by stating:

1. I ran the unit tests many, many times.
2. I tested interactively to produce the data in the commit message (page stuff out, go get tea, come back).
