DESCRIPTION

MB-10496 [4/6]: Add epoch field to Blob; use as part of defragmenter policy

When a Blob object is allocated record the current 'epoch' in it -
essentially how the number of defragmenter passes which have occurred
mod 256. This can then be used to determine the age of a blob, and
consequently can be used by the defragmenter to select Blob objects
which have been in existance (and haven't changed size) for a long
period, and hence are candiates for defragmentation.

Line:295, src/item.h -> As you know, this will be shared across all the buckets and incremented every time each bucket's defragmentor is scheduled. So, if you have multiple buckets and want to defragment each bucket's item based on the number of defragmentor's runs on that bucket, this won't work correctly. To resolve this, we need to maintain currentEpoch counter per bucket.

Line:295, src/item.h -> Good point. Looks like EventuallyPersistentStore is the correct place for this - I will move it there.
