DESCRIPTION

MB-10496 [4/6]: Add age field to Blob; use as part of defragmenter policy

When a Blob object is allocated record the current 'age' of it. The
age is incremented when the runs, allowing us to measure how many
defragmenter passes have occurred, and consequently can be used by the
defragmenter to select Blob objects which have been in existance (and
haven't changed size) for a long period, and hence are candiates for
defragmentation.

Patch Set 5:

Rework to directly store the age in the Blob, and increment this when defragmenter runs. Removes the need for the static currentEpoch in item, which was problematic as it would need to be per-bucket to work correctly.
