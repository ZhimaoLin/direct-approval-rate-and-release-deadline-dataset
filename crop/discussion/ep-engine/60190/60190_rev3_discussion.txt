Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Line:21, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.h -> We should always include "config.h" before any other headers - it sets some defines etc which need to be picked up by all subsequent headers.

Line:24, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> Bump on "add comment to class"
