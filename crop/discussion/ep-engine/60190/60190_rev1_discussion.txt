Functionality looks good, just a couple of minor stylistic issues.

Line:24, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> Could you add a comment describing that this class does?

(I know there wasn't a description before you changed it, but now is a good opportunity to fix that :)

Line:28, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> In C++11 the (optional) `override` keyword can be used to specify that a virtual method overrides the base-class instance. This makes it clearer this is not a "new" method in this class.

You can also drop `virtual` if you use override - it's optional anyways in a derived class (you can't change the "virtualness" of a derived method from the base anyway), but with override it becomes unambiguous that it is a virtual method.

Line:53, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> Can `stats` ever be null? It not, change this to a reference instead.

Line:56, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> Style: We generally put the initialiser list on a new line, with each item also on a line to itself - e.g.

 StatsOps::StatsOps(CouchstoreStats *_stats)
     : stats(_stats) {}

I don't think this should be merged for Watson at this time, but rather suggest to wait until branching for Watson. Every commit (except for unit test improvements) requires the corresponding MB ticket that is approved for Watson at this time.

Agreed - and this is part of the set of changes I was alluding to in my email earlier about when to branch.

Line:56, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> except that the * should be next to the type, not the name ;-)

Line:70, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> This should be a constant somewhere with a comment section describing the various versions.
