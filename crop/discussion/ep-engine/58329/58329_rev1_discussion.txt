Patch Set 1:

I am curious to know as to why we are making this change when we have plans to run all the unit-tests in both eviction modes as part of commit validation anyways?

Patch Set 1:

If we'd be doing that there'd be a lot of redundant tests, but then again, I think we'd be better off running the entire suite by with the new configuration.

So abandon this change I will.
