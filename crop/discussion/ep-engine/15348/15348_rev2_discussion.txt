DESCRIPTION

MB-5092 Queue non-existent item deletion into checkpoints.

An item might not exist in the replica vbucket when its deletion
is received from the active vbucket, if that item was already
expired and deleted from the replica vbucket. In this case,
an item deletion should be still pushed into a checkpoint for
replication into another replica vbucket.
