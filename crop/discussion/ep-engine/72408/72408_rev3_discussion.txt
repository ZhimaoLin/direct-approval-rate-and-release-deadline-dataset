DESCRIPTION

MB-22230 simplify decrement logic for stats and vbucket

Moving EPStats and VBucket to use NonNegativeAtomic.

Can now use fetch_sub directly, removing

 EPStats::decrDiskQueueSize

and

 VBucket::decrDirtyQueueSize

as they are now unneeded.

(2 comments)

Line:1965, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Style: prefer pre-decrement over post - see https://github.com/daverigby/memcached/blob/coding_standard/docs/CodingStandards.rst#prefer-preincrement

Line:808, src/vbucket.h -> Don't bother trying to keep this aligned (with the two spaces) - it's generally something which code fails to maintain as it's changed (unless you make a bunch of whitespace-only changes).
