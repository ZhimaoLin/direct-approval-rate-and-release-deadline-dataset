DESCRIPTION

MB-22230 simplify decrement logic for stats and vbucket

Moving EPStats and VBucket to use NonNegativeCounter<>.

Can now use fetch_sub directly, removing

 EPStats::decrDiskQueueSize

and

 VBucket::decrDirtyQueueSize

as they are now unneeded.

Line:339, src/vbucket.cc -> This isn't actually atomic - we load and store separately. (Note: it was broken before your change...)

To fix you need:

# exchange() the current value of dirtyQueueSize with zero (atomically obtaining what it's value used to be).
# issue the fetch_sub() with the value returned from exchange().
