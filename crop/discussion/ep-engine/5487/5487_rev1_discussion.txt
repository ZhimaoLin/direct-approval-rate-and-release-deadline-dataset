DESCRIPTION

MB-3643 Don't disconnect TAP producer with positive tap_keep_alive

When the ns server sends a TAP connection request with a positive
tap_keep_alive value to the master node, there was an issue, which the
master node always disconnects the corresponding TAP connection
immediately without considering the tap_keep_alive parameter.
