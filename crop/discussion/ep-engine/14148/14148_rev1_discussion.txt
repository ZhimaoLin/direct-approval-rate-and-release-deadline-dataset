Patch Set 1:

Damien, Jin: You need to add the extra setup of the mock server in the setup phase there, and nuke it in the shutdown :) Apart from that the logic should all be here for running all of the test cases with the new storage... 

It would be awesome if we at least could run the test suite with the communication to a mock server disabled

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Junyi is currently looking at changes that are required to run a mock CouchKVStore. Added him for the code review as well here.
