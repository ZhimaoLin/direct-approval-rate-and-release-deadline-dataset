DESCRIPTION

Consider memory usage in creating a new checkpoint by TAP consumer

If 1.7 TAP consumer connects to TAP producer that does not support
checkpoint operations, it should create a new checkpoint for itself
and consider the current memory usage in creating a new checkpoint.

If the current memory usage is too high, TAP consumer triggers the
creation of a new checkpoint, so that the item pager can purge
items from the old open checkpoint.
