DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move VBucket related stuff out of HashTable::unlocked_softDelete

This commit removes VBucket related stuff in HashTable::unlocked_softDelete.
Also breaks up that logic such that we can logically delete an item across
all the in-memory data structures in the future.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:1451, src/vbucket.cc -> I think the fact you're having to add this here is a sign this function is too long (150 lines) and does too much.

I assume that the code above this point should have handled any null `v` case - and that the reason you're having to add this check is the logic is unclear.

Suggest you refactor or split this function - maybe handling the case where there isn't a valid `v` to delete first, and then a second inner function which handles the case where one does exist (or the other way around if that is clearer).

Line:965, src/vbucket.h -> It's not immediately clear from the names (or the descriptions!) what the difference is between these two methods.

Could you try to give them more distinct names, and improve the comments?

Line:1451, src/vbucket.cc -> Yup the function is too long.. In fact all the front end op handling functions are long VBucket::deleteItem(), VBucket::setWithMeta(), VBucket::set() etc..
To break them meaningfully into functions we have to define right abstraction for VALUE EVICTION vs FULL EVICTION policies.

That will be another KV Goodness task I think.
If you want me to make a function in this commit then, I will more or less copy paste above lines in a function. But that wont be best I think.

After reading through myriad of if-else above it is seems that we should have already handled v == NULL.
The check was a paranoid check or to handle a case if someone adds a new if else or changes something in existing if-elses above.

And, now found out that we can in fact handle better than throwing an exception. Changed accordingly

Line:965, src/vbucket.h -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1451, src/vbucket.cc -> I think it's ok to leave as-is for now, especially as this is mostly a "code-moving" exercise. Please create a kv-goodness task to track the splitting; the code can stay in this structure for now.
