Patch Set 1:

PLEASE READ:

* This commit moves KVShard inside VBucketMap (based on the adoption 
  of Mike's KVShard implementation:
  http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/25495/)

* Next step will be getting remove of EP Store reference from KVStore,
  otherwise we must pass the reference from ep -> vbucketmap ->
  kvshard -> kvstore

* Then will address Chiyoung's comments along with the integration with
   IO Manager
