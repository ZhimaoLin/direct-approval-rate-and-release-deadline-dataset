DESCRIPTION

MB-11287 Lock TaskQ selectively, avoid busy loops

Global Thread Pool offers 2 serialization features:
1. lockless shard serialization (Flusher, VBDelete, Snapshot etc)
2. task-queue based thread control (NonIO and AuxIO)
If thread is working on tasks that need neither of the above two,
then avoid locking overhead completely.

Also isLock variable ends up causing more overhead, removing same
