DESCRIPTION

MB-14988: Split TestDcpConsumer::run() into multiple functions

Run method in TestDcpConsumer opens a DCP connection, opens streams
and streams all items from the DCP producer. However, there are cases
where you just want to open a connection but not open a stream or
open a connection and a stream but not stream items.

Hence making run() more modular helps more granular testing of DCP.
