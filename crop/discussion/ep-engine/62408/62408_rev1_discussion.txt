DESCRIPTION

MB-14988: Split TestDcpConsumer::run() into multiple functions

Run method in TestDcpConsumer opens a DCP connection, opens streams
and streams all items from the DCP producer. However, there are cases
where you just want to open a connection but not open a stream or
open a connection and a stream but not stream items.

Hence making run() more modular helps more granular testing of DCP

I thought this is better merged in Watson branch than master branch as the change is only in test code.
This is help us write test cases for any watson fixes we make in the coming days

Line:178, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Please keep the style of the initialiser list start marker (:) indented - this helps to distinguish the initialiser list from the function prototype.

Line:532, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Pretty sure check() works for string types, so you can change this to the following and get the expected/actual arguments printed if they mismatch:

 check(status, std::string(disabled), "Flow control enabled!");

Line:4461, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Debug?
