see my comments.

Line:107, src/bgfetcher.cc -> this should be non-zero from the get() to do the work, so dont need "!"
get() != 0, we should do the work.

Line:132, src/bgfetcher.cc -> this one should be zero to setup the timer, so should use "!" in the if statement.
get() == 0, we should set up the sleep timer.

I have another fix that I think will work.

Line:107, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Your statement and the one suggested are equivalent.

Line:132, src/bgfetcher.cc -> With this change I get unit test failures.
