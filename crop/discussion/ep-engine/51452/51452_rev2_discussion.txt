DESCRIPTION

MB-13910: Set DCP flow control buffer sz as a percentage of bucket sz

Set the flow control buffer size on DCP consumer to 1% of the bucket
memory, but, withing the max limit of 50MB and min limit of 10MB.
Also, keep track of overall memory used by DCP consumer flow control
buffers, and limit the memory used to min value of 10MB beyond a
threshold.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Line:104, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> This would mean that the aggregated buffer size could still exceed the memory threshold, with too many connections couldn't that become a problem?

Line:466, configuration.json -> Description should have been: flag to enable/disable use of dynamic connection buffer by dcp consumer.

I dont understand why do we even need this parameter, we could have just the new way of deciding the consumer buffer size.

Line:470, configuration.json -> This is pretty much the same thing as dcp_conn_buffer_size.

Line:484, configuration.json -> Percentage of memQuota.

Line:496, configuration.json -> This should state that this is an aggregated memory threshold.

Line:504, src/connmap.h -> Would this need to be atomic?

Line:104, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> This is how we want it.

We dynamically decide the buffer using until the aggr mem usage across all flow control buffers exceeds a threshold. After that we switch back to what we had before (set the buffers to min value).

Line:466, configuration.json -> Using this flag gives the users an option to use the default (already existing) flow control mechanism

Line:470, configuration.json -> Ok, we can use the dcp_conn_buffer_size instead.
I thought we could have a default, min and max config params. But looks like for now it is sufficient to have just default and max params

Line:504, src/connmap.h -> this is used under connsLock is ctor and as a RCPtr in dtor.
But, anyways will make it more safer by using atomic
