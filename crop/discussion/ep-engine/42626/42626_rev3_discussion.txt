DESCRIPTION

Add explicit Item copy-constructor, reduce uses of value_t constructor

Further refactor and simplify Item construction:

- Add an explicit Item copy-constructor for use when copying items
  (e.g. MutationResponse).

- Change uses of Blob-passing constructor to just use the {char* data,
  size_t len} variant instead - in three use-cases the client just
  creates a Blob immediately before calling the constructor; might as
  well let the consturctor do the work.

This reduces the users of the Blob-passing constructor to one -
StoredValue::toItem(). This already has a value_t and so we do want to
make the new Item point to it, hence can't change this to use the
{data, len} variant.

Line:363, src/item.h -> Shouldn't the ObjetRegistry::onCreateItem(this) be called? (if we're going to remove that we should do that before we're having some code paths that do and other that don't calculate this..)

Line:1802, src/tapconnection.cc -> You missed the fields for ext_meta and ext_len:

itm = new Item(key.data(), key.length(), /*flags*/0, /*exp*/0, &cid, sizeof(cid), /*ext_meta*/ NULL, /*ext_len*/0, /*cas*/0, /*seqno*/-1, checkpoint_msg->getVBucketId());

Line:2166, src/tapconnection.cc -> We shouldn't set bySeqno for Item, as this causes an abort() whenever bySeqno=0, you can initialize item as:

Item *item = new Item(key, nkey, flags, exptime, value, nvalue, &datatype, EXT_META_LEN, cas, -1, vbucket, revSeqno);

and you could get rid of the three lines below, as we've already initialized vbucketId, cas and revSeqno in the constructor.
