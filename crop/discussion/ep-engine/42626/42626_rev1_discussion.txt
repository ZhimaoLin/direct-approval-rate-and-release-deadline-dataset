DESCRIPTION

Add explicit Item copy-constructor, reduce uses of value_t constructor

Further refactor and simplify Item construction:

- Add an explicit Item copy-constructor for use when copying items
  (e.g. MutationResponse).

- Change uses of Blob-passing constructor to just use the {char* data,
  size_t len} variant instead - in three use-cases the client just
  creates a Blob immediately before calling the constructor; might as
  well let the consturctor do the work.

This reduces the users of the Blob-passing constructor to one -
StoredValue::toItem(). This already has a value_t and so we do want to
make the new Item point to it, hence can't change this to use the
{data, len} variant.
