DESCRIPTION

Sort configuration.json

I wrote this to keep it pretty:

    (defun format-json ()
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                 "python -mjson.tool" 'nil t)
        (delete-trailing-whitespace)))

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved

(one problem will be to keep it sorted ;-) Not everyone use emacs, and have json.tool ;-))

Patch Set 3: Verified

Nothing breaks if it goes bad.  I like the intention of doing so, kind of like .gitignore.  I'd be surprised if anyone didn't have json.tool, though (or at least, couldn't get it).  :)
