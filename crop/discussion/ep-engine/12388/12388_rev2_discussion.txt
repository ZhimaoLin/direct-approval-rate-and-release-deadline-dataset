DESCRIPTION

Sort configuration.json

I wrote this to keep it pretty:

    (defun format-json ()
      (interactive)
      (save-excursion
        (mark-whole-buffer)
        (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                 "python -mjson.tool" 'nil t)
        (delete-trailing-whitespace)))

Guys have an opinion on this?  I think it fits well with our "keep stuff organized" strategy.
