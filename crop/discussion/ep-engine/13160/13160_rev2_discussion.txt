DESCRIPTION

Export a vbucket's last closed checkpoint id through stats.

The last closed checkpoint id for a given vbucket was previously
retrieved by sending a separate command to the engine. As one of
the checkpoint stats, it should be simply retrieved by requesting
checkpoint stats for a given vbucket.
