DESCRIPTION

MB-14193: Consolidate file statistics in the KV Store

- Remove KVStatsCallback and collect statistics for files
  in KVStore. The idea is to not associate file/disk
  statistics with a specific vbucket or shard, but to
  make it a property of the KV store
- Add getDbFileInfo API to get file information for the
  whole KVStore
- Retain existing vbucket-level file and data statistics
  for existing clients. This will be eventually moved
  to the underlying KV store

(5 comments)

Line:654, src/vbucket.cc -> Please remove these two variables from VBucket class

Line:968, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Can you prepend 'CouchKVStore::setVBucketState' to help us debug any potential failures?

Line:1087, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we can simply use cachedDocCount[vbId] to avoid calling fdb_get_kvs_info in line 1099

Line:1088, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we can now use the cached file size to avoid calling fdb_get_file_info in line 1083

Line:1109, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Similarly, we can use the cached space size. It seems to me that we don't need to call fdb APIs in this function with this change.

Line:654, src/vbucket.cc -> Done

Line:968, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1109, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> The cachedFileSize and cachedSpaceUsed are shard-level stats for ForestKVStore. This API gets vbucket-level file statistics. There are 2 consumers of this API. Backfill and warmup for getting item count. I plan to deprecate this API and add a separate call to just get item count on a vbucket-level to support that case. That would be a separate patch. For now, we can retain the current behaviour.

Line:274, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Done
