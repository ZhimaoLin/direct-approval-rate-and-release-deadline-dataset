DESCRIPTION

MB-14193: Consolidate file statistics in the KV Store

- Remove KVStatsCallback and collect statistics for files
  in KVStore. The idea is to not associate file/disk
  statistics with a specific vbucket or shard, but to
  make it a property of the KV store
- Add getDbFileInfo API to get file information for the
  whole KVStore
- Retain existing vbucket-level file and data statistics
  for existing clients. This will be eventually moved
  to the underlying KV store
