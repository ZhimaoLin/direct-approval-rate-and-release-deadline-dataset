DESCRIPTION

MB-100 traverse sample items belong to a single shard

This fix may not need after integrating multi-dispatcher implementation
(global io manager). Otherwise, without the fix, the unit test
intermittently runs into time out error for following scenario.

for iteration over vbid = 0 ... vbid = 99
bgfetch for vbid = 0; shard 1/2/3 go to sleep
bgfetch for vbid = 1; shard 0/2/3 go to sleep, wakes up shard 1
bgfetch for vbid = 2; shard 0/1/3 go to sleep, wakes up shard 2
.
.
.
repeating upto vbid = 99, while the single dispatcher interleaving
among 4 individual bgfetch deamon tasks, which further slows down
servicing requested bgfetch jobs

Patch Set 2:

Jin,

This seems like a test case workaround to ensure a timeout doesn't happen. It seems to me that if a user ran a workload similar to this and the bgfetcher was not waking up fast enough then that would be a problem. Let's discuss this more and I also want to take some time to try to understand the issue better myself.

Patch Set 2:

As stated in the bug description it is "a test workaround" to avoid the apparent slowness by the single dispatcher (dispatcher) running 4 bgfetcher tasks (vs 1 task per thread). Which should be automatically addressed when the io manager is enabled.

I am not planning to merge this commit by any means but have it available for the toy build and local unit tests. Thanks.
