DESCRIPTION

Fix to setting incorrect rev_seqno in hashtable::add()

If an item in hashtable has a state of temp_deleted_key, which
means that the item is marked as "deleted" in a storage layer,
we should set its rev_seqno to its current rev_seqno + 1
when that item is added back to the hashtable.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

It might be good to add a unit test for this too so it doesn't get messed up in the future.
