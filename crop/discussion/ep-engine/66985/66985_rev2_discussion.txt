DESCRIPTION

MB-20649: Fix lock inversion between Processor and front-end

Processor via PassiveStream::processBufferedMessage has a lock-inversion
for setVbucketState messages.

The Processor obtains bufMutex then connManager
Frontend path is reversed, connManger then bufMutex

An existing test-case is reused in buffered only mode to trigger
the inversion.

However in addressing the lock-inversion by reducing the
scope of the bufMutex, we introduce further problems which
need addressing by use of shared_ptr for the DcpResponse objects
as they can be deleted by the frontend whilst the Processor task
is working on the object.
