Patch Set 1:

Doesn't this mean items being read are effectively always uncompressed?

Patch Set 1:

Yes, this patch compress everything on write, and uncompress everything during read.. It's not how I want it to be in the end ;) I just want to check the latency effect of using snappy ;)

Cool, so this will be as bad as it gets, then.  :)

Patch Set 1:

I think the other thing we'd want here is stat adjustment.  Let's lower the actual memory in use when we compress an object and perhaps track the compression ratios usefully (maybe a histogram?).  I think it'd be hard to track compressed vs. uncompressed size (unless the snappy API will give us this cheaply), but that'd be nice.

Patch Set 1:

Oh, and Frank insists on adding an engine parameter to enable/disable it.

I believe that Frank has access to push changes to Jasmin Rangel, right?

Patch Set 1:

Heh.  Well, probably a better point would be that don't need the enable/disable flag in this particular change.  I do think stat adjustment is important, though.  Otherwise we'll be using less memory than we think and we'll OOM when we're only about half full.
