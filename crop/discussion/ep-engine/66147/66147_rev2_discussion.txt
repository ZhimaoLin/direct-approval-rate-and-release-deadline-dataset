DESCRIPTION

MB-20235: Fix wake's incorrect work counting

MB-20061 introduced a better futureQueue object but has
introduced a ExecutorPool work accounting bug. The work
counter should only be increased for tasks in the readyQueue,
MB-20061 would sometimes add 1 for items in the futureQueue.
The counter would then never reach 0 and the fetchNextTask loop
would never yield (causing high CPU).

Note that when MB-18453 is merged up from sherlock, this code
will be tweaked again to remove any readyQueue push code
from the wake path.
