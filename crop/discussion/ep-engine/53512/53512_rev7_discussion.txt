Is DCP already "datatype-aware"? I.e. if a item at the producer end has datatype COMPRESSED, do we currently (before these patches) send the document as-is, or must we decompress it first?

Line:955, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Nit: Use a constructor instead of assigning (saves a default initialising of std::string) :-

 std::string val("true");

Line:415, src/dcp/producer.cc -> In C++ you can also just write

    if (valueStr == "true") {
       // see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/operators/
    }

Dave, today DCP ships a specific datatype as is.
I will be adding a separate commit (to complete datatype support) to support inflation if a dcp client does not support datatype.

Line:415, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done
