Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:552, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Judging by this code, I assume my initial thought in comment #1 was correct - "enableValueCompression" is supposed to indicate the current state of this option?

Line:139, src/dcp/consumer.h -> Would be helpful to describe what this variable does - as per my previous comment it's not clear if this is supposed to indicate the current state of the feature; or a flag to record that we have a pending need to configure this setting...

Line:962, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Why are we setting enableValueCompression to false here? Surely this function should be enabling compression?

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding - if 'enableValueCompression' is used to indicate if the request to enable has already been sent, then can I suggest renaming it to something clearer - for example:

 needToEnableValueCompression 

?

Line:133, src/dcp/consumer.h -> This new boolean only ever has one use and its value is then copied into the second new boolean. We should just have one new boolean and this one has the clearest name. I suggest deleting "enableValueCompression"

Line:552, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Just making sure, you're first comment was on the consumer side, and this is on the producer side, so thats 2 different contexts entirely.

Line:133, src/dcp/consumer.h -> I have 2 copies of this boolean for 2 purposes.

The one below is for the control message mechanism, which is reset to false (if it were true to start with) once the control message has been sent. 

The one above is used by the consumer to check if compression was enabled, in which case it would have to uncompress the documents that have been compressed by the producer.

Line:139, src/dcp/consumer.h -> The above five boolean variables are temp variables which are used to stage the control message mechanism between the consumer and the producer. These messages need to be sent only once, so these variables will be reset to false after a control message has been sent for them.

Line:962, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> This is how we send control messages from the consumer to the producer. These need to be sent only once. So if this parameter was set to true, we send the control message once and set it to false. The control message needs to be sent only at the start.

Line:552, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Ah yes, you're right. Part of the trouble in using the same name for two variables which act in different ways ;)

Line:139, src/dcp/consumer.h -> Thanks, that's helpful to know; but the comment in this code review will quickly be lost - I actually meant update the code to describe what they do :)

Line:962, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Ok, so can I suggest renaming to a more descriptive name - valueCompressionEnablePending  is perhaps a better suggestion than my previous; and/or adding a comment to the variable's declaration to make it clearer.
