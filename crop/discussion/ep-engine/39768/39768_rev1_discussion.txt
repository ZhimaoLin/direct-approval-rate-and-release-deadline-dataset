Hi Abhinav, please correct me if I am wrong..

Line:5596, src/ep_engine.cc -> if a disconnect comes before compaction finishes won't the compaction thread crash since it has a copy of the engineSpecific and will try to do a notifyIOComplete ?

Line:5596, src/ep_engine.cc -> If a disconnect comes in for the cookie before compaction completes, the memcached thread wouldn't revisit the compaction interface. However if the cookie's engine specific is not set to NULL, when the cookie is re-used for the compaction of another vbucket, the session counter would not be incremented, causing the crash when the memcached thread revisits the engine interface after it receives the notification.
