DESCRIPTION

MB-7965: Skip scanning for existing files during flush all

During flush all, all the vbucket files are being deleted
and recreated. Given that the files are going to be
recreated anyways, there is no need to scan the directory
for any existing files.

Line:1393, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think you should get rid of the "INFO:" part in the log message, as logging something with EXTENSION_LOG_INFO will already prefix an INFO to the log message.

Line:1397, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Same goes here as well.
