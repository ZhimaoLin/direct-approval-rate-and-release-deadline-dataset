DESCRIPTION

MB-23719: Add ephemeral_metadata_purge_age setting

Add the new config option "ephemeral_metadata_purge_age" to
ep-engine's configuration, along with listeners so changes in it's value
are propogated to the bucket.

Note the default value of 60s, and -1 for disabled exists mostly for
component testing - don't expect that to be exposed to
users. Similarly the unit of seconds is used to aid in testing - I'm
aware the UI is limited to a minimum of 1 hour.

This setting will be dynamic - i.e. can be changed via SET_PARAM
without restarting the bucket.

As per the name, this option is only applicable to Ephemeral buckets -
it will be ignored by Persistent Buckets.

  Implementation Note: The actual Tombstone Purger Tasks do not yet
  exist, so there's currenlty placeholder code for enable/disabling
  the task.
