spotted this accidently. I was sure that we are never going to use UPR_EXPIRATION. At least my code is built with that assumption. So if you guys plan to actually use it, please let me know.

We don't plan on using it for 3.0, but I want to include it in the ep-engine code so that we can easily support backward compatibility.
