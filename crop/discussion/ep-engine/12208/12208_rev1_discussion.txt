DESCRIPTION

Introduce GetMeta class for the get-meta callback

Similar to the GetValue class, this class will be used as the value
passed by the persistent store to the callback function after a back-
ground fetch for an item's metadata completes. The metadata passed
back will contain the seqno, cas, length and flags attributes along
with an engine error code about the result of the fetch.

Line:129, callbacks.hh -> We don't need this class as the above GetValue class already has the item instance and partial flag.
