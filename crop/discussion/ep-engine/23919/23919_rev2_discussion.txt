DESCRIPTION

MB-7524 Schedule the stats snapshot before purging TAP connections

When the engine shuts down, we schedule the stats snapshot task
and destroy all the TAP connection instances as part of the
shutdown process. As the stats snapshot task needs to persist
TAP stats, it should be scheduled before purging those TAP
connections from memory.
