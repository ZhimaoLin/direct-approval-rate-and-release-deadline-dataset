DESCRIPTION

[Fix coverity warning]: Initialize all members of RangeIteratorLL

We must always initialize all the non static members of the RangeIteratorLL
class in the constructor.

Below is the warning reported by coverity:
*** CID 169606:  Uninitialized members  (UNINIT_CTOR)
/ep-engine/src/linked_list.cc: 430 in BasicLinkedList::RangeIteratorLL::RangeIteratorLL(BasicLinkedList&)()
424         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> listWriteLg(list.getListWriteLock());
425         std::lock_guard<SpinLock> lh(list.rangeLock);
426         if (list.highSeqno < 1) {
427             /* No need of holding a lock for the snapshot as there are no items;
428                Also iterator range is at default (0, 0) */
429             readLockHolder.unlock();
   CID 169606:  Uninitialized members  (UNINIT_CTOR)
   Non-static class member "earlySnapShotEndSeqno" is not initialized in this constructor nor in any functions that it calls.
430             return;
431         }
432
433         /* Iterator to the beginning of linked list */
434         currIt = list.seqList.begin();
