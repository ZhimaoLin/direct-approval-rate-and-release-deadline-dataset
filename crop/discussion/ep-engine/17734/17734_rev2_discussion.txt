DESCRIPTION

MB-5718: Fixed race in flusher

If you try to stop and restart the flusher really quickly then
you can potentially run into an issue if the flusher is in the
pausing state (not paused) because going from pausing to running
is not considered a valid transition. This change fixes that
issue by making this a valid transition.
