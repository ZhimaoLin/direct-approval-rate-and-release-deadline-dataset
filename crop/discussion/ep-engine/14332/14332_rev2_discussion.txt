Patch Set 2: Verified

There has to be a separate bug or further debugging to figure out why couchstore(changes_since()) returns an error while reading persisted vbucket info (very rarely though). However, this fix will allow the warmup to complete without repetitive abort.

Line:360, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> it would be better to compare errorCode to the error code that represents "no failure".
