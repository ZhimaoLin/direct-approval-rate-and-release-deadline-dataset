I saw two issues in this change, which need to be fixed.

Line:480, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This will cause lots of overhead because it will do the directory scanning for every batch read. We already saw 10X slower performance in XDCR tests with this change because XDCR issues lots of bg fetches for getMeta.

Line:2346, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> It should be == 0.
