Patch Set 1: Verified

Verified on both OS-X and Linux (centos). Encountered an error for sqlite unit test, which has nothing to do with this patch set.

Running [0222/0362]: flush with stats (sqlite)...engine_testapp: ep_testsuite.cc:1608: test_result test_flush_stats(ENGINE_HANDLE*, ENGINE_HANDLE_V1*): Assertion `mem_used2 == mem_used' failed.

Overall, looks very good. Just minor few comments.

Line:167, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please move this variable to for loop or remove it by moving "new VBucketBGFetchItem" to push_back().

Line:645, mutation_log.cc -> Please initialize the iterator before for loop.

Line:649, mutation_log.cc -> Same comment as above

Line:651, mutation_log.cc -> This will make another copy of a string (although some compilers support COW for string objects).

Line:653, mutation_log.cc -> Can we simplify "std::make_pair(it2->first, it2->second);"
