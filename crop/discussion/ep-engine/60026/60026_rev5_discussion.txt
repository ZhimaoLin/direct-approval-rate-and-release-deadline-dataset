DESCRIPTION

MB-18149: Do not generate new CAS value unless DELETE succeeds

Operations that fails should not modify the objects properties
(That would make it impossible for clients to safely delete
the correct version of the object they modified if others
tried to delete the object with an incorrect CAS value)
