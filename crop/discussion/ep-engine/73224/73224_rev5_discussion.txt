DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Update revSeqno outside add/update/delete calls in VBucket

Currently revSeqno (revision seqno) is updated/generated newly in the
updateStoredValue(), addNewStoredValue() and softDeleteStoredValue().
These functions should rather focus only on the respective
update/addNew/softDelete.

Hence instead of passing a flag indicating how rev seqno change must
be handled, it is better to change rev seqno in the functions that call
updateStoredValue(), addNewStoredValue() and softDeleteStoredValue().
