Line:46, src/threadlocal.h -> Seeing as the implementation of these appears to be totally different for Win32, is it worth creating PosixThreadLocal and WinThreadLocal classes, and then doing:

#ifdef WIN32
class TheadLocal : WinThreadLocal
#else
class ThreadLocal : PosixThreadLocal
#endif

or similar? (Or go wild with traits classes if you prefer that ;)

Line:46, src/threadlocal.h -> Ideally I'd like to see the entire thing go away ;-) I'll rewrap it to be a bit more clear..
