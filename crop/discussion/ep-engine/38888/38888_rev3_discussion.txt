Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

This won't fully resolve the issue because the buffer might still have items in it. Since the consumer is being deleted we can just clear those items. After we set each stream to dead we also need to clear the buffer items too.

Patch Set 3:

The buffer is cleared, in passive stream's setDead function.
