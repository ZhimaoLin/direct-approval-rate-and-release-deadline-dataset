DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [7/N]: Correct thread naming

Threads were stopped in the order of creation, leaving higher number
threads. This caused problems with new created threads, as they assumed
the existing threads would be numbered from 0.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

long line needs fixing, but check other comments

Line:543, src/executorpool.cc -> nit: long-line (git-clang-format!)

Line:78, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.h -> nit: for(const auto* thread : threadQ) at least add the const

consider also std::for_each (something like)

  std::for_each(threadQ.begin(), threadQ.end(), [output](ExecutorThread* v){ output.push_back(v); });
