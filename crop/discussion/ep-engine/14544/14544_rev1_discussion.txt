DESCRIPTION

MB-4951: Update stats using a single thread

Every time we try to add an item to the database, check to see
if there is room in checkpoint queues, try to see of we have
enough memory for backfill, ... we need to check that we aren't
using more memory than we have allocated to use. This process
required getting stats from tcmalloc and getting stats required
going through a few spin locks and this resulted in a lot of
contention. This fix adds a new thread to the MemoryTracker that
will update the stats every 1/4 second in order to relieve
contention around the spin locks in tcmalloc.

Line:71, memory_tracker.cc -> Please correct the error message.

Line:102, memory_tracker.cc -> It would be probably better to extract the allocated_bytes and fragmentation values from stats instance and store them into separate member variables.

Line:105, memory_tracker.cc -> const char* stat_name

Line:107, memory_tracker.cc -> This won't be small overhead as we need to do string comparisons on all stats for every memory allocation request. Let's have separate size_t member variables for fragmentation and allocated bytes.

Line:114, memory_tracker.cc -> Let's simply return size_t member variable that represents fragmentation.

Line:118, memory_tracker.cc -> Let's simply return size_t member variable that represents allocated bytes.

Line:107, memory_tracker.cc -> might want to consider a perfect hash (or even better just a plain struct) if all the stats are known ahead of time.

Line:115, memory_tracker.cc -> BTW, this cast is due to the thing Chiyoung pointed out above.  If you're casting, you should always second guess yourself when casting.

Line:107, memory_tracker.cc -> Yeah, using a plain struct is a good idea.

Line:107, memory_tracker.cc -> This won't be called on every memory allocation, but I agree with your point here.
