DESCRIPTION

Don't evict pending vbucket's items aggressively during takeover

When a given vbucket is being taken over to the new node, its
state in the new node is in pending and then changed to active
after takeover completion. Therefore, the pending vbucket's
items should not be evicted aggressively while being persisted in
disk. Otherwise, the resident ratio of active vbuckets becomes
quite low after cluster rebalance. Currently, pending to active
state change is the only valid state transition from pending
state.

Note that we have a separate item pager that runs every 10 sec
to evict non-dirty items if the current memory usage is above
the high watermark.
