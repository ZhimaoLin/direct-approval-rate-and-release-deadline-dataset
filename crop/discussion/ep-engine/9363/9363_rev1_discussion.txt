DESCRIPTION

Don't evict pending vbucket's items aggressively during takeover

When a given vbucket is being taken over to the new node, its
state in the new node is in pending and then changed to active
after takeover completion. Therefore, the pending vbucket's
items should not be evicted aggressively while being persisted in
disk. Otherwise, the resident ratio of active vbuckets becomes
quite low after cluster rebalance. Currently, pending to active
state change is the only valid state transition from pending
state.

Note that we have a separate item pager that runs every 10 sec
to evict non-dirty items if the current memory usage is above
the high watermark.

Btw. This change will probably have a negative effect if you're rebalancing with a lot more items than you can fit in memory (since we would hit the memory limits sooner and then start having to back off the tap stream).. or am I completely off?

Patch Set 1:

Thanks Trond for good points. As you know, the item pager is periodically scheduled and evicts items from pending vbuckets if the current memory usage is above the high watermark.

In addition, from 1.7, the ns_server schedules vbucket takeover one at a time. Therefore, it's unlikely to have memory issues by not evicting pending vbucket's items aggressively while persisting them.
