Patch Set 2:

In ps2: testcase added in ep_testsuit

Jin, please cherry-pick and fix the item_pager issue (not kick-in if curr_item is 0). That probably caused that unit test fail. Thanks.

Line:1245, stored-value.hh -> I don't think we need another parameter for this. resetVal = true is only used for creating a temp item. I think we can simply rename resetVal to isTempItem.

Line:6812, ep_testsuite.cc -> Remove this debug stmt.
