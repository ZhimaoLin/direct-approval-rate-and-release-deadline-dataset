DESCRIPTION

MB-23435: Refactor - move VBucketCountVisitor to own file

Move VBucketCountVisitor from ep_engine.{cc,h} to it's own files -
vb_count_visitor.{cc,h}. This is to facilitate derived classes of
VBucketCountVisitor, without such classes having to include all of
ep_engine.h.

Line:56, src/kv_bucket.cc -> This is necessary - the class definition used to come from ep_engine.h, but now it's in it's own header we need to specify it here to use the VBCountVisitor later in this file.
