DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral] Remove Warmup task from EphemeralBucket

Ephemeral buckets do not have warmup (there's no data ever persisted,
so we shouldn't attempt to load anything).

Forcefully disable warmup from the configuration for Ephemeral
buckets.

Line:23, src/ep_bucket.cc -> Why include more headers?

Line:2066, src/ep_engine.cc -> Seems like an invalid configuration to both specify warmup for an ephemeral bucket? shouldn't that be logged?

Line:20, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> why do we need this header?

Line:23, src/ep_bucket.cc -> hmm, looks like that was left over from a later commit. Will fix.

Line:2066, src/ep_engine.cc -> Well, problem is the default (in configuration.json) is warmup is on, and we don't have any support currently in the config file to make one setting (e.g. warmup) dependent on another.

Seemed the simplest option was to just override warmup setting for ephemeral buckets.

Line:20, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> As previous, I'll fix :)
