DESCRIPTION

MB-17230: Do not allow active stream creation over a dead VB

+ Active and Notifier streams will not be created for
a vbucket whose state is DEAD, error response will be
ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET.
+ Note that acquiring the producer's streamsMutex within
a vbucket's stateLock shouldn't cause a lock inversion as
this pattern is followed in several other code paths, for
example the set->queueDirty->notifyConnection codepath.
+ test case
