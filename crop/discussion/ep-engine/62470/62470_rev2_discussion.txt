Line:210, src/dcp/producer.cc -> hmm, what if the vbucket state is set to dead after this point? Are we going to close the stream eventually before sending any items over this stream?

Line:210, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I'm afraid if the stream hasn't been added to the list, we'd have a problem, I think we would need to hold on the stateLock, while a stream is being added to the streams list.
