DESCRIPTION

MB-20611: Fair scheduling when # of tasks >> # of threads

With large tasks and small snooze times, sorting by taskId
can result in lower taskId tasks getting 'lucky' and running
more frequently in an unfair manner.
1) Update current time of executor threads after task finishes
to ensure that sleeping tasks get woken correctly
2) Use a monotonically increasing "queue entry time" to
distinguish among tasks of the same priority in FIFO

We need some tests for this to validate it behaves as expected.

Patch Set 7:

The unit test we used to debug/validate the fix is here : http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/67257/
We will later move the complete unit test framework in execpool_test to ep-engine as a separate commit.

Thanks for the link. I don't think we should add this patch without a patching unit test - there's no guarantee it does what we think it does, and moveover it is "undefended" - if a change is made which inadvertently breaks the scheduling we won't know about it.

Please include at least a regression test for this particular issue in this patch.
