DESCRIPTION

MB-20611: Fair scheduling when # of tasks >> # of threads

With large tasks and small snooze times, sorting by taskId
can result in lower taskId tasks getting 'lucky' and running
more frequently in an unfair manner.
1) Update current time of executor threads after task finishes
to ensure that sleeping tasks get woken correctly
2) Use a monotonically increasing "queue entry time" to
distinguish among tasks of the same priority
