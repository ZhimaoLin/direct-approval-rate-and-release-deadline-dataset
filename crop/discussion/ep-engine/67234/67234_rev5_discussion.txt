DESCRIPTION

MB-20611: Fair scheduling when # of tasks >> # of threads

With large tasks and small snooze times, sorting by taskId
can result in lower taskId tasks getting 'lucky' and running
more frequently in an unfair manner.
1) Update current time of executor threads after task finishes
to ensure that sleeping tasks get woken correctly
2) Use a monotonically increasing "queue entry time" to
distinguish among tasks of the same priority

Line:92, src/taskqueue.h -> This doesn't need to be atomic, its updated within mutex anyway.

Line:142, src/executorthread.cc -> This is unnecessary.

Line:142, src/executorthread.cc -> I just consolidated the gethrtime() call with the one above so there is no cost associated with this statement. But it can help keep the scheduling stats up to date when tasks don't call snooze() method
