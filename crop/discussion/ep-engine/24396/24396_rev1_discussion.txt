The issue is still not fixed. So I push the trivial fix here. Hope it is fine with you guys.:)

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

This is fixed in another patch-set, but I am still waiting on review of it. I'll push this through now to unblock you though.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

My other change just got reviewed and it has some other stuff in it too so I am just going to push that one since this way I won't have to check out this change and rebase.
