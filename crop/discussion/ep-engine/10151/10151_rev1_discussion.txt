Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Two minor comments, but the code looks good.

Line:197, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> The function name here leads me to believe that we are doing something to actually optimize, but we are actually just checking to make sure the order is correct. Maybe a name like verifyKeyOrder would be better?

Line:198, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> I don't think this if statement is necessary since the for loop should immediately exit if the list is empty.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'd kind of rather see a util method sorted() that works similarly to sort and is tested independently.  Then we'd just do an assert(sorted(items)) here which would be faster, better tested, and look really clear in this method.

Line:197, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> This is a method that's defined as part of the kvstore API.  The previous implementation was empty because it assumed the values were already in the order it wanted them in.  Now it explicitly confirms it.

Patch Set 1:

Yeah, having a generic fast "sorted" util function is a great idea. I will work on it soon.
