DESCRIPTION

WIP: implement RCPtr using std::shared_ptr

Current 'rub' is that we occasionally need to acquire a RCPtr from the current object. for std::shared_ptr we can do that by using std::enable_shared_from_this<> and calling shared_from_this(), but we cannot synthesise an RCPtr as it requires a lock.

I *think* that if the lock was removed (and we just used atomics) then it might be safe), but that needs some further thought)...
