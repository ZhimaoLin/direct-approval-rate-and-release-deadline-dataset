DESCRIPTION

Maintain a cursor's offset in a consistent way.

This change makes sure that a cursor's offset includes checkpoint
meta items (e.g., checkpoint_start, checkpoint_end).
However, when we calculate the number of items remaining for
persistence or replication, we should not consider those meta
items.
