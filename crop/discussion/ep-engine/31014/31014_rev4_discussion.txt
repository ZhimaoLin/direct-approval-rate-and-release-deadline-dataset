DESCRIPTION

Add a snapshot marker when backfill ends

Backfilling items from disk is considered a snapshot so we need
to make sure that we add a snapshot marker to the ready queue
once backfill finishes.

Line:1923, src/tapconnection.cc -> why send StreamEnd? there could be more snapshot after this marker.

Line:1923, src/tapconnection.cc -> Similar to David's concerns. Because of NACKs, we might send the stream_end message even before streaming all the items belong to a given snapshot.

Line:2000, src/tapconnection.cc -> We don't need to synchronize the access to streams and readyQ instances?
