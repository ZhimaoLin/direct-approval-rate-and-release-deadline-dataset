DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Enable collections DCP streams for replication

Eventually ns_server will have the job of enabling collection dcp,
until then we will enable collection's on any stream starting with
"replication:" (provided that the bucket config has collections
enabled).

This works by rejecting DCP open for "replication:" and expecting
memcached to retry with DCP_OPEN_COLLECTIONS.

The retry is here - http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/78095/

This is "temporary" until we implement collections in ns_server.
