DESCRIPTION

MB-6756: ++/-- should be prefix operators for non-primitive types

A postfix operator on a non-primitive type will cause the creation of a
of a temporary object, while the prefix operator does not. This change
will provide a small performance boost.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

I wonder if we can add this as a part of our coding standard to the lint tool you mentioned earlier! Thanks.
