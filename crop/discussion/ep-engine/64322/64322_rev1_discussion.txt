DESCRIPTION

MB-19428: Don't schedule a backfill for streams on dead vbuckets

MB-17230 added a new check to stop the creation of an ActiveStream
on a dead vbucket. Due to lock inversion issues this check is done
after creating the ActiveStream object and more importantly
after we've called "setActive".

setActive will drive the stream state machine once, moving from
pending to backfilling, yet we never put the new ActiveStream
into the streams map.

These dangling streams can still then pull data into memory and
increment the backfill manager's accounting, yet because the
stream is not connected to the producer it never goes through
the logic to decrement the accounting.
