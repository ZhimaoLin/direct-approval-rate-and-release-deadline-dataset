Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I understand what you're trying to do here. But, it is usually better to allocate the objects and free them in the same context.

If we free them in the lower layer component, there is always a chance of memory leak if we switch to a different storage engine.

Patch Set 1: No score

I actually don't care it as we will use couchstore for the time being. Feel free to merge this.
