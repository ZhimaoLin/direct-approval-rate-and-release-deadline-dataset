Line:63, src/mutation_log.cc -> Don't we need to throw exceptions here and for the one before as well?

Line:166, src/mutation_log.cc -> I remember there being a bunch of aborts as well, we're probably going to have to replace these with throwing exceptions too.

Line:63, src/mutation_log.cc -> Note the caller (MutationLog::updateInitialBlock() checks the return value and already throws, so I think we are ok. Same with pread().

Line:166, src/mutation_log.cc -> Yeah, I thought I'd already got rid of them but that must have been in memcached - there's still ~50 or so in ep-engine :(

I guess we have another cleanup task.
