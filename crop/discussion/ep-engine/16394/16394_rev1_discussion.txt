DESCRIPTION

CBD-285: refactoring XDCR unit tests

This change-set extracts redundant memcached binary protocol building
code in multiple XDCR unit tests and put them in helper functions.
Future unit tests can call these helper functions directly to send
operation set_with_meta/add_with_meta/delete_with_meta to ep engine
without building the packet from  memcached bianry protocol.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

(4 inline comments)

Looks good overall, there are a few very minor comments. Please take care of them. Also let's try to run this test on Linux system before merging it. Thanks.

Line:5283, ep_testsuite.cc -> I am a CouchBase coder now ;) I don't think you need this comment here.

Line:5333, ep_testsuite.cc -> function name itself is sufficient enough for describing what it does.

Line:5372, ep_testsuite.cc -> Same as above, I don't think we need this function header.

Line:5668, ep_testsuite.cc -> This is a separate issue, but we need to release item after the above store. Ex. h1->release(h, null, i). I wonder if this causes some intermittent memory issues we've seen on Linux box...
