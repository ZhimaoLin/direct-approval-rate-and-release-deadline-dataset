Patch Set 6:

I'd recommend breaking this into two patches for the two logical changes:

1) Moving code around
2) reworking to C++11.

Line:1262, src/connmap.cc -> This looks part of a different change - we are changing the stats API.

I'm ok with this in principle, but I feel it should be in it's own patch - the title of the patch implies a refactor, not a change in functionality.

Line:32, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> I doubt you need this here - IIRC only some storage tests made us of it.
