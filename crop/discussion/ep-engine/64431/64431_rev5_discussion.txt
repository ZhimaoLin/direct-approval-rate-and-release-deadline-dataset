Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:1576, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> This should come from `min_items` and not be hardcoded.

Line:1778, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Probably simpler to change check_min_items to use check() / abort() or similar, then you don't need to explicitly check the result and early return.

Line:2162, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Here and elsewhere - I don;t think you need an explicit std::string constructed - a string literal should be sufficient.
