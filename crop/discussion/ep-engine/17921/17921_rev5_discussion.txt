DESCRIPTION

MB-5800 Don't create mc-engine instances for read-only kvstore

If CouchKVStore instance is read-only, we then don't need to
instantiate the mc-engine instance that allows us to synchronize
the db updates with the DB compactor and indexer running in
another process.

We plan to get rid of this mc-engine dependency from CouchKVStore
because this tight coupling between two components would
cause database inconsistency and make the extensibility quite
difficult.
