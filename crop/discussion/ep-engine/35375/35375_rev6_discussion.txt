DESCRIPTION

MB-9898: Refactor consumer processing of items

This change allows an upr consumer to buffer items before actually
processing them and putting them into the checkpoint queues for
persistence and replication.

This change works by buffering items into an upr stream and then
relying on a background job to periodically take each item and
process it based on how much memory is available in the system.
