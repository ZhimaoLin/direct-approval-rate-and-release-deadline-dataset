DESCRIPTION

MB-9898: Refactor consumer processing of items

This change allows an upr consumer to buffer items before actually
processing them and putting them into the checkpoint queues for
persistence and replication.

This change works by buffering items into an upr stream and then
relying on a background job to periodically take each item and
process it based on how much memory is available in the system.

(6 comments)

Most of comments are minor ones, but think we need to address them to make sure that it works functionally.

Line:30, src/upr-consumer.cc -> connection_t &c

Line:43, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Please use static_cast as it is always UPRConsumer.

Line:222, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Where is "cas" value?

Line:290, src/upr-consumer.cc -> We don't need to wake up the daemon task here?

Line:746, src/upr-stream.cc -> We don't need to address it in this commit. But, as an optimization, I rather grab all the items from the queue and then release the lock, and finally process those items all at a time. In this way, we can reduce the overhead of grabbing / releasing the lock for each item.

Line:816, src/upr-stream.cc -> delete mutation->getItem()?

Line:30, src/upr-consumer.cc -> In order to pass this by reference I would need to create a reference counter point in the calling function and then pass it by reference. Since this does this automatically I think it's a little bit cleaner and it's also how we ended up doing it in the UprBackfill job. If you would still prefer I change it let me know.

Line:43, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Done

Line:222, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Done. Added to Item constructor.

Line:290, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Added.

Line:746, src/upr-stream.cc -> MB-11010

Line:816, src/upr-stream.cc -> Done
