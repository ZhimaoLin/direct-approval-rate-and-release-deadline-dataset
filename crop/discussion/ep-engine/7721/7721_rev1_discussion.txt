DESCRIPTION

Fix build errors with gcc 4.6.

With gcc 4.6 there were plenty of warnings (treated as errors) related to name
shadowing (mostly variables named 'item' shadowing memcached's type
'item'). Renamed those conflicting definitions trying to use the names
already present in the project.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think this idea is OK, but I'm going to vote no on this branch since it's a maintenance release branch.  I'll happily be overridden if we think it's a problem we want to resolve for source dist of this link (adding Matt).

If we want it here, let's also work to merge it up to 2.0.  Otherwise, let's do it there.

BTW, I pulled the management guys off the review and replaced it with the DB guys.  I think we need alias types of things in Jasmin Rangel.

Patch Set 1:

I asked Aliaksey to do this against 1.7 so that when 1.7.1 is out our product could be built on more modern distros. But apparently it's too late now to get this into 1.7.1.

Patch Set 1:

fyi, I heard from Volker, btw, that he needed something like this for 2.0 (branch-20), and he also said this commit didn't apply cleanly on branch-20.
