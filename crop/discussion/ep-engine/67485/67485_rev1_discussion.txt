Line:210, src/dcp/producer.cc -> "... and only active vbuckets were requested" ?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> If you use the same Change-Id on both patches then commit-validation will check them out together to aid in testing.

Line:682, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Could you make this test more exhaustive? Check all the other negative cases (pending, dead), and also check the positive case (i.e. asking for ACTIVE_ONLY for an active vbucket succeeds).
