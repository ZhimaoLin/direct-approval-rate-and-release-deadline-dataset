Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think we should get rid of "configuration.addStats(add_stat, cookie);" from doEngineStats() instead. I don't understand why we import duplicate stats from the configuration instance.

Patch Set 1:

Okay, I think we should remove all the engine params from Stats class because we already have them in the configuration instance.

Mike,

Let's discuss it more tomorrow. Now, I have better understanding about how the configuration works in 2.0

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I think we should keep the current implementation because the access to the configuration instance requires grabbing a lock and many different threads need to get the value of low and high watermark

Regarding MB-5354, we can simply remove calling configuration stats from doEngineStats() because those config stats are separately available via "stats config".
