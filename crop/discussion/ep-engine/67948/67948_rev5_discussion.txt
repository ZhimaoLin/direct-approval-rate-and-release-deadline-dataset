DESCRIPTION

MB-21036: Fix intermittent failure in shutdown_snapshot_range

Issue is that the test attempts to create exactly 3 checkpoints,
however this is load-dependent (i.e. how quickly the flusher runs and
creates checkpoints).

Remove this intermediate checks in the test, and just check the
sequence numbers.
