DESCRIPTION

MB-20136: Fix intermittent failure in shutdown_snapshot_range

Issue is that the test attempts to create exactly 3 checkpoints,
however it writes 100 items which means the second checkpoint can be
split (i.e. we end up with an earlier checkpoint which has less than
100, then a additional checkpoint with the remainder.

Fix is to just write one item, which cannot be split across
checkpoints.
