Patch Set 13:

(9 comments)

Line:967, src/kvstore.h -> As I commented before, let's rename fileformat to filename_suffix

Line:200, src/kvstore.cc -> I think we can consolidate this function with updateDbFileMap below

Line:140, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> FDB/KV handle pools

Line:161, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We don't need this function anymore as we don't use ".compact" suffix.

Line:174, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we can remove this check and directly push it to vector.

Line:203, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We don't need this stmt as dbFile is not referenced at all.

Line:405, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Read-Only FDB/KV handles

Line:406, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Read-Write FDB/KV handles

Line:407, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> STATE SNAPSHOT FDB/KV handles

Line:278, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we need to reset the block cache stats too.

Line:530, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please reset the block cache stats too.

Line:968, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> case default:

Line:946, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As I mentioned, we should persist a vbucket state change along with a batch write through the same commit call. We can't do this in setVBucketState below.
