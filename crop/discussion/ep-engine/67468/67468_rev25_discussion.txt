DESCRIPTION

MB-20611: Adapting ForestKVStore to map a vbucket to a file

+ Removing the commitInterval paradigm
+ Seperate kvshandle maps for RW, RO, Default (state)
+ Moving kvstore common functionality to KVStore class
+ Caching blockCacheHits and blockCacheMisses in kvstore
+ Update cachedDocCount and cachedDeletedCount by invoking
  fdb_get_kvs_info and not fdb_get_file_info to avoid
  accounting items from the file's default kvstore.
