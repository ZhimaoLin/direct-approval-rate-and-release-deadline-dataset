DESCRIPTION

MB-20611: Adapting ForestKVStore to map a vbucket to a file

+ Removing the commitInterval paradigm
+ Seperate kvshandle maps for RW, RO, Default (state)
+ Moving kvstore common functionality to KVStore class
+ Caching blockCacheHits and blockCacheMisses in kvstore
+ Update cachedDocCount and cachedDeletedCount by invoking
  fdb_get_kvs_info and not fdb_get_file_info to avoid
  accounting items from the file's default kvstore.

Line:1746, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> You can open the vbucket KV store here and add its handle to ctx, so that we can avoid creating the KV handle for each compaction callback above.

Line:1773, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As I mentioned above, you don't need to open the new compacted file.

Line:1789, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> You can now close the old file's handle (now actually new file's handle) here.

Line:455, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think you can simply pass 'ForestKvsHandle' that has a pair of a file handle and KV handle. Then, we can avoid calling 'openKvsHandle' in line 469

Line:1471, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This would be quite expensive because ForestDB handle is created for each compaction callback call. We should pass the corresponding KV handle to this callback function through 'ctx' parameter.

Line:1571, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to close the old file's handle here, but can pass it to updateFileInfo because the old file's handle will automatically be linked to the new compacted file upon any ForestDB API call. I think you can put some brief comments.

Line:1660, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Given that we only access last_seqnum of kvs_info, I think we can simply call fdb_get_kvs_seqnum API instead.
