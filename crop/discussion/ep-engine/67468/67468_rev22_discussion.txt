DESCRIPTION

MB-20611: Adapting ForestKVStore to map a vbucket to a file

+ Removing the commitInterval paradigm
+ Seperate kvshandle maps for RW, RO, Default (state)
+ Moving kvstore common functionality to KVStore class
+ Caching blockCacheHits and blockCacheMisses in kvstore
+ Update cachedDocCount and cachedDeletedCount by invoking
  fdb_get_kvs_info and not fdb_get_file_info to avoid
  accounting items from the file's default kvstore.

Abhinav,

I think your last patch will address the compaction inefficiency, but found one minor bug that is related to the thread safe issue when multiple compaction tasks are running at the same time for a given shard.

Line:457, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Even though we schedule a single compaction task at a time by default, it is still possible to increase the parallel degree of compaction tasks (i.e., multiple compaction tasks running at the same time). Therefore, having a single KV handle for compaction callback won't be thread safe in this case. We need to maintain a vector instance of KV handles for compaction callback.
