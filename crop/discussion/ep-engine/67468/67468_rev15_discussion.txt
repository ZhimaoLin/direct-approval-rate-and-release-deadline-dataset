A couple of minor comments. Overall, it looks good. Let's run the unit test and figure out if there are any regressions from this commit.

Line:237, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> status != FDB_RESULT_NO_SUCH_FILE

Line:218, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we should put a bracket from the line 217 to 224, so that fkvsHandle should be freed, which consequently calls fdb_close.

Line:472, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto
