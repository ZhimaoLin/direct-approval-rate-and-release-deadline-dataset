Please update the stats.org as well.

Line:3557, src/ep_engine.cc -> Shouldn't we check if the command is GAT or not before incrementing the stat?

Line:3571, src/ep_engine.cc -> white space

Line:264, src/stats.hh -> We don't need this stat. I guess we can increment the existing "get" stat. Then, it wouldn't require any changes in the ns_server.

Line:266, src/stats.hh -> I don't think we need a separate stat for gat miss. It is determined by the ns-server through bg_fetches / total_get_num.
