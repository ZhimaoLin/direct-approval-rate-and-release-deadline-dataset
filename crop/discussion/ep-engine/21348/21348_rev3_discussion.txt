Patch Set 3: Do not submit

Mike,

As we discussed, we shouldn't make any changes in ep-engine, but instead adapt the bucket engine to address this issue. This task is moved to post 2.0. Please abandon this change.

Patch Set 3:

Chiyoung,

First off, I agree on not having this in 2.0 and that it would be better to not have this change in ep-engine, but the reason I have not abandoned it yet is that this change would actually need to go in memcached. We actually keep the stats for get operations at that level and it appears that we would likely have to add another engine api just for gat. Bucket engine only handles top keys stats and does not appear to change operation stats.
