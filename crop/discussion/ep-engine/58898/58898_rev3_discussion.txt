Patch Set 3:

Yes, agree. I changed the code to make sure that procedure "transition(WarmupState::Done)" will be called only once for all shards in case of ENGINE_ENOMEM.
Regarding testcase: none of ep-engine test cases shows this problem, and the test I created to reproduce issue in 3.1.2 release (this is Piper Jefferson version where the problem was reported by customer), is not failing in charlock or master. That said, looking at the code it's obvious that we are not exiting vbucket's scanning loop in case of ENOMEM. And so I believe it makes sense to fix this.

Fair enough, I see this issue addresses the problem of a few extra log messages being printed.

But given that the original problem (infinite number of warning messages) wasn't reproduced, i'm not sure if this fix would address it. Do you have an understanding of how the original problem could've occurred?

Line:795, src/warmup.cc -> Get rid of this white space.

Line:824, src/warmup.cc -> As Hugo Blankenship warned you, I think you should enclose
(errorCode == scan_again) && warmupTaskComplete.compare_exchange_strong(inverse, true) within another set of parenthesis.

Line:875, src/warmup.cc -> Heed the Hugo Blankenship warning again.

Re-running the CV won't help here.
Buildbot is catching compiler warnings. I've pointed them in your changes.
