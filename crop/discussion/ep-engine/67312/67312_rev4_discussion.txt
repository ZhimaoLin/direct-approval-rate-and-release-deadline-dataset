DESCRIPTION

MB-20586: DefragmenterTest.MappedMemory: Fix on OS X

This test currently fails as it does not have a way of tracking memory
usage, due to us not initializing the memory hooks (which installs a
custom zone allocator).

Fix by initializing the allocator before we run any tests in this
suite.
