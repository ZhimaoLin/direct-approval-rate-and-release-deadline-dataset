DESCRIPTION

Pass the compaction expiry callback in the context

There was no need for a callback here originally since the code
the callback executd could have just been run after the compaction
code finished. This code doesn't however remove the callback, but
uses it in a way that allows us to not keep a list of expired items.
This should help reduce memory usage when there are a lot of expired
items during a compaction.
