DESCRIPTION

Add WithMeta unit tests

Create a test-suite using the SingleThreaded store test to drive
the with_meta commands.

The test-suite so far tries to exercise many of the error and success
paths.

The intent is to give a starting point for more comprehensive and easy
to understand *with_meta tests as opposed to the extension of the
testapp tests.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Sorry for the slow review, combination of large patch + trying to get Tombstone Purging implemented.

In general looks good - great addition to the XDCR tests. Few minor comments, no single thing blocking.

Line:91, tests/module_tests/evp_store_with_meta.cc -> Style: Can be more flexible / explicit at the call site of where a failure occurred if you remove the expected code and just make this return the status code from set/deleteWith meta. That'll push the EXPECT macro to the call-site.

Line:376, tests/module_tests/evp_store_with_meta.cc -> Comment seems to stop abruptly..

Line:583, tests/module_tests/evp_store_with_meta.cc -> This and the previous (seqno) test - looks like a bunch of the code is the same - could that be put into a common helper function called by both tests, maybe with a bool flag specifying the conflict res mode? Then at least the identical code wouldn't need to be repeated?

(Similary in other tests you have here).

Line:202, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Possibly not worth it now, but KVBucketTest has a vbid member variable so you could skip specifying it here.

Line:211, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Given this is a static check you could use static_assert()
