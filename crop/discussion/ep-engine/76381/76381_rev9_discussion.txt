DESCRIPTION

Add WithMeta unit tests

Create a test-suite using the SingleThreaded store test to drive
the with_meta commands.

The test-suite so far tries to exercise many of the error and success
paths.

The intent is to give a starting point for more comprehensive and easy
to understand *with_meta tests as opposed to the extension of the
testapp tests.
