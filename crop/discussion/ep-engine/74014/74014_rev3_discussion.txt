DESCRIPTION

Refactor getLockedBucket to remove int ptr

getLockedBucket returned a lock and alter the int passed via a pointer.
This commit combines the two in to a structure that is returned. Part of
the motivation of this was that the bucketNum should not be nullable.

looks good. except for a few formatting stuff

Line:49, src/ephemeral_vb.h -> nit: Formatting not per our coding standards

Line:142, src/hash_table.h -> nit: space after const before the braces.
Do you use git-clang-config ? If not, plz consider using it

Line:332, src/hash_table.h -> Please update the documentation for all the changed functions
