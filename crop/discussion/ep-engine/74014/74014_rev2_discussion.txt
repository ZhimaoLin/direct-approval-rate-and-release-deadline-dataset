DESCRIPTION

Refactor getLockedBucket to remove int ptr

getLockedBucket returned a lock and alter the int passed via a pointer.
This commit combines the two in to a structure that is returned. Part of
the motivation of this was that the bucketNum should not be nullable.

Patch Set 2:

Note: I'm planning follow up commits to get rid of the default parameters used as well as converting some boolean parameters to enums to improve readability. I'm not doing these changes in this patch so that it is easier to review.
