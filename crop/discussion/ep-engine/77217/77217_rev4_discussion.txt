DESCRIPTION

MB-23999: Perform CAS check only if item being stored is alive

If the existing document is expired, then storing another
deleted document with a CAS results in a ENOENT instead of
returning EEXISTS. The CAS check on an expired document is only
applicable if the incoming document is not in Deleted state
