DESCRIPTION

MB-10159 Correct a lower rev_seqno value for SET /DEL operation.

If SET, ADD, or DEL request has a lower rev_seqno value than
the one on memory or disk due to unknown reasons, this change
makes sure that the rev_seqno value won't be decreased when
a dirty item is persisted onto disk.

We will continue to investigate if there are any edge cases
that cause an item's rev_seqno to be dropped when it is
persisted.

Patch Set 1:

Guys,

This is the urgent hot fix (more correctly, band-aid) for one of our customers. Can you please review this hot fix in your earliest time (tomorrow morning)?

We need to build the new ep.so and then complete the QE tests by tomorrow evening.

Thanks,
