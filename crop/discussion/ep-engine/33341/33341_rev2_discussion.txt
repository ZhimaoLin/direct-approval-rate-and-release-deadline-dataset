DESCRIPTION

MB-10159 Correct a lower rev_seqno value for SET /DEL operation.

If SET, ADD, or DEL request has a lower rev_seqno value than
the one on memory or disk due to unknown reasons, this change
makes sure that the rev_seqno value won't be decreased when
a dirty item is persisted onto disk.

We will continue to investigate if there are any edge cases
that cause an item's rev_seqno to be dropped when it is
persisted.
