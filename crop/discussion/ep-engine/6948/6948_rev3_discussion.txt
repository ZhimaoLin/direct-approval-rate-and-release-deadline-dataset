DESCRIPTION

MB-3689 Getl should only return value in body section

Currently getl returns both the key and value in the body section
of the memcached binary response protocol message. This is
inconsistent with other get commands, which only return the value
for the specified key in the body section. This commit fixes this
inconsistency
