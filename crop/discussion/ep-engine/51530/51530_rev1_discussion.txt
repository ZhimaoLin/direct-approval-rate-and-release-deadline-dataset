DESCRIPTION

MB-14322: Handle race for db files when engine and perf tests run concurrently

When tests engine tests and perf tests run concurrently, both use db files
with same name, causing a contention. This fix lets engine tests use
db files with default name and changes the name for db files used by perf
test. In general, the fix ensures that if a test wants to create db files at
non default location then it does not contend with tests that run with
db diles at default location.
