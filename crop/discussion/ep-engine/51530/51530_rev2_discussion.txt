DESCRIPTION

MB-14322: Handle race for db files when engine and perf tests run concurrently

When tests engine tests and perf tests run concurrently, both use db files
with same name, causing a contention. This fix lets engine tests use
db files with default name and changes the name for db files used by perf
test. In general, the fix ensures that if a test wants to create db files at
non default location then it does not contend with tests that run with
db diles at default location.

Line:243, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> Please make this 'if clause' as a function as it has almost the same logic as the one in prepare function.

Line:375, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Please remove the whitespace.

Line:377, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Please rephrase as follows:

This ensures that the perf test doesn't not use the same file as the functional test when they are running concurrently.
