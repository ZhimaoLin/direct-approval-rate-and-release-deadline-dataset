(8 comments)

I have some concerns about adding 'lww_eligible' flag to both Item and StoreValue class because this flag is just for a specific conflict resolution. What if we plan to support other conflict resolution methods in the future? Are we going to keep adding new flags into those classes?

Line:83, src/ext_meta_parser.h -> Please reorder these member variables by putting longer-length variables first. This can reduce the memory overhead from creating a metadata instance.

Line:519, src/ep.cc -> I saw this checking logic in many places. Can we check this condition only once inside queueDirty function instead?

Line:161, src/dcp-producer.h -> This is not just for XDCR. Please rename it more generally.

Line:139, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Please define the const variable for '1' instead of hard-coding.

Line:828, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> Why do we need to set it to false here?

Line:433, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Please name it with a more general term like 'enable_extra_metadata'

Line:625, src/item.h -> Just our coding convention, we don't use '_' in a class member variable, but instead differentiate it through an upper-case letter like 'lwwEligible'

Line:131, src/dcp-consumer.h -> Please rename it with a more general term like 'enable_extra_metadata'

Line:828, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> In order to avoid sending the control message every time step is called.
