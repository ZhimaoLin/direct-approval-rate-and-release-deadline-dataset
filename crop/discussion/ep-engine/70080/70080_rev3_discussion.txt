DESCRIPTION

MB-21568: Don't double-free newdb if rewind_db_header fails

If couchstore_rewind_db_header() fails, then it will free the DB
before returning, so we need to ensure that the DbHolder doesn't cause
a double-free by also trying to free the Db.

Found during merge to master where we have improved couchstore testing
(CouchKVStoreErrorInjectionTest)
