DESCRIPTION

MB-21568: Don't double-free newdb if rewind_db_header fails

If couchstore_rewind_db_header() fails, then it will free the DB
before returning, so we need to ensure that the DbHolder doesn't cause
a double-free by also trying to free the Db.

Found during merge to master where we have improved couchstore testing
(CouchKVStoreErrorInjectionTest)

Line:507, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> I think release would be a better name as if we're assuming the unique_ptr nomenclature the db should otherwise also be closed as part of this method.
