Line:370, src/stored-value.h -> Isn't a temp item always non-resident? If so, then we don't need to check it explicitly.

Line:370, src/stored-value.h -> That is true, but during unlocked_add, the cachedSize is calculated much before the item is marked as non-resident.

Line:370, src/stored-value.h -> I'm not sure if I understand your comment. Can you point out the code in unlocked_add? It seems to me that we should fix it in unlocked_add if cacheSize is calculated in a wrong way.

Line:370, src/stored-value.h -> Makes sense, i'll fix unlocked_add, so cacheSize is calculated correctly then.
