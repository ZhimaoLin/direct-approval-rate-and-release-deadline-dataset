DESCRIPTION

ep_perfsuite: Tune down the iteration counts of tests

To maintain a fast-running suite for these micro-benchmarks tune down
the iteration count of some tests so they each take under 2 seconds to
execute (most take ~1second). This brings the suite runtime down from
~66s down to ~7s.

The actual metrics reported are representative with the previous ones,
althoug the absolute values have changed so they shouldn't be compared
across this commit.
