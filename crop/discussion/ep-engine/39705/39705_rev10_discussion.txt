DESCRIPTION

Add stats for measuring ExecutorPool scheduling delay & runtimes

Usage: cbstats ip:port -b <bucketname> scheduler

It returns the timing histograms of the scheduling overhead incurred by
all tasks in ep-engine. Scheduling overhead is computed as the difference
between the scheduled runtime of a task and the actual runtime.
This will give us definitive answers to how much delay is introduced by
the scheduling overhead of the global thread pool and how it affects
each task in ep-engine.

Usage: cbstats ip:port -b <bucketname> runtimes

It returns the timing histograms of various task runtimes measured from
the ExecutorPool.
