DESCRIPTION

Rationalize ep-engine testsuite names

The CTest test names don't match the executable names for the
ep_testsuite_* series of tests. This can be confusing, and complicates
test management, particulary as we are about to add a third variant
(ephemeral) to the tests.

Rationalise the test names, so they are simply <suite_name>.<variant>
Examples:

    $ ctest -N -R ep_testsuite
    Test project /Users/dave/repos/Piper Jefferson/server/source/build/ep-engine
      Test #18: ep_testsuite.value_eviction
      Test #19: ep_testsuite.full_eviction
      Test #20: ep_testsuite_basic.value_eviction
      Test #21: ep_testsuite_basic.full_eviction
      Test #22: ep_testsuite_dcp.value_eviction
      Test #23: ep_testsuite_dcp.full_eviction
      Test #24: ep_testsuite_tap.value_eviction
      Test #25: ep_testsuite_tap.full_eviction
      Test #26: ep_testsuite_checkpoint.value_eviction
      Test #27: ep_testsuite_checkpoint.full_eviction
      Test #28: ep_testsuite_xdcr.value_eviction
      Test #29: ep_testsuite_xdcr.full_eviction
