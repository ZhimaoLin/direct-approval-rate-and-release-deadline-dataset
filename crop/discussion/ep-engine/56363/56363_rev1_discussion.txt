DESCRIPTION

MB-16632 ActiveStream locking changes.

Significant changes to ActiveStream to avoid streamMutex.

Introduce 2 new RWLocks

One for readyQ
One for state_

Re-jig the control-flow so that state changes are bubbled back to
higher functions and the actual transition peformed under the correct
lock.

Needs more work on PassiveStream and notifierStream to remove streamMutex
altogther and do everything with the least contention.

Consider this draft for now. I can probably delete streamMutex altogether once PassiveStream etc... is tidied up.
