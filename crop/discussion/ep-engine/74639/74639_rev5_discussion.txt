DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Add point-in-time snapshot enabled range read to LinkedList

Monotonically point-in-time snapshots which can be used for incremental DCP.
This is implemented in the sequential data structure 'BasicLinkedList' in
EphemeralVBuckets. This is equivalent to DCP disk backfill in Piper Jefferson
buckets.

To get a point-in-time snapshot from the list, the main requirement is no
de-deduplication be allowed on the list in the range where the read for the
snapshot is happenning. We try to achieve it by not blocking the writes
on the list during the time of the range read.

This commit implements only the range read part. The non-blocking write
during a range read will be evident with implementation of updateListElem
in an upcoming commit.
