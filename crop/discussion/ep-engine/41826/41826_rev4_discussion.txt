DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Refactor database scan code

This change splits the database scan (called dump in our API's) into
three separate phases. The first is initializing the scan, the second
is actually doing the scan, and the last is closing the database. One
fundamental change is the fact that we now keep a handle to the
database file in the KVStore until the handle is closed. This change
paves the way for allowing us to have pausable backfills.

Line:88, src/kvstore.h -> Can you rename "ok", "nd", and  "od" to "_onlyKeys", "_noDeletes", "_onlyDeletes"?

Line:1231, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I'm not sure why we need to check "db != NULL". It seems wrong. I don't see any line that destroys this handle.

Line:1243, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think we need to gracefully handle this error instead of abort(). We can address it in a separate commit later.

Line:1247, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't think this will be thread-safe. I guess this is the reason why we saw the crash in the QE test, and think you already addressed it in a separate commit.

Line:668, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> AtomicValue<size_t>

Line:88, src/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:1231, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> It must have been left over from some other change I made. I'll remove it.

Line:1243, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I would prefer not to change it here. In one of the other changes I made I add better error handling in this function. I'll post it as a WIP.

Line:1247, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Yeah, I'll squash that change with this one so there's no confusion.

Line:668, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Done
