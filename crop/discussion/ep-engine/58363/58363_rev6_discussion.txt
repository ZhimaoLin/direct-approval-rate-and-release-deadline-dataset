DESCRIPTION

Update CMakeLists to support running testsuite in full eviction mode

* Custom target: make test-full-eviction
* make-test will run this too
* Seperate dbname for full-eviction-tests so as to not clash with
  engine-tests: ./full_eviction_test
* Pre-requisite: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/58365/

Line:395, CMakeLists.txt -> We've lost the previous command-line arguments (flushall_enabled, ht_size) - is that not a problem?

Line:395, CMakeLists.txt -> No, not a problem. You see they were never really used. This change in memcached: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/58365/, now will make sure any command line parameters are picked up.

Line:395, CMakeLists.txt -> Yep, I saw the memcached change to engine_testapp. I just wanted to confirm we don't need the explicit ht_size / flushall_enabled params we used to have.
