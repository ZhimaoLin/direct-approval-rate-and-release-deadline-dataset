DESCRIPTION

Update CMakeLists to support running testsuite in full eviction mode

* Custom target: make test-full-eviction
* make-test will run this too
* Seperate dbname for full-eviction-tests so as to not clash with
  engine-tests: ./full_eviction_test
* Pre-requisite: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/58365/
