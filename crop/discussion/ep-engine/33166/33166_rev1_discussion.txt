Line:4186, src/ep_engine.cc -> It is not scope of this change, but this function becomes longer and unmanageable. We need to refactor and classify stats requests based on their types.

Line:5034, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please use static_cast as we already know the type.

Please see my comments. I think this code might be ok in its current state.

Line:4186, src/ep_engine.cc -> MB-10147

Line:5034, src/ep_engine.cc -> This might be an UprConsumer which is why I did the dynamic_cast.
