DESCRIPTION

MB-11941: Use the latest seqno during tap mutation/deletion cur snapshot

We generate the seqno when inserting the item into the hashtable when
using tap. As a reuslt we need to retrieve that seqno when updating
the latest snapshot because the byseqno passed into the mutation and
deletion functions for tap is always 0.
