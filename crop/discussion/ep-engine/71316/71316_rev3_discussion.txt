DESCRIPTION

CheckpointTest: Add a ThreadGate class

Add a ThreadGate class - an object which is used to synchronise the
execution of a number of threads.  Each thread calls thread_up(), and
until all thread have called this they are all blocked.

Note: This functionality already existed in the test but used static
variables and hence only allowed it to be used once per program
execution. A forthcoming change will want to run this test twice (with
different parameters), hence this refactoring.

(3 comments)

Line:111, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> really not keen on this use of list initialisation, very inconsistent with the rest of our code base, if you want 0.. thread_count(0) or thread_count(),

Line:139, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> change to a reference, your usage is to refer to a stack variable. Otherwise use a unique_ptr if heap allocating

Line:243, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Just use normal construction. Is list-initialisation (which is finding a matching constructor) really beneficial?

 gate(n_threads);
