DESCRIPTION

MB-23530: Add test for CAS set after delete

It is erroneously possible to set an item with CAS after deleting it on
an ephemeral bucket or a full eviction persistent bucket. This breaks
the expected behaviour.

This test should identify this failure and as such can not be enabled
for these types until after the issue is resolved.
