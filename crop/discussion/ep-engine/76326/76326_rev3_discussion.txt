DESCRIPTION

MB-23530: Add test for CAS set after delete

It is erroneously possible to set an item with CAS after deleting it on
an ephemeral bucket. This breaks the expected behaviour.

This test should identify this failure and as such can not be enabled
for ephemeral buckets until after the issue is resolved.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:320, tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Nicer to do:

 engine->getConfiguration->getBucketType() == "persistent"

That would work if say we expanded out the Param to include more options.

Line:332, tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Similar here, check the engine config.

Line:333, tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> For completeness you should Adrianna Holmesally run the bgfetch task (see the other tests) and once the BGFetch completes check the result is ENOENT.

Patch Set 3:

Line:333, tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Sorry I didn't explain that very well - VBucket::processSet checks itself:

if (v && v->isExpired(ep_real_time()) && !hasMetaData)

stored-value.h

bool isExpired(time_t asOf) const {
        if (getExptime() != 0 && getExptime() < asOf) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

it's not actually being expired, but the time has passed. It passed the test by entering that `if` when stepping through. Otherwise, it passes through processSet in the same way as in ephemeral, succeeds setting the document, and fails the test.

Again, I may have erred if this is sounding fishy?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:333, tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Glad you pointed this out! Looks like it actually fails the test once that is done! It /can/ pass the test, if it happens that by vbucket.cc:1953 the tempDeletedItem is expired (such as when stepping the code) but it usually fails in the same manner as an ephemeral bucket.

I've genericized the fix to check for a tempDeletedItem too. 

(This all comes with the caveat that I may be doing something wrong either)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:333, tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> What's expiring the tempDeletedItem? The flusher shouldn't be running (IIRC)
