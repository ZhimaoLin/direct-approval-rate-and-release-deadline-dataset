DESCRIPTION

MB-12924: [Observe] Do not return keyStats for a temp item

This caused an issue with observe during bidirectional
XDCR on deletes, where observe over one of the keys
caused the client to return a KeyExistsError as the
cas was not what was expected for a temp item (that
was deleted already).
