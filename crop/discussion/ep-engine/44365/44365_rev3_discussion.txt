DESCRIPTION

[Observe] Do not return keyStats for a temp item

This caused issue with observe during bidirectional
XDCR on deletes, where one of the keys was returning
a KeyExistsError during observe's polling, although
deleted already, as we were fetching the cas of a
temp item.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Sorry to be a pain, but I think it is important that it is linked to a MB and the commit message has that MB. I have created MB-12924 for this purpose.

The main reasons behind this are:

1) It allows the support team and customers to track a fix to a MB to a CBSE and back to a ticket.

2) Other customers could hit this problem and it is good to have a public viewable defect.

3) With no defect, we do not have anyway of tracking this fix, i.e should it be in the next maintenance fix.
