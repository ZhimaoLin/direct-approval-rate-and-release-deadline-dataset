DESCRIPTION

Reset a vbucket on the source node if its take-over is completed

If the source node completes the transfer of a given vbucket to
the destination by receiving an ACK for vb_state_active message,
it can safely reset that vbucket from memory. Otherwise, the
source will keep all dead vbuckets until the ns_server janitor
triggers vbucket deletion commands after rebalance.
