Mike, David,

I quickly went through the current UPR implementation and had some comments. We should address them separately if they are valid issues.

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> What I meant here is that we should iterate "all" list instance and compare the list's element with "conn" instance by comparing their pointer values

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> uprconnmap won't allow duplicate conn. conn with the same name is removed from 'all' first before the new one is added.

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I don't see any other parts that removes an old connection instance with the same name from "all" list. I think we need to define "bool operator== (...)" in SingleThreadedRCPtr class to remove an old instance from the list.

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> they can only be added here and the "findByName" line make sure the same one can't be added again.

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I still don't understand what you meant by that. I saw below that we always add a new connection to "all" list.

If you're sure of it, can you please add a unit test by adding two connections with different names and add a new connection that has the same name as one of those two connections, and then make sure that we still have two connections in the list?

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> You're right. The name append line should be before the find. it messed up the check. I am uploading a fix.

I have addressed all of your comments. Each issue should now either be fixed or have a bug filed for it.

Line:54, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I have filed MB-9892 to track this issue. It's a simple fix, but we need to add testing for it and that will be a lot more work.

Line:4888, src/ep_engine.cc -> Connection pausing is not implemented yet and is a change that I will be working on soon. The reason I have delayed it is that people writing consumers don't really care much about the cpu being at 100% at this point. I have filed MB-9715 to track this issue.

Line:155, src/upr-producer.cc -> I have already fixed this.

Line:178, src/upr-producer.cc -> This function has already been removed from the code base.

Line:248, src/upr-producer.cc -> This function has already been removed.
