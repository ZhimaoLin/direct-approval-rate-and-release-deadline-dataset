DESCRIPTION

Don't need to reserve connection cookie for backfill tasks.

From 1.7.1, we check TAP connection validity by using the TAP
connection's name instead of its cookie, in performing backfill
tasks. Therefore, we do not need to reserve the TAP conneciton
cookie at the beginning of a backfill task and release it upon
the backfill completion anymore.
