Line:31, couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> Why not directly instantiate the above object inside CouchKVStore constructer?

Line:342, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> let's use camel case for variable names

Line:31, couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> The stat collection code is independent of CouchKVStore. I don't think it's necessary to tie them together such that the stat code can no longer be used without CouchKVStore.

Line:342, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Done

Line:31, couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> It keeps this reusable and also allows us to not export any of these cfs_* symbols outside of this file :)
