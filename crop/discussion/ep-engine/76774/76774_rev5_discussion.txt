DESCRIPTION

Move OSV::stale back to StoredValue

As part of MB-23795 it was necessary to move the OrderedStoredValue
{stale} flag out of the packed bitfields in StoredValue so it didn't
share its byte with any other data not guarded by writeLock. This was
to prevent any data races, as C++/x86_64 only exposes byte-level
addressing and if it remained in the bitfield we'd see races when
other elements in the bitfield (e.g. deleted) were changed.

While fixing the correctness issue, this had the consequence of
bloating the size of OrderedStoredValue by 8 bytes; as OSV was
previously an exact multiple of 8 bytes in size, and adding one more
byte for the bitfield forced the object size to increase by 8 bytes to
maintain ABI alignment rules.

However, we actually /do/ have a spare byte in StoredValue after the
bitfields. If we move the stale flag back to SV, but in its own byte
then we recover the size bloat of OSV - we are back to the original SV
and OSV sizes before MB-23795.
