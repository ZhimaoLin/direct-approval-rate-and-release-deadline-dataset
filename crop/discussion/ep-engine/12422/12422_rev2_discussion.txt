DESCRIPTION

Remove unused list of persistence callbacks from Transaction class

As persistence callbacks are not used in Transaction::commit() at
this time, we don't need to maintain them in a separate list
within a single transaction.

Patch Set 2:

the couch backend does _not_ trigger the callback during the ::set(), method, but at the time we're running commit()... I would expect this to crash badly there, or is that code path changed already?

Patch Set 2:

I'm working on refactoring PersistenceCallback class, but forgot that a different callback handling was used for couchdb backend.

Sorry for the confusion. I will upload the refactored code as a separate commit soon.
