DESCRIPTION

[Backport] MB-4661 Don't skip dead vbuckets in the flusher loop

During the rebalance, a given dead vbucket can be set to replica
state before the janitor issues a vbucket deletion command for
that dead vbucket. If the dead vbucket has the same open
open checkpoint id as the active vbucket, the vbucket reset and
backfill won't be required. Therefore, the persistence tasks on
dead vbuckets should not be skipped. If those dead vbuckets are
deleted from memory by the janitor that runs every 10 sec,
their persistence tasks will be then skipped.
