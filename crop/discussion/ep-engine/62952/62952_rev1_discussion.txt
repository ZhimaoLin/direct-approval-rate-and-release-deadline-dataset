DESCRIPTION

MB-19183: Clean-up connection handlers in DCP tests

Disconnect the connection handler cleanly instead of
just calling reset.

This results in the mock_cookie_release being called
which will free the cookie.  Therefore we do not
need to explictly delete the cookie at the end of
each test.
