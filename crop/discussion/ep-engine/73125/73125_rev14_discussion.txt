DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Flusher integration and set/get support

This commit ties together collections code so that system events
and manifest updates are now applied to storage.

Without any external API calls data will still flow because all
keys are by default, default collection keys and the $default
collection exists in the VB::Manifest.

With an external call (currently via VBucket) we can make changes to
the collection state and enable policing of collections. Changes to
collections creates SystemEvents and they are now flushed to
couchstore.

SystemEventFlush tries to capture extra state for a single
run of the flusher for the handling of SystemEvents (writing
special documents and _local docs)

This commit enables set/get only to be collection aware - each
datapath in/out method will need similar "isValid" checks.

EPBucket unit tests enable namespace persistence and check that
collections can be created, written and read from (get/set only)
