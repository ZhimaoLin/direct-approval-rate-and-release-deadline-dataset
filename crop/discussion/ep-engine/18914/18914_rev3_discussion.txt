DESCRIPTION

MB-5876: Add an initial state for temp items

state and schedule a bg fetch. Thi background fetch will set
the initial temp item to either a deleted or non-existent temp
item.

Line:506, stored-value.cc -> I don't understand why this part should be removed. hashtable::add() is also invoked for normal add API. This might break XDCR properties.

Line:506, stored-value.cc -> I was trying to simplify the code by moving some stuff around. I see your point though and will change this back.
