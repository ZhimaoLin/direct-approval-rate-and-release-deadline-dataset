DESCRIPTION

MB-23505: [Ephemeral] Do not call KVStore file during vb-takeover stats

In Ephemeral buckets we do not have KVStore data file to get an estimate
of persisted deletes. We should rather get the estimate from in-memory
data structure.

We are already running vb-takeover tests on Ephemeral buckets in our
unit tests, but for some reason KVStore data file read does not fail
in unit tests. It only fails during a cluster run rebalance.
