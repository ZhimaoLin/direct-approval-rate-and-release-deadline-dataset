DESCRIPTION

MB-11629: Remove decrement_session_ctr logic in disconnection

CompactVB and DeleteVB tasks complete before shutdown, and
notify memcached upon completion, resulting in memcached
threads visiting the engine interface to decrement session
counter, therefore we need not handle the decrementing while
handling disconnection.
