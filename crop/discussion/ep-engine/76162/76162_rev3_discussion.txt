DESCRIPTION

MB-23637: Extra logging for dcp-vbtakeover stat & refactor stream type

The dcp-vbtakeover stat is critical to the success of rebalance.
Therefore it is useful for debugging future rebalance failures to log
the unexpected and error paths in the functions used to collect and
return the dcp-vbtakeover stats.

The debug logging wants to print the stream type.  Therefore the stream
type has been refactored into a enum class and a to_string method
provided to print a textual representation of the type.
