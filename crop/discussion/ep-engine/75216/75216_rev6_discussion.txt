DESCRIPTION

Change StoredValue::toItem to return via unique_ptr<>

To prevent memory leaks of Items created by StoredValue::toItem(),
change from returning a raw pointer to unique_ptr<Item>. Update the
callers of toItem() as appropriate.

Note I've curtailed the propogation of the Item* -> unique_ptr<Item>
change to the first "non-intrusive" point, otherwise the scope of this
patch would be significantly larger, however ideally we should
continue the propogation to make all owners of Item objects use owning
pointers.

Line:66, src/backfill.cc -> nit: This name, later in the code, could imply an iterator rather than an item. "itm" would be consistent with other occurrences

Line:66, src/backfill.cc -> Fair comment, although that variable name was already present - and we do use `it` already in a few places.
