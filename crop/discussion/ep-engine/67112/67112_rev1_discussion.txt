DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Fix incorrect waketime for executor threads

When a thread is done with a task from a particular queue,
it calls doneWork() which was setting its current Queue type
to NONE. This was causing the subsequent reschedule to not
pick the earliest waketime and end up sleeping longer than
necessary. In rare occasions, this can even lead to starvation.
Simplify the reschedule logic as part of this fix.
