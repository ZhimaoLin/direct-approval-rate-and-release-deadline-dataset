DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Fix incorrect waketime for executor threads

When a thread is done with a task from a particular queue,
it calls doneWork() which was setting its current Queue type
to NONE. This was causing the subsequent reschedule to not
pick the earliest waketime and end up sleeping longer than
necessary. In rare occasions, this can even lead to starvation.
Simplify the reschedule logic as part of this fix.
+Add unit test for validation.

This needs a new MB, not linking to a closed one as this issue clearly affects previous releases and needs tracking properly.

Line:644, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Wrong MB

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The rare conditions appear to be when the task queue has 0 ready tasks and reschedule occurred (i.e. ExecutorPool::trySleep finds numReadyTasks == 0)?

Is that correct? if so can the commit message (or new MB) include the conditions.

You can also update the test to demonstrate that the huge sleep will occur by ensuring the test operates under these conditions and then the fix is definitely validated.

Yes, this is correct. I will reflect it in the new MB ticket and also in commit message.
 > You can also update the test to demonstrate that the huge sleep will occur by ensuring the test operates under these conditions and then the fix is definitely validated.
The simple unit test added does this right? Just one task ensures that when it is rescheduled, readyQueue would be empty, satisfying numReadyTasks == 0. A huge sleep time would be tricky because currently sleep is bounded by MIN_SLEEP_TIME (2 seconds) anyway. Please correct me if I misunderstood. thanks

Line:644, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Sure will create a new tracking MB ticket. thanks
