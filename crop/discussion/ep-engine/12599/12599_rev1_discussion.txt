DESCRIPTION

Refactored soft delete functions in stored value

This commit rolls delete and delete with meta into a single function
in order to get rid of duplicate code. Soft delete also now takes
a StoredValue parameter instead of a string. This will make it so
that we only have to do one hash table look up instead of two.
