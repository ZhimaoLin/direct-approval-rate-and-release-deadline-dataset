DESCRIPTION

hash_table_test: reduce HashTable locks

The default number of HashTable locks (193) causes problems for
ThreadSanitizer as it exceeds the maximum number of acquired locks it
can track. Given that the tests where we do not already set the lock
count are single-threaded, change these to have 1 lock.
