Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:52, src/mutation_log.cc -> Note that couch-kvstore.cc has very similar code (getSystemStrError), please refactor both of these into a single function.

Line:653, src/mutation_log.cc -> Do we need to expose (i.e. return) the writeFully error back up to the caller of flush()?

Line:52, src/mutation_log.cc -> Done

Line:653, src/mutation_log.cc -> I have modified to ensure that flush() will return an error in case of failure. Also, it will disable the log, for now. I am sure, we can do something better. There are lots of places in the mutation log where error handling can be improved. I would rather reserve those changes for spock as opposed to making too many invasive changes for 4.1.2.
