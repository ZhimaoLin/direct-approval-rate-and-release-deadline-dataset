DESCRIPTION

OrderedStoredValue[3/N]: Derive classes from HT that have different SV factories

Current HashTable contains elements of type 'StoredValue' populated from
'StoredValueFactory'. For ephemeral buckets we need linked storedValues which
are of type 'OrderedStoredValue'. Hence we need different types of HT elements
to be createad on the fly.

Hence, we make HashTable abstract and derive 2 subclasses from it.
'ChainedHashTable' which populates HT with 'StoredValue' and
'OrderedChainedHashTable' which populates HT with 'OrderedStoredValue'.

For now only 'ChainedHashTable' is created. In subsequent commits, we will
create 'OrderedChainedHashTable' as well.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I don't think the two subclasses are necessary (for the storedValue factories at least) - we can just have a single HashTable and use dependancy injection to specify the factory an instance should use.

I'll upload a variant of this soon.
