Line:5153, src/ep_engine.cc -> Strictly speaking the datatype should represent the type of the response payload - which in this case *is* raw bytes (it's a packed representation of the metadata).

If we change the meaning of it to encode the datatype of the underlying document we're actually changing the binary protocol and could break clients (which always expect raw bytes).

I think we need to change this so it /only/ uses the underlying Documents' datatype if the client has somehow explicitly requested it. Given we have the HELLO:XATTR flag, we can use that as the exploit request. 

(As an aside - in an ideal world when we first added HELLO:DATATYPE we should have used that as the indicator that GET_META should return the datatype of the underlying document - but unfortunately that ship has sailed and that also would be a breaking protocol change).

Line:1933, src/vbucket.cc -> I don't think the API / semantics of this function / code are very clear - datatype is only returned if the current cookie has XATTRs enabled. That's a very implicit API.

I suggest instead one of two options:

a) Always return the datatype from this function, and then have the caller decide if it's included in the response.

b) Explicitly request datatype by adding a new in parameter which asks for it - fetch_datatype or similar.

Note the downside of (a) is that we pay the cost of having to go to disk if the value has been ejected irrespective of if the caller actually needs it, which makes me want to lean towards (b).

Line:1950, src/vbucket.cc -> I think this would be clearer if you combined it in the check at line 1937 - i.e. that gives us just one place where we determine if we need to perform a bgFetch or not, and reduces code duplication.
