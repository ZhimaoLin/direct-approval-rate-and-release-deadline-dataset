DESCRIPTION

Remove LockHolder implementation

Replaces LockHolder with an alias to std::lock_guard. Replaces
instantiations of LockHolder which require `unlock` or ability
to move the lock with std::unique_lock and refactors some uses
so they can use a regular std::lock_guard.

Line:109, src/locks.h -> I think this is worth keeping, given the bugs we hit previously (creating a lock without a variable attached) - I think we still need that when using std::lock_guard?

Line:109, src/locks.h -> std::lock_guard abuses the `explicit` constructor flag to prevent it

Line:109, src/locks.h -> ```
#include <mutex>

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	    std::mutex m;
	    std::lock_guard<std::mutex>(m);
	    return 0;
    }
```

Results in:

```

Line:233, src/configuration.cc -> Apparently this has always been broken and we've been checking ssize_t variables through the size_t change listener. I'll revert this 'fix' in this patch and look at fixing it properly in a separate patch since it breaks stuff elsewhere
