DESCRIPTION

This doesn't work for last write wins conflict resolution as the CAS
needs to be generated using HLC.

Line:2854, src/ep.cc -> Should you check for a scenario where 'v' wasn't found here? If not, we can remove all the checks for v around here, like in line 2847 (above), line 2856 (below), line 2862 (below).
