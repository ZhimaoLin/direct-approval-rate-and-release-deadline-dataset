DESCRIPTION

MB-17666: Generate CAS using HLC for deletes

We currently only increment the CAS value for a deleted or expired item.
This doesn't work for last write wins conflict resolution as the CAS
needs to be generated using HLC.

Line:627, src/ep.cc -> I was trying to see if we can set a new cas using high resolution clock inside hashtable's unlocked_softDelete, so that we don't need to call this separately. However, it seems to me that it requires more code refactoring. Given that the Watson code freeze is tomorrow, let's get this merged and refactor it later.
