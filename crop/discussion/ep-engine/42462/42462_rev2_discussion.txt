DESCRIPTION

Add unit test for memory tracking

Memory tracking (by linking with tcmalloc/jemalloc) is enabled in
production for accurate accounting of per-bucket memory usage, and so
it should be enabled as part of unit tests if we are to have
representative memory usage numbers. Add a test to this effect.
