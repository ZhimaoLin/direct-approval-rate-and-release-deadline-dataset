Sriram,

I saw the failure in the following test in thread sanitizer:

Memory tracker not enabled .../home/Piper Jefferson/jenkins/workspace/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite.cc:14021 Test failed: `Adjusted time is supposed to negative' (adjusted_time < 0)
Running [0339/0343]: test hlc cas (couchstore)...(0 sec) CORE DUMPED

It doesn't seem the failure was caused by this change, but can you check it again?

Chiyoung, I've seen this failure before and it seems to be happening on the thread sanitizer CV. This is definitely unrelated to this change. I'm adding some debugging messages to figure out whats happening.

Also there is another potential data race that was uncovered with the previous run in forestkvstore/forestdb which I copied in an email to you and Ellie Kidd.
