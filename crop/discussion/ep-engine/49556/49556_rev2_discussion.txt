Can you also take a look at why the build failed?

Line:12009, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Seems like key spaces are not overlapped between two threads. Is this the same as the test case from Eric?

There was a windows compilation warning, which is unrelated to this change, I'll push in a separate change for that.

Line:12009, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Yes, the key spaces dont overlap in eric's test as well. I just confirmed that.
