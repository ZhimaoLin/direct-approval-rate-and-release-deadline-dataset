DESCRIPTION

Consider memory usage in throttling TAP stream by disk queue cap.

From various use cases, it turns out that throttling TAP stream
by disk queue cap only causes too many unnecessary negative ack
messages to be sent to the TAP producer even if TAP consumer has
enough memory. Therefore, this changes adapts the tap throttle
logic so that the tap stream can be throttled if any of the
following conditions is met:

1) Current memory usage is above the threshold that is 90% of the
bucket quota by default.
2) Current memory usage is above the high water mark (75% of the
bucket quota by default) and the disk write queue size is greater
than the write queue cap threshold (1M by default).

Note that the above thresholds are all configurable at runtime.
