DESCRIPTION

Checkpoints contain items with keys and meta data only by default

Previously, items in checkpoints referred to Blob value instances.
This default behavior caused much more memory overhead in case
persistence or replication cursor is very slow on checkpoints.
This patch changes the default behavior so that checkpoints have
items with keys and meta data only. When a checkpoint item is
persisted into disk or replicated to the slave via TAP,
its latest value is fetched from memory hash table.

This new behavior does not break any replication or persistence
consistency. However, if the strict consistency is required in
item's values across checkpoints, a new engine parameter
'chk_meta_items_only' should be set to false at startup or
runtime.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I think I understand the changes here. The strict consistency is lost because you are not keeping the value in the queued item by default. This would mean that if a key was in two checkpoints then if we grabbed the value from the first checkpoint it will return the value from the second write (second checkpoint). Therefore we lose some consistency, but lower the memory overhead. This consistency in most cases also won't be important.

I do have some questions though on two of the other changes so let's that discuss tomorrow.
