DESCRIPTION

MB-22524: Add XATTRs for DCP Deletion (and expiration)

According to the spec we should send XATTRs as part of of the
deletion messages over DCP. In order to do so we need to send
the item as part of the message producer the same way we
do for a normal mutation.

The same change applies to expiration messages (currently not
used)
