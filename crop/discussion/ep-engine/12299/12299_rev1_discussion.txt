DESCRIPTION

MB-3424: Tap sends only keys when keys only flag is specified

This fix allows tap streams to send keys only. Note that this
solves the problem, but not in an elegant ways. Sending keys
only should not require us to do backfill when in DGM, but
we do backfill anyways.

The reason for this is that we support changing tap streams
mid-stream. This means a user could ask for keys only and then
later request values be sent on that same stream in the middle
of the process. As a result we may need to access the values that
are on disk at any time.

In the future tap should be more dynamic to allow this to perform
better. This future improvement is filed under  MB-4556.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Mike, as we discussed, when you have time later, please adapt the backfill module so that a disk backfill won't be scheduled for "keys_only" flag.
