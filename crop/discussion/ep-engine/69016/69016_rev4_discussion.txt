DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [7/N]: CheckpointManager::queueDirty: Pass vb by reference

The VBucket argument to queueDirty is passed via a (reference to) a
ref-counted pointer. Nothing in this function modifies the arguments'
ref count, or passes it another owner; moreover it is also never null.

Therefore change to pass as a reference.
