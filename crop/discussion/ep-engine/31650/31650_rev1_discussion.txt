Add a test api to get 64 bit stat numbers

Not being able to get these numbers can cause crashes in
the testsuite since the values can be truncated.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

I messed up when I push the upr changes earlier and didn't test on linux. It turns out that since we had 64bit numbers to get from stats that the get_int_stat function was truncating the values and causing issues. This change just adds a get_ull_stat function and corrects the test cases. I'm self pushing since it only touches test code and I don't want others to get confused. I verified this on centos, ubuntu, and os x.
