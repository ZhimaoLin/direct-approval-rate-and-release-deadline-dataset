DESCRIPTION

MB-16915: Use refcounted pointers on producer/consumer

Prevents a race/crash occuring when the DcpProducer is destroyed
and there are backfill tasks running/pending.

The test case reveals the probem when run under valgrind as
a series of invalid reads of freed memory. E.g.

==40673== Invalid read of size 8

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

(6 comments)

Functionality looks good, but a few minor comments.

Line:8432, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we see this with fewer streams? Just thinking about making this as simple and quick as possible - the commit-validation VMs are notably slower than my desktop :(

Line:8443, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Style: I generally just use std::to_string() with string concatenation - normally more concise than std::stringstream.

Line:8449, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Ditto

Line:8463, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Nit: prefer strlen("connection_buffer_size") to a magic number.

Line:8470, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Nit: Long line.

Line:35, src/dcp-stream.h -> Nit: I find it a bit hard to parse "dcpproducer" when run together - what do you think to renaming to "dcp_producer_t" ?

(and I guess renaming dcp_consumer_t for consistency)

will post an updare soon, just need to rerun test suite to see if a lower number of streams hits the problem.

Line:8432, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> No luck in shrinking the test, maybe for master need a more clever way of doing this? Someway of having the backfill tasks run slowly, difficult though with out some other mocking.
