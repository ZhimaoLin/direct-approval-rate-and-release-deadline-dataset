This comment worries me. I'd assumed (I guess incorrectly :( ) that the existing ep_testsuite type tests would cover most of the basic queueDirty functionality. It sounds like this isn't the case.

Looking at the nightly coverage testing (http://cv.jenkins.Piper Jefferson.com/view/Nightly/job/memcached-nightly-coverage/312/cobertura/ep_engine_src/kv_bucket_cc/#2293) we /do/ have code which executes those lines, but I assume the test isn't validating the resulting CAS.

Could you take a look at the existing delete_with_meta tests and see if we can fix this omission - I expect it should be a simple case of (a) ensuring there's a variant which specifies a CAS and (b) we verify the CAS is set correctly.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please give a more descriptive commit subject here - from scanning the subjects of commits this gives no clue about the change (area of the code, type of bug, etc).

Something like:

"KVBucket::deleteWithMeta: Pass correct generateCas to queueDirty"

for example
