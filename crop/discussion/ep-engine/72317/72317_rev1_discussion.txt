Presumably there wasn't a test defending this functionality. Would it be particularly troublesome to introduce one?

I thought about writing a test case but there are no test cases for everything that is being refactored as part of ephemeral buckets. Do not want to digress from the task.
We can note it down to add test case in the future

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

It really could be argued you shouldn't be doing *any* kind of refactoring without tests defending the functionality you're refactoring.
