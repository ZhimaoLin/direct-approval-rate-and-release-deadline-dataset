DESCRIPTION

Changed the way stats observe returns results

We now surround individual values in brackets. We do this to
keep the protocol consistent with the current stats command.

For example:

--> stats observe watchset1
<-- key1 12 0 replicated,persisted

becomes

--> stats observe watchset1
<-- [key1][12] [0][replicated][persisted]

Patch Set 1:

slashes or commas would have saved a couple of chars and would have been easier for some client languages to parse, using a simple string.split().

Patch Set 1:

The brackets look cleaner to me and commas or slashes aren't easier since a key can contain multiple commas or slashes.

Patch Set 1:

parsing comma-separated (or slash separated) is easier.

Patch Set 1:

ack, hit the wrong button too soon.

if where were embedded commas, for example, you'd still do something like...

   actual_key = key.split(',')[0:-2]
   cas = key.split(',')[-1]
