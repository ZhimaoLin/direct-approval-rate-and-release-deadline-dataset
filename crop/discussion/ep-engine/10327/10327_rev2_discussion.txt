DESCRIPTION

Changed the way stats observe returns results

We now comma seperate all values in order to keep the
protocol consistent with the current stats command.

For example:

--> stats observe watchset1
<-- key1 12 0 replicated,persisted

becomes

--> stats observe watchset1
<-- key1,12 0,replicated,persisted
