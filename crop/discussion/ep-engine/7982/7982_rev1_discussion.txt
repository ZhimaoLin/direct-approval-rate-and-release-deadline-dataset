DESCRIPTION

Memcached will always send error messages for tap notifications

Initially tap streams wouldn't send anything back, and we added
the nack mode to be backwards compatible. The old mode should not
appear in the upstream memcached (because it's a new interface
there), so it should not be present in our code as well.
The bucket migrators supports getting errors, so this change
should work for our product.
