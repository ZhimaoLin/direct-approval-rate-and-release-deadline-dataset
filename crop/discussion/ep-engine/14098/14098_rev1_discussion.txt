DESCRIPTION

Don't reset bg-fetch related stats in registering TAP cursors.

If a tap cursor already exists for a given vbucket, bg-fetch
related stats in the cursor's checkpoint state should not be
reset because checkpoint synchronization requires those stats
due to item eviction in the open checkpoint.

Note that there are no logic changes in the cursor registration.
