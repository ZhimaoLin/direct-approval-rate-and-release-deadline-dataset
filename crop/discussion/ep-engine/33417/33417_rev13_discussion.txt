Line:4129, src/ep_engine.cc -> This will cause a seg fault because we erase the map element pointed by "it" above. Can you also simply remove an element if it exists in the map? I don't think we need to check the result code here.

Line:5324, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please check the existence of a vbucket from vbucket_map and whether it is active or not. Then return ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET appropriately.

Line:5340, src/ep_engine.cc -> We don't need to allocate the memory for this. If keylen is zero, please return ENGINE_EINVAL. Otherwise, you can simply create a string instance  as follows:

char *keyptr = request->bytes + sizeof(request->bytes) + extlen;

std::string start_key(keyptr, keylen);

Line:5357, src/ep_engine.cc -> We don't need to define this function separately. Please move this function's logic to FetchAllKeysTask::run()

Line:5363, src/ep_engine.cc -> Where do we free this object?

Line:329, src/kvstore.h -> Please change ptr to shared_ptr<...> cb.

Line:397, src/kvstore.h -> getAllKeysPtr

Line:398, src/kvstore.h -> getAllKeysLen

Line:405, src/kvstore.h -> Why do we need this struct? Can you simply declare them as member variables separately?

Line:2267, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> As I mentioned, we can use the temporary buffer like vector or linkedlist to store all the keys temporarily.

Line:2276, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> std::string &start_key

Line:2297, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please log the failed errCode as well.

Line:114, src/kvstore.cc -> sizeof(uint16_t) instead of "2"

Line:115, src/kvstore.cc -> Same as above.

Line:119, src/kvstore.cc -> I don't think we need this function. This function is too costly as it does unnecessary memory copy and allocations. You can store all the keys in a temporary buffer (like vector or linkedlist), and then traverse it in a forward or backward through the iterator.

Line:847, src/ep_engine.h -> please use unordered_map for a faster lookup.

Line:4129, src/ep_engine.cc -> By not erasing if it->second is ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK, i wouldn't need to add an entry another time in getAllKeys (ep_engine:5321) for ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK until it changes to ENGINE_SUCCESS.

Line:329, src/kvstore.h -> Will make it as AllKeysCB*, instead of shared_ptr, as I am not inheriting Callback in AllKeysCB's class declaration.

Line:405, src/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:4129, src/ep_engine.cc -> EWOULDBLOCK means that the socket is blocked (i.e., client is blocked) until the background operation is completed. We don't need to worry about that case.
