Patch Set 18:

I made some changes and fixed some bugs.

Abhinav, Mike,

I heard that the ns-server team wants us to support an ascending or descending order feature. Is it still true?

Patch Set 18:

As per Aaron's comment, I don't think we'll need the Sorting options either, I could remove it.

Patch Set 18:

I'll have to double check. I just saw a comment from Aaron mentioning that couchstore doesn't support it and he mentioned that the change is not easy to do.

Okay, let's review the latest patch and get it merged if it looks good.

Abhinav,

Did you share your design doc with the ns-server team?

Looks like ns_server, wants the sorting for now. I did put the link to the design document on the ticket, let me share it again in an email anyway.

>> Couchstore currently does not (and will not without significant changes) have the ability to wNathalie Landry in descending order.

ns_server can drop support for descending option on UI then. Don't think it's a big deal.

Patch Set 18:

Alternatively ns_server (or ep-engine) can implement descending by bisecting range of keys from "" to <given-key> and finding key that's N keys before given. But IMHO we can just drop descending requirement.

Okay, then let's drop the descending order support. We will adapt this change based on it.
