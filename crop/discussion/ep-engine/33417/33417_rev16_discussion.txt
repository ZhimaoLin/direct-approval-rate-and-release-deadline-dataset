Line:5355, src/ep_engine.cc -> This log message needs to be more descriptive. Something like "All key request failed because because keylen is 0". Also, don't use <= 0. uint16_t is unsigned so it will never be less than 0.

Line:376, src/kvstore.h -> Is there a specific reason why we need to have this class to maintain all of the keys we read? It seems like this would be much simpler to just use std::string. All we're doing it buffering data. If we really don't want to use the string class then it seems like we should implement a generic buffer class that can resize itself if it needs more space.

Line:232, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think we should remove the sorting feature. I don't think ns_server needs it and we cannot support it anyways.
