Stuck with the allKeysLookups implementation for now, as i'm using the second entry for saving the ENGINE_ERROR status.

Patch Set 10:

Couchstore currently does not (and will not without significant changes) have the ability to wNathalie Landry in descending order.

This code will, as written, if I ask for the first N keys from a key in descending order.. return me the same *set* of keys I would get in ascending order, just flipped around.

Usually a descending option would mean that I'd get the key I passed and N keys descending from it (this is what you get with views, *and* with the current _all_docs endpoint).

In this case the option should probably just be removed, since it can't be supported in the same way.
