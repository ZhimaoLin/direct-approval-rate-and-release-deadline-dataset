DESCRIPTION

Warmup should be executed by the read-only KVStore instance.

As we plan to execute the warmup through a separate thread, it
makes sense to use the read-only KVStore instance. Note that using
the same read-only KVStore by two threads (warmup thread and
read-only dispatcher) works fine as long as they don't use the
same PreparedStatement instance at the same time.
