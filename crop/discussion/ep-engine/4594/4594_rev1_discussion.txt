DESCRIPTION

Allow response messages containing null bytes

We're currently calling strlen() to determine the length of the body
for the response message of the ep-engine custom commands (handled by
the function  EvpUnknownCommand). For the upcoming SYNC command, there's
a need to include null bytes inside the the response message body, so
strlen() truncates the message.

The following change allows each custom command function to explicitly set
the message body size. If not set, it fallbacks to a call to strlen() to
determine the message size.
