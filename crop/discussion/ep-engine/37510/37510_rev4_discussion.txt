DESCRIPTION

MB-11193: use right shard-level kvstore in wamrup

General use of getAuxUnderlying() ends up causing all the warmup
threads to share the same CouchKVStore instance. This can result
in corruption of shared datastructures like dbFileRevMap.
Use the appropriate shard level KVStore instance for separation.
