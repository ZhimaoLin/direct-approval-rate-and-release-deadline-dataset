DESCRIPTION

MB-8259 Maintain a disk queue size stat per shard.

Multiple checkpoints on a replica vbucket can be collapsed into
a single checkpoint to reduce the memory overhead. We should
reflect the checkpoint collapsing impact on the disk queue size
stat. To address this issue, this change maintains a disk queue
size stat per shard and reset it to the size of backlogs in
checkpoint persistence cursors on that shard before the shard
flusher visits all of its vbuckets that belong to that shard.
