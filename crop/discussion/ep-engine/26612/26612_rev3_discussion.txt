DESCRIPTION

MB-8259 Maintain a disk queue size stat per shard.

Multiple checkpoints on a replica vbucket can be collapsed into
a single checkpoint to reduce the memory overhead. We should
reflect the checkpoint collapsing impact on the disk queue size
stat. To address this issue, this change maintains a disk queue
size stat per shard and reset it to zero if there are no dirty
items in the vbuckets that belong to a given shard.
