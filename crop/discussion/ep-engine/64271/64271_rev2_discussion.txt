DESCRIPTION

Skip test_mb19635_upgrade_from_25x for forestdb as backend

This is a couchstore-specific test that tests whether vbuckets warmed up
from 2.x couchfile results in different UUIDs. This doesn't apply
to forestdb as backend as 2.x doesn't use forestdb as backend

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:5802, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Just use get_str_stat() - that doesn't need to record all of the different stats in the group, and will give an explicit error if the "ep_backend" stat is missing.
