DESCRIPTION

MB-5297 Send INITIAL_VBUCKET_STREAM message for new vbuckets only

As TapProducer::scheduleBackfill() can be invoked multiple times
from different threads before the backfill is actually scheduled,
it should send INITIAL_VBUCKET_STREAM messages to the destination
for new backfill vbuckets only.
