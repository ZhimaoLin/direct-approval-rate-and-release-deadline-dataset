DESCRIPTION

Modified split backup after merge to be optional with -s parameter.

The -s flag can be used -m split_size parameter to enable splitting
of backup into smaller backup chunks of size split_size.
Split of backup files is disabled by default.
If we specify one single input file with -s flag, it will use input
file as source and perform split alone rather than creating a new
merged file and splitting that file after that.

Line:26, management/mbbackup-merge-incremental -> If we want to make "split" as optional, it would be better to have a single argument "-s" with the max size. For example,

1) ./mbbackup-merge-incremental -s -v incremental_backup_files...
--> If we don't pass the max db file size, it will create a split db file with 512MB max size (default).

2) ./mbbackup-merge-incremental -s 1024 -v incremental_backup_files...
--> This will create a split db file with 1GB max size

3) ./mbbackup-merge-incremental -v incremental_backup_files...
--> This wouldn't create any split db files, but simply merge all the backup files into a single file.

Line:201, management/mbbackup-merge-incremental -> Wrong white space indentation.
