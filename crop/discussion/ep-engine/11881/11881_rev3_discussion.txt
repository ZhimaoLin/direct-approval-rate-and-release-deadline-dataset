DESCRIPTION

Modified split backup after merge to be optional with -s parameter.

Added -s split_size option to enable splitting of backup into
smaller backup chunks of size split_size. Split of backup files
is disabled by default. If we specify one single input file with
-s option, it will use input file as source and perform split alone
rather than creating a new merged file and split using that file.

Usage:
./mbbackup-merge-incremental -s -v incremental_backup_files...
with 512MB max size (default).

./mbbackup-merge-incremental -s 1024 -v incremental_backup_files...
This will create a split db file with 1GB max size

./mbbackup-merge-incremental -v incremental_backup_files...
the backup files into a single file.

Patch Set 3:

It seems it is not possible to have -s without argument if i set as s: in getopt(). But if i set as 's' in getopt, it will not take the argument either. This was one reason why -m as used with -s. What could we do now?

Patch Set 3:

getopt will support optional argument only for long options.
Can I restructure my code to use -m -s split_size mode?

Patch Set 3:

Sorry for the confusion. I think it is okay to force -s to have a value that is the max size of a split db file.

In other words, we will have only two options:

./mbbackup-merge-incremental -s 512 -v incremental_backup_files...
--> This will create a split db file with 512MB max size

./mbbackup-merge-incremental -v incremental_backup_files...
--> All backup files are merged into a single file.
