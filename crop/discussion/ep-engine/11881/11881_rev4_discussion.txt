DESCRIPTION

Modified split backup after merge to be optional with -s parameter.

Added -s split_size option to enable splitting of backup into
smaller backup chunks of size split_size. Split of backup files
is disabled by default. If we specify one single input file with
-s option, it will use input file as source and perform split alone
rather than creating a new merged file and split using that file.

Usage:
./mbbackup-merge-incremental -s 1024 -v incremental_backup_files...
This will create a split db file with 1GB max size

./mbbackup-merge-incremental -v incremental_backup_files...
the backup files into a single file.
