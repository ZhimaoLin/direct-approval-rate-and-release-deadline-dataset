DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Merge tapQueueDirty() into queueDirty()

Both the functions have mostly similar behavior. The main difference
is tapQueueDirty() puts the item onto VB queue, queueDirty() puts the item
onto checkpoint. This difference can be handled by passing a flag.

Line:734, src/vbucket.cc -> I'm not a fan of yoda conditions as they're awkward to read and it gets picked up by static analysis (I believe in this case compiler warnings), especially if you're going to make the variable const anyway.

Line:519, src/vbucket.h -> document new parameter
