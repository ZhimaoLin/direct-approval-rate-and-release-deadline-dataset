DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Give all tasks their own stats and priority

MB-18453 identified that tasks have copied & pasted
constructors which leads to some tasks all having the
same Priority object.

The fallout of this is that many tasks now all contribute
to the same histogram for runtime and scheduling waittime.
When debugging issues which lead to MB-18453 it is near
impossible at times to know which real task was delayed
as the stats can be attributed to many tasks.

This commit introduces makes all tasks have their own ID
and thus their own histograms and also makes it easier
for new tasks to be created without forgetting to create
a new Priority instance.

tasks.defs.h is a new file that captures every sub-class
of GlobalTask and shows the priority of all tasks.

TASK macros are now used to generate various switch
statements and enums used in task accounting.

The new system is not strict, MyTask could still be
assigned the priority/id of OldTask, however this
flexibility can be useful in some circumstances.

Note this patch has changed ep_testsuite test_item_pager
to increase the max_size value in the test config. This
is because this patch increases the baseline heap usage
of a bucket as we've increased the number of Histogram
object allocated by EventuallyPersistentStore.

Prior to this patch 28 were allocated, with this patch
51 are allocated (1 per task). Each Histogram<hrtime_t
is approx 1568 bytes (on OSX clang build).

The new max_size is 2.5MiB

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

(5 comments)

Generally looks good, couple of suggestions; nothing blocking.

Line:69, src/tasks.cc -> One alternative would be to add a similar throw outside the switch() - that would guard against someone somehow calling the function with a totally invalid ID.

Line:83, src/tasks.cc -> Ditto

Line:87, src/tasks.cc -> Can be made const.

Line:203, src/warmup.h -> Nit: Given you're reformatting this, would be nice to move the `:` to the start of the line (similary for other cases in this file).

File Comment: tests/module_tests/priority_test.cc -> As per previous comment, would be good to convert these into static_assert()s.
