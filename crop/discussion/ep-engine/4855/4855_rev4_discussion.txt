DESCRIPTION

Set the current CAS for each keyspec in a SYNC response

Currently for the SYNC command, on some cases, for each keyspec in the
response sent to the client, we set the CAS to the same value that the
user specified in the request message (SYNC on persistence) while for
others we set the CAS of the key when the SyncRegistry was notified.
With this patch we get a more consistent behaviour, besides being
eventually more useful to clients.

Line:3325, ep_engine.cc -> For sync on persistence, shouldn't we use the cas value from the client? If so, we should then pass "false" to addSyncKeySpecs.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

See inline comment reply

Line:3325, ep_engine.cc -> It could be. But the spec says nothing about it. I would say that for all SYNC operations, the responses either uses the CAS'es given by the client request or the latest CAS of each key - before this commit, you have a mix, which I think it's confusing.

My point of view (if I were a user/client), is that getting the latest CAS might be more useful - imagine that after the SYNC operation I want to do some operation on one of those keys where I need to specify the CAS of the key. Otherwise having the same CAS in response as in the request, is a bit useless - we could omit the CAS in the response and save a few bytes :)

What do you think?

Filipe, thanks for the clarification. I think that makes sense to me.
