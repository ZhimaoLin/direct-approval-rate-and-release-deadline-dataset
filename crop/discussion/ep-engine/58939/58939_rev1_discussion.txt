DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 4/4 Remove unecessary validation from configuration and consolidate most validation at the validators

* Adds a string to boolean function which will throw an invalid_argument inherited exception
if it cannot be validly converted to boolean. This is used for any string to boolean conversion needed for
setParam and exposes a more detailed error message on the wire.
* Removes any unnecessary validation that will subsequently be performed by the configuration validators
from the set_param level and moves validation that can be trivially be moved to the configuration validators.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(7 comments)

Line:375, src/ep_engine.cc -> Given our discussion on the non-intuitive /ambiguous names for the exceptions thrown by std::stoXXX, suggest you add a brief comment to this block noting that throws this (and maybe also a note that the configuration.setXXX() functions throw  std::exception-derived classes).

Line:20, tests/module_tests/string_utils_test.cc -> You probably don't need this.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Again, this all needs wrapping shorter.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I generally name the function - cb_strtobool() or whatever in the commit message - makes it more useful when searching down the line.

Line:27, src/string_utils.cc -> The black-box description of a function should go before the prototype in C++ (and moved to the header), as it documents the interface.

Line:30, src/string_utils.h -> Not sure you need this `using` statement.

Line:3049, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Did we decide we don't need this change anymore?
