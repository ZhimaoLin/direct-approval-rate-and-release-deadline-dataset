DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 4/4 Consolidate and remove unecessary validation from SET_PARAM

* Adds a string to boolean function `cb_stob`  which will throw an
invalid_argument inherited exception if it cannot be validly converted
to boolean. This is used for any string to boolean conversion needed for
setParam and exposes a more detailed error message on the wire.
* Removes any unnecessary validation that will subsequently be performed
by the configuration validators from the set_param level and moves
validation that can be trivially be moved to the configuration validators.

Line:4440, src/ep_engine.cc -> This now throws an exception - you need to put it inside a try .. catch block. You could probably reuse the one above as I expect you'll be returning the same EINVAL error code.

Line:4440, src/ep_engine.cc -> Didn't mean to include this as part of the patch (bit out of scope), was just part of some testing I was doing.
