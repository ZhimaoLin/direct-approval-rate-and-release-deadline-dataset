DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 4/4 Consolidate and remove unecessary validation from configuration

* Adds a string to boolean function `cb_stob`  which will throw an invalid_argument inherited exception
if it cannot be validly converted to boolean. This is used for any string to boolean conversion needed for
setParam and exposes a more detailed error message on the wire.
* Removes any unnecessary validation that will subsequently be performed by the configuration validators
from the set_param level and moves validation that can be trivially be moved to the configuration validators.

Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:28, src/string_utils.h -> Might be worth documenting what two strings are valid ("true" & "false") - people may otherwise think "0", "1", "True", "False", etc are accepted.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Wider than 80 cols
