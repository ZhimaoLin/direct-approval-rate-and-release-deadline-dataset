DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 4/4 Consolidate and remove unecessary validation from SET_PARAM

* Adds a string to boolean function `cb_stob`  which will throw an
invalid_argument inherited exception if it cannot be validly converted
to boolean. This is used for any string to boolean conversion needed for
setParam and exposes a more detailed error message on the wire.
* Removes any unnecessary validation that will subsequently be performed
by the configuration validators from the set_param level and moves
validation that can be trivially be moved to the configuration validators.
