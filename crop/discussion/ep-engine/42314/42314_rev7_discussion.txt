DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Add the backfill manager

The backfill manager will be used for scheduling backfills on a per
connection basis and in a future commit will be used for managing
the memory of a dcp connections backfills. The backfill manager will
keep track of all of the active backfills for a given connection and
will run them in a round robin fashion. This will ensure that all
backfills for a given connection are treated equally.

Line:25, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Please avoid using macro to define the constant. This can be addressed in a separate commit later.

Line:52, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Please use the above constant variable for snooze time.

Line:126, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> This will cause the thread to be stuck because of calling lock twice (one in switch and the other here).
