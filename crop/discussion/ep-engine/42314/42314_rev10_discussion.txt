DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Add the backfill manager

The backfill manager will be used for scheduling backfills on a per
connection basis and in a future commit will be used for managing
the memory of a dcp connections backfills. The backfill manager will
keep track of all of the active backfills for a given connection and
will run them in a round robin fashion. This will ensure that all
backfills for a given connection are treated equally.
