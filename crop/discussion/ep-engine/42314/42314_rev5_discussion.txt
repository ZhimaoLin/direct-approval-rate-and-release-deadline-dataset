DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Add the backfill manager

The backfill manager will be used for scheduling backfills on a per
connection basis and in a future commit will be used for managing
the memory of a dcp connections backfills. The backfill manager will
keep track of all of the active backfills for a given connection and
will run them in a round robin fashion. This will ensure that all
backfills for a given connection are treated equally.

Line:53, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> You need to check if the engine is now being shutdown or not. If it is, then it should return false.

Line:81, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I think we need to wake up the backfill manager task if it is in snooze state.

Line:85, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Why not using BackfillTaskPriority?

Line:104, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Shouldn't we grab the lock before pushing it again?

Line:110, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Same as above comment.
