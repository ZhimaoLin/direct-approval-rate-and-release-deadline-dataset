Line:63, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> nit: These should probably be asserts as the test should not continue if they fail

Line:124, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> This this might be expressed more cleanly using GoogleMock matchers. e.g.

```
EXPECT_THAT(vals, UnorderedElementsAre(Key(high_seqno), Key(last_persisted_seqno), Key(abs_high_seqno) .. ));
```

https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/CheatSheet.md#matchers

You can probably also use the 'Pair' matchers to also simultaneously perform the 0-check from further down

```
EXPECT_THAT(vals, UnorderedElementsAre(Pair(high_seqno, "0"), Pair(last_persisted_seqno, "0"), Pair(abs_high_seqno, "0"), Key(uuid) ));
```
