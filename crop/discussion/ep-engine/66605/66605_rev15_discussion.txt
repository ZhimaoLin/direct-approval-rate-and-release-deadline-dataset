Patch Set 15: Code-Review+2

For future reference, probably easier to split the patch into two - first half which refactors the evp_store code to make it available to other classes, and a second which adds the new tests.

Patch Set 15:

While the data-driven change is an improvement, I would still like to re-emphasise my earlier comment that the entire test could be expressed very simply through the use of GoogleMock. I have made the effort of reproducing the test in those terms:

https://github.com/Chippiewill/ep-engine/commit/ef2f3985adb500d917a01bc0cc0b2a464acafc29

The GoogleMock matchers are *very* convenient for performing checking of containers.
