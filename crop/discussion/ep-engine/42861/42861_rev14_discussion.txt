DESCRIPTION

MB-12540: Refactor the way we track snapshot start/end seqnos

For the 3.0 release I needed to add snapshot sequence number
quickly and in doing so implemented an approach that was not
very good and prone to errors. The correct approach is to track
sequence numbers on disk and also to track them for each checkpoint
in the checkpoint manager. This change moves us to the better
approach.

Line:468, src/checkpoint.h -> This is okay, but I think it would be better to declare this function to return the snapshot_range like

snapshot_range getAllItemsForCursor(name, items);

Line:540, src/checkpoint.h -> snapshot_info getSnapshotInfo(void);

Let's avoid passing the reference parameter to get snapshot info. I know I also used to use it in some places, but think we should avoid it for a better readability.

Line:1132, src/checkpoint.cc -> Does that mean that a replica vbucket receives the full snapshot from its active vbucket? If so, then I think we can still figure out this case by comparing info.start with info.range.end in a caller side. It might cause some confusions if we return the same values for those three variables.
