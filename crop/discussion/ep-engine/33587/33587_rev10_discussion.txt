Line:2009, src/ep_engine.cc -> Grabbing this value from the config requires a lock. We should use maxItemSize.

Line:789, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think we should add a few more tests. For example, append compressed to compressed, and append normal to compressed. That way we actually hit each case in the append function.

Line:824, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Same with prepend.
