Line:63, src/item.cc -> is it "i.getValue()->vlength()"?

Line:81, src/item.cc -> Before appending the value, please check the new value size and return false if it exceeds 20MB instead of assertion. Also, you can get the max item size from the engine instance.

Line:110, src/item.cc -> Same as above

Line:156, src/item.cc -> same as above.

Line:169, src/item.cc -> Same as above.

Both the append and prepend functions look very similar. Is there a way we can move most of the code into a single function. For example, when append/prepend are called we would have a function called getUncompressed() which would give us both uncompressed blobs. Then based on whether it's an append or prepend we figure out how to do the copy. Then after the copy you can compress agin if necessary.

Line:306, src/ep_engine.h -> I personally don't like adding "Error" or "Warning" or things like that to log messages. We already have the log level recorded and this is an indication of the message level. Adding this extra text just adds extra bytes to the logs. I'm not sure how others feel about this though.

Line:39, src/item.cc -> All of these comparisons are really confusing. It's not apparent what your comparing without looking at the enum. Can we have some sort of isCompressed() function that checks to see if the value is one of the corresponding enums? Another reason this will be helpful is that it's possible we might add more values to the enum. If we do that then all of this code might have to be changed.

Line:39, src/item.cc -> I will move some common code into functions that can be accessed by both operations.

Line:63, src/item.cc -> Yes it should be.

Line:81, src/item.cc -> Done
