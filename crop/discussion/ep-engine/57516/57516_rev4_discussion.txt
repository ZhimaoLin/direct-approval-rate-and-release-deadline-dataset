DESCRIPTION

MB-16684: DCP Producer could miss fetching items from a stream

Here's the scenario:
- Stream currently in backfill phase
- When backfill is received, 1 item added to readyQ
    - itemsReady of stream set to true (Producer notified)
- Front end op comes in
    - item added to checkpoint queue
    - itemsReady not set to true, as it already is (Producer not
      notified)
- Producer calls stream::next()
    - stream in backfillPhase(): 1 item popped from readyQ
    - backfill task still running => no state transition to IN_MEMORY
    - 1 op returned to producer, producer re-adds vbucket to ready list
- Backfill completes
- Producer calls stream::next()
    - stream in backfillPhase(): no items in readyQ
    - As backfill task has completed, state transitions to IN_MEMORY
    - no items in readyQ => NULL returned
    - As no op obtained, producer doesn't re-add vbucket to ready list

=> Front end item remains stuck in checkpoint queue, until more front
end ops come in - which would notify the producer
