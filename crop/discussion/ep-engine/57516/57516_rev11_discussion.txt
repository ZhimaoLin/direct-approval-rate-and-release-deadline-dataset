DESCRIPTION

MB-16684: DCP Producer could miss fetching items from a stream

Here's the scenario:
1. Stream currently in backfill phase
2. When backfill is received, 1 item added to readyQ
    a. itemsReady of stream set to true (Producer notified)
3. Front end op comes in
    a. item added to checkpoint queue
    b. itemsReady not set to true, as it already is (Producer not
      notified)
4. Producer calls stream::next()
    a. stream in backfillPhase(): 1 item popped from readyQ
    b. backfill task still running => no state transition to IN_MEMORY
    c. 1 op returned to producer, producer re-adds vbucket to ready list
5. Backfill completes
6. Producer calls stream::next()
    a. stream in backfillPhase(): no items in readyQ
    b. As backfill task has completed, state transitions to IN_MEMORY
    c. no items in readyQ => NULL returned
    d. As no op obtained, producer doesn't re-add vbucket to ready list

=> Front end item remains stuck in checkpoint queue, until more front
end ops come in - which would notify the producer

The proposed fix here is: In step 6b, when the producer sees the
backfill task has completed, and the state for the stream transitions
to IN_MEMORY, move checkpoint items into readyQ. This way the readyQ
will not be empty, and the producer would re-add the vbucket back into
the ready list.

Line:878, src/dcp/stream.cc -> For future reference: If you remove the `default` case (and instead move the throw after the switch statement) then the compiler will warn you if a new enumeration value is added to stream_state_t which isn't handled in the switch.

Line:878, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Will remember that, in this case however the throw statement will be invoked for state STREAM_READING.

Line:878, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Then why not add that case explicitly and throw? - That way the reader doesn't have to consult the set of enums for this type and compare with the switch statement to understand the behaviour ;)

Line:878, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Then, let's add it explicitly. I don't understand how this is kind of critical issues. I don't see any big problems in this code. If we see anything for improvements, then let's make a change.
