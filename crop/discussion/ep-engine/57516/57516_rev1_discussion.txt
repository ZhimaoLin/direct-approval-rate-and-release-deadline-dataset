DESCRIPTION

MB-16684: DCP Producer could miss fetching items from a stream

Here's the scenario:
- Stream in backfill phase
- Backfill is received, 1 item added to readyQ
    - itemsReady of stream set to true
- Front end op comes in
    - item added to checkpoint queue
    - during notification, itemsReady not set to true, as it already is
- Producer calls stream::next()
    - backfillPhase(): 1 item popped from readyQ
    - backfill task still running, no state transition to IN_MEMORY
    - 1 op returned to producer, producer re-adds vbucket to ready list
- Backfill completes
- Producer calls stream::next()
    - backfillPhase(): no items in readyQ
    - backfill task completed, state transition to IN_MEMORY
    - no items in readyQ, so NULL returned
    - Producer doesn't add vbucket to ready list

=> Front end item remains stuck in checkpoint queue, until more front
end ops come in
