DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: Update stream stats 'backfillRemaining' in memory backfills

'backfillRemaining' is a stat in DCP stream and can be used to track the
progress of a backfill. This has more significance in a disk backfill,
that is, how many items are yet to be read of the disk. In in-memory
backfill as well it is good to maintain this stat.

In in-memory backfills, we must increment it before reading the items to
the stream and decrement it as we read items one by one.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Can you add a unit test for this please? (Or maybe there's an existing DCP one which we just need to re-enable for Ephemeral)?
