DESCRIPTION

MB-13286: New DcpProducer to have paused status set to true

DcpOpen will create a new DcpProducer and if one with a
similar name already exists (e.g - during rebalance),
this new producer will replace the older one, and the
paused status will need to be set to true, to let the
notification for the new connection to be sent to
memcached.
