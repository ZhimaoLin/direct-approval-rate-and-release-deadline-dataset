DESCRIPTION

MB-13286: New DcpProducer to have paused status set to true

DcpOpen will create a new DcpProducer and if one with a
similar name already exists (e.g - during rebalance),
this new producer will replace the older one, and the
paused status will need to be set to true, to let the
notification for the new connection to be sent to
memcached.

This looks good, but it appears you have other changes that are not needed to fix this bug. Please put them into different commits.

Line:739, src/tapconnection.h -> I'm not sure why this is different from what we currently have.

Line:87, src/dcp-producer.cc -> You don't need to check for NULL. Also, this should be in a separate commit.

Line:564, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Can you explain why this needs to be changed as part of this commit?

Line:565, src/dcp-producer.cc -> You should call the Producer::addStats here instead of adding the paused stat here.
