Trond, Testing/Temporary does not contain stdout output from engine_testapp, it only reports whether or not the entire test ran with success or failure.

Patch Set 3:

I've got the following in my Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log:

(and yes, there seems to be a bug in engine_testapp that it didn't pick up the core dump as an error (I just modified a test to do abort())
