DESCRIPTION

MB-6211 Only one access scanner should be scheduled at any time

If a user sets the access scanner task interval to a shorter
period, there is a chance of having multiple acccess scanner
tasks scheduled in a very short time. This change makes sure
that there is only one access scanner task scheduled at any time.
