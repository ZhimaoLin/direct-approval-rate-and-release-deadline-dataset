DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: Use 'uint64_t' for 'seqno_t' instead of 'int64_t'

'uint64_t' is a more apt for the 'seqno_t' in ephemeral as there is
no case where it must handle 'sequence numbers' < 0.

Initially, we had used 'int64_t' just to be cautious as the seqno
in 'CheckpointMgr' and 'Item' class are of type 'int64_t'.
