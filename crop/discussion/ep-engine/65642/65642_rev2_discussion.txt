DESCRIPTION

Skip test_tap_sends_deleted with forestdb as backend

This test times out with forestdb as backend because deleted items
don't get reflected in the final item count as forestdb doesn't
provide an accurate item count until a wal flush takes place.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:428, tests/ep_testsuite_tap.cc -> Could we not instead issue a WAL flush in the test so the statistics are accurate? Or is there not an API exposed which allows us to do a flush?

Line:428, tests/ep_testsuite_tap.cc -> As far as I know, there is no explicit API exposed in order to perform a WAL flush.

Line:428, tests/ep_testsuite_tap.cc -> :( Ok, this is probably ok for now, given this is a TAP test which I don't expect will be used much with forestdb.
