DESCRIPTION

Make sure seqno's are in the right order upon checkpoint creation

When we are assigning sequence numbers we need to make sure that
if a checkpoint start message is added to the checkpoint manager
then we need to also make sure that we assign a sequence number
to the checkpoint start message before the mutation.
