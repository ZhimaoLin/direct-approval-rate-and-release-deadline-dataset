-1 for the abort.

Note that *if* you really do want to terminate memcached/ep-engine, I'd suggest using cb_assert(false) as that prints a backtrace to the log.

Line:1004, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Why are we aborting here? Similar to the original bug, is it not possible a erroneous packet could have some invalid type and trigger this code path?

Even if that's believed not possible, killing the whole of ep-engine seems a bit extreme (given the recent problems we've seen). Can we not just shutdown this connection / stream?

Line:1004, src/dcp-stream.cc -> +1 I think we should use "return ENGINE_DISCONNECT"; (and also extend the log message with: disconnecting client"

Line:1004, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I suppose a DISCONNECT makes sense. I'll edit this part.
