DESCRIPTION

Create task for file removal

The unlink/remove function can fail if there is another process that has an open
file handle on that file. In such cases, we need to retry the remove periodically in a separate task until we get rid of those files. A separate task is being created, so that it will be
generically useful for offloading file manipulation tasks in the engine.
