DESCRIPTION

Handle unlink/remove failures

The unlink/remove function can fail if there is another process that
has an open file handle on that file. In such cases, we need to retry
the unlink periodically in the flusher task until we get rid of those
files.

Line:1187, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Can this queue be declared within the if(!pendingFileDeletions.empty()) block? this way we can avoid a constructor call for the most of the times?

Line:1205, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Don't you want to push the failed operation back into pendingFileDeletions since getAll() call above would have removed it?
