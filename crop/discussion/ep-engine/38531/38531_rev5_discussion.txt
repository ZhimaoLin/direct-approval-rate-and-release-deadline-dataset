I think it would be better to convert the temp item to a normal item than to delete and recreate the item. This is how we normally do this in other parts of the hashtable. See my comments for my proposed code changes.

Line:263, src/stored-value.cc -> if (!v->isResident() && !v->isDeleted() && !v->isTempItem()) {

Line:265, src/stored-value.cc -> if (v->isTempItem()) {
    --numTempItems;
    ++numItems;
    ++numTotalItems;
}
