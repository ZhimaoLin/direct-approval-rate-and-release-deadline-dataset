Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Will verify once Jin's bug fix gets merged first.

Patch Set 1: Fails

replica read returns both the key and the value, whereas get only returns the value. either the server implementation needs to change, or the client needs to understand the difference
