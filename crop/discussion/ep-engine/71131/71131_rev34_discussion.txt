Patch Set 34: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

Line:300, src/ep.h -> Any reason for not using default values for the value and datatype like you do for the get path?:

    ...
    const const_char_buffer value = {nullptr, 0},
    const uint8_t datatype = PROTOCOL_BINARY_RAW_BYTES);

Line:345, src/kvbucket.h -> Use default values for these two?

Line:355, src/hash_table.h -> Use default value?

Line:300, src/ep.h -> DaveR had some concerns about using too many defaults for a function call. Hence, I have left it as is.
