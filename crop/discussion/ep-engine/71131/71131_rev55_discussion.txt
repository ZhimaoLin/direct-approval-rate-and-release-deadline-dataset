Line:221, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> It looks like every time you call this function you specify a value for `wantDeleted`, it would be clearer if there wasn't a default value for it. Similar, now the order of the arguments to HashTable::find() have been swapped I think it would be clearer if there were in the same order.

Line:606, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> You might as well remove all these instances of /*wantsDeleted*/false - given that's the default it just adds noise to the patch (and defeats the some of point of default arguments) :)
