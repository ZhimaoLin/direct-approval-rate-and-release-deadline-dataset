I've only skimmed over this patch and a few questions popped up..

Line:171, tests/ep_test_apis.h -> whitespace change... should be reverted

Line:262, src/ep_engine.cc -> I don't really understand this.. why are we moving the key over to a (potentially) new namespace as part of delete?

Line:248, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Not related to this patch, but these should be changed to use the mcbp::datatype::is_XXX methods

Line:575, src/hash_table.cc -> as mentioned earlier, shouldn't the key namespace be preserved

Line:346, src/hash_table.h -> pretty obvious what it is for, but there is a description of all of the others ^^

Line:262, src/ep_engine.cc -> Worse than that, if the key has null bytes as part of the key then this will truncate the key.

Line:270, src/ep_engine.cc -> If another option is ever added to the document state then this will just silently do nothing. A switch block will produce compiler warnings if a new option is added, alternatively changing the above 'else' to an else-if and reinstating returning ENGINE_ENOTSUP for the 'else' will allow a more noticeable fail.

Line:356, src/vbucket.cc -> I think this method is probably getting a little big now, I would suggest factoring it out (potentially in a separate patch) to:

a) Add a constructor to vb_bgfetch_item_ctx_t to explicitly setup the getDeletedValue and isMetaOnly fields (isMetaOnly is rather clunkily initialised through an empty list check below)
b) Add some kind of update or append member function to vb_bgfetch_item_ctx_t which takes a VBucketBGFetchItem which adds ti to the list and updates the flags.

Line:607, src/hash_table.cc -> I think it would be more expressive to use !value.empty()

Line:648, src/hash_table.cc -> ditto

Line:673, src/hash_table.cc -> Unnecessary whitespace only change

Line:231, src/tasks.h -> nit: I suggest moving this below init so that it corresponds with the order the arguments are passed to the underlying function.

Line:325, src/kvbucket.h -> Please document the effect of nullability / 0-length (ie. don't store a value)

Line:326, src/kvbucket.h -> This parameter appears to no longer exist
