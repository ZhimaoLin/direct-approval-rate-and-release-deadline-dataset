Mostly there. One minor documentation comment, and also some suggestions for more tests.

Line:250, src/ep_engine.h -> Please document this function, specifically what arguments are allowed to be null or not.

Line:661, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> Could you also add a final check where if you lookup the item again (ht.find() I think?) you successfully get back a deleted item and with the expected deleted value?

Also - could you add a second test which attempts to set a deleted body for an already deleted item (two variants - one where the initial deleted body was null, one where the deleted body was non-null).
