Looking good - I think this is much cleaner.

We should also add unit tests to this - for example in HashTable test add checks to performing a n unlocked_softDelete with a value in the item.

Line:260, src/ep_engine.cc -> You don't need this - `itm` is already non-const.

Line:264, src/ep_engine.cc -> Pretty sure both of these are necessary - you should be able to directly construct a DocKey (for deleteItem()) from a StoredDocKey - i.e. this should just work:

 getHandle(handle)->deleteItem(item->getKey(), ...

Line:1339, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Use checkeq().

Line:254, src/kv_bucket.h -> Maybe highlight this can be null if an empty body is to be used for this deletion.

Line:265, src/kv_bucket.h -> Note: Given this is a virtual method and the base interface (kv_bucket_iface.h) already documents these arguments, there's no need to document it twice. We can just delete this documentation and rely on the base classes.

Line:284, src/ep_engine.h -> Not sure I understand the reason for this extra level of indirection (itemDelete() -> deleteItem() -> kvBucket->deleteItem).

Given there's only one existing caller to itemDelete (EvpItemDelete), you can just directly add the Item* argument to itemDelete(), and update the existing caller; removing the need for the extra new function (deleteItem).

Line:260, src/ep_engine.cc -> Am not sure I fully understand the comment. I am just casting the opaque item type to the Item object. There is no constness involved here.

Line:264, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:1339, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Done

Line:254, src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:265, src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:260, src/ep_engine.cc -> Ah sorry - I misread that the parameter is `item` (lower-case) and it's `Item` (uppercase) here :).
