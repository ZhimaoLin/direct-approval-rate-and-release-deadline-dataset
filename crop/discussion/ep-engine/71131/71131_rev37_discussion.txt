Patch Set 37: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

My gut feeling here is there's a lot of code changes here for what I had thought would logically be much simpler.

For example, why do we need to pass down GET_DELETED to all the bgfetch code if it wants deleted values or not? 

Given that Couchstore treats mutations and deletion similar (both will require reading the whole object from disk), I believe it would be simpler to have ep-engine unconditionally fetch deleted objects, and then in the front-end of EP-Engine (e.g. EPBucket::getInternal(), after a bgfetch check the isDeleted() flag and only return a valid GetValue if GET_DELETED_VALUE is true.

I believe this will exactly the same effect as your proposal (we will perform the same disk fetches), but will vastly simplfy the code.

What do you think? Is there something I'm missing which means we need the more complicated approach?

Line:84, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Probably worth expanding this comment to describe how it handles deleted documents / when it returns null.

Line:391, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Probably makes sense to combine this into a tri-state enum - that's much more explicit about the usage. It also disallowed the combo fetchDelete=false, getDeletedValue=true which doesn't make sense to me.

Line:300, src/ep.h -> Given these are input arguments, I'd list them before the result arguments (itemMeta & mutInfo)

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Given the size of the patch it would be useful to give some more details in the commit message of what's changing here - for example:

 * what the usage model is for the server (memcached) to store deleted
 * "How far" down the stack this works (i.e. are we persisting the deleted value yet?)
