Hey Dave, can I get your help on this.

While compiling test/module_tests/stream_test.cc, there's a failure in finding daemon/alloc_hooks.c. Clearly the path wasn't included, so I added:

${Memcached_SOURCE_DIR}

.. to the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES section in CMakelists.txt. But this introduced a whole lot of linkage errors. Did I do the right thing here?
