DESCRIPTION

MB-23505: Notify high priority rebalance requests in ephemeral buckets

High priority requests are async requests made by modules like ns-server
during rebalance. The request is for a response from the vbucket when it
'sees' beyond a certain sequence number or when a certain checkpoint is
persisted. Depending on the vbucket type, the meaning 'seeing' a sequence
number changes. That is, it could mean persisted in case of EPVBucket and
added to the sequenced data structure in case of EphemeralVBucket.

In ephemeral buckets we must notify high priority seqno requests as well.
Wwe notify when the requested seqno (or beyond) is put on the sequenced
data structure (say list) by the respective vbucket.

(6 comments)

Line:34, src/vbucket.h -> Alphabetical

Line:181, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Why the underscore-prefixed method? Given this takes the same parameters as addHighPriorityVBEntry(), why can't you just make it a virtual method - EphemeralVB doesn't even need to override it.

Line:308, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Whitespace-only change.

Line:138, src/ep_types.h -> I'd argue `Type` on the end of this is redundant (and saves you 4 chars ;)

Line:141, src/ep_types.h -> Not sure this needs to be in global scope - can't you just put it in the to_string function?

Line:156, src/ep_types.h -> Unnecessary for this to be inline (it shouldn't be perf-sensitive). Please move to ep_types.cc

(6 comments)

Line:34, src/vbucket.h -> I thought git-clang will do this for me

Line:181, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Because EPVBucket::addHighPriorityVBEntry() needs to do a bit more and then call this _addHighPriorityVBEntry()

Line:308, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Done

Line:138, src/ep_types.h -> Done

Line:141, src/ep_types.h -> Done

Line:156, src/ep_types.h -> Moved to ep_types.cc, now not a static function though

Line:34, src/vbucket.h -> It /should/ do IIRC...

Line:181, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Well then that's fine, EPVBucket can do the extra stuff, and then call the base class implementation.
