DESCRIPTION

silence gcc warning about comparing signed time_t and uint32_t

On 32-bit machines time_t is int32_t, so comparison is more ambiguous
than 64bit time_t versus uint32_t.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The fix is not quite correct.

1) Being-born-right-now x86-32 architecture will have 64-bit time_t. We're going to loose precision here.

2) AFAIK msvc has 32-bit longs even on x86-64.

I think the approach instead could be

(time_t)(int32_t)expiration != v->getExpiration()

instead. I.e. convert left side to time_t.

Thanks Alk for providing the fix.

We already merged the fix by changing the function parameter type to time_t to be consistent with its type in the hash table entry.
