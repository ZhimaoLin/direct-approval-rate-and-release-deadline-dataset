DESCRIPTION

MB-20852: ep_unit_tests_main: Show DEBUG logs with -v

Previously we would only print INFO level log messages when the -v
flag was given, even though the code claimed to have enabled DEBUG
level.

This was because we didn't get the log level early enough - the
extension defaults to INFO, and will propogate that down to ep_engine
(overwriting what we specify). Fix by setting the log level in the
server API to debug.
