DESCRIPTION

Update CHECKPOINT_START item if the open checkpoint ID is changed.

During the warmup time, we read each vbucket's last checkpoint Id
from vbucket_state DB table, and then update each vbucket's open
checkpoint Id. In this process, we also update CHECKPOINT_START
item with the new checkpoint Id.
