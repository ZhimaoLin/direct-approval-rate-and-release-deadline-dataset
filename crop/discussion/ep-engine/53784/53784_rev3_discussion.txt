DESCRIPTION

MB-15837 Generate a new vbucket UUID for TAP-based VBucket takeover.

A new vbucket UUID should be generated for each TAP-based vbucket takeover
completion. Otherwise, it can cause potential data loss after fully
switching from TAP to DCP, because TAP-based replication doesn't synchronize
sequence numbers between active and replica vbuckets.
