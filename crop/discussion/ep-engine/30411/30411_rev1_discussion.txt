DESCRIPTION

MB-9588 MB-9521 Reuse Flusher Task, Retry logic

MB-9588: Avoid the memory corruption in flusher code where
re-creating new Task every time a state change occurs can
result in multiple threads mutating the Flusher queues.
Instead re-use the same flusher task efficiently

MB-9521: If the flusher races before the snapshot of a
vbucket ran, then it must be able to retry that vbucket
