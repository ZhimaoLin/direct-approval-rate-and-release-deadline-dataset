DESCRIPTION

Remove default parameter from deleteItem

The EventuallyPersistentStore method deleteItem has
a parameter called tapBackfill, which is defaulted
to false.  The parameter is used to specify if an
item deletion is from a TAP backfill stream.

However the deleteItem method is never passed
a tapBackfill parameter and therefore the default
of false is always used.

This patch removes the unrequired parameter from
the deleteItem definition and simpifies the body
of the method.

Line:2798, src/ep.cc -> Nit: I normally "attach" the comment to the constant to make it easier when scanning which variable (left or eight) the comment is associated with - e.g.

 queueDirty(vb, v, &lh, NULL, /*tapBackfill*/false);
