DESCRIPTION

unmerged-commits: Improvements for usage in scripts

Improve interoperability with scripting use-cases:

* Only use ANSI colour codes if stdout is a TTY.
* Use the total number of unmerged patches as the error code.
* Don't print headers if there are no unmerged patches. This also
  means that if no unmerged patches are present, the script outputs
  nothing.
