Patch Set 21: Code-Review-1

So I want to be sure this test isn't increasing our run-time.

Your CV run shows the following

"11/24 Test  #3: ep-engine_ep_unit_tests ..................   Passed   53.80 sec"

Vs one from a different patch

"5/24 Test  #3: ep-engine_ep_unit_tests ..................   Passed    4.93 sec"

and comparing other test runtimes, it seemed they were similar, just that ep-engine_ep_unit_tests has increased. Can you tell me if this was just unlucky, or has this test increased the run time?
