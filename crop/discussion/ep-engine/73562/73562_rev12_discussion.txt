Line:122, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> nit: i < 3

Do you use git-clang-format ? If not you might wanna consider using that

Line:128, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> I think it is better to have a const variable that is equal to 2.
const int numWriters = 2;
so that subsequently,
pool->setMaxWriters(numWriters + 1);
EXPECT_EQ(numWriters + 1, pool->getNumWriters());

Similarly for other numbers.
