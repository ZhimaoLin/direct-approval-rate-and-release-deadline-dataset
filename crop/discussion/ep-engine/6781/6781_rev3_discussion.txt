DESCRIPTION

Instantiate VBucket if not exist while registering its TAP cursor

We observed that ep-engine sometimes receives TAP connection request
from EVBucketMigrator even before the corresponding vbuckets are
instantiated. This race condition can be resolved by activating any
missing vbuckets with pending state while registering TAP cursors.

ns-server will shortly change those vbuckets' states based on its
vbucket map.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(1 inline comment)



Line:240, tapconnection.cc -> Should we also log when the other is true? (when the instantiating message receives?) I don't understand when this should happen, because it breaks some of the "logic" (we should always send the set vbucket message first...)

I forgot that Alk already fixed this issue in ns-server. Abandon this change.
