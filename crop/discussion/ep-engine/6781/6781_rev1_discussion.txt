DESCRIPTION

Instantiate VBucket if not exist while registering its TAP cursor

We observed that ep-engine sometimes receives TAP connection request
from EVBucketMigrator even before the corresponding vbuckets are
instantiated. This race condition can be resolved by activating any
missing vbuckets with pending state while registering TAP cursors.

ns-server will shortly change those vbuckets' states based on its
vbucket map.
