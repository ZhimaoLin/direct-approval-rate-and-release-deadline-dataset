DESCRIPTION

MB-5236 preserve vb state after vbucket deletion

order to allow backfills from a source node continue to
write items to previously reset(deleted) vbuckets.

Line:221, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please declare vbstate and errCode inside for loop as their scope is limited to for loop.

Line:224, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to call the vector default constructor explicitly. Please simply it as "std::vector<std::string> files;"

Line:251, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please declare those variables inside for loop. It doesn't affect the performance. Or please pass them to setVBucketState by the iterator directly.

Line:258, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please consider the success case first:

if (setVBucketState(...)) {
    updateDbFileMap(...);
} else {
    error...
}

Line:451, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please declare errCode inside if { ..} below.

Line:485, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We usually put the success predicate in if (...).
I suggest you to adapt
if (setVBucket(...)) {
    updateDbFileMap(...)
} else {
   error ...
}

Line:592, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to declare another variable here. Please use newfile parameter variable below.
