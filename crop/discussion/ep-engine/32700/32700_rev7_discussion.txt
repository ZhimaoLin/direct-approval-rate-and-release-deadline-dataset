DESCRIPTION

MB-9866 StoredValue now contains queued_item instance.

Use reference-counted Item (queued_item) class inside StoredValue
class so that CheckPoint Manger and Hashtable can share keys and
metadata of items instead of keeping separate copies.
This will greatly decrease memory usage for cases where there
is big number of small sized items.

Patch Set 7:

drastically reduced the change scope and only limit them mostly to stored-value.h/cc instead of across the board.

I still saw some issues in the latest patch. I will adapt the code and upload the new patch.

Line:2618, src/ep.cc -> This will create a separate item instance for checkpoint, which results in no memory reduction.

Line:520, src/item.h -> We don't need this function.

Line:2618, src/ep.cc -> it won't. getItem will just return item_ because the first parameter is 'false'. a new item intense is created only when it's 'true'.
