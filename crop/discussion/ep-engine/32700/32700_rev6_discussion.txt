DESCRIPTION

MB-9866 StoredValue now contains queued_item instance.

Use reference-counted Item (queued_item) class inside StoredValue class.
CheckPoint Manger and Hashtable will now share keys and metadata for
items instead of making copies. This will greatly decrease memory usage
for cases where there is big number of small sized items.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:1033, src/tapconnection.cc -> queued_item &itm

Line:703, src/stored-value.h -> As I mentioned earlier, we should NOT add the key length here as the item instance already has the key.

Line:218, src/stored-value.h -> These two lines do the same thing.

Line:631, src/stored-value.cc -> Where do we use "lck" and "vbucket" params in this function?

Line:218, src/stored-value.h -> Well, What I'm saying is that "itm->setRevSeqno(revSeqno) does exactly the same thing as "setRevSeqno(revSeqno)". Whey do you think we need these two statements here?

Line:218, src/stored-value.h -> setRevSeqno calls "item_->setRevSeqno" which is different than
"itm->setRevSeqno" because item_ is not the same as itm here.

The original code set revseqno for member variable as well as the parameter. don't know why but I'm just maintaining the same logic.
