DESCRIPTION

MB-9866 StoredValue now contains queued_item instance.

Use reference-counted Item (queued_item) class inside StoredValue class.
CheckPoint Manger and Hashtable will now share keys and metadata for items
instead of making copies. This will greatly decrease memory usage for
cases where there is big number of small sized items. Many files have been
changed to allow the queued_item class to used intead of Item class.
