DESCRIPTION

Remove the use of new and delete from VBucketMap class

Create KVShared objects using make_unique.

Also move bucketCreation, bucketDeletion and persistenceSeqnos data
structures into the VBuckets themselves, as opposed to being in the
VBucketMap.

(4 comments)

Line:65, src/vbucketmap.h -> not a huge amount of value in const for value parameters, you can't affect the callers data

Line:556, src/vbucket.h -> nit: persistenceSeqno

Line:136, src/vbucketmap.cc -> no need for const, doesn't do much and saves the awkward 80 char wrap

Line:156, src/vbucketmap.cc -> ditto
