Patch Set 16: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:405, src/ep.h -> I think you need to check for null here - see my similar changes.

Line:59, src/vbucketmap.h -> Personally I thought the original comment was more informative - make it clear it wasn't necessary the number of current VBs, but number of total possible.

Line:114, src/bgfetcher.cc -> yes created -> created yet.
