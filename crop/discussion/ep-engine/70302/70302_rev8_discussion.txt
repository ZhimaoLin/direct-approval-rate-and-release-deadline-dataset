DESCRIPTION

Remove the use of new and delete from VBucketMap class

Create KVShared objects using make_unique.

Also create bucketCreation, bucketDeletion and persistenceSeqnos
data structures using std::vector as opposed to explictly creating
the array data structures using new.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-2

(5 comments)

Line:67, src/vbucketmap.h -> just delete the function if not needed?

Line:96, src/vbucketmap.h -> aren't you going to need an extra space here? did this compile before you uploaded? 

std::vector<std::unique_ptr<KVShard> >

Line:608, src/ep.cc -> why no longer auto? to iterate a vector of unique_ptr  

for(const auto& shard: vbMap.shards) {
   shard->getFlusher()->start();
}

Line:3830, src/ep.cc -> as above

Line:124, src/vbucketmap.cc -> Should be

vbData[id]->bucketDeletion.load();

unique_ptr operates like a pointer, no need to get the pointer

Line:96, src/vbucketmap.h -> ah ignore... did c++ fix this,  it used to be the case that the >> got interpretted as shift and failed compilation...

-2 based on Jim's comments, -1 for just mine.

Line:47, src/vbucketmap.h -> VbData is a bit ambiguous - everything is "data" ;) - maybe call it something like VBFlags?

Furthermore, I think this "data" probably belongs inside the VBucket objects themselves - see for example http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/67877

Line:67, src/vbucketmap.h -> Given this isn't virtual there's essentially no need to explicitly declare it, compiler-provided default is fine.

Line:97, src/vbucketmap.h -> As above, I think it's better to move this data into the bucket object - having to maintain two parallel vector where the contents should match feels like code smell to me (unless there's some good reason for it, which I don't think there is here).

Line:25, src/vbucketmap.cc -> Nit: Use <platform/make_unique.h> as these come from a different library (platform).

Line:96, src/vbucketmap.h -> Yeah, was fixed in C++11 iirc.
