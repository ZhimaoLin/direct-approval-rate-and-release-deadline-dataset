DESCRIPTION

Allow duplicate INITIAL_VB_STREAM messages to the destination.

As ns_server makes a new connection repeatedly with the same name and
new list of vbuckets during the rebalance, INITIAL_VB_STREAM message
for a given vbucket might not be sent to the destination if we don't
allow duplciates on that message. The reason was that if a new
connection request was made within a very short time, the old
connection coudln't even send INITIAL_VB_STREAM message to the
destination.
