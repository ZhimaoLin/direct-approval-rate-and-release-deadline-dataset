Line:213, sync_registry.cc -> std::set.insert won't insert a new item if the item with the same value already exists. So, the CAS value won't be updated. If the item with the same value already exists, it should be first removed and then the new item should be inserted.

Line:248, sync_registry.cc -> This will have the same issue mentioned above.
