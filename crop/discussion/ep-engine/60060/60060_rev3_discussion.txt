DESCRIPTION

MB-18171: Break cyclic reference between ActiveStream & ChkptProcesser

Removing circular dependency between ActiveStream and
ActiveStreamCheckpointProcesserTask where each holds a reference
to the other causing a memory leak during shutdown.

Also explicitly clear the queues of checkpointProcessor task upon
disconnection of the DcpProducer, so as to remove a cyclic reference
between DcpProducer, ActiveStream, and ActiveStreamCheckpointProcesserTask.
