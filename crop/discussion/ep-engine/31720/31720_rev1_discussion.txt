Patch Set 1:

1) trying to isolate code and make it more "modular" => we can change code without having to recompile more stuff. (Moving all implementation out of headerfiles and forward decl classes instead of including the headerfiles helps here).

2) I personally find it easier to navigate in a small file which contain a limited amount of functionality (and when I try to understand something I don't have to jump hundreds of lines back and forth in the file, but can just toggle to the other file..
