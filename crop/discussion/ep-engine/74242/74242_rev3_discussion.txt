Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Manu's previous patches (606a8c7 and 47af4312) introduced incorrect use of the eviction policy in the highlighted sections.

I'll ask him to fix those, then you can re-apply your patch.

Line:830, src/vbucket.cc -> Interestingly enough this has highlighted a bug introduced by Manu recently - see my latest comment on http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/71572/6 - essentially this should always be true.

Line:989, src/vbucket.cc -> Same problem here.
