DESCRIPTION

Reduce log priority in conflict resolution to avoid unnecessary warnings

It is quite possible to receive mutations that aren't eligible
for last_write_wins conflict resolution strategy when time sync is
enabled. Therefore, reducing the priority of the log to avoid a
large number of warnings.
