DESCRIPTION

MB-23211: Allow the expiry callback to carry full item

case of full eviction, the system xattrs can be retained in the
body after deleting the rest of the body

Patch Set 21: Code-Review-1

(7 comments)

Line:803, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why are we creating a whole Item object on the heap here? Can't we just create a concrete object and save the allocation?

Line:302, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Pretty sure you can just pass by Item& here.

Line:564, src/kv_bucket.cc -> The item knows its own vbid; you can remove the explicit `vbid` argument and take it from the Item.

Line:594, src/kv_bucket.cc -> I don't see why we need to change the revSeqno here. Could you add a comment explaining why?

Line:517, src/kv_bucket.h -> You don't need an explicit vbid argument, an Item knows it's own vbid.

Line:5707, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Any reason why this isn't done with an EPStoreEvictionTest? That's a much nicer / more explicit test environment which doesn't have all the various background threads present creating the opportunity for test races.

They also generally run a lot quicker.

Line:5708, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please add a more descriptive name / comment explaining what this test checks for.

Line:803, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I am not sure as to what you mean by a concrete object.

Line:803, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Instead of using a std::unique_ptr to an Item, just create an Item:

 it = Item(makeDocKey(, ...), ...);
