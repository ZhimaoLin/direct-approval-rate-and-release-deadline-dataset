DESCRIPTION

MB-23211: Allow the expiry callback to carry full item

case of full eviction, the system xattrs can be retained in the
body after deleting the rest of the body

Line:430, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Style: prefer to use `auto*` here, so the reader knows that this is a pointer type (and hence might need to delete / free later).

(Or you could just wrap in a std::unique_ptr<Item> and hence then you don't have to worry about deleting).

Line:449, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Should also check that the datatype is now only XATTR - i.e. any datatype associated with the body (JSON) has been removed. To do this you'll need to change the datatype of the original item at line 425.

Line:744, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Worth documenting what this function is used for.

Line:751, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> It looks like this will only set any ext_meta (and hence datatype) if the item being expired has the XATTR bit set. Is this correct? I would have thought that we'd want to set it unconditionally.

Line:761, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> You might as well just use the same type as `item` (sized_buf), then you don't have to keep reinterpret_cast<>ing all over the place (and in face you could just update `item` once at line 773).
