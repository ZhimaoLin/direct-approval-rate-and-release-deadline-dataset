DESCRIPTION

MB-23211: Allow the expiry callback to carry full item

case of full eviction, the system xattrs can be retained in the
body after deleting the rest of the body

Please could you also convert the ep_testsuite test over to a GTest-style one - I'd like us to be moving towards that test framework where possible.

Line:241, src/item_pager.cc -> again, I think this is an unnecessary indirection.

Line:757, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> You don't actually need this variable until line 806; as such prefer to define as close to as needed - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-scope

Line:759, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> These seem unnecessary - I believe you can just use cb::const_byte_buffer data to refer to the data to use.

Line:789, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Bug! - you're declaring an array and then taking a pointer to it; but the array (`ext_meta`) does out of scope at line 794. As such ext_meta_ptr will be a dangling pointer when it's used at line 802.

Also - prefer something type-safe like a std::array for ext_meta.
