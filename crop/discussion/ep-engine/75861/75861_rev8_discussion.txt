Line:5668, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Suggestion for test - disable_persistence(), store() to same key again (generating new rev/CAS); then compact_db() as below.

Then check the new value is still in the HT and hasn't been deleted (and has the original).

Line:1316, src/vbucket.cc -> We didn't perform a CAS check before, any idea as to why the CAS check is needed with the new change?

Line:1316, src/vbucket.cc -> without a cas check someone could have modified an item, but it is not (yet) persisted to disk when the disk is doing the compacting and see an expired item and push it down here...  checking the cas would make sure that we expire the item we expected to expire and not another version of the object
