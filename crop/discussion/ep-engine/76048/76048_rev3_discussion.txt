DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Don't schedule backfill until previous is complete

Previously in the handleSlowStream function if we are in the
Backfilling state and backfillTask is not running then we called
scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED.

However although the backfillTask is not running there could still
be items in the Ready Queue.

As we are still in the Backfilling state, regardless as to whether
the backfillTask is running, we should drop the current cursor
and set the pendingBackfill flag.

Line:168, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Style: I generally use ASSERT_XX() for test preconditions - this also has the benefit that the test will stop at that point (no value in continuing).

It also makes it more obvious what checks are setup, and what checks are the actual issue we are checking for.
