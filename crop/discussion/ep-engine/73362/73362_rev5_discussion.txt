DESCRIPTION

Add appropriate comments for KEY_ENOENT after a deletion

When a delete is issued, the existing item could have expired
and thus we need to return a KEY_ENOENT. But, a deletion
still needs to be queued in order to persist the fact that
the item has expired.

Patch Set 5:

I looked at the code more closely. It seems like a fall through is expected in this case because the item could have expired and a deletion needs to be queued after returning a KEY_ENOENT.
