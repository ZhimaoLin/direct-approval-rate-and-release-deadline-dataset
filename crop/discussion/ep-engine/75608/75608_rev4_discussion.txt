DESCRIPTION

MB-23067: Explicitly make_pair in initializer_list

MSVC 2013 does not play well with the current initializer list for the
stats. This seems to be a variant of
https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/800104/

To accomodate for this bug, this commit explicitly uses make_pair and
specifies the types (the key ones being the std::strings) to help avoid
the compiler getting confused and silently changing the data.

One approach tried was to explicitly use an initializer_list, however
this still resulted in the same issue. Another approach of explicitly
creating std::strings in the initializer list resulted in an internal
compiler error.

Line:135, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Looks as though clang-format is adding it, may be due to extra leading space on line 123?
