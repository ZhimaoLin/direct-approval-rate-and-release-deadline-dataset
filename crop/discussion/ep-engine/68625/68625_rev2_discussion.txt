DESCRIPTION

Add support for enabling xattr support

The DCP producer must be told explicitly to send XATTRs to
the consumer to support backwards compatibility.

The DCP client in ep-engine don't need support for this
control message as it is a message sent from the client to
the server. By default the consumer in ep-engine expects
ns_server to enable xattr support.
