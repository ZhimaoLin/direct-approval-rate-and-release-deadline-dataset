DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Mark the StoredValue dirty or clean inside StoredValue::setValue()

HashTable::unlocked_add() calls StoredValue::setValue() and in next step
again marks StoredValue dirty or clean immediately afterwards. It is more
appropriate to set that in StoredValue::setValue() itself

(1 comment)

Line:183, src/stored-value.h -> Prefer not to default this - (1) it'll make it hard if/when we add another argument, and (2) it forces people to think if something should be dirty or not.
