DESCRIPTION

MB-24817: During takeover, hold stream lock until vb is set to dead

During DCP takeover, when we decide to set the vbucket to dead state
on the producer side, we also transition the stream state from
STREAM_TAKEOVER_WAIT to STREAM_TAKEOVER_SEND state to send out any
remaining items that were received before the vbucket was set to
dead state.

The stream lock must be held until the vbucket is set to the dead
state, so that we do not prematurely finish sending out the last
items when the vbucket is not dead yet (that is if the vbucket
is not dead, it could get some more items).

This commit addresses the issue and also handles the ordering of
locks involved at stream level, ep store level and vbucket level
in the scenario.

Adding a test case seemed not possible because it involves ordering the execution of 2 threads at the code line level

Fix looks good. What's our test coverage like in this area - do we have a test for this?

Line:528, src/ep.h -> Nit: not applicable here (c/p bug from the unlocked variant?)

Line:558, src/ep.h -> I think this is potentially confusing - I'd be tempted to just pass in a reference and have the caller always lock it.

Line:296, src/vbucket.h -> For consistency I'd name this setState_UNLOCKED().

We have tests covering the takeover, including the modified function setVBucketStateAckRecieved(). But we do not have a test for this specific race condition.

Line:528, src/ep.h -> Done

Line:558, src/ep.h -> setVBucketState_UNLOCKED() is called from other places as well.
In those places, enforcing vbStateLock to be acquired before hand has 2 problems
1. Increased scope of vbStateLock
2. We enforce, that vb should be present when setVBucketState_UNLOCKED() is called. Currently we also create a vb in the setVBucketState_UNLOCKED() call.

If I have to pass vbStateLock as a reference, then I will have to use separate function instead, which does similar stuff as setVBucketState_UNLOCKED().

Line:296, src/vbucket.h -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:558, src/ep.h -> Hmm, I'm not a big fan of this but I think for watson it's probably reasonable to keep as-is.

Maybe we can simplify in master.
