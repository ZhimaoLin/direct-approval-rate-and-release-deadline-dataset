Patch Set 1:

171 had fallen behind a bit.  I don't think there's *too* much going on here, but there is at least and annoying bug in mbrestore a user pointed out to me.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Farshid, I think this can be safely merged into 1.7.1 because it does not have any changes in the engine core, but only contains the fixes to mc_bin_client and unit test modules. It's your call to ship this into 1.7.1 release.

Patch Set 1:

the only change that requires us to do more testing are the changes to mbrestore.
I think it should be safe but anyhow i am adding keith to the review to assess the change since he is working on mbrestore test cases.
