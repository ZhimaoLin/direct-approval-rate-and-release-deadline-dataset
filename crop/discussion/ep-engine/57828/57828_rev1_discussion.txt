DESCRIPTION

MB-17083: Include lastHighSeqno in setDriftCounterState API

If setDriftCounterState API, invoked by XDCR changes the
time_sync status of a vbucket (toggles it from enabled to
disabled or vice versa), then last high seqno of the vbucket
will be sent in the body section of the response packet.

If the time_sync status doesn't change, the response packet
will not carry any extra payload.
