DESCRIPTION

Apply state transition once when a passive stream is marked dead

When an attempt is made to mark a passive stream dead, apply
the state change and log only if it hasn't been marked dead
already. This prevents consecutive logs that mention the same
message that a particular passive stream was marked as dead.

Line:1052, src/dcp/stream.cc -> transitionState function actually checks if the previous state is same as the new state.
If you don't want the log below twice, then use killed flag only for that.
It might be best to have all state transition related logic in one place.
(for example in future we may decide to add some special logic for STREAM_DEAD -> STREAM_DEAD transition.)

Line:1052, src/dcp/stream.cc -> It didn't look good if I had it this way instead:

if (state_ != STREAM_DEAD) {
     will_kill = true;
}
transitionState(STREAM_DEAD);

Why would there be a special logic to handle STREAM_DEAD to STREAM_DEAD?

Line:1052, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Not saying for sure there will, but there could be. In transitionState() you see that there are some valid transitions and some invalid. Also if new state is STREAM_DEAD we have separate cases for old state STREAM_PENDING and STREAM_READING (even though they are doing same thing). Idea is to control all transitions here (essentially the func is state diagram).
STREAM_DEAD -> STREAM_DEAD is a possible transition in the state diagram and is best if it is handled appropriately in the function transitionState().
