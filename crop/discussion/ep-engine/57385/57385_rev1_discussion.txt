DESCRIPTION

Apply state transition once when a passive stream is marked dead

When an attempt is made to mark a passive stream dead, apply
the state change and log only if it hasn't been marked dead
already. This prevents consecutive logs that mention the same
message that a particular passive stream was marked as dead.
