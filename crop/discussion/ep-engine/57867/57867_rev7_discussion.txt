Line:521, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Why this is no longer needed?

Line:592, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Ditto

Line:676, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Shouldn't we increment roundRobinVbReady before returning here? Otherwise, the next call will visit the same vbucket again if that vbucket still has some items in the queue.

Line:521, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Because setDead above sets vbReady to true, and the step function needs to send out the END_STREAM message. This would mean one extra iteration of step.

Line:676, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Yes that would be the right thing to do, I'll increment roundRobinVbReady before we return op.
