DESCRIPTION

Always adjust stats properly on hashtable changes.

The hash table itself adjusted the stats on the way in and on
deletions, but on reset, the caller would adjust the stats.
Sometimes.

This change adjusts all memory stats in the hashtable itself and
demonstrates correctness through unit tests.
