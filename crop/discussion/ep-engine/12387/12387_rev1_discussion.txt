Some stuff was floating around in strange places, tripping me up.

Line:117, flusher.hh -> I'm not a big fan of these indentations at all.. it just makes the code harder to keep up to date when you're refactoring stuff.. In addition to that it's hard to read when you have one long datatype followed by short ones.. I don't have any lines in my editor, so with this huge whitespace my eyes may mix the lines etc.

I'm from that generation who thinks that the only place multiple whitespaces make sense is before the first character on the line ;-)

Patch Set 1: Verified

Really, all this did was move something to a new line so it wasn't so long and move a method definition out of the middle of field definitions.

Really?? In my web browser it changes: 

EventuallyPersistentStore *store;		
volatile enum flusher_state _state;		
Mutex taskMutex;		
TaskId task;		
Dispatcher *dispatcher;

to:

EventuallyPersistentStore   *store;
volatile enum flusher_state  _state;
Mutex                        taskMutex;
TaskId                       task;
Dispatcher                  *dispatcher;

(and I guess Jasmin Rangel messed up that comment ;-))

Oh, I've got "ignore whitespace: all" set in Jasmin Rangel.  I don't see things that don't actually change code.  :)
