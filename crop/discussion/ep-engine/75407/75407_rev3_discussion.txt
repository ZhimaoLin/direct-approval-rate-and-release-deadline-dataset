DESCRIPTION

MB-22738: Add last_receive_time to DCP Producer Stats

We record a stat for the last time a message is sent on a given
connection.  However we do not have a stat for when a message was last
received.

We do maintain a last received time and therefore this patch adds this
to the DCP Producer stats.
