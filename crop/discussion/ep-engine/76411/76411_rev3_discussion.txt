DESCRIPTION

Improve cbstats and cbepctl usage text

Corrects exit code when calling with "--help" - this is a successful
execution and should exit(0). This facilitates simply executing these
tools with "--help" as a very basic test.

Also improves some error messages, making better use of optparse.

Line:31, management/cli_auth_utils.py -> You need to revert this - you've broken (for example):

 cbstats bucket-details

It takes an argument (vbid), but it's optional.
