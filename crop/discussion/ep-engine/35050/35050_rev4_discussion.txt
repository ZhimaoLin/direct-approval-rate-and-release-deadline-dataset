DESCRIPTION

MB-10403 Improve UPR connection notification

Use spinlocks instead of conn mutex to guard UPR notifications
similar to the way TAP does. This will decrease lock contention
since conn mutex is no longer needed here.

We now need to manipulate vbconns structure for UPR too:
add and remove connection for a stream based on vbid.

Also Refactored ConnMap/TapConnMap/UprConnMap as needed.

One minor comment. Other than that I think this looks good.

Line:61, src/upr-producer.cc -> I don't think we should use a do-while here since we're not actually looping. Let's just return call the UprConnMap remove when needed and return.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Some minor comments to be addressed.

Line:1053, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Can we simply use "static_cast" here as we know that they are always producers.

Line:1055, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I saw that we still use a mutex inside this function, which can cause a high lock contention if memcached worker threads get into the same UPR producer. We may need to revisit this area again after we get some performance numbers.

Line:1085, src/tapconnmap.cc -> *iter should be corrected to "i" (vbucket id)

Line:139, src/upr-producer.cc -> It seems like we don't need do-while loop

Line:1055, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Take a look at this review:
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/35373/

I plan on doing something similar to this in the upr producer and that will remove the lock.

Line:1053, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I can change this one this time. But there are other places have the same issue.

Line:1085, src/tapconnmap.cc -> yes.

Line:61, src/upr-producer.cc -> do/while solves the ugliness of "cleanup/release" before every "return statement". It's more readable and easy to maintain. for ex, if we need to change or add addition cleanup/release, we just need to do it at one place instead of before every error return.

Line:139, src/upr-producer.cc -> I like the do-while structure. it's cleaner.

Line:1053, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Please use static_cast. We can address other places as a separate commit.

Line:60, src/upr-producer.cc -> We can simply move this connection addition to the end of this function, so that the connection is added iff all the conditions below are passed.

Line:61, src/upr-producer.cc -> This method is invoked on the producer side when it receives a stream request from the consumer for a given vbucket. We should not allocate any resources until it passes all the conditions below.

Line:141, src/upr-producer.cc -> I will rather adapt it like

if (rv == ENGINE_SUCCESS) {
    engine_.getUprConnMap().addVBConnByVBId(conn, vbucket);
}
