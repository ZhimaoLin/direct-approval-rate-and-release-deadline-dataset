DESCRIPTION

MB-10403 Improve UPR connection notification

Use spinlocks instead of conn mutex to guard UPR notifications
similar to the way TAP does. This will decrease lock contention
since conn mutex is no longer needed here.

We now need to manipulate vbconns structure for UPR too:
add and remove connection for a stream based on vbid.

Also Refactored ConnMap/TapConnMap/UprConnMap as needed.

I found one minor bug. Other than that, it looks good and ready to merge if it passes make simple-test.

Line:1085, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Seems like you missed correcting "*iter" to "i" to pass a vbucket id correctly.

Line:1085, src/tapconnmap.cc -> sorry. something maybe wrong with my way of rebase/merge/patch, missing of the same line of change happened at least twice. I'll make sure this gets corrected.
