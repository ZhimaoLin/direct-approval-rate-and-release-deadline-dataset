DESCRIPTION

MB-10403 Improve UPR connection notification

when notifyStreamReady. This may cause same stream be in the
ready queue more than once which is OK.

David,

This change might reduce the lock overhead, but not much. Even with this change, there will be heavy locking overhead, which will affect the frontend ops/sec significantly.

Let's discuss it more offline.
