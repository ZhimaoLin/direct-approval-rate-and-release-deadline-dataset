DESCRIPTION

MB-14978: Consistency in vbmap creation state array when deleting VB.

It's possible to create and quickly remove a VBucket leaving the
VBucketMap::isBucketCreation function returning true allowing
a number of pointless flush requests.

Setting this value to false on delete allows the flusher to quickly
ignore the deleted vbucket and go back to sleep sooner.
