Uploaded patch set 2.

Patch Set 2:

ep-engine_stream_test appears to fail threadsanitizer due to an exception being caught:

14:13:37 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'
14:13:37   what():  Failed to store thread specific value: Invalid argument: Invalid argument

and a warning: 14:13:37 (default) Tried to signal a NULL cookie!.

The 2nd patch, I think would address the warning.
@DaveR would you perhaps know why the exception is being fired?
