DESCRIPTION

Revert "CouchKVStore to enable direct I/O to CouchDB files"

This reverts commit bacb148a77f11f8109b6e124eb6206f97f842749.

The code caused a build break on FreeBSD, and turned out to be
included on 1.8.1 that doesn't contain the other dependencies needed.

Reverted to to let people build the source while waiting for a fix.
