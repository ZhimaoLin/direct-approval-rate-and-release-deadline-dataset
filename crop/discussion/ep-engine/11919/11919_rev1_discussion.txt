DESCRIPTION

Do not delete expired items during delete-with-meta

The local expired items pages will delete the expired items. So, we
should not have to delete them also inside delete-with-meta.

This also conflicts with the idea of lazy expiration. The expiry pager only runs once every hour by default so it is preferable to delete expired items whenever possible. Can you provide reasoning on why we shouldn't delete an expired item here.
