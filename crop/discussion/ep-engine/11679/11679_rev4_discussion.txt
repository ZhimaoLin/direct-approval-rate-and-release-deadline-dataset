Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

I think this is right and simplifies the implementation. I don't think we need to support the dynamic runtime resizing on the number of vbuckets at this time.

Line:86, vbucketmap.cc -> I'm pretty sure this caused a compile failure for me (the id >= 0).  It's a uint16_t.

Patch Set 4: Fails; No score

Actually, yeah, just reconfirmed.  Let's call this a failed verification vs. a bad review.

I forgot to mention that vbucketmap source file should be added to the windows one.
