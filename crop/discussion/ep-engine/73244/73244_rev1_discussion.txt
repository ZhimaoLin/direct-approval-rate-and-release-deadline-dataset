DESCRIPTION

Move evictKey() into VBucket

Move the implementation of EPBucket::evictKey() down into the VBucket
class. In addition to removing a use of the HashTable from outside
VBucket itself, this also removes the last use of eviction policy from
the bucket-level classses - and hence it can simply be a VBucket level
member (in a subsequent patch).
