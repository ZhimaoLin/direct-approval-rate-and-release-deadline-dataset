DESCRIPTION

MB-10640 Improve UPR rollback during failover.

Stream request now includes snap_start_seqno and snap_end_seqno.
(high_seqno is removed) which can be used to deal with
partial snapshot.

failover check is based on start_seqno, snap_start_seqno and
snap_end_seqno.

Generally this looks good. Remember that we need to have all of the other components implement this change before merging it.

Line:78, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Remove XXX comment here.

Line:87, src/failover-table.cc -> To support the new rollback mechanism I think we just need to add the following if statement below.

if (snap_end_seqno >  upper {
    *rollback_seqno = snap_start_seqno;
    return true;
}
