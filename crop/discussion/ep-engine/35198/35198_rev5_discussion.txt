DESCRIPTION

MB-10640 Improve UPR rollback during failover.

Stream request now has snap_start_seqno and snap_end_seqno.
(high_seqno is removed) which can be used to deal with
partial snapshot. failover check is based on start_seqno,
snap_start_seqno and snap_end_seqno.

Snapshot Marker now has start_seqno, end_seqno and flag.
start_seqno/end_seqno indicates sequence number ranges
of the stream.

The flag indicates if a stream is from disk or memory.
The current value are:
0: memory
1: disk

Patch Set 5:

1 thing, when running against corresponding changes to pyupr I hit a case when snap_start > snap_end.

./pyupr -b dev -h 127.0.0.1:9000  -o test_stream_request_n_producers

not sure if it's trivial enough to fix here or bug should be opened.

(4 comments)

Line:449, src/upr-stream.cc -> When getting a checkpoint we will always be in the in-memory phase so we don't need this parameter.

Line:63, src/upr-producer.cc -> We need to add a sanity check here for snap_start_seqno <= start_seqno <= snap_end_seqno.

Line:96, src/failover-table.cc -> This should never happen. The snapshot start seqno should always be less than or equal to the start seqno. This means that this if statement will always be true.

Line:102, src/failover-table.cc -> This is incorrect when the start_seqno and snap_start_seqno are less than upper, but the snap_end_seqno is greater than upper. In this case we want to rollback to the snap_start_seqno.
