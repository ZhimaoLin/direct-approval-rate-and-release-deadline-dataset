DESCRIPTION

MB-10640 Improve UPR rollback during failover.

Stream request now has snap_start_seqno and snap_end_seqno.
(high_seqno is removed) which can be used to deal with
partial snapshot. failover check is based on start_seqno,
snap_start_seqno and snap_end_seqno.

Snapshot Marker now has start_seqno, end_seqno and flag.
start_seqno/end_seqno indicates sequence number ranges
of the stream.

The flag indicates if a stream is from disk or memory.
The current value are:

0: memory
1: disk

Line:342, src/upr-stream.cc -> I think we will also need to force a checkpoint creation before entering this state. Let's tNathalie Landry about how you can do this.

Line:348, src/upr-stream.cc -> I think we should remove this snapshot marker. Getting items from the checkpoint manager should be able to properly add the snapshot marker.

Line:436, src/upr-stream.cc -> This won't work properly because it will cause a snapshot marker to be sent after the first snapshot item. You should just remove the code you added here and change the if statement to:

if (qi->getOperation() == queue_op_checkpoint_end) {

Line:462, src/upr-stream.cc -> The if statement below should be:

} else if (qi->getOperation() == queue_op_checkpoint_start) {

Line:463, src/upr-stream.cc -> We need to properly get the end seqno here (Let' discuss how you can do this). Also, the start seqno is not the start of this snapshot. You can get the snapshot start number by calling qi->getBySeqno().

Line:516, src/upr-stream.cc -> Please fix this tab.

Please keep the docs in sync.

Line:89, src/failover-table.h -> The documentation should be updated as well.

Line:79, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I guess that XXX is some development process leftover.
