DESCRIPTION

Unit tests: Allow StatTest to be used by other tests

Refactor the StatTest test fixture so it can be used (via inheritence)
by other tests:

* Create a header for it and move class definition into it.

* Modify get_stat() so the statistic map is returned from the method,
  instead of held in a static global.

Line:45, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> is this updating the 'stats' from line 36 or line 42 ? 
'stats' in line 36 and 42 are different or same ?

Line:45, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> 42 - well they are both the same thing - one is a pointer to the other. I'll tweak it tomorrow to give them different names.

Line:26, tests/module_tests/stats_test.h -> Derive from SingleThreadedEPBucketTest or SingleThreadedEphemeralBucketTest ?
Or planning to do this in a future commit ?

Line:26, tests/module_tests/stats_test.h -> This was just code moving from one file to another.. Given the StatTest class does test EPBuckets, this seems a fair hierarchy.

Line:35, tests/module_tests/stats_test.h -> Ditto - given it's just moving code, I prefer to not change unnecessarily, as that maximises the value of `git blame`.
