DESCRIPTION

Unit tests: Allow StatTest to be used by other tests

Refactor the StatTest test fixture so it can be used (via inheritence)
by other tests:

* Create a header for it and move class definition into it.

* Modify get_stat() so the statistic map is returned from the method,
  instead of held in a static global.
