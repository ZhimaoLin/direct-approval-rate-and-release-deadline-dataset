DESCRIPTION

Adapt the flusher's persistence function for UPR.

As the UPR requires a strict consistency in persisting dirty
items with respect to their by-seq numbers, the flusher should
not look up the hash table to persist the latest value for each
dirty item.

This change should have very significant improvement in SET op/s in the Piper Jefferson server according to the results of code profiling.
Thanks Chiyoung

Chiyoung,

Should I review this? I saw the -1 on verified so I've been holding off.
