DESCRIPTION

Remove potential deadlock from TAP connection map

Now that tap connections may run in all worker threads we may
have a deadlock if we try to release the reference with the
tap connection map locked. Delay the release call until it's
executed by the dispatcher.

Line:473, tapconnmap.cc -> I'm not sure if we still need to collect the list of disconnected tap instances that are not expired yet. We will eventually release their references through TAPConnectionReaperCallback once they are expired.
