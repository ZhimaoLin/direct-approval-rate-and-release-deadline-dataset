DESCRIPTION

Set more appropriate timeouts for basic & dcp tests

As seen on valgrind enabled tests, test time for basic tests
are as follows:
ep-engine_full_eviction_basic .......... Passed 425.09 sec
ep-engine_basic_tests .................. Passed 433.73 sec

- Increasing the timeout for these tests from 400 to 600, so
that they may complete when run with valgrind.
- Also reducing the timeout for dcp tests from 1800 to 1200.
