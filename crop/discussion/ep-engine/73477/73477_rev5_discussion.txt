DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove force param from KVBucket::deleteItem and VBucket::deleteItem

Force param in these functions is always passed as false. Also the code path
related to force == true leads to a possible exception (never executed and
hence not seen so far). It is better to get rid of this unexecuted code path.

Further, I see that force == true is unused atleast from Watson.
