DESCRIPTION

Make cookie validity check optional for backfill thread.

From 1.7, replication is still going during rebalance, and
therefore, the source node will receive a new connection
request with the list of existing + new vbuckets many times
during rebalance. Whenever the source node processes a new
connection request, it checks the list of vbuckets that require
backfill. This results in creating bunch of backfill threads
with many duplicate vbuckets. We observed that this behavior
caused lots of disk IO, slow or stuck rebalance, and data
loss due to race conditions.

To resolve this issue, we provided the fix
(http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#change,6771), which schedules a
backfill thread for new vbuckets only even if the new connection is
requested with the same name but different cookie. This change
allows us to make cookie validity check optional to support
the incremental backfill in processing many new connection
requests with the same name and different cookies during rebalance.

If vbucket list from the new connection is completely different from
the old connection, any invalid mutations from old backfill will be
simly filtered by eVBucketMigrator.
