Line:412, CMakeLists.txt -> Can we disable it iff valgrind test is enabled?

Line:412, CMakeLists.txt -> We probably can, but I've seen tests take really long with thread sanitizer sometimes as well. Note that this was only added recently to avoid waiting on really-long or possibly hung tests. Since most of the potential deadlocks (if not all) have been addressed already, I think we might as well get rid of this time-limit.

Line:412, CMakeLists.txt -> If the 900 is too short let's increase it - but we shouldn't remove it - what if we get more hangs and the test just sits there for hours on end?
