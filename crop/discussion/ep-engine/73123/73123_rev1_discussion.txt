DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Flusher integration

This commit ties together collections code so that system events
and manifest updates are now applied to storage.

SystemEventFlush tries to capture extra state for a single
run of the flusher for the handling of SystemEvents (writing
special documents and _local docs)

This commit enables set/get only to be collection aware - each
datapath in/out method will need similar "isValid" checks.

EPBucket unit tests enable namespace persistence and check that
collections can be created, written and read from (get/set only)
