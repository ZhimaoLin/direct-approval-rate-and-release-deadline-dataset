DESCRIPTION

Add synchronous EPStoreTests - GetKeyStats tests

Add tests for EPStore::getKeyStats, both for full eviction and value
eviction.

These tests use a new Test base class (EventuallyPersistentStoreTest)
and mocks which set up EPEngine / Store in a synchronous mode, so
normally background tasks can be explicitly triggered as desired.

This allows testing of things like a 2nd request for a non-resident
key (triggering EWOULDBLOCK) without the non-determinism of the
BGFetcher task running in the background and interfering.

Just took a quick glance...

Line:202, src/connmap.cc -> if the destructor of connNotifier_ did stop() you could have used deleted it (or used a unique_ptr...

Line:43, tests/module_tests/ep_unit_tests_main.cc -> seems unrelated, but ;)

Line:202, src/connmap.cc -> True - although I was just trying to do the minimum here (on watson branch) to allow me to safely drive this from unit test.

re: unique_ptr<>, I think we should go on a `new` cleanup post-watson and try to get rid of as many owning raw pointers as possible.

Line:43, tests/module_tests/ep_unit_tests_main.cc -> Let me shuffle it into a different fix I have in flight to improve all the logging here.
