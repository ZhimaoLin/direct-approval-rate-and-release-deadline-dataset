DESCRIPTION

Add synchronous EPStoreTests - GetKeyStats tests

Add tests for EPStore::getKeyStats, both for full eviction and value
eviction.

These tests use a new Test base class (EventuallyPersistentStoreTest)
and mocks which set up EPEngine / Store in a synchronous mode, so
normally background tasks can be explicitly triggered as desired.

This allows testing of things like a 2nd request for a non-resident
key (triggering EWOULDBLOCK) without the non-determinism of the
BGFetcher task running in the background and interfering.

Patch Set 2:

Note that while this does *slightly* touch production code, it only in the simplest sense to allow testing of it - it's mostly test improvements. On that basis I believe this is ok to commit to watson at this time.
