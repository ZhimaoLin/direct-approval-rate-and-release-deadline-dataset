DESCRIPTION

MB-16182: Setting a desired compression ratio for DCP

Set dcp_min_compression_ratio to a default of 0.85.

Upon attempting to compress a document at the producer,
if at the least this much compression isn't achieved,
the producer will ship the document as is.

This paramenter can be changed during run time using
cbepctl.

Line:1275, src/connmap.cc -> I don't think we need to update the min compression ratio for each producer, but instead simply maintain it inside the DCP connection map.

Line:569, configuration.json -> Can we add the validator range? I guess the range should be 0.0 - 1.0

Line:569, configuration.json -> We don't want to add the max as part of the validator here, as this should be able to accept any value greater than 0.0. I will add a validator in ep_engine.cc for this parameter to ensure that we don't accept a value less than 0.0.
