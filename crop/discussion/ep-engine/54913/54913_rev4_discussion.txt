DESCRIPTION

MB-16182: Setting a desired compression ratio for DCP

Set dcp_min_compression_ratio to a default of 0.85.

Upon attempting to compress a document at the producer,
if at the least this much compression isn't achieved,
the producer will ship the document as is.

This paramenter can be changed during run time using
cbepctl.

(3 comments)

Agree that we should impose an absolute minimum size before attempting compression, which I think we can choose empirically with some benchmarking. However I'm ok for that to go into a subsequent patch.

Line:1278, src/connmap.cc -> Can simplify this to a range-based for:

 for (auto& kv : map_) {

Line:4711, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> std::to_string() has an overload for float type, you can just use that.

Line:488, src/connmap.h -> Could you add a comment describing this function please.
