DESCRIPTION

MB-16434: In setDead release streamMutex before cleaning up stream buffer

To avoid lock order inversion in DCP passive stream we must release streamMutex
before acquiring bufMutex. This is because while processing incoming mutations
on dcp consumer we acquire bufMutex first and then streamMutex.
