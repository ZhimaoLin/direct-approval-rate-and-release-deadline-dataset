DESCRIPTION

MB-16434: During PassiveStream::setDead release streamMutex before cleaning up stream buf

To avoid lock order inversion we must release streamMutex before acquiring bufMutex. This is because while processing incoming mutations on dcp consumer we acquire bufMutex first and then streamMutex.
