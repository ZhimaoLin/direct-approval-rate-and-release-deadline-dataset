Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:4838, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please prefix with the method name (same below).

Line:4838, src/ep_engine.cc -> Prefer "vb:%" (no space) - easier to grep for (and consistent with logging spec).

Line:2265, src/vbucket.cc -> As before, remove the space.

Line:2266, src/vbucket.cc -> Style: Personally I'd also "attach" the label to the value - i.e. "cookie:%p" for consistency and to aid in grepping.

Line:6727, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Not sure it's worth providing an aggregate stat for active+pending+replica here (I've not done that for the other other ephemeral stats, and we already have a large number of stats).

Line:6727, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> You mean, no aggregate stat at all ? or just no (active + pending + replica) ?
Actually now, I prefer no aggregate at all

Line:6727, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Yeah, just drop this one. The individual (active_, pending_, replica_) should be sufficient.
