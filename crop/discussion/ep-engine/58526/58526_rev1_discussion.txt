DESCRIPTION

Fix ep_testsuite.cc test_set

This test became broken in 3.0.x as we added tasks and the flusher
appears to run more than once, breaking the (invalid) test assertions.

The fix was added in commit fa17728, which is not the correct home.
Now that fa17728 was reverted the fix is lost but the test can still
fail.

This commit brings the fix into its own commit ensuring the test
does not fail.
