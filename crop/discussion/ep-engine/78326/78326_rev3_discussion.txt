DESCRIPTION

Minimise inclusion of 'item.h'

Remove unnecessary inclusions of item.h, instead use forward decls or
the more specific headers which a file actually needs.

To allow some removals to occur, un-inline some methods as to remove
the need for the definition of Item from other header files.
