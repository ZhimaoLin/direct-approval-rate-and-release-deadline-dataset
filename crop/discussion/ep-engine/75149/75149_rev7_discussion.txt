DESCRIPTION

VBucket::getNumNonResidentItems: remove unnecessary arg

Remove the 'policy' argument from VBucket::getNumNonResidentItems() -
the vBucket itself knows the current eviction policy.

This also has a knock-on effect to the VBucketCountVisitor which no
longer needs a reference to EPEngine :)
