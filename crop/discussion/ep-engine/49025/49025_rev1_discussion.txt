DESCRIPTION

Fix linker (Ubuntu12.04) error in NotifyFlusherCB::callback()

Move the definition of NotifyFlusherCB::callback() from kvshard.h to
kvshard.cc so users of the header file aren't forced to link in kvshard.cc.

Fixes a linker error when building on Ubuntu 12.04:

    CMakeFiles/ep-engine_defragmenter_test.dir/src/checkpoint.cc.o: In function KVShard::getBucket(unsigned short) const'
    ep-engine/src/kvshard.h:170: undefined reference to \`KVShard::getBucket(unsigned short) const'
