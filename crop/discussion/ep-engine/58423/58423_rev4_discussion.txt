Line:173, src/ep.h -> Please note the usage of old-style enum as opposed to enum class. I couldn't find a trivial way of combining options from enum classes. If anyone is aware of a better way, I am open for suggestions.

Line:300, src/ep_engine.h -> I don't think you need the static cast for a single NONE option.

Line:173, src/ep.h -> I'm fine with what you have, but a more type-safe alternative which you may prefer is to create a simple helper struct with bit-fields - this also centralises the default options a user gets. For example:

 struct GetOptions {
     bool track_statistics : 1;
     bool queue_bg_fetch : 1;
     bool honor_states : 1;
     bool track_reference : 1;
     bool delete_temp : 1;

     // Default constructor can specify whatever you want the default
     // options to be:
     GetOptions()
       : track_statistics(true), 
         queue_bg_fetch(...),
         ...

 };

This also has the advantage that you have a central place (the constructor) which can check if the options set specified is valid - for example in future it might be the case that some options are mutually exclusive.

Line:2060, src/ep.cc -> You can make this const (assuming it's not changed in the function).

Line:2073, src/ep.cc -> Given you're "in" this code we can improve the readability of this quite a bit - have a single if (honorStates) { ... predicate around all of then, and then switch on the vb->getState().

Line:2075, src/ep.cc -> make const
