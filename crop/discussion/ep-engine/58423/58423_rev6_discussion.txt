Line:180, src/ep.h -> I think this should be 0x0010

Line:2074, src/ep.cc -> Minor suggestion: I think we can get the vbucket state once and then use switch statements

Line:180, src/ep.h -> Agreed. Our you could just create a bitfield type as I suggested and let the compiler manage all this stuff ;)

Line:180, src/ep.h -> I shall address that in a separate patch. If this is satisfactory enough, I wish to merge to unblock Abhinav, so that he can enable the full eviction tests for master.

Line:2074, src/ep.cc -> I am getting vbucket state once. But case statement only allow constant expression but disallowedState is a variable. Hence I am keeping the behaviour as is.
