DESCRIPTION

Add defragmenter_test to list of tests

ep-engine_defragmenter_test was incorrectly not added as a test (via
ADD_TEST), hence was not run as part of `make test`.

Also change hash table number of locks to 47, to match
configuration.json (and to avoid a warning from ThreadSanitizer about
too many recursive locks).
