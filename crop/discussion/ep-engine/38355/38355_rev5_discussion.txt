DESCRIPTION

MB-11361: Implement upr noop command

The upr noop command is used to detect dead connections. It is sent
once every 3 minutes and waits 3 minutes for a response. If no
response comes in that time the connection is deemed to be dead. The
noop command is only sent when flow control is turned on by the
consumer.

Line:188, src/upr-producer.cc -> Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the 120 time limit used below supposed to be 180 as per upr_noop_interval ?

Line:396, src/upr-producer.cc -> Add lastSendTime to the stats as well?
