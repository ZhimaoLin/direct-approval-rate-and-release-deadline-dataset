DESCRIPTION

MB-11361: Implement upr noop command

The upr noop command is used to detect dead connections. It is sent
once every 3 minutes and waits 3 minutes for a response. If no
response comes in that time the connection is deemed to be dead. The
noop command is only sent when flow control is turned on by the
consumer.
