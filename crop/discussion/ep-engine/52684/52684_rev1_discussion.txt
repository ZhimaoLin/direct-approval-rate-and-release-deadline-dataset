This has a build dependency on memcached change http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/52685.
Will retrigger the test once the memcached change is submitted

Line:6062, src/ep_engine.cc -> we should move this over to the packet validators in memcached for watson (we've got a standard framework for that there)

Line:6066, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think it would be better with:

    vbucket_state_t reqState = static_cast<vbucket_state_t>(0);
    if (req->message.header.request.extlen) {
        ....
    }

Line:6100, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Cleaner (and more obvious) to compare to the value you expect than relying on implicit cast to bool (and in fact MSVC can warn about that).

Line:673, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Note: now we have C++11 you can just do:

 std::string vb_stat_seqno("vb_" + std::to_string(vb_start + i) + ":high_seqno");

Line:13074, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Similarly here:


 std::string key("key" + std::to_string(i));

Line:776, src/ep_engine.h -> Nit: I don't really mind what style of indentation we decide to use for code, but we should at least be consistent - the rest of this file appears to align to the same column as the previous line.

Line:644, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Can the 4 be derived from a type (sizeof(struct X) or predefined constant? I'm really not keen on 'magic numbers' in the code.

Line:6100, src/ep_engine.cc -> The problem here is we do not have a vbucket state indicating "any vb state". Is there any other elegant way this can be done ?

Line:776, src/ep_engine.h -> So here I have to choose between "previous column alignment" and "exceeding 80 chars per line"

Line:776, src/ep_engine.h -> So I'd (personally) go with a line continuation indented to 4/8 spaces - e.g.


 ENGINE_ERROR_CODE getAllVBucketSequenceNumbers(
         const void *cookie, protocol_binary_request_header *request,
         ADD_RESPONSE response);


(i.e. if you're going to wrap the line, might as well give yourself a decent amount of space to write in :)

(To be clear I don't expect you to change this here, just an idea for the future)...
