DESCRIPTION

Properly check the perisistence seqno

If we are in the backfill phase then we need to make sure that we
get the persistence seqno based on where we left off in the backfill
queue. If it is grabbed from the checkpoint queues then it will be
incorrect.

Line:2540, src/ep.cc -> If we remove this, then checkpoint_persistence command might not work because we update it in getLastPersistedSeqno().
