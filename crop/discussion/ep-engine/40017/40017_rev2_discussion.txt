DESCRIPTION

MB-11725: Place rollback task on the writer dispatcher

The rollback task writes a header on success and as a result we need
to make sure that this doesn't race with other writer tasks. We also
need to keep in mind that the cached vbucket states in couch kvstore
are only valid for the rw kvstore.
