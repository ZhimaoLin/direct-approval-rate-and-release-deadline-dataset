Line:965, src/kvstore.h -> method

Line:2215, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Isn't a CouchstoreManifest a std::String.  Do you not need to call c_str() - or does the cast to char* do the right thing?

Line:2216, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> why do we -1 - is it to handle null termination?

Line:518, src/warmup.cc -> In ephemeral_vb.cc, you moved first parameter up to be on same line,
however here you are moving down to be on next line.

Line:488, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> present

will rebase and update soon

Line:30, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Done

Line:31, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Done

Line:2215, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> nope it's a const char*, this needs to be changed to const_cast and is needed because couchstore doesn't use const properly

Line:2216, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> sizeof returns the allocation size which includes the null terminator. Using sizeof here is preferable as the compiler can calculate the strlen without us calling strlen

Line:518, src/warmup.cc -> this is what clang-format gives
