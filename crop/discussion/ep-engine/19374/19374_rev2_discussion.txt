DESCRIPTION

MB-6143 Use JSON.org JSON validator

We don't need to actually parse JSON bodies, and the cJSON parser is not

other problem cases.

Patch Set 2:

I've added Dipti as we're incorporated 3rd party code.

And 'must be used for good and not evil' was found to be problematic license. Not sure if it's ok for us or not.

Patch Set 2:

Yeah, Damien was hesitant about that too, this should already be on Dipti's radar.
