DESCRIPTION

MB-6143 Use JSON.org JSON validator

We don't need to actually parse JSON bodies, and the cJSON parser is not
strict enough, as it will accept JSON values followed by garbage, and
other problem cases.

Patch Set 5:

This should reject anything that doesn't fit the UTF-8 encoding scheme. It will still let stuff past like suboptimal encodings or other bad codepoint values, however our view indexer/V8, I've verified, will not decode those in strings, and replace them with codepoint 0xFFFD.

I think this is fine, since we've now decided to only use the JSONness flag for determining whether to pass the value to the indexer, and in all cases where we're moving data around we now err on the side of keeping the value bit-for-bit the same as what was inserted. So, this is probably the behavior we want, as it will still allow such things to still be indexed, but they will be prevented from doing anything sneaky.

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, approved

great. I'd consider one additional improvement. In order to encourage compiler to inline this by-char validation function we can make it static. As well as everything else in this module except our entry point.
