DESCRIPTION

MB-6143 Use JSON.org JSON validator

We don't need to actually parse JSON bodies, and the cJSON parser is not
strict enough, as it will accept JSON values followed by garbage, and
other problem cases.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

See inline. Plus:

*) I think by-char validation is going to be somewhat slow. It'll involve all those PIC calls. Having a small function that validates a chunk of memory inside that json validator file should help. Particularly it'll allow inlining of by-char validation function.

*) I think we should check for valid utf8 in strings. Otherwise people will be unable to use them in our views. There's also all kinds of undefined behavior for invalid things such as 0xC0 0xA2 (which naive decoder will decode to  double quotes causing problems to parse this stuff)
