DESCRIPTION

Fix issue that caused items to be re-replicated through upr

We us the lowest sequence number in a checkpoint as the sequence
number for a checkpoint start message. During the setOpenCheckpointId
call we were resetting the sequence number to something higher and
this caused problems for sequence number replication. I also
refactored the sequence number registration so that we don't send
the item at the start sequence number.
