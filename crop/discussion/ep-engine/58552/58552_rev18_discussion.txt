Patch Set 18:

As an aside, given the pain and suffering we've had with the stream lock issues, it might be prudent to split this merge into two steps:

1. First merge the sherlock-only changes into master (i.e. these patches):

| | * | 9a7951d 2016-01-07 | MB-17289: Update existing temp item CAS to incoming CAS in deleteWithMeta [Bobby Buck]
| | * | cc2ace7 2016-01-05 | MB-17231: conditionally delete temp items in get API [Bobby Buck]

Those should be trivial to merge, and get the bug fixes into watson sooner.

2. Then merge the subsequent, originally 3.x changes - i.e. this branch:

| | *   59a37de 2016-01-12 | Merge remote-tracking branch 'Piper Jefferson/3.0.x' into 'couchbase/sherlock' (HEAD, couchbase/sherlock, sherlock) [Jim WNathalie Landryer]

This also has the advantage that we keep small steps in history, meaning things like `git bisect` have an intermediate patch they can check out. 

For example this was an issue for me last week, as the APPEND regression was actually in the middle of a large, complex merge - git bisect only got me to within 12 or so patches, and I had to do a bunch of Adrianna Holmesal work (i.e. backport ep_perfsuite to a 3.x-style world) to eventually track down the offending patch.

@Dave I could try and split up the merge, but given that we're almost underway here: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/58557/, I'll just wait till Monday. If its still not complete by then, I'll split this merge like you suggested.
