Line:378, src/dcp/stream.cc -> This had to be done to avert a potential lock inversion as identified by thread sanitizer. Note that this should't cause a race with any other thread trying to access this very active steam because:
- This is a front end thread, meaning no other memcached thread can access this connection at the same time.
- As the state of the stream is TAKEOVER_WAIT, there cannot be an IO thread that is performing backfill or any other job for this stream that could contend with this function.
