DESCRIPTION

Skip tests which are not applicable when warmup is disabled

In preparation for adding Ephemeral buckets, update the existing tests
to skip any tests which are not applicable when Warmup is disabled.

(Ephemeral buckets will not have warmup, as there will be no disk
files to warmup from).

Line:2712, src/ep.cc -> I believe it's essentially bogus - resetting a bucket shouldn't have any affect on the disk queue size (I saw some later tests fail due to it).
