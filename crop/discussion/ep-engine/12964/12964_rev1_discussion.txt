Patch Set 1:

Is it possible to just have a SET_PARAM here and parameterize the parameters?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Thanks Dustin for quick review. Yeah, that's a good point. It would be better to have a single command "SET_PARAM" and sub-parameterize it.

That's an awesome link that visualizes your comments :)
