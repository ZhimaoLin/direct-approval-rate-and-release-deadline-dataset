DESCRIPTION

Estimating cummulative flushtimes & committimes

Calculate the cumulativeFlushTime and cumulativeCommitTime
with the same granularity of milli-seconds.

Use gethrtime() to set the flush_start time, as gethrtime()
is used to set the end, which is used to estimate transaction
time for an item. Also the same start and end times can be
used to calculate the cumulativeFlushTime as well.
