DESCRIPTION

mb-19033 Allow connections of the same name

It was thought that connections would not exist
in the connection map with the same name.

However the view code does create connections of
the same name.  As we index on the connection object
(cookie) as opposed to the name, we can relax the
constraints to allow connections of the same name.
