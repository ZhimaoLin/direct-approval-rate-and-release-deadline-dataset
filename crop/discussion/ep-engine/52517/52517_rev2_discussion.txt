Line:211, src/dcp-stream.cc -> There are two separate operations which are non-atomic right? Will it work if say 2 threads race to decrement the readyQSize and both of them pass the first check won't the readyQSize still hit some very large value then?

Line:211, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Can we just do readyQsize.load() just once as opposed to doing it 3 times in this call?

Line:211, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Good catch. Will do it only once

Line:211, src/dcp-stream.cc -> decrReadyQSize() is always called with "streamMutex" lock acquired.
readyQ operations are always called with "streamMutex" lock acquired and this is called after a readyQ.pop().

I chose to use atomic rather than using "streamMutex" lock for getReadyQSize().
