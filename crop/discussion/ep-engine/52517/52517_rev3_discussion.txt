I have some comments on this. Please hold merging it.

Line:621, docs/stats.org -> Please rename this param to a more intuitive one like 'ready_queue_memory'

Line:660, docs/stats.org -> Same as above comment.

Line:152, src/dcp-stream.h -> As updating this stat is guarded by the mutex, I don't think we need to use atomic variable. It is okay to have some dirty reads for stats call. Note that atomic operations are not cheap and we should avoid them if possible.

Line:217, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I don't think we need to log it as warning level. This is not a critical case for DCP operations.

Line:340, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I think it would be better to provide a separate function for pushing an item into the ready queue and updating the memory overhead stat. Otherwise, it can be buggy because someone might forget to update the stat after pushing an item into the queue.

Line:581, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Same comment as above.
