DESCRIPTION

MB-21916: StoredDocKey - A DocKey container and test code

This commit introduces StoredDocKey - a container to replace
our use of std::string for document keys. The container can be used
in std::map/set etc... and allows for us to store all items that are
needed to reference a document.

- the key (and the key size)
- the document namespace (a critical piece for Collections)

StoredDocKey will store a key of n-bytes in an n+1 std::string.
The extra byte is where we store the DocNamespace.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Line:93, tests/module_tests/storeddockey_test.cc -> Might also be worth testing the positive case - that the same namespaces+key hash equal.

Line:48, src/storeddockey.h -> If we don't have something similar elsewhere, probably worth adding a static_assert that sizeof(DocNamespace) equals sizeof(char).
