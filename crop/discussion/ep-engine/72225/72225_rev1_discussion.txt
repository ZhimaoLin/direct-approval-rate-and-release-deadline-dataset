DESCRIPTION

Replace bare owning pointer with unique pointer

ItemAccessScanner owns a MutationLog, which can be nullable. Best to
make this a unqiue_ptr to better fit the desired semantics.

Replaces checks to NULL with nullptr to make these safer and show intent
more clearly.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Is there an MB for this? If so please include it in the subject.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> No specific MB for this afaik, just saw it and it looked like an easy fix. Perhaps loosely related to MB-22015, should I mark this commit against that?

Line:67, src/access_scanner.cc -> unique_ptr has a well defined boolean conversion so this line could become:

    if (log && v->isResident()) {
