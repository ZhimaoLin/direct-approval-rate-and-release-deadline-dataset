DESCRIPTION

MB-20623: Remove unused fields from temporary warmup data structures

Warmup currently creates three data structures (per vBucket) in memory
when warming up using the access.log:

1. A map of keys -> sequence number at the time the access log was
   generated - MutationLogHarvester::committed

2. A list of {key, hashTable_seqNo} pairs -
   MutationLogHarvester::apply::fetches

3. A map of key -> VBucketBGFetchItem for every key in the list above
- batchWarmupCallback::items2fetch

There are a number of inefficiencies in this implementation, the first
of which is that we record sequence numbers in the first two data
structures which are never actually used - the final BGfetch doesn't
need them.

This patch therefore removes the recording of sequence numbers. This
changes the data structures to:

1. MutationLogHarvester::committed - a set of keys (per vBucket).
2. MutationLogHarvester::apply::fetches - a vector of keys.

Results in a reduction in the memory used by these temporary warmup
data structures - from 4356MB to 3876MB (11%) for the following
workload:

* 1 bucket, 10,000MB quota, 1 node.
* 30M items, 300bytes each. Dataset generated by:
