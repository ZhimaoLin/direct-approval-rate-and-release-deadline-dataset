If this is a consistent issue for just this test then I think you should create an augmented version of cb::io::rmrf in platform (which rmdb uses) that will throw a std::system_error with the errno as that will give you more information on the root cause.

Line:7227, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I'd be tempted to wrap this in its own function so that we can use it elsewhere.

Part of me thinks you could stick this in rmdb itself but that might hide other underlying intermittent issues.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This title is slightly misleading as it implies that it was doing infinite retry before this patch.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> atmost isn't a word, needs a space ("at most") :P

+1 for Will's suggestion to make io::rmrf expose the error as to why it's failing - I believe it should always be possible to remove a directory on posix.

Line:7226, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> A 1 second sleep is a long time in a unit test - I'd go for something like 10ms.
