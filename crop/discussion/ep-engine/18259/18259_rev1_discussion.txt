DESCRIPTION

MB-5871 Fix wrong access scanner sleep time value change listenner

Whenever alog_sleep_time is changed, another instance of listener
would be created as part of new access scanner. This would linger
around while its access scanner had been released. Change to use
EPStoreValueChangeListener and create it only once.
