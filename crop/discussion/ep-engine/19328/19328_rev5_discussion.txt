DESCRIPTION

MB-6142: Unknown ops have functions calls in ep_testsuite

When doing unkown operations we would typically construct a
packet in the testcase and then call the function. This change
adds functions for unknown operations that can be called so
that the test writer doesn't have to deal with the details of
creating the packets and sending them.
