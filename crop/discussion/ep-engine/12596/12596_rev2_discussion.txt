DESCRIPTION

Fix to the deadlock between restore process and flusher.

When ep-engine is running in restore-mode and keys are getting
restored, flusher process the incoming delete operations
in callback(int &value) method. The addUnlessThere() method
and callback(int &value) uses the hashtable bucket mutex and
restore mode mutex, restore.mutex. The order in which the mutexes
are acquired is wrong in addUnlessThere() method. This patch corrects
the order of acquiring the mutexes.
