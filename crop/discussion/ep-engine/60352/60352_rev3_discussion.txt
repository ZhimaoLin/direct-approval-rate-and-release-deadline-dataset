DESCRIPTION

MB-17889: No notify from streamRequest

The 3.1.3 (i.e. before the DCP churn) didn't ever notify from
streamRequest, so that is reverted and helps to bring
view_query latency down (view engine is constantly creating
streams).

A second tweak is to not call stream->next whilst holding
the streamMutex. This can block streamRequest again
affecting the view-engine's DCP stream requests.
