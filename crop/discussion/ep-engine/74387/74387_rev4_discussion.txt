DESCRIPTION

Shink SerialisedDocKey with one byte

Note that this saving doesn't really matter as all keys
_must_ be at least one byte long, but the size of the
struct cause the alignment of the owning struct to change.

By keeping the size correct we'll report the correct number
of bytes used for internal overhead.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

This will conflict with http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/74532/. Should be possible to rebase it on top of that - we can still remove the one byte from SerializedDocKey's representation.

Patch Set 4:

When is that planned to be merged? I don't really need this patch with the referenced change there is 3 bytes left in the struct due to alignment and I can use one of those for the datatype...

Abandoned

keys must be > 1 byte (and now it won't cause alignement problems in stored value so that we got to put the datatype in storedvalue...
