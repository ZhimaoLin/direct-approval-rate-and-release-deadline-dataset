DESCRIPTION

Shink SerialisedDocKey with one byte

Note that this saving doesn't really matter as all keys
_must_ be at least one byte long, but the size of the
struct cause the alignment of the owning struct to change.

By keeping the size correct we'll report the correct number
of bytes used for internal overhead.
