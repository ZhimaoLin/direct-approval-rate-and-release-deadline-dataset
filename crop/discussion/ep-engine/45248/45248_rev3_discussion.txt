Line:73, docs/protocol/del_with_meta.md -> We'd still have backward compatibility issues, as in pre-sherlock we return EINVAL if extlen is not 24 or 28.

Line:111, docs/protocol/del_with_meta.md -> Is the actual extended-meta-data's length still going to count towards extlen? If yes, I don't see the point of having the nmeta field. If no, bodylen (which is calculated as extlen + keylen + vallen), will somehow need to account for this extra length?

Line:73, docs/protocol/del_with_meta.md -> I might be missing something but would go-xdcr actually populate these extra fields if the destination node is pre-sherlock?
