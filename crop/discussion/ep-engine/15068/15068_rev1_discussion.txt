Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

As we have a blocker in ep_engine for the QA tests on 2.0, we will NOT merge any changes into ep_engine except for the fixes to the blocker at this time.

We will merge your pending XDCR changes once we have a set of XDCR unit tests from you.
