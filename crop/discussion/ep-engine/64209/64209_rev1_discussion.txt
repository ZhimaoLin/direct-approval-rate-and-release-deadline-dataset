Line:4462, src/ep_engine.cc -> Can you create a testcase for this please? I'm thinking of something like making a stats call for whatever group addSeqnoVbStats() is from, and verifying that we have a value for all the expected stat names.

Dan: I'm going to submit your fix today (give how close to RC build we are) 

Could you raise a separate Task (against 4.5.1) for the testcase please?

Line:4462, src/ep_engine.cc -> Given how close we are getting to the RC build (and hence need to get all issues closed), I think we can submit this as-is (i.e. without the testcase) and then follow-up with the testcase in a separate MB.
