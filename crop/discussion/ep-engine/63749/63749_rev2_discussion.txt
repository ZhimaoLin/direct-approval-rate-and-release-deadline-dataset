DESCRIPTION

MB-18670: ep_perfsuite: Fix end of DCP/TAP stream calculation

A number of ep_perfsuite tests check for a specific number of TAP/DCP
messages to be received, based on the number of mutations. However we
have seen occasional test failures in these tests, similar to:

    Test failed: `Didn't receive expected number of mutations' (num_mutations <= static_cast<size_t>(ha->itemCount))

The problem is how DCP stream (running in the background) is setup,
and how it detects the end of the test. Currently the code tries to
predict what sequence number it will see up to (i.e the total mutation
/ deletion count) when the stream is created, and once the stream ends
it compares how many mutations it has received with the expected
number. It uses a simple calculation of 3x the number of keys as the
expected number of operations (one per ADD, REPLACE and DELETE).

The first problem with this approach is it fails to account for the
updates created by the recently-added APPEND operations - we append
multiple times to a single key, which creates higher sequence numbers
than expected. The net effect of this is that what it thinks is the
last sequence number (should be the last document getting deleted) is
actually one of the append operations. As a consequence (and due to
potential de-duplicaiton we do not always see as many mutations as
expected.

I initially looked at solving this by fixing the calculation of how
many updates will occur. This worked for DCP (where we have an
accurate sequence number) however the TAP tests do not have an
accurate sequence number, and so we cannot predict how many mutations
will occur.

The chosen solution is to instead create a sentinal mutation at the
end of the load phase, and have the DCP & TAP clients simply check a
mutations' key against this marker and stop when they encounter it.
