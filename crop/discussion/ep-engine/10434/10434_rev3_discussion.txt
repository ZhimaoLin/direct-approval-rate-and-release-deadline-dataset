Line:1075, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> An item's body and metadata such flags and expiration are meaningless in the context of a delete operation.

This needs fixing, right?

Line:1075, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> Yes, you are correct here. Alaiksey originally told me that delete is the same packet as set, but informed me yesterday that delete actually has no flags or expiration field. I am working on updating this change set to reflect that new information.
