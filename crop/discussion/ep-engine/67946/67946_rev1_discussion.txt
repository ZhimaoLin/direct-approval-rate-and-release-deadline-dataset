DESCRIPTION

MB-20134: Fix race in test_expiry_pager_settings (gmtime_r)

When calculating expiry pager adjusted time values, use the
thread-safe variant (gmtime_r) so the test doesn't conflict with the
ep_engine code.

Also use std::chrono to perform the time manipulaton (which handles
any modulus of minutes -> hours etc).
