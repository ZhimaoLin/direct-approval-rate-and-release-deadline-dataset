DESCRIPTION

MB-5278 Drop TAP BG fetched items if a connection is newly created

TAP BG fetch jobs can be still in the dispatcher queue when their
corresponding TAP connection is completely removed. If a TAP
connection is newly created for the same client, those TAP BG
fetched items should be dropped.
