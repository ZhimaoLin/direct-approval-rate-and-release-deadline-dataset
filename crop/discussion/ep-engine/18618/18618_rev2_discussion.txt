Line:572, stored-value.hh -> I think it is probably cleaner to put CAS change in the caller rather than del() here.  The caller knows it is a normal deletion or delWithMeta(). The del() here is a generic function and should not take care of CAS issues. 

Also, is it better to get a brand new CAS here? What is the point to increment the CAS for a normal deletion? CAS is a token, it is not meant to be incremented/decremented. We grab a new CAS for other operations, seems not quite consistent to me to increment it here.

Line:389, stored-value.cc -> Imagine that we have a bunch of temp items and 0 normal items. That would mean that the temp items wouldn't get evicted when the item/expiry pager runs.
