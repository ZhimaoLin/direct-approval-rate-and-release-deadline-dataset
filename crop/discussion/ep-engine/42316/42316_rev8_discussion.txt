DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Pause backfills when after 'x' of items or bytes are read

All dcp backfills are will be paused after reading 4MB or 4096 items
and if any other backfills are scheduled then those will be run before
the original backfill is run again. This change allows us to interleave
backfills so that we no longer have to run a backfill for a single
vbucket to completion before starting the next one.

(5 comments)

Line:104, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I'm not sure if we need this special check for "0". We can simply use "if" clause below.

Line:114, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Why this function is empty?

Line:161, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Does this work with 20MB item?

Line:207, src/dcp-stream.cc -> This doesn't include the memory overhead from key string. You can simply use "itm->size();"

Line:295, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Same as above.

Line:104, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I did this in case the user sets the scan buffer to less that 20MB. This first clause will allow an item larger than the scan size to be added to the buffer only if the buffer is empty.

Line:114, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I'll remove it, but basically there isn't anything to decrement at this point. That comes in the next change.

Line:161, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I think I'll have up the default buffer size, but this is still ok because we allow an item of any size to be added to the buffer when the buffer size is 0.

Line:207, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Done

Line:295, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Done
