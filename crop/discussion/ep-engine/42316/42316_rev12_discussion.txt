DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Pause backfills when after 'x' of items or bytes are read

All dcp backfills are will be paused after reading 4MB or 4096 items
and if any other backfills are scheduled then those will be run before
the original backfill is run again. This change allows us to interleave
backfills so that we no longer have to run a backfill for a single
vbucket to completion before starting the next one.
