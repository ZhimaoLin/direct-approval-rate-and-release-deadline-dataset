DESCRIPTION

MB-11809: Don't use last_by_seqno when checking for sending marker ack

The last_by_seqno variable is set when an item is received and
buffered. As a result it is possible that the last_by_seqno might
be different than the mutation seqno we are surrenty processing. This
can lead to no sending an ack when we should.
