DESCRIPTION

Unit tests: Rearrange KVBucket test fixtures

Rearrange the various KVBucket test fixtures to have names which more
accurately reflect what they do, and make room for subsequent
Ephemeral-only tests:

* Rename SingleThreadedKVBucketTest to STParameterizedBucketTest -
  this 'frees' up the SingleThreadedKVBucketTest name to be used as
  the base class of single-threaded tests which can operate on any
  KVBucket subclass.

* Rename SingleThreadedEPStoreTest to SingleThreadedKVBucketTest -
  this more accurately reflects what this class does - it's a common
  base class for KVBucket tests running in a single-threaded mode.
