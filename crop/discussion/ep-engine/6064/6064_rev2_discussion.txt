DESCRIPTION

MB-3772 Don't schedule backfill from disk if not necessary.

If the resident ratio for a given vbucket is high and beyond the
configured threshold, we do not need to kick off backfill from
disk, but instead only do backfill from memory.

I moved the definition of backfill-related classes to the beginning of the source file.

The actual changes of backfill-related classes in
ep_engine.cc are:

line 1000 - 1009

line 1065 - 1074
line 1153

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

Ideally I'd like the code to be moved to it's own file, but that's a task for another rainy day...
