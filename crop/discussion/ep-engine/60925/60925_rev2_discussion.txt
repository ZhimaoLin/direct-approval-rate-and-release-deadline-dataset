DESCRIPTION

Remove AtomicValue and Mutex defines

We already removed our own custom AtomicValue and Mutex classes when
we moved to C++11; replacing them with #defines to std::atomic and
std::mutex respectively. This patch completes that changover, using
the underlying types directly so it's easier to see what is actually
being used.
