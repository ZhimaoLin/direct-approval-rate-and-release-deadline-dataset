DESCRIPTION

MB-3424: Tap sends only keys when keys only flag is specified

This fix allows tap streams to send keys only. Note that this
solves the problem, but not in an elegant ways. Sending keys
only should not require us to do backfill when in DGM, but
we do backfill anyways.

The reason for this is that we support changing tap streams
mid-stream. This means a user could ask for keys only and then
later request values be sent on that same stream in the middle
of the process. As a result we may need to access the values that
are on disk at any time.

In the future tap should be more dynamic to allow this to perform
better. This future improvement is filed under  MB-4556.

Following the info on bug MB-3424, this looks like it's meant for 1.8.1.  If that's incorrect (and this is actually meant for 1.8.0), please wave the flag.

I think it looks about right (though I'm a bit afraid of the small code duplication).

I'm kind of wondering if it'd be difficult to reuse the same empty blob instead of recreating them so much (though it likely doesn't matter all that much where we have a good enough malloc).  Not very important, but if it's easy, it'd be still yet less code duplication and less work on the allocator.

Line:1968, ep_engine.cc -> I think I'd rather see a ternary here setting the value to NULL or the value based on sendKeysOnly().  That's a bit too much duplicated code to get wrong in one place at some point in the future.
