Line:50, src/executorthread.cc -> Wouldn't it be better if we can set the names correctly while creating the threads?

Line:50, src/executorthread.cc -> It would be... I'm just afraid someone have scripts that use the name, and I didn't want to "break" them...

Line:50, src/executorthread.cc -> I agree with Sriram - it's non-obvious if the function changes the name passed in. I'd rather we fix the instances in memcached instead.

Line:50, src/executorthread.cc -> I mean remove this patch and update all the callers / creators of this class to use names with underscores for name separation.

For example, with the current change if I try to grep the code for a thread name I see (e.g. "aux_io_" I won't find anything, as the actual code will call it with "aux io "

Line:50, src/executorthread.cc -> Ok, so no one have scripts that asks for those stats? then its perfectly fine by me :-)
