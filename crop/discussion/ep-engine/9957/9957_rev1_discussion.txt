DESCRIPTION

WIP: observe_registry.h

This file outlines the basic way I will be holding my observe sets.
The plan is to just get the table working for now. For example, observe
a key, call stats and have that key come up in the stats and say nothing
has changed, then unobserve it. As soon as I get this working I will
begin adding in all of the callbacks.

Line:48, observe_registry.hh -> I debated over what to have that return and after just adding the hook for the stats command I definitely don't like that return type anymore. A map<string, string> might be better where the first string is the key name and the second is something like "235 1 persisted".

Anyways what you should take away from this function is that it will be called to get the state of the keys in the observe set for the stats command. I will fine tune it during the actual implementation (It will not be a string though).
