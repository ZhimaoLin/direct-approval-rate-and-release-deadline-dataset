DESCRIPTION

WIP: observe_registry.h

This file outlines the basic way I will be holding my observe sets.
The plan is to just get the table working for now. For example, observe
a key, call stats and have that key come up in the stats and say nothing
has changed, then unobserve it. As soon as I get this working I will
begin adding in all of the callbacks.
