> This is probably worth pushing to 3.0.x.

So I think there's minimal benefit to porting to 3.x - this is only a unit test so the actual memory leaks in it "don't matter" - the test quickly shuts itself down and cleans up.

*If* we actually ran Valgrind against 3.x then it would have benefit - as running Valgrind against this (and ensuring the test code itself was free of issues) would allow us to detect any leaks in ep.so, however this isn't the case.

Additionally I don't think we can get this trivially leak-free even if we wanted - the methods to  destroy a created engine instance don't exist on 3.x (Jim added them iirc as part of 4.x work to get Valgrind clean), so ultimately I think we should just keep this on master.
