DESCRIPTION

MB-5102 Don't assert for dead vbuckets in CouchKVStore::saveDocs

When rebalance out is performed, there could be a short time
window on existing nodes, which dead vbuckets on those nodes are
reactivated immediately before the ns-server janitor clears them
up. Consequently, assertion should not be generated for dead
vbuckets in the underlying KV store while persisting items into
those vbuckets.
