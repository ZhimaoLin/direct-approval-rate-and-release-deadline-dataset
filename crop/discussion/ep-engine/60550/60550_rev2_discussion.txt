DESCRIPTION

MB-17086: Test append performance

Update our microbenchmarking code to include append performance.
The append test purposely appends to a single key to grow one
document upto approx 1MiB.

This is highlighting the revAB slow-down when using jemalloc 4.0.4
in the default configuration.
