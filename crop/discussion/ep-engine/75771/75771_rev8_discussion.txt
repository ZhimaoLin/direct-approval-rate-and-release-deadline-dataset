DESCRIPTION

Let DCP log messages look like memcached log messages

The log messages include the connection identifiers first to
allow it to be easily mapped to the events logged by the
core.

example:

2017-03-30T17:53:25.450557+02:00 NOTICE 40: (bucket) DCP (Producer) eq_dcpq:dcpsend - (vb 1023) Creating stream with start seqno 0 and end seqno 18446744073709551615
