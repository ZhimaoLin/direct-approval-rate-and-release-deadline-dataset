DESCRIPTION

MB-5093 populate correct mutation return value

This is the ep-engine side of changes that are necessary to fix
rebalance failure (and data loss afterward) described in MB-5093.

After encountering background fetch or set item failure, CouchKVStore
must examine and return correct error status along with the callback.
This error handling ensures proper handling of failed item in the
upper layer of ep-engine.

GET:
return ENGINE_SUCCESS upon receiving COUCHSTORE_SUCCESS
return ENGINE_ENOMEM upon receiving COUCHSTORE_ALLOC_FAIL
return ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT upon receiving COUHCSTORE_DOC_NOT_FOUND
return ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET upon receiving COUCHSTORE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET
return ENGINE_TMPFAIL - general error case

SET:
return MutationValue[1, itemId(0:1)] upon receiving COUCHSTORE_SUCCESS
return MutationValue[0, -1] upon receiving COUCHSTORE_DOC_NOT_FOUND
return MutationValue[-1, -1] - general error case

DEL:
return MutationValue[1] upon receiving COUCHSTORE_SUCCESS
return MutationValue[0] upon receiving COUCHSTORE_DOC_NOT_FOUND
return MutationValue[-1] - general error case

Note: The mccouch side of changes are being tracked and reviewed in a
separate commit (http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#change,15178).

Line:28, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please use upper letters for const variable names.

Line:236, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> As this error code is not returned from couchstore, we don't need to do any conversion. Simply pass the const variable that you define above.

Line:266, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to do any conversion here as the error code is not actually returned from couchstore.

Line:386, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Same comment as above

Line:1229, ep.cc -> We don't need this extra if statement here. We check the status through assertion below, which makes sense to me.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:28, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Since they are all constant, is it better to use  define like this?

#define MUTATION_FAILED  -1
