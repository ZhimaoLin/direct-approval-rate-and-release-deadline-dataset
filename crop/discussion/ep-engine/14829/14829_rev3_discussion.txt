DESCRIPTION

[MB-5074] Clear id in SET if the key's metadata bgfetch is pending

While the background fetch for a non-resident/non-existent key is
underway, if we receive a SET that will overwrite the temporary item
created for the background fetch, we must also clear the "id"
attribute of the associated StoredValue object as it no longer
constitutes a temporary item.

Line:1102, stored-value.hh -> Is it still okay to clear id here even if this function returns an error such as "INVALID_CAS"?
