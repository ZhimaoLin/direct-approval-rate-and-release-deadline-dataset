DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-17517: Regenerate CAS for TAP/DCP mutations with invalid CAS

When receiving mutations via TAP or DCP, validate the CAS if invalid
generate a new one.

This is instead of the simply dropping the mutaiton (returning an
error to the producer), as by dropping the mutation we could cause
data loss.

Line:94, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> can checknefn be defined as !checkeqfn (not sure you can do that with #define).  Thereby reducing code duplication?

Line:9614, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> mis-spell of mutations

Line:941, src/ep.cc -> Before returning do we want to log that the cas is invalid?
