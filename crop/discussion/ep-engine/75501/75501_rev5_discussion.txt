DESCRIPTION

MB-23435: [Ephemeral] Add seqlist statistics

Add per-vBucket sequence list statistics for Ephemeral buckets:

* seqlist_count - number of documents in this VBucket's sequence list.

* seqlist_deleted_count - Count of deleted documents in this VBucket's
  sequence list.

* seqlist_high_seqno - High sequence number in sequence list for this
  VBucket. We need to keep track of the highest seqno separately
  because there is a small window wherein the last element of the list
  (though in correct order) does not have a seqno. High seqno is
  monotonically increasing and is reset to a lower value only in case
  of a rollback.

* seqlist_highest_deduped_seqno - Highest de-duplicated sequence
  number in sequence list for this VBucket. We need to this to send
  out point-in-time snapshots in range read. highest_deduped_seqno is
  monotonically increasing and is reset to a lower value only in case
  of a rollback.

* seqlist_read_range_begin - Starting sequence number for this
  VBucket's sequence list read range. Marks the lower bound of
  possible stale documents in the sequence list.

* seqlist_read_range_end - Ending sequence number for this VBucket's
  sequence list read range. Marks the upper bound of possible stale
  documents in the sequence list.

* seqlist_read_range_count - Count of elements for this VBucket's
  sequence list read range (i.e. end - begin).

* seqlist_stale_count - Count of stale documents in this VBucket's
  sequence list.

* seqlist_stale_value_bytes - Number of bytes of stale values in this
  VBucket's sequence list.

* seqlist_stale_metadata_bytes - Number of bytes of stale metadata
  (key + fixed metadata) in this VBucket's sequence list.
