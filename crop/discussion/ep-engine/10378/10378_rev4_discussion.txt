DESCRIPTION

Let mc-kvstore control mccouch write batch jobs

This change allows mc-kvstore to control mcocuch batch jobs as
follows:
- A new engine parameter is added to put the limit on the
number of concurrent workers at the mccouch side.
- Batch size per mcocuch worker is now determined by dividing
the transaction size by the max number of concurrent workers.
- Items from the persistence queue are reordered so that each
mccouch worker works only with a single vbucket database:
 1) Divide the list of items for each vbucket into multiple
    chunks such that each chunk size is equal to the
    above batch size.
 2) Iterate each vbucket and push its current chunk into the
    outgoing queue. Remove the current chunk from each vbucket.
 3) Repeat step 2 until all the chunks are visited.

    For example, suppose that the persistence queue currently has
    (vb0,k1)...(v0,k2000)
    (v1,k2001)...(v1,k4000)...
    (v7,k14001)...(v7,k16000)

    The batch size is 1000.

    After reordering, the persistence queue will have
    (vb0,k1)...(vb0,k1000)
    (vb1,k2001)...(vb1,k3000)...
    (vb7,k14001)...(vb7,k15000)
    (vb0,k1001)...(vb0,k2000)
    (vb1,k3001)...(vb1,k4000)...
    (vb7,k15001)...(vb7,k16000).

In the mccouch side, it will first receive the message indicating
the max number of concurrent workers allowed from ep-engine, and
then create a new worker whenever it receives an item with the new
vbucket Id.
