DESCRIPTION

MB-21725: test_exp_persisted_set_del check for greater or equal 1

The test stores key twice and waits for ep_total_persisted to equal 1.
The test fails because the wait_for stat function timesout, the
total persisted is 2.

If the flusher ran quickly we may actually have a value of 2.
