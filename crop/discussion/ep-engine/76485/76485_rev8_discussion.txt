DESCRIPTION

MB-23795: Ephemeral Tombstone purging Task

Expands on the previous patch to implement a Task which performs
Tombstone purging. This Task is scheduled periodically (see
ep_ephemeral_metadata_purge_interval), and when run it visits all
vBuckets and purges all applicable OSVs.

Task can be reconfigured dynamiclly via epctl parameters:

- ephemeral_metadata_purge_age
- ephemeral_metadata_purge_interval

Example output:

    NOTICE (eph) Ephemeral Tombstone Purger starting with purge age:60
    NOTICE (eph) Ephemeral Tombstone Purger completed. Purged 39000 items. Took 104ms. Sleeping for 60 seconds.
