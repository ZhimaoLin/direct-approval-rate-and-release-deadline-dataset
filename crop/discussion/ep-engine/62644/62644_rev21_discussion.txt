Hi Chiyoung

The restriction that is being added is how it was previously before I started working on a fix, which is for connections with the same name, we mark them as "to disconnect" and then proceed creating a new connection.

This change has been run through a toy-build by QE and has passed the XDCR, View and rebalance tests where previous issues were found.

The fix to the original defect I started work on is to not allow a new connection if a connection already its on the same cookie.  This constraint has to be enforced because we disconnect given a cookie (and therefore we can't have two connections on the same cookie).  If we try to create a connection with the same cookie, we will mark the connection as "to disconnect" and return null_ptr.  Therefore when manageConnections is next run it should be disconnected.  If a client retries repeatedly retries on failure, it will ultimately succeed.

Patch Set 21:

I forgot to add, I made a minor change to the code since the QE team tested (I now set "to disconnect" for the connection on the specified cookie, if it already exists, before returning null_ptr).

I believe this is the right thing to do, because it means that the connection will get disconnected and so if the client repeatedly retries it will ultimately succeed.

However given it a change to what QE tested, I'm currently in the process of creating another toy-build, just to be certain the fix is OK.

Thank you Daniel for good analysis and details.

If your toy build tests by the QE are all passed with rebalance, XDCR, view, ...(major DCP clients), please feel free to merge it.
