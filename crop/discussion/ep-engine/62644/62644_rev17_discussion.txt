DESCRIPTION

MB-19124: Disconnect connections of same name or same cookie

If a DCP connection request has the same connection
object (cookie) as an existing or the same name as
an existing connection, then mark the connection as
"want to disconnect" and remove from "map_", which
is a map of cookies to connections.

Then create the new connection as normal and add
an entry to "map_".

ns_server relies on this behaviour.
