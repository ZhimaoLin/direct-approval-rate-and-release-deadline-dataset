Patch Set 22:

Hi Chiyoung,
Thanks for the feedback.  I’m pleased to say the appropriate tests have passed.
I updated the patch, to change the loop to c+11 format.
I also removed the break from the for loop.  This is because if we repeatedly requested a connection with the same name it is possible that more than one connection would exist in the all list with the same name.

By removing the break we ensure they are always all marked “doDisconnect”.
