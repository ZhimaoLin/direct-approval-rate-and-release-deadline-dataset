As we discussed, we don't need this optimization at this time.

Line:5240, src/ep_engine.cc -> We should not use the block timer for setWithMeta because setWithMeta might require a bg fetch. That is the reason why we measure its wall clock time differently as you can see from startTime and endTime calculation.

Line:5404, src/ep_engine.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:261, src/vbucket.h -> White space.

Line:266, src/vbucket.h -> Please simplify this 'if - else' clause to

int currentTime = wallTime ? wallTime : gethrtime();
