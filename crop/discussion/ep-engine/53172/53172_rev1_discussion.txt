DESCRIPTION

Fix invalid memory accesses to objectregistry during engine shutdown

During engine shutdown (EvpDestroy) we proceed to stop (and join) all
executorpool threads. However a number of invalid memory accesses have
been observed when there was more than one bucket (prior to shutting
down). See for example the following Valgrind report:

   Thread 7 mc:reader_4:
   Invalid read of size 8
      at 0x7918DDD: fetch_sub (atomic_base.h:628)
      by 0x7918DDD: ObjectRegistry::memoryDeallocated(unsigned long) (objectregistry.cc:215)
      by 0x406711: invoke_delete_hook (alloc_hooks.c:71)
      by 0x406711: free (alloc_hooks.c:95)
      by 0x50407C0: platform_thread_wrap (cb_pthreads.c:24)
      by 0x54A4E99: start_thread (pthread_create.c:308)
      by 0x5D4138C: clone (clone.S:112)
    Address 0x6c8b4e0 is 1,248 bytes inside a block of size 3,072 free'd
      at 0x528F8C8: je_valgrind_freelike_block (valgrind.c:33)
      by 0x78A1478: EvpDestroy (ep_engine.cc:141)
      by 0x4039A9: destroy_bucket(engine_interface*, engine_interface_v1*, bool) (engine_testapp.cc:995)
      by 0x74069CA: perf_latency_baseline_multi_bucket(test*, int, int) [clone .isra.141] (ep_perfsuite.cc:336)
      by 0x403524: execute_test (engine_testapp.cc:1098)
      by 0x403524: main (engine_testapp.cc:1435)

(a number of similar errors follow this one...)

The issue is that during it's cleanup the thread (a reader thread in
this instance) free()s it's thread context object, which is tracked by
the objectregistry. So far so good, except in this instance the engine
(aka bucket) assosicated with the thread is a one which was previously
deleted - and we are attempting to access stats from a free'd engine.

Solution is simply to reset the engine associated with thread to null
when they stop running.
