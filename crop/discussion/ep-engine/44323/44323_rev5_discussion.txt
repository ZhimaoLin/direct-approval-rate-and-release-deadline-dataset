Line:132, src/failover-table.cc -> If the failover table becomes empty, then I think we still need to initialize the latest uuid to an appropriate value (e.g., -1 or 0) to indicate this erroneous case. Please check this with Mike to see if there are any cases where the failover table becomes empty in the operational mode.

Line:195, src/failover-table.cc -> This function doesn't change the failover table, but simply exports the failover table content through the callback passed as a parameter. I don't think we need to update the latest UUID in this function.

Line:234, src/failover-table.cc -> As I mentioned above, we need to initialize the latest_uuid appropriately if the failover table is empty.

Line:269, src/failover-table.cc -> Sam as the above comment.

Line:45, src/failover-table.cc -> You don't need any of this latest_uuid stuff. You can just add "return table.front().vb_uuid" here. Alternatively you can not even have this function at all and just use getLatestEntry() to get the vbucket uuid.

Line:234, src/failover-table.cc -> Also, the failover log should never be empty. If it is we can have serious issues.

Line:45, src/failover-table.cc -> We want to avoid the locking overhead every time the lastest UUID needs to be retrieved. If we can come up with other approaches that doesn't require us to grab the failover table lock, then that should be fine too.

Line:234, src/failover-table.cc -> Then, we should put an assertion instead of checking the emptiness.
