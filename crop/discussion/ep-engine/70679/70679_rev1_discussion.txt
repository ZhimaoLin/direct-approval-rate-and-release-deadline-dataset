Sorry, spotted a couple of things on final review :(

Line:230, src/mutation_log.h -> Would be more robust to check for the valid type(s) for t and throw if not them (then if anyone adds a new mutation_log_type_t it won't automatically be accepted).

Line:321, src/mutation_log.h -> I think it would be cleaner if this constructor chained to your new one below (removes the need to duplicate the initialisation of all the same member vars), and then can update keylen in the body.
