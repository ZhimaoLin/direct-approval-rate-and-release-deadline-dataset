DESCRIPTION

MB-16056: Use correctly-sized type for VBucket identifiers

vBuckets are identified with a 16-bit value; however in VbucketMap it
uses various types (int and size_t) for vbucket identifiers.

This means that various places in the code need to perform range
checks to determine the values returned from VBucketMap are in range.

Simplify this by using a correctly-sized type for these methods - a
newly-created VBucket::id_type (typedef of uint16_t). This makes the
code safer (and simpler).

Line:78, src/vbucketmap.cc -> Should we have a VBucket::to_string(VBucket::id_type id) ? to avoid leaking the width? (currently its only called from the vbucketmap which probably is tightly coupled with vbucket anyway...)
