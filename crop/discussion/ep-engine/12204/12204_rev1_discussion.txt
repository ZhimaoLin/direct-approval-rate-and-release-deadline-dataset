DESCRIPTION

Add new stored value states for tracking deleted items

For servicing getMetaData() requests for possibly deleted items, we
create a temporary item, add it to the hashtable and schedule a
background fetch of its metadata from the persistent store. After the
fetch completes, we restore its metadata in memory (if it was found
in the persistent store) or mark it as non existent. We also set it
to automatically expire after a predetermined but configurable amount
of time. As such, in order to correctly track the background fetch,
the following new stored value states are required:
1. meta_pending: soon after creation and as long as the background
   fetch is in process, a temporary item remains in this state.
2. meta_available: after the fetch completes, if the item was found
   deleted in the persistent store, it is marked as available for
   queries involving its metadata.
3. non_existent_key: after the fetch completes, if the item was not
   found in the persistent store, it is marked as having never
   existed. engine_key_noent will be returned if the item is queried.

This change set introduces these states. The actual logic of handling
deletes as described here is part of subsequent change sets.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:464, stored-value.hh -> Please simplify the above three functions into one function such as "getStoredValueState()" and compare the returned state with the state you want to compare.

Line:483, stored-value.hh -> Simply the above two functions into a single function such as "setTmpStoredValueState(..)"
