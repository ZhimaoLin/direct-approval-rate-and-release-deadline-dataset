DESCRIPTION

Add new stored value states for tracking deleted items

For servicing getMetaData() requests for possibly deleted items, we
create a temporary item, add it to the hashtable and schedule a
background fetch of its metadata from the persistent store. After the
fetch completes, we restore its metadata in memory (if it was found
in the persistent store) or mark it as non existent. We also set it
to automatically expire after a predetermined but configurable amount
of time. As such, in order to correctly track the background fetch,
the following new stored value states are required:
1. deleted_key: after the fetch completes, if the item was found
   deleted in the persistent store, it is marked as deleted_key.
2. non_existent_key: after the fetch completes, if the item was not
   found in the persistent store, it is marked as having never
   existed. engine_key_noent will be returned if the item is queried.

This change set introduces these states. The actual logic of handling
deletes as described here is part of subsequent change sets.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:613, stored-value.hh -> variable names are too long. Please shorten them and move their initialization to the source file. For example, "state_id_cleared", "state_non_existent_key". Please put some comments on these two new states.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)



Line:613, stored-value.hh -> I had moved these outside of the previous enum and overlooked the fact that they should be shortened.

Will fix it.
