I think the new queue_op documentation needs expanding slightly, otherwise looks good.

Line:57, src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Nit: Slightly nicer to use make_unique<>() here, then we don't have to "worry" if this use of bare `new` is safe or not.

Line:480, src/stored-value.h -> Would still be helpful to expand on this as to what it /is/ used for.
