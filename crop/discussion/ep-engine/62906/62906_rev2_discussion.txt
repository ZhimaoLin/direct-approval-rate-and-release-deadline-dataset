DESCRIPTION

MB-19204: Remove alarm() call from atomic_ptr_test, reduce iteration count

This test runs slower under ThreadSanitizer than normal. Given we
already have CTest enforcing timeouts, remove the explicit alarm calls
and handle the timeout at the CTest level.

Also reduce the iteration count by 10x, so the test runs in a more
resonable time.
