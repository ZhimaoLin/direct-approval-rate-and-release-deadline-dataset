DESCRIPTION

MB-11263: Add retry logic for temporarily failed mutations

Processing a mutation on the consumer side can fail due to temporary out of memory
conditions. In that case, we need to add the failed batch of mutations to a pending
queue in the buffer and retry processing those pending mutations the next time we
try to process mutations for that stream.

Line:914, src/upr-stream.cc -> I think the reason for having the mesg_queue was that we needed to grab the streamMutex before. Since we no longer need to do this I think we can just loop through whatever is in the pending_messages until we hit the batch size. Does that make sense to you?
