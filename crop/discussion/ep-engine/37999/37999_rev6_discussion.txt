DESCRIPTION

MB-11263: Add retry logic for temporarily failed mutations

Processing a mutation on the consumer side can fail due to temporary out of memory
conditions. In that case, we just need to return from the failure and re-process
the failed message in the next iteration.

Line:965, src/upr-stream.cc -> Our coding guidelines require that we always use brackets.

Line:994, src/upr-stream.cc -> If something other than ENGINE_TMPFAIL or ENGINE_ENOMEM is returned here than we will not delete the item/response which will result in a memory leak.
