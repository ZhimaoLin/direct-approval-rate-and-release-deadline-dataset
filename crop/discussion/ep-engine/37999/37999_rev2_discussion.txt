DESCRIPTION

MB-11263: Add retry logic for temporarily failed mutations

Processing a mutation on the consumer side can fail due to temporary out of memory
conditions. In that case, we need to add the failed batch of mutations to a pending
queue in the buffer and retry processing those pending mutations the next time we
try to process mutations for that stream.
