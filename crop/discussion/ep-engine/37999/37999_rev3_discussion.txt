DESCRIPTION

MB-11263: Add retry logic for temporarily failed mutations

Processing a mutation on the consumer side can fail due to temporary out of memory
conditions. In that case, we need to add the failed batch of mutations to a pending
queue in the buffer and retry processing those pending mutations the next time we
try to process mutations for that stream.

Line:977, src/upr-stream.cc -> I'm pretty sure that there's a race condition here between removing the items from the stream when the connection is set to and when we put failed items back into the pending queue. This can cause flow control to get out of sync with the producer. I think I know of a good way to resolve this issue. Let's discuss over skype or when your in the office.
