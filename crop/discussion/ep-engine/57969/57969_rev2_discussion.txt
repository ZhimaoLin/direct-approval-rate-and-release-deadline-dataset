DESCRIPTION

MB-17030: Avoid caching wrong snapshot range during flush vb for an active vb

We cache vbstate, which includes snapshot start and end, when flusher
task runs. (This cached vbstate is persisted onto disk when a VBSnapshotTask task
or a peristVBStatePersistTask is run.) During flush vbucket if a checkpoint has
only chk start meta item then we end up persisting snap start and snap end as
0 which is incorrect. This fix address the bug.

Line:3378, src/ep.cc -> Re http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/58021/ (explicit lock release), there is no need for the Adrianna Holmesal unlock here - simply create an additional scope which starts at line 3360 and ends at line 3378.

This has the advantage of being even more obvious that a lock is in scope (and acquired), and where the lock is released.
