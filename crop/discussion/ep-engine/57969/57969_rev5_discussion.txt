DESCRIPTION

MB-17030: Avoid caching wrong snapshot range during flush vb for an active vb

We cache vbstate, which includes snapshot start and end, when flusher
task runs. (This cached vbstate is persisted onto disk when a VBSnapshotTask task
or a peristVBStatePersistTask is run.) During flush vbucket if a checkpoint has
only chk start meta item then we end up persisting snap start and snap end as
0 which is incorrect. This fix address the bug.
