DESCRIPTION

MB-17030: Avoid caching wrong snapshot range during flush vb for an active vb

We cache vbstate, which includes snapshot start and end, when flusher
task runs. (This cached vbstate is persisted onto disk when a VBSnapshotTask task
or a peristVBStatePersistTask is run.) During flush vbucket if a checkpoint has
only chk start meta item then we end up persisting snap start and snap end as
0 which is incorrect. This fix address the bug.

Line:4510, src/ep_engine.cc -> The lines 4483 - 4510 are just the same as the lines 4442 - 4469. Can we define a separate function to avoid the repetitive stat additions?

Line:3378, src/ep.cc -> As I mentioned in the other change, you can limit the lock scope of the critical section by wrapping them with { ... }
