Line:1909, src/vbucket.cc -> You're shadowing one of the parameters to this function - please rename one of them.

Line:1912, src/vbucket.cc -> This needs updating.

Line:1948, src/kv_bucket.cc -> I'm in two minds about this - while that would be more explicit, part of the attraction of smart ptrs is they behave like normal pointers (unless you want to do something special with them).
