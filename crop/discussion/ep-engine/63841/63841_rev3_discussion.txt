Line:1603, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Can this be implemented in terms of the existing getDbFileInfo function? See the similar refactoring I did for couchstore: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/63527/

Line:1603, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I just realized that the getDbFileInfo function didn't really require getting the kvsInfo (which is what this function needs). So, they are making mutually exclusive calls now.
