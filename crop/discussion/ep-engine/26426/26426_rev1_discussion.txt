DESCRIPTION

MB-8323: Make sure all tasks finish before deleting a bucket

Since we don't hold a tasks lock while the task is running it is
possible that we can cancel a running task and then immediately
delete the bucket. This causes a problem because a task may still
be running and doing work on that bucket. If this happens it will
cause a crash. This change moves the task counting mechanism inside
the constructor and destructor of a task. Each bucket now also knows
how many tasks it currently has scheduled to run and can properly
make sure that all of it's tasks are finished before the bucket
frees up all of it's resources.
