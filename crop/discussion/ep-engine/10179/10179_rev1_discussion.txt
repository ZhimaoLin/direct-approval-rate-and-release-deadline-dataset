Line:136, observe_registry.cc -> I recall that ep-engine had some cheaper (non-system-call) way of getting current time.  Look for hrtime ?

Line:113, observe_registry.hh -> I don't think you need this extra expired bool state?

As soon as you notice an expired ObserveSet, just get rid of it immediately?  That'll be more apparent if you had a helper method like ObserveRegistry::getUnexpiredObserveSet() which (handwave) cleans up actively as necessary, instead of letting expired observeSets hang around.
