Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)



Line:81, observe_registry.cc -> Wondering if you need those removeObserveSet() calls here, too, in the various itemFooBared() callbacks methods?

And, whether you should refactor registry.find()+isExpired()+removeObserveSet() into a nice helper method, since that triplet of calls seem to be repeated often.

Line:81, observe_registry.cc -> 1. Already done in a later patch set

2. Won't work, that if, else if, else is custom in each function.
