Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:1609, src/vbucket.cc -> From an interface perspective it's awkward to check this without picking up the state lock inside the function - especially if it's not documented on the vbucket interface.

Line:661, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Why duplicate this check both outside and inside the function?

Line:1609, src/vbucket.cc -> Actually it is upto the caller to decide whether he wants a specific state of VBucket to expire an item. VBucket class should be flexible enough to delete an expired item in any state. So removing the check here

Line:661, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Just doing outside here
