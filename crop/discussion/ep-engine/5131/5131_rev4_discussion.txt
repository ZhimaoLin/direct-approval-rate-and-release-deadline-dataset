DESCRIPTION

MB-3514 Fix to the performance issue on the fast VBucket deletion.

There was a bug in the fast VBucket deletion, which results in
poor performance on the vbucket deletion. The bug was caused by
executing too many vbucket-deletion SQL statements incorrectly.

This change fixes the above issue by executing the corresponding
vbucket-deletion statements only.
