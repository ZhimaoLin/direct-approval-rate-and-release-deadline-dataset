DESCRIPTION

MB-8024: Fix to the BackfillRemaining stat overflow

Note that stats used in estimating the number of backfill items
are atomic individually, but not atomic when they use together.
Therefore, there is still a small time window that can cause the
backfill estimation counter to be overflow or underflow.

This change adds a check to prevent adding a negative number to
the backfill estimation counter.
