DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter that calls releaseHandle() rather than
doing a delete.

The entrypoints to EP-Engine have all been changed to use the new
style. As such the old {get,release}Handle has been removed.

(1 comment)

Line:82, src/ep_engine.cc -> Probably worth being explicit it obtains a handle to the engine, which allows access to the engine while it's in scope.

(Note it's generally not necessarily to explain the "how" in the external documentation - i.e. I probably wouldn't mention the cast - I'd just say "what" it does from the user's POV).
