DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter that calls releaseHandle() rather than
doing a delete.

The entrypoints to EP-Engine have all been changed to use the new
style. As such the old {get,release}Handle has been removed.

Missed this the first time - apologies. Need to document the new function:

Line:80, src/ep_engine.cc -> This comment is now outdated - refers to code which has been deleted. 

Could you remove it, and then at least document acquireEngine below (given that's the new public interface to getting access to EPEngine.
