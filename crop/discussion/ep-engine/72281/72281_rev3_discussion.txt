DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter (EngineHandleDestroyer) that calls
releaseHandle() rather than doing a delete.

Initially just a single entrypoint has been changed. The plan is to
increase the usage of this once this change is agreed on.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Approach looks good. Few suggestions, mostly around the naming of things, but I think you can also simplify the code a bit by getting rid of the `handle` arg.

Feel free to expand to all the other uses of get / releaseHandle.

Line:89, src/ep_engine.cc -> Style: Probably worth adding a type alias (using) for this to make the code more terse.

Line:91, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Prefer make_unique<>

Line:96, src/ep_engine.cc -> Note: releaseHandle doesn't actually do anything with `handle`, so we don't actually need to store it within this RAII class.

Moreover, given that we plan to use this RAII pattern for all instances, I'd just inline the content of `releaseHandle` into here and delete releaseHandle (similary with getHandle).

Line:294, src/ep_engine.cc -> I know I suggested `toEngine`, but thinking about it more and looking at the code, I think that something like `acquireEngine()` or `enterEngine()` would be a better name. I think it better suggests that we are actually (temporarily) making use the engine, compared to `toEngine` which implies conversion to me.

Line:962, src/ep_engine.h -> I'd probably not call this "Destroyer", for a couple of reasons:

1) It's not that an idiomatic name - normally "Deleter" or perhaps "destructor" would be the name for deleting things in C++
2) "Destroyer" implies we are actually deleting something, which in fact this is just us entering / leaving ep-engine (and the work associated with that).

I'd suggest something like EngineReleaser - or other suggestions are also welcome ;)

Line:294, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think if we're introducing RAII it would be better to make it explicit. ie. actually store this in an lvalue (a variable) so that it's obvious what's happening.

At the moment a reader might not realise that toEngine isn't just a cast (and that it actually introduces an rvalue that must be destructed after getStats() is called).
