DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter that calls releaseHandle() rather than
doing a delete.

Initially just a single entrypoint has been changed. The plan is to
increase the usage of this once this change is agreed on.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:89, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'd suggest something more like EPHandle or EPLease to emphasise this isn't simply a pointer, it's an object which has more to it. 

(Apologies for the bikeshedding ;)

Line:97, src/ep_engine.cc -> You can get rid of this (as per previous comment) - the `(void)evp` does nothing, it was probably originally there to silence a compiler warning about an unused argument.

Line:89, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:97, src/ep_engine.cc -> I assumed we would still need it to silence the compiler
