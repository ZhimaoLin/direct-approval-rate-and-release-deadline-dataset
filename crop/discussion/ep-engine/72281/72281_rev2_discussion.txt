DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter (EngineHandleDestroyer) that calls
releaseHandle() rather than doing a delete.

Initially just a single entrypoint has been changed. The plan is to
increase the usage of this once this change is agreed on.
