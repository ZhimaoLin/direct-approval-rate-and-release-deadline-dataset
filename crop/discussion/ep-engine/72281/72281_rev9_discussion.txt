DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter that calls releaseHandle() rather than
doing a delete.

The entrypoints to EP-Engine have all been changed to use the new
style. As such the old {get,release}Handle has been removed.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:91, src/ep_engine.cc -> Revert this (note the double-asterisk notation is used to denote Doxygen comments (i.e. public API).

Line:135, src/ep_engine.cc -> Not really any value in splitting this - might as well just do:

 return acquireEngine(handle)->getInfo();

Line:147, src/ep_engine.cc -> This isn't sufficient here, as calling reset() will just run the (custom) deleter for EPHandleReleaser.

You'll need to explicitly call `delete` on eng.get() - yes, this is a bit ugly :(

Line:174, src/ep_engine.cc -> Similar here - just return directly.

(basically if you're just assigning to a local and then immediately return it, simplify to return directly).
