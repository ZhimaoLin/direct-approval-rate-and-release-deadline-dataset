DESCRIPTION

MB-22231: Use RAII for ep-engine entrypoints

Adds a function to get a resource handle (unique_ptr) for
EventuallyPersistentEngine rather than a bare pointer. This resource
handler has a custom deleter that calls releaseHandle() rather than
doing a delete.

The entrypoints to EP-Engine have all been changed to use the new
style. As such the old {get,release}Handle has been removed.

Line:1388, src/ep_engine.cc -> Might as well also make this one statement (similary below in AddStream).

(1 comment)

Line:1281, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think this is technically undefined behaviour as the lifetime of the unique_ptr rvalue is not being extended to the duration of `processUnknownCommand`.

Either way the lifetime isn't clear so you should make it explicit (ie. make the unique_ptr an lvalue for the scope of this function).
