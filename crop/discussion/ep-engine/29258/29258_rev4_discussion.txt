Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:860, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please parse the request packet to see if it has a right format and then pass the compaction parameters to the epstore compaction API instead of passing a binary protocol message down to CouchKVStore.

Line:704, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why they are commented?

Line:231, src/tasks.h -> As mentioned earlier, please do not use the binary protocol message directly. They should be parsed to see if it has a right format, and then the compaction parameters (purge_by_time, purge_by_seq, deletes) should be passed to this class.
