Patch Set 17:

Retry logic is added back so that we can merge this without breaking anything. This will avoid a circular dependency with ns-server team so that they can independently add the logic to support the new VB_COMPACT* opcodes.

Retry logic removal will go in as a separate commit once ns-server team merges their changes to support the new way of doing compaction.
