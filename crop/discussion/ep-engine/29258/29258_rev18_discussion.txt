Line:632, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Can we define VB_COMPACT_OPENDB_ERROR?

Line:633, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't use goto in our code base. It is an arguable point, but I would like to avoid it.

Line:636, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why do we need to get the header? Seems we don't need to.

Line:638, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need this check because if the open is succeed, then it shouldn't be null.

Line:695, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> VB_COMPACT_OPENDB_ERROR

Line:713, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why is it always "VB_NO_CHANGE"?

Line:2294, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we add some items to the vbucket and wait for the flusher completion before calling the compaction?
