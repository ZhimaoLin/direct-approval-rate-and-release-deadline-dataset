CBD-485: Move DB file compaction into EP-Engine

As detailed in CBD-485, the compactor module is moved into EP-Engine
New Memcached Command:
-> CMD_COMPACT_DB with protocol_binary_request_compact_db
New Stats:
-> ep_pending_compactions
-> compaction timing histogram
New unit test case to exercise the code path
New command line utility to perform compaction:
cbcompact 127.0.0.1:12000 compact <vbid> --wait

Patch Set 5:

No use of protocol_binary_request in couch store
using compaction_ctx struct instead
uncommented the resetVBucket function - unit tests pass BUT unless NS server changes are made this code will not work
thanks

Line:845, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please also check if ext_len is 20 bytes or not.

Line:853, src/ep_engine.cc -> these are both 8 bytes. We should use ntohll instead.

Line:47, src/ep.h -> Please remove it as we don't need to know the packet structure.

Line:492, src/ep.h -> Not the cookie. It contains compaction-related parameters.

Line:500, src/ep.h -> The same comment as above.

Line:502, src/ep.h -> Why should it be const void *? Shouldn't we use compaction_ctx?

Line:620, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We should not pass 'CREATE' flag to the couchstore for the source file, but instead pass 'COUCHSTORE_OPEN_FLAG_RDONLY' to it.

Line:683, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We should not invoke resetVBucket here. It is only used for resetting a vbucket.

Please use CouchNotifier directly here and add "VB_COMPACTION_DONE" to couch-notifier.h:

uint64_t newHeaderPos = couchstore_get_header_position(db);
RememberingCallback<uint16_t> lcb;

VBStateNotification vbs(0, 0,
                        "VB_COMPACTION_DONE", vbucketId);

couchNotifier->notify_update(vbs, newfileRev, newHeaderPos, lcb);
if (cb.val != PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_SUCCESS) {...}

mc-couch in the eralng side should be adapted to understand "VB_COMPACTION_DONE".

Line:663, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> htonll

Line:664, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> htonll

Line:2310, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I rather switch this check with while loop above. We should check ep_pending_compactions to be one after calling compact_db, and then while sleep until the compaction is completed, which means that ep_pending_compactions becomes zero.

Line:23, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> We should not include this header file anymore.

Line:242, src/kvstore.h -> Please change "const void *" to "const compact_ctx *"

Line:231, src/tasks.h -> The order of initialization is wrong. It should be aligned with the order of member variable declaration below.
