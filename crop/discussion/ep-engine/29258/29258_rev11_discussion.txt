Line:58, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore-dummy.h -> cookie should be changed to compaction_ctx *c

Line:1122, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> If we remove this function, we should make sure that the read-only CouchKVStore instance should correctly update the file rev number for each vbucket and open the correct file.

Line:338, src/vbucket.h -> As a further optimization, we can use an atomic variable to indicate if a compaction is running for a given vbucket. Then, the flusher can bypass that vbucket and revisit it later. Let's make a separate commit later.

Line:1917, src/ep.cc -> Please grab the compaction lock here before calling the commit

Line:878, src/ep.cc -> Why do we need to grab the lock here? It seems to me that it's not necessary.

Line:916, src/ep.cc -> we don't need to worry about this race case. You already grab the vbucket instance above and try to run the compactor for that vbucket. It should be fine.

Line:1916, src/ep.cc -> Please don't grab the lock here. It's unnecessary too early.
