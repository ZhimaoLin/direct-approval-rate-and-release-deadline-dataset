Line:288, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Why did you add this? Please don't make changes that are not related to comments from reviewers. 20 bytes as an extension data should be fine.

Line:288, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> When I did sizeof on this struct without this change it still returned 24 and ended up failing the tests when we tested extlen for 20 bytes. The reason was that the compiler seems to be adding a few padding bytes on the struct. So to make the client also accurately reflect the size I added these spare bytes as padding such that the struct is rounded to 8 bytes for sure.
thanks

Line:288, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> We should not use sizeof operation to check the packet extension length. Please simply check it with ext_len field as we expect that the client should fill out that length field.

Line:1196, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Since the compactor is in ep-engine now is it still necessary to have all of this retry logic around opening files?

Line:1196, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> No - we can remove the retry code now. I had planned to do this later once the NS-server changes were also finalized, but I can do this right away.

thanks

Line:288, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Done
