DESCRIPTION

Close a stream if the vbucket state changes

This change is needed for two reasons. The first is that upr
consumers should get a notification that a stream is closed if
the state of the vbucket changes. The second is that since a
vbucket might be accessed by a stream during shutdown we need
to notify the upr connection that the vbucket is no longer
valid so that the stream can be closed. Otherwise we might
access invalid objects.
