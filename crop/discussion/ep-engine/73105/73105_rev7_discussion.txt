Patch Set 7: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:2362, src/vbucket.cc -> Nit: You can just use a boolean expression - that also allows for const for example:

 const bool onlyMarkDeleted = value &&
                              mcbp::datatype::is_xattr(value->getDataType();

(No need to change this time, for future reference).
