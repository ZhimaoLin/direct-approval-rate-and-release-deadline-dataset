DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Enable separator modifications

Up until now the separator was fixed as the default value of "::".
This commit allows incoming manifests to change the separator if
allowed, as follows:

1. No open collections exist.
2. Only the default collection exists.

A separator can be changed by two manifest "types" (when the above
rules are met)

1. A manifest that has a new "separator" field
2. A manifest that has a new "separator" field and a new "collection"

In the first case a new/dedicated SystemEvent is required that ensures
a serialised copy of the manifest is flushed.

In the second case the CreateCollection event will also flush the
new separator.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:91, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Might be worth bumping this up to NOTICE given that INFO isn't logged by default (and it should be a rare event anyways).

Line:503, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> If you're removing the lock here (I assume because you want to call operator<< with the lock already held), probably worth mentioning it's semantically "_UNLOCKED" in the method description.

Line:415, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Style: I think it would be more readable if this was named `canChangeSeparator()` and the logic reversed.
