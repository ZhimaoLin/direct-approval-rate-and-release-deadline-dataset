DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Enable separator modifications

Up until now the separator was fixed as the default value of "::".
This commit allows incoming manifests to change the separator if
allowed, as follows:

1. No open collections exist.
2. Only the default collection exists.

A separator can be changed by two manifest "types" (when the above
rules are met)

1. A manifest that has a new "separator" field
2. A manifest that has a new "separator" field and a new "collection"

In the first case a new/dedicated SystemEvent is required that ensures
a serialised copy of the manifest is flushed.

In the second case the CreateCollection event will also flush the
new separator.
