DESCRIPTION

MB-19278: Fix lock-order inversion on ActiveStream::streamMutex

ThreadSanitizer has identified a potential deadlock due to a cycle in
  the lock order graph: Cycle in lock order graph:

    M43515         => M36787      => M36848            => M43515
   [ActiveStream::   [TaskQueue::   [ExecutorThread::    [ActiveStream::
    streamMutex]      mutex]         currentTaskMutex]    streamMutex]

The crux of the problem appears to be the acquisition of streamMutex
in the destructor of ActiveStream. This is ultimately a Bad Idea - if
you still have multiple threads accessing an object when it's been
deleted then you are already into undefined behaviour.
