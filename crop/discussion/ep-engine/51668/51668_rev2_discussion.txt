DESCRIPTION

MB-15206: Check and add new checkpoint upon receiving snapshot end

In the DCP consumer, upon receiving a snapshot end message,
check and add a new checkpoint for the replica vbucket, to
ensure that items that are in the current checkpoint do not
take up a lot of memory. Any old unreferenced checkpoints
will be removed by the checkpoint-remover and item-pager
daemons.
