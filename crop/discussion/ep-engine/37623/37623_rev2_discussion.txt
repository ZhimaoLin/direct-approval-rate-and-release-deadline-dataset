DESCRIPTION

MB-11107: The amount of processed bytes in an upr consumer should be atomic

We update this variable from different threads and as a reuslt need to make
it atomic to prevent concurrency issue. This fixes an issue where the
amount of acked bytes on the consumer did not match up with the producer.
