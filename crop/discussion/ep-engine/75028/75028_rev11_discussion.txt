DESCRIPTION

Refactor: CacheCallback to not directly access HashTable object

The hash table object should ideally be a protected member of the
VBucket class, as opposed to being public.

The patch moves towards this goal by introducing a getItem function to
the VBucket class, which ensures that the backfill function
CacheCallback::callback no longer requires direct access to the hash
table object.
