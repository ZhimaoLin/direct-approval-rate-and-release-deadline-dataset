DESCRIPTION

Refactor: CacheCallback to not directly access HashTable object

The hash table object should ideally be a protected member of the
VBucket class, as opposed to being public.

The patch moves towards this goal by introducing a getItem function to
the VBucket class, which ensures that the backfill function
CacheCallback::callback no longer requires direct access to the hash
table object.

Line:955, src/vbucket.h -> Please document.

Line:63, src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Probably more explicit to check for v.getStatus() == SUCCESS (although I concede the ptr is only set if that's true).
