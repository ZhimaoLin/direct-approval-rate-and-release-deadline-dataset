DESCRIPTION

Refactor: CacheCallback to not directly access HashTable object

The hash table object should ideally be a protected member of the
VBucket class, as opposed to being public.

The patch moves towards this goal by introducing a getItem function to
the VBucket class, which ensures that the backfill function
CacheCallback::callback no longer requires direct access to the hash
table object.

Line:78, src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Maybe a little cleaner to immediately "wrap" v.getValue in a unique_ptr (say at line 63-64), then you don't need to Adrianna Holmesally delete it.

This part of the code is not very well unit tested for all the conditions.
Urgency to submit this commit permitting, it would be great if you can add a unit test as part of this
