DESCRIPTION

[IK] Make unlocked_add::maybeKeyExists authorative

The `maybeKeyExists` argument is sometimes used as a hint which is
predicated on full eviction. This makes it hard to generalise the code
for other strategies, as we can only 'trust' this argument in certain
code paths.

This patch adjusts the semantics of maybeKeyExists, removing the
eviction policy predicate so it is /always/ authorative.
