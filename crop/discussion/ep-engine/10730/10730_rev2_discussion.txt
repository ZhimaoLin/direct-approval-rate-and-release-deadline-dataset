Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

We need to fix the following 3 things before we push it..

Line:45, sizes.cc -> Do we need this one when you changed the size to uint16_t?

Line:2320, ep.cc -> We need to verify this...

Line:574, stored-value.hh -> Dustin: You should probably do your magic here?

Patch Set 2: Abandoned
