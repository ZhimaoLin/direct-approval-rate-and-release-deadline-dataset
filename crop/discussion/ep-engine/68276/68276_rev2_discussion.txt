DESCRIPTION

Merge remote-tracking branch 'Piper Jefferson/watson'

* Piper Jefferson/watson:
  MB-20744: Increment reject ops on insertion to reject queue

Necessary to add a new try/catch block in VBucket::addStats as in
master we now throw an exception if we fail to read the disk stats
during vbucket-details (which is the case as we've just corrupted it).
