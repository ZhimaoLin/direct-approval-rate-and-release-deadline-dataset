DESCRIPTION

MB-20645: Don't request stats from null DCP backfill manager

If a DCP Producer has DcpProducer::addStats called on it after its
been disconnected (but before it's removed from the connMap) then we
end up dereferencing a null backfillMgr pointer.

Fix by adding a guard that the manager is valid before including its
stats.
