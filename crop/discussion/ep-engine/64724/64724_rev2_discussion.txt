DESCRIPTION

MB-19255: Only update sendTime if successfully send noop

In the maybeSendNoop function when a DCP producer attempts
to send a noop to a consumer it can receive back
ENGINE_SUCCESS or ENGINE_E2BIG.

We should only set pendingRecv to true and update the
last sendTime if ENGINE_SUCCESS is returned.

(3 comments)

Line:22, tests/module_tests/stream_test.cc -> I don't think we have gtest in the 3.0.x branch - so I'm surprised this works...

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please remove all this - it applies to the original commit and not to this one.

Line:207, src/dcp-producer.h -> It will be a smaller diff (and more closely match the upstream code - making any future backports easier) if you keep the function in the same place and just add a "protected:" clause at line 281 (and a "private:" one after noopCtx).
