DESCRIPTION

MB-5944 Fix warmup batch read using access log

Batch read cannot use rowids (i.e. seq_id) from access log
because seq_ids might have changed since access log was generated.
Change to get seq_id from hashtable when filling fetches vector.

Patch Set 1: (3 inline comments)



Line:204, Makefile.am -> white space

Line:653, mutation_log.cc -> what if vbucket is not available, we may want to create one by reset function? Look at initVBucket in warmup.cc.

Line:655, mutation_log.cc -> we may want to assert if v == null, though it is unlikely.
