DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Buckets Prototype1]: Full HT scan, sort scanned items by seqno

This is just a prototype, by no means a full functionality. Also it is
a hack and not a clean implementaion.

The goal of the prototype is to enable writes, reads and DCP
functionality on a single node.  This can be further extended for
profiling performances in reads, writes and DCP backfill.

Disk persistence has been disabled by making flusher no-op.
Also persistence cursor is not registered in checkpoints.

Writes/reads are to/from HT(hash table) as before. DCP backfill is done
by scanning the entire HT and then sorting the items by seqno.

Few limitations:
1. The prototype will work only when the memory usage is below high
   watermark. Evictions are not expected to function correctly.
2. Only active vb is handled.
3. Only single standalone node can be tested from ep-engine testsuite.
4. Only 1 (active) vb has been tested, but I expect multiple vbs to
   function in parallel without any problem.

Test present in ep dcp testsuite.
(EP_TEST_NUM=84 ../memcached/engine_testapp -E ep.so -T
ep_testsuite_dcp.so -e "flushall_enabled=true;ht_size=13;ht_locks=7")
