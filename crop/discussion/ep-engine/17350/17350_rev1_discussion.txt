So I should send this command not on tap producer's connection right? I can/need to use my dedicated control connection to memcached ?

BTW, I think your more detailed explanation of encoding may be added to commit message.

Yes, you can simply use the dedicated control connection to memcached, which is usually used for stats collection / vbucket deletion, etc.
