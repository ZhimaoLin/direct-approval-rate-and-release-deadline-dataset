DESCRIPTION

don't loose notify events in notifyPendingConnections. MB-5136

Because previously tapConnMap.wait would always wait 1 second it may
cause 1 second delay if notify occurs when not
notifyPendingConnections thread is not "parked" in wait.

This was observed as occasional weird 1 second delays in vbucket
takeover. And I've verified that it indeed makes rebalance faster.

This potential 1 second delay is what makes MB-5136 relatively
probable in practice.

New code maintains cas-like notify counter variable. Which notify
increments. And wait checks that under lock but prior to sleeping. If
prior to sleeping wait finds this value changed it will realize that
some notify event(s) happened between previous return from wait and
it's next call. Thus it won't sleep in such case fixing this problem
of "loosing" notifications.

Patch Set 2: Verified

Works now.

I've tested with and without patch and confirmed that rebalance is faster with patch.

Previous version had negated wait condition causing it to use 100% cpu which incorrectly lead me to believe it was better.
