DESCRIPTION

MB-5136 Don't sleep if there are any new pending notifications.

Because the notification thread always sleeps for one second
through TapConnMap.wait(), it may result in one second delay even
if a new notification occurs when the notification thread is not
"parked" in wait. This one sec delay was also frequently observed
in vbucket takeover.

This change maintains cas-like notification counter variable that
is incremented per new notification. The notification thread
will then sleep for one sec iff the current notification counter
is different from its previous value. This change provides faster
rebalance operations.
