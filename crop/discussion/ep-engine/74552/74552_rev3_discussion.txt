DESCRIPTION

MB-19001: Append CREATE flag even for non-zero open flags

* If we disable buffered IO, then open option flag will have non-zero
value, and accordingly CouchKVStore::openDB_retry will not try to open
the file with CREATE flag. It will cause file open failure.

* Modified the code to make it work correctly for the case that given
option is not zero.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

Code looks good - just a documentation suggestion.

Line:1479, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Given this conditional is getting quite complex now, I think it's worth a brief comment describing what the intent here is - something like:

 // Last retry - if file still doesn't exist, attempt to create it if we are allowed.
