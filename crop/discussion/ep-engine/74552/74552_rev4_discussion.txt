DESCRIPTION

MB-19001: Append CREATE flag even for non-zero open flags

* If we disable buffered IO, then open option flag will have non-zero
value, and accordingly CouchKVStore::openDB_retry will not try to open
the file with CREATE flag. It will cause file open failure.

* Modified the code to make it work correctly for the case that given
option is not zero.
