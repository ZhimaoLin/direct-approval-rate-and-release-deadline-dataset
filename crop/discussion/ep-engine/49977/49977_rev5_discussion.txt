DESCRIPTION

Add destroy_engine method and free the MemoryTracker.

A related memcached patch requires that all engine DLLs export
the following method.

  void destroy_engine(void)

Memcached code uses this method to request cleanup before the
engine DLL is unloaded (dlclose).

This patch adds to the destroy_engine function a MemoryTracker
destroy function which fixes a problem where unloading the
engine DLL left unmapped memory hooks accesible to memcached,
triggering a segv.

Note: this patch is safe to commit without the memcached patch as
the function will just be dangling (uncalled).
