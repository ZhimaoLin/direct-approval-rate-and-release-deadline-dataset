Line:1809, src/ep_engine.cc -> MemoryTracker is a singleton class that is shared among all the buckets created. If we call this API when a given bucket is destroyed, then it would incur memory referencing errors in other buckets.

Is this new API invoked only when memcached process is terminated or all the buckets are destroyed? Can you please put some comments to explain the usage of this API?

Line:50, src/memory_tracker.cc -> Please reset it to NULL for a safe reference.

Line:944, src/ep_engine.h -> I don't see any places that refer this variable. Please remove it.

Rebasing and uploading fixes, the memcached side of this will be uploaded too.

Line:1809, src/ep_engine.cc -> Sorry for the delay, I was on vacation. This new path is for tearing down the shared object as part of testing or clean termination of memcached. I'll comment this method here and in memcached so that it is clear this method forms part of the shared-object clean-up and not a single bucket destroy.

Line:50, src/memory_tracker.cc -> Consider it done.

Line:944, src/ep_engine.h -> oops, missed when cleaning the patch. Consider it gone.
