DESCRIPTION

Merge remote-tracking branch 'Piper Jefferson/sherlock' into 'couchbase/watson'

* commit '6403bc0e8bbd7e94bb03672f505d99ff68d56c36':
  MB-18453: Give all tasks their own stats and priority
  [BP] MB-18580: Wait for VB state to be persisted before starting tests
  MB-19948: enable disabled meta-data tests.
  MB-19948: Handle 18 bytes of metadata
  MB-19948: CouchKVStore metadata tests
  MB-19897: Fix the data race on lastSendTime between stats and dcp worker threads

Merge notes:

[1] This merge brought in http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/65211/
and has been deliberatley removed. The eachRCU visitor raised
a new race condition yet the code which MB-19982 orginally
protected has been removed, so eachRCU is not needed. The
test remains to ensure the code-path is clean.

[2] This merge introduced a TSAN issue because the test
for MB-19982 demonstrates another lock ordering bug.
The resolution is to move the buffer.mutex in
PassiveStream::messageReceived and make buffer.items
atomic.
