well, yes and no... Yes in the sense that I discovered it as part of fixing that.. no in the sense that it is completely unrelated ;-) there should probably be a bug raised for ep-engine that it is using the wrong loglevel a lot of places... I can't see why it is a warning that we're stopping a task (which action should the operator take? etc)
