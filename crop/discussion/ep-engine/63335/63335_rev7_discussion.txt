Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Bunch of minor things. I haven't looked in detail at the actual forestdb file ops struct.

Line:407, src/kvstore.h -> Update to a more generic name

Line:409, src/kvstore.h -> ditto

Line:411, src/kvstore.h -> ditto

Line:307, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: Once initialiser lists get more than 1 line I find putting each element on it's own line improves readability.

Line:79, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Can be made const.

Line:387, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Style: Reference marker (&) is generally attached to the type, not the variable.
