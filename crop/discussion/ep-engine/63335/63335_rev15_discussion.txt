Line:1889, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Where do these magic numbers come from?

Line:1898, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please use checkeq() for all these checks here.

Line:1921, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Given this is always 4, I don't think putting it into a variable is very helpful - it just hides what the expected value is.

Line:364, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Can this method be moved into the base class (KVStore), given that's where the actual member variable now lives?

Line:50, tests/module_tests/couch-fs-stats_test.cc -> Whitespace-only change

Line:1889, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Dave, I just extended the existing test case. This isn't a comprehensive test case to test all the fs stats.

In this changelist, I just intend to complete the file ops stats integration which sriram had started.

Was thinking of adding tests for fs stats/ fileops in a separate task.

Line:364, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:50, tests/module_tests/couch-fs-stats_test.cc -> Done
