Sriram,

Overall, it looks good. Most of my comments are minor ones. Thanks.

Line:753, src/kvstore.h -> Minor one: let's separate the protected member functions from variables for a better readability (at least put a separate line and comments).

Line:353, src/kvstore.h -> minor one: If we don't need the copy constructor, then can we remove it or use DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN?

Line:380, src/kvstore.h -> Given that these atomic variables are just I/O related stats and frequently updated, it would be better to use Couchbase::RelaxedAtomic to reduce the default memory order overhead.

Line:211, src/kvstore.cc -> Given that the above addStat template function takes const std::string reference, I think we can simply pass 'prefix' to addStat() instead of 'prefix_str' below.

Line:257, src/kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:715, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As a deletion is persisted as key and its metadata without a value, I think we should update writeSizeHisto too.

Line:1067, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Given this is the loop for the bg reads for the same key, I think it would be better to update readSizeHisto only once before (or after) this loop.

Line:1784, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As the future enhancement, I think it would be better to 1) move these file ops definitions to a separate header and source file as we define them in couch-fs-stat.h (.c), and 2) put some brief comments for some of main file ops functions or classes.

Line:1896, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> totalBytesRead?
