(8 comments)

style: A lot of new * and & are on the wrong side throughout the patch

Line:331, src/kvstore.h -> style: Please put these on their own line for readability

Line:844, src/kvstore.h -> weird spacing

Line:2106, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> style: as before, move across

Line:227, src/kvstore.cc -> This appears to be missing the new compaction total bytes stats

Line:1939, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> style: Once you get beyond a couple of lines it would be more readable to have one line per parameter

Line:399, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Style: * and & should all be on the left

Line:361, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> nit: Maybe worth renaming to 'getKVStoreStat' or even 'getStats'

Line:361, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> style: since you're touching the line it's probably worth kicking the '&' across.
