Patch Set 2: (34 inline comments)



Line:3301, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please find a good way to aggregate all of the kvstore stats.

Line:35, src/flusher.cc -> This is something I left in on accident. Please remove it.

Line:224, src/flusher.cc -> Please remove this comment.

Line:234, src/flusher.cc -> Please remove this comment.

Line:8, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Remove comment

Line:106, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Remove comment.

Line:135, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Remove comment and delete whitespace

Line:102, src/bgfetcher.hh -> Can we just rename this to shard instead of parentShard?

Line:15, src/kvshard.cc -> maxVBuckets/numShards to lower allocation size

Line:17, src/kvshard.cc -> Please remove this comment.

Line:22, src/kvshard.cc -> We will not support the auxUnderlying for 2.0.2. Please remove it.

Line:31, src/kvshard.cc -> I think we should stop the flusher and bgfetcher here if they are not already stopped.

Line:41, src/kvshard.cc -> Please remove this comment.

Line:105, src/flusher.hh -> Can we just change this to be shard instead of parentShard?

Line:20, src/kvshard.hh -> Whitespace.

Line:25, src/kvshard.hh -> Whitespace.

Line:75, src/kvshard.hh -> Remove comment.

Line:195, src/ep.cc -> Please align these variables.

Line:262, src/ep.cc -> Please align these variables.

Line:519, src/ep.cc -> I think we need to have failure logic for the functions below since I don't think it would be right to have half the flushers stop and just return a failure. It seems like these should be all or nothing.

Line:1951, src/ep.cc -> Don't we need to reset all of the kvstore's

Line:1977, src/ep.cc -> I think we can just reset all of the kv stores and looping isn't necessary.

Line:2409, src/ep.cc -> Please move this to VBucketMap class and make sure it returns the same results no mater how many shards there are.

Line:2419, src/ep.cc -> We don't need an assert here since getShard should never return null. It will also just crash at the next line anyways.

Line:2425, src/ep.cc -> We don't need an assert here since getShard should never return null. It will also just crash at the next line anyways.

Line:2652, src/ep.cc -> Let's get rid of these two functions below.

Line:141, src/vbucketmap.cc -> As discussed we need to refactor the functions below.

Line:129, tests/module_tests/mutation_log_test.cc -> Since these tests are disabled please remove this.

Line:541, src/ep.hh -> Let's add back these functions, but with your new logic here. I think it would be better to have them inlined since they are short.

Line:160, src/ep.hh -> Let's remove startVb0 since we just get this from the config anyways and this is passed with the engine.

Line:789, src/ep.hh -> This variable should be in the VBucketMap

Line:89, Makefile.am -> Whitespace

Line:12, src/vbucketmap.hh -> I don't think the VBucketMap should have EventuallyPersistentStore as a friend. Can you explain why this is necessary? In other words would it be wrong to make add some extra public functions so that we wouldn't need a friend class?

Line:32, src/vbucketmap.hh -> Whitespace.

Patch Set 2: (33 inline comments)



Line:3301, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done - next commit for sure ;)

Line:35, src/flusher.cc -> Done

Line:224, src/flusher.cc -> Done

Line:234, src/flusher.cc -> Done

Line:8, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Done

Line:106, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Done

Line:135, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Done

Line:102, src/bgfetcher.hh -> Done

Line:15, src/kvshard.cc -> will do but must first convert this from array to std::list or std::map in order to correctly access populated elements. will consider the conversion in following commits.

Line:17, src/kvshard.cc -> Done

Line:22, src/kvshard.cc -> Done

Line:31, src/kvshard.cc -> Done - original code (2.0.1) didn't even bother to log this error case however. And, bgfether doesn't implement running stats (run, stopping, stopped, etc). Thanks for pointing this out.

Line:41, src/kvshard.cc -> Done

Line:105, src/flusher.hh -> Done

Line:20, src/kvshard.hh -> Done

Line:25, src/kvshard.hh -> Done

Line:195, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:262, src/ep.cc -> DONE.
However I aligned them following the similar coding style seen throughout the src file. If it doesn't match to ep engine standard please let me know.

Line:519, src/ep.cc -> good point, we need to stop the flusher before return a hard failure. thanks.

Line:1951, src/ep.cc -> Actually no. A single reset request from one underlying storage to mccouch is all we need to reset the entire database. Thanks.

Line:1977, src/ep.cc -> this diskFlushAll logic probably need to revisit (taking it to offline discussion), however, without the looping multiple threads can end up requesting expensive reset() operation concurrently (causing mccouch/couchdb to repeat resetting database over and over).

Line:2409, src/ep.cc -> refactored code no longer needs this utility method, removed. thanks.

Line:2419, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:2425, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:2652, src/ep.cc -> will do when add per shard kvstore kvtimings stats.

Line:141, src/vbucketmap.cc -> moved this method to kvshard so ep can directly call each shard's set priority (both high and low) methods. pls see the latest commit and provide more input. thanks.

Line:129, tests/module_tests/mutation_log_test.cc -> Done

Line:541, src/ep.hh -> Done

Line:160, src/ep.hh -> Done - it is outside of this review scope but will remove it anyway.

Line:789, src/ep.hh -> Done - remnant of old commit. thanks for finding this out.

Line:89, Makefile.am -> Done

Line:12, src/vbucketmap.hh -> To have a public method is probably a right way as you stated. I added this for various reasons in the old commit but for now I leave this as friend so ep can directly reference individual shard by vbMap.shards[id]. This avoid to have another getShard(uint16_t by_shard_id). Let's discuss this offline. Thanks.

Line:32, src/vbucketmap.hh -> Done
