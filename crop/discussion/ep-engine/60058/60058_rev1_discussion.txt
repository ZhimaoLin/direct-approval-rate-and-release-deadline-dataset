DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-17766: Fix intermittant stream_test failure

Address two issues:

1) end sequence numbers were incorrect, which could result in not
   having any items in our cursor.
2) Don't check CheckpointMamager::registerCursor() return falue, we
   don't actually care if any other cursors are already registered for
   a given checkpoint (persistence cursor sometimes registers before
   us).
