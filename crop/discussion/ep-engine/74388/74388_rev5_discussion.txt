DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Backfill task leave stream state unchanged

The backfill task must not change the state machine of the active
stream that it is associated with.  In particular:
1) In ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot if a vbucket is not found then
   it should just return, leaving the entity deleting the vbucket to
   set the stream to dead.
2) ActiveStream::completeBackfill should not call
   scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED as this can move the stream into the
   STREAM_IN_MEMORY state.

State machine changes should only be driven by ActiveStream::next,
which is invoked by DcpProducer::getNextItem.

The call to scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED that was invoked in
ActiveStream::completeBackfill when the pendingBackfill flag was true
has been moved to the ActiveStream::backfillPhase function and is
invoked once the current backfill has completed and the pendingBackfill
flag is set to true.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:316, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Maybe make this log more explicit that this is an unexpected transition (so in the context of a whole file of log messages it's more obvious this is not expected to happen).

Line:425, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Similary here.

Line:507, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Is this under lock? If not this is racy, as you could read the pendingBackfill flag, and then if it gets set to true again (by another thread) after calling scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED(), then you'll miss an update as it's then unconditionally cleared at line 506.

Line:508, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style - else should be on same line as the closing if.

Line:167, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> GTest will already print the expected and actual values, prefer to use the message to explain "why" a given value was expected.
