DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Backfill task leave stream state unchanged

The backfill task must not change  the state machine of the active
stream that it is associated with.  In particular:
1) In ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot if a vbucket is not found then
   it should just return leaving the entity deleting the vbucket to
   set stream to dead.
2) ActiveStream::completeBackfill, it should not call
   scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED as this can move the stream into
   STREAM_IN_MEMORY state.

State machine changes should only be driven by ActiveStream::next,
which is invokved by DcpProducer::getNextItem

The call to scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED that was invoked in
ActiveStream::completeBackfill when the pendingBackfill flag was true
has been moved to the ActiveStream::backfillPhase function and is
invoked once the current backfill has completed.
