DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [15/N]: Accurately track meta items within checkpoints

Instead of assuming that a Checkpoint only contains 1 (Open) or 2
(Closed) meta-items, maintain a count of items within each Checkpoint,
and track how many meta-items a CheckpointCursor has read.

This allows us to support an arbitrary number of meta-items within a
Checkpoint, and in any sequence. This feature will be used to add
support for set_vbstate meta-items in a subsquent patches.
