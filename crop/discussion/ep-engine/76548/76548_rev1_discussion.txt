DESCRIPTION

MB-23796: Wait for flusher to avoid stat race

Under full eviction, the stat used for curr items is different to that
used under value eviction. Aditionally, under full eviction, the flusher
updates the relevant stat. This can lead to a race in the test between
the flusher and the test code. For example to test code to get the stats
may run before the flusher can, meaning that the previous operation is
not reflected in the stats, leading to the test failing a check.
