DESCRIPTION

MB-5873 Use single-threaded reference counted pointer if possible

If the reference counted pointer is accessed by only one thread
at any time or accesses to the reference counted pointer
by multiple threads are synchronized by the external lock, it is
better to use single-threaded reference counted pointer that
doesn't have any internal lock and AtomicPointer support.

This new reference counted pointer can be currently used for
Blob and QueuedItem instances.

Line:400, atomic.hh -> Chiyoung, can this be implemented thru subclassing? RCPtr is superclass and SingleThreadedRCPtr is subclass. The function gimme, swap, and cas are virtual function. That way, will save some dup code.

Line:400, atomic.hh -> Good point. I was trying to do it, but I intentionally avoided subclassing because it will cause more unnecessary memory overhead
