DESCRIPTION

MB-5873 Use single-threaded reference counted pointer if possible

If the reference counted pointer is accessed by only one thread
at any time or accesses to the reference counted pointer
by multiple threads are synchronized by the external lock, it is
better to use single-threaded reference counted pointer that
doesn't have any internal lock and AtomicPointer support.

This new reference counted pointer can be currently used for
Blob and QueuedItem instances.
