DESCRIPTION

Unify definitions of dcp smart pointer types.

Move the definitions of the smart pointers to their own
header file to prevent cyclic include problems.

For example stream.h includes producer.h and vice versa, yet
the files need the other files types, which can cause a compilation
failure.
