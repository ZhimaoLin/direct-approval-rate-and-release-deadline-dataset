DESCRIPTION

MB-8012 Fix to unit test failures in set/add/del/WithMeta ops.

We recently made a change in persisting a deletion so that we
put the current epoch timestamp of the deletion in the
expiration field of the key's meta data.

This change fixes the unit test failures due to the above change.
