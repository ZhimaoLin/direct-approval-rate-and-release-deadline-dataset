DESCRIPTION

Remove the unused ONLY_DELETES Document Filter

This option is unused with couchstore and is
not available in forestdb at the moment (created
MB-19681 for forestdb). However since this is an
unused capability, I'm getting rid of this option
and will close the ticket (mentioned above) as
Wont-fix.
