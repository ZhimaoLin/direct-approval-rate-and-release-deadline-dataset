DESCRIPTION

MB-24034 [Ephemeral]: Fix incorrect NumDeletedItems after un-delete

In an Ephemeral bucket, if an item is created, deleted, and then
re-created, the numDeletedItem count in the SeqList is incorrect - we
fail to decrement the deleted item count when it's re-created.

Line:292, src/linked_list.cc -> Wouldn't it be better to do this in updateHighSeqno() itself ?
This stat would be updated along with the new seqno added

Line:292, src/linked_list.cc -> The issue is that in updateHighSeqno you don't have the old (previous) item's deleted state; so we'd have to change it to add a new argument. At that point it's not really "updateHighSeqno", it's "updateHighSeqnoAndUpdateNumDeletedItems", and as such seemed clearer/more explicit to move into it's own method.
