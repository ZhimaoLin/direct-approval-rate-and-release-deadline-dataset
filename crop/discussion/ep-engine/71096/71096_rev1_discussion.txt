DESCRIPTION

MB-22016: Defragmenter test tweaks

* try and reduce the heap churn during the test by using the stack
  and DocKey
* Don't check memory changes when running under valgrind as a fixed
  jemalloc and valgrind have made the test fail. This can be forced
  when not running valgrind by setting the JEMalloc quarantine param
  to be the same value it is set to during valgrind runs.

JEMalloc - no valgrind
  opt.quarantine: 0
  opt.redzone: false

JEMalloc - valgrind
  opt.quarantine: 1677721
  opt.redzone: true
