DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-18625: Do not queue mutations into readyQ after a STREAM_END

Once an active stream has been closed, and a STREAM_END message has
been added into the active stream's readyQ, its checkpoint processer
task that may have been scheduled should not add any more items into
the readyQ.
