DESCRIPTION

MB-14140: Add stats for total Couchstore IO bytes read and written

The existing IO stats (io_{read,write}_bytes only measure the amount
of 'user' data (document, key, value and metadata) written. While
useful for some use-cases, these fail to account for the actual amount
of bytes read / written to disk, which can be very useful to measure
and compare to the output of iostat etc.

Add two new stats to CouchstoreStats which measure the 'total' number
of bytes we request the OS to read & write to/from disks:

* io_total_read_bytes - Number of bytes read from disk (total,
  including Couchstore B-Tree and other overheads).

* io_total_write_bytes - Number of bytes written to disk (total,
  including Couchstore B-Tree and other overheads).

These are exposed via the normal `cbstats kvstore` interface:

    rw_0:backend_type:         couchstore
    rw_0:close:                2974
    rw_0:failure_del:          0
    rw_0:failure_get:          0
    rw_0:failure_open:         0
    rw_0:failure_set:          0
    rw_0:failure_vbset:        0
    rw_0:io_num_read:          0
    rw_0:io_num_write:         4998
    rw_0:io_read_bytes:        0
    rw_0:io_total_read_bytes:  16935210    ***
    rw_0:io_total_write_bytes: 2607998     ***
    rw_0:io_write_bytes:       184378
    rw_0:lastCommDocs:         2
    rw_0:numLoadedVb:          0
    rw_0:open:                 2974
