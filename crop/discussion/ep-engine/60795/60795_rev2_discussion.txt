DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-17517: Check for and disard an invalid max_cas in _local/vbstate

If there is an invalid max CAS value on disk (in _local/vbstate),
discard it (resetting it to zero). Instead will need to rebuild the
max CAS value from the items we load from the file.

Note: Ideally we want a unit test for this, which I haven't got to yet, but given the temperature of this issue I wanted to at least put it out for comments asap.
