DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move callers to ht.unlocked_set() from KVBucket to VBucket

set(), replace(), addTAPBackfillItem() and setWithMeta() call
ht.unlocked_set() from KVBucket. It is good to call rather from VBucket
class. By doing this, we can target to break these functions into smaller
ones and hence reuse common code.

Probably worth breaking this into smaller patches (say one for each of set() / replace() / addTapBackfillItem() - easier to test / review / spot regressions down the line.

Line:843, src/kv_bucket.h -> Please add a description of this method.
