DESCRIPTION

During init only let RW instances of kvstore to remove temp files

Do not let RO instances of the couchkvstore even attempt to remove
stale or temporary files during initialization. This would ensure
that there's no spamming of the logs with this message upon warmup:

"A read-only instance of the underlying store was not allowed to delete
a temporary file:.."
