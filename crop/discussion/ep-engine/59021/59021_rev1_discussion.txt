DESCRIPTION

MB-17502: DCP performance regression fixed.

Many patches were added to speed up DCP, however some of that
performance was lost when doing some code tidying without
re-profiling.

With all the DCP performance patches (particuarly) 87869fd39 straight
DCP performance is a touch slower. This is because DCP used to take
one lock and then do work. The new code has more locks, but holds
them for fewer lines of code. This means that DCP is friendlier/fairer
to the other threads interacting with a DCP producer.
The front-end operation threads are no longer stalled for long periods
whilst DCP holds the one lock.

Frontend latency before locking changes:

 === Latency [With background DCP] - 100000 items
                                 Percentile
                   Median     95th     99th  Std Dev
 Add               16.337   34.894   45.241   25.627
 Get                1.226    1.524    1.745    0.435
 Replace           16.311   34.386   42.097    8.435
 Delete            15.636   32.915   41.999    7.408

Frontend latency after locking changes:

 === Latency [With background DCP] - 100000 items
                                 Percentile
                   Median     95th     99th  Std Dev
 Add                3.996   12.159   20.724   11.376
 Get                1.299    1.629    1.730    0.634
 Replace            4.274   12.831   22.988    4.523
 Delete             3.142   10.302   14.292    3.350

The average and 95th/99th are all improved.

Fix details:

The roundRobin/vbReady code has a bufferLog.pauseIfFull call on the
"hot" part of the loop, this is the main cause of the regression.

With that fixed CPU profiling and benchmarking shows that DCP is back
to 3.1.3 levels but highlighted that:

1. DcpProducer::getNextItem was hot (5% of a DcpProducer thread).
2. DcpConsumer::processBufferedItems was hitting SpinLock hard.
   20 to 30% at times was consumed by SpinLock code.

So to address 1. the fix is actually to remove the roundRobin/vbReady
code. It is actually no better and in some cases a little slower than
the orginal. This code is replaces with std:: structures *but* the
Mutex used has a much smaller scope.

Note the DcpProducerReadyQueue has been profiled and proven that having
the std::map powering find() is much faster than searching the list.
This is important because the find method is part of the front-end
operation thread.

To address 2. it was observed that the consumer code is constructing
a passive_stream_t frequently, then testing if there is a pointer.
The construction uses the SpinLock code and can be avoided just by
testing the streams[vb] directly and only then do we construct
a copy of the passive_stream_t. This avoids the SpinLock code on
every iteration of the for loop in the affected function.
