Patch Set 4:

This seems wrong to me.. The datatype should reflect what the data is... Note that the _ONLY_ time you'll see that the _COMPRESSED_ part of the flag is set, is when we've enabled the datatype from the client (and the client set it to compressed and then it should be snappy compressed).. 

To me it means that on the producer side, you should try to compressed documents that is _RAW, and if the result is smaller, change it to _COMPRESSED. If it is JSON, compress it and set datatype to _COMPRESSED_JSON.  On the consumer side you can now inflate it the _compressed_ bit is set.. That should work perfectly well with our current implementation (note that we would have to disable the "auto-inflate" over DCP in memcached that we've got...)
