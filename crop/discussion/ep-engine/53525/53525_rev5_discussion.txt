DESCRIPTION

MB-15662: Compression at producer, uncompression at consumer

corresponding producer will compress all JSON documents
before transmission. On the consumer side, all documents
of JSON type will be uncompressed before processing.

Patch Set 5:

(6 comments)

Line:273, src/dcp/producer.cc -> If the snappy compression fails and a uncompressed value is simply sent to the consumer, then the consumer doesn't know this failure and simply tries to decompress it that will cause the data corruption.

Line:276, src/dcp/producer.cc -> We don't need to free any buffer allocated for snappy compression?

Line:424, src/item.h -> static_cast<uint8_t *>

Line:292, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Where do we free 'value' blob after the decompression?

Line:299, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Where do we free 'val' blob from snappy decompression?

Line:309, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> static_cast<const void *>

Line:273, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I have verified this snappy would fail trying to uncompress an uncompressed document. I could add a test case that would depict this behavior of snappy.

Line:276, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Snappy compression returns a unique_ptr.

Line:292, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Freed as part of the packet.

Line:299, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Not necessary as the output from snappy operations is a unique_ptr.
