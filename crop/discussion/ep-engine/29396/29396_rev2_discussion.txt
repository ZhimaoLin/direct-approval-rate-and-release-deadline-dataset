DESCRIPTION

MB-9237: Fix bucket creation hang with 3 replicas

With new shard based thread change, it can happen that the
total number of threads does not match the total number of
workers set on each bucket.

Hence fix startWorkers() to exit immediately if we have
hit the max limit on the number of IO worker threads
