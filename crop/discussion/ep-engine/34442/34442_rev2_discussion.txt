DESCRIPTION

MB-9993: make warning msg more readable

Today the warning msg returns generic I/O exception which does
not provide any insight of the consequence. This commit simply
modifies warning msg by specifying to which json stat doc we
fail to log the ep_engine stats.

Patch Set 2:

Add back the IO exception output. 

The IO exception output seems a generic runtime exception which gives no clue and actually I am not sure it is platform dependent. (Trond observed it on OS X but not sure if he tried other platforms). As long as the errors do not persist, probably it should be OK?

Patch Set 2:

The code existed since 2.x releases and we didn't see this issue on centos and ubuntu. It seems to me that it is an OSX specific issue. We need to further debug this issue by running cluster_run on OSX, to figure out what the issue is.
