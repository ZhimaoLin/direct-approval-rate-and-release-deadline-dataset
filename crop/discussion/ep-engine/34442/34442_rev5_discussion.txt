DESCRIPTION

MB-9993: make warning msg more readable

Today the warning msg returns generic I/O exception which does
not provide any insight of the consequence. This commit simply
modifies warning msg by specifying to which json stat doc we
fail to log the ep_engine stats.

Wouldn't it be better to rewrite the code to the "normal" IO pattern and then report what the error is? (failed to open the file, did we get an interrupt and we should retry? etc).. 

TO me it is a bit weird to print out a warning telling people to ignore it ;-) Then I'd rather print it out as an info message..

Patch Set 5:

Sure, we can print out errno info by using normal raw IO operations like open, read, write, ... etc. We will address it soon.
