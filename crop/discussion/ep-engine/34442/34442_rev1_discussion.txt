DESCRIPTION

MB-9993: make warning msg more readable

Today the warning msg returns generic I/O exception which does
not provide any insight of the consequence. This commit simply
modifies warning msg by specifying to which json stat doc we
fail to log the ep_engine stats.

Line:887, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Adding a file name is okay, but we still need to log the output from the IO exception. Seems like this issue only happens on the mac OSX. If you already figured out the root cause of this IO exception on mac OSX, can you fix it as part of this commit?
