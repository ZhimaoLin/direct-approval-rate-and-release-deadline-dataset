DESCRIPTION

MB-24394: Peform an unlocked reset of ExecutorThread::currentTask

When performing currentTask.reset with currentTaskMutex held a
lock inversion situation occurs if:

* the task hits a ref-count of 0
* the task owns a VBucketPtr (shared_ptr)
* the VBucket is marked for deferred deletion
* the VBucketPtr hits a ref-count of 0

This occurs because the VBucketPtr deleter will schedule a new task
to delete the VBucket and thus we re-enter the task code with a
different lock ordering (TaskQueue::tMutex->currentTaskMutex vs
currentTaskMutex->TaskQueue::tMutex).

To fix this issue we simply need to not hold the currentTaskMutex
whilst calling currentTask.reset().

We switch ExTask over to being a std::shared_ptr and use its well
define move constructor (via std::move) to move the ref-counted
pointer into unlocked scope, and then reset that.
