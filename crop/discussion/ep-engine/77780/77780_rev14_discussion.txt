DESCRIPTION

MB-24159: Fix segfault in ephemeral backfill

DCPBackfillMemory::run would segfault if the underlying rangeRead
returned no items.

This was because the front and back of the UniqueItemPtr vector were
unconditionally dereferenced even if non-existent. This was to call
getBySeqno().

This patch replaces these calls with the startSeqno and endSeqno
specified when the DCPBackfillMemory task was created. This is
consistent with the behaviour of DCPBackfillDisk.
