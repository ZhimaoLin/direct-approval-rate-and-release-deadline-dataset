DESCRIPTION

Address text_MB-19687_fixed for forestdb as backend

ForestKVStore doesn't have a separate read-only and read-write
instance. CouchKVStore has separate statistics for read-only
and read-write statistics. Make the statistics common to all
KVStore instances. For specific instances, these statistics
just won't get set.
