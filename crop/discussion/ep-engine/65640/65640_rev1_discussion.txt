DESCRIPTION

Address text_MB-19687_fixed for forestdb as backend

ForestKVStore doesn't have a separate read-only and read-write
instance. CouchKVStore has separate statistics for read-only
and read-write statistics. Make the statistics common to all
KVStore instances. For specific instances, these statistics
just won't get set.

Line:6031, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I'm not sure about this - it feels wrong that we have something labelled "read-only" which now has stats for delete, set, etc.

Can we not solve this in a different way - for example just not show *any* 'ro' stats for forestdb, and just have all the statistics show up under 'rw' ?
