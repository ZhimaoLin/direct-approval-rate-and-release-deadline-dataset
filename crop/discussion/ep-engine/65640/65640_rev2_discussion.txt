DESCRIPTION

Address text_MB-19687_fixed for forestdb as backend

ForestKVStore doesn't have a separate read-only and read-write
instance. CouchKVStore has separate statistics for read-only
and read-write statistics. Make the statistics common to all
KVStore instances. For specific instances, these statistics
just won't get set.

Line:1925, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Given our conversation today on different backends, I suggest we make this an explicit `else if (backend == "forestdb")`, and then add an else which cb_assert(false) or similar.

Line:3994, src/ep.cc -> I believe this is all dead code now - please delete.

Line:4001, src/ep.cc -> I like the set approach - very nice :)

Line:4007, src/ep.cc -> Style: you can simplify this to a range-based for:

 for (auto* store : underlyingSet)
