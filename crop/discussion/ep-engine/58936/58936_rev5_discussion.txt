DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 1/4 Add detailed range errors to configuration validation exceptions

This commit improves the exceptions thrown by the configuration's validators to
include a message which more precisely describes why the validation failed.

The purpose of this is to in a subsequent commit expose this message to an end
user modifying the configuration via a SET_PARAM operation.
