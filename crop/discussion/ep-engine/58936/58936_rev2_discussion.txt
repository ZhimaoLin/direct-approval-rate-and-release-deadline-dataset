DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 1/4 Add detailed range errors to configuration validation exceptions

This commit improves the exceptions thrown by the configuration's validators to
include a message which more precisely describes why the validation failed.

The purpose of this is to in a subsequent commit expose this message to an end
user modifying the configuration via a SET_PARAM operation.

Line:169, src/configuration.cc -> Still have a whitespace-only change here (and below) :) 

Additionally our style is a space between "if" and the opening "("

Line:305, src/configuration.h -> Style: Relying on implicit conversion from int to bool isn't always clear - prefer use an explicit bool expression - if (acceptable.size() > 0) ...
