Do you mean that the observer command implementation was reverted from ep-engine?

Patch Set 1:

It wasn't reverted, we just deleted all of the code because the implementation caused a big performance hit. I have a better implementation in my local branch, but I still want to change the design since I think the one I originally came up with is pretty bad.
