DESCRIPTION

MB-20771: Remove unnecessary defragmenter_test operator overloads

The defragmenter & ep_unit tests have their own operator new/delete
overload, to improve interopability with Valgrind (so Valgrind saw
explicit calls our malloc / free).

However the global_new_replacement in platform does this anyway now, so
this code is no longer needed.
