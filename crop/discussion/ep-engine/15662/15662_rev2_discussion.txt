DESCRIPTION

MB-5227 check vbucket pointer before updating its stat

The change is to fix the segfault that can occur during a callback
of an item deletion. When an item deletion is complete and its callback
is invoked, it is possible that the vbucket of the item has already
been deleted thus removed from the vbucketmap. In such case the callback
should not attempt to update any stat of the deleted vbucket (opsDelete).
