DESCRIPTION

MB-18209: Do not let processer task go to sleep indefinitely in case of backoffs

If in case of backoffs due to memory pressure, the vbucket needs to
be re-added back into the DcpReadyQueue, to ensure that the consumer's
processer task picks it up again at a later time. If this isn't done,
it is possible that the processer task may sleep forever with a bunch
of items still sitting in each of the vbucket's passive stream buffers.
