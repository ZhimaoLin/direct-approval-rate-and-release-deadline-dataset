DESCRIPTION

MB-18209: Do not let processer task go to sleep indefinitely in case of backoffs

If in case of backoffs due to memory pressure, the vbucket needs to
be re-added back into the DcpReadyQueue, to ensure that the consumer's
processer task picks it up again at a later time. If this isn't done,
it is possible that the processer task may sleep forever with a bunch
of items still sitting in each of the vbucket's passive stream buffers.

+ Unit test confirming the above

I'd like to get Jim's review of this also, given he's changed this recenty.

Line:105, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Nit / Style: I generally put initialiser list items on their own line (especially once you get into more than one line's worth) - aside from the fact that long, multi-items per line is hard to read, this makes it easier when merging / backporting changes to other branches, as you have a simple addition of a single line instead of having to combine them.
