DESCRIPTION

Disabling expiry pager task to terminate the task

Enabling it back will make the last exp_pager_stime
to go into effect. When exp_pager_enabled is false,
setting exp_pager_stime would update the sleeptime,
but only setting exp_pager_enabled to true would
make the new sleeptime to go into effect.
