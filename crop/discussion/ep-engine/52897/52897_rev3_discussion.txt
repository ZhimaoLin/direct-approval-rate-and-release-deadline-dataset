DESCRIPTION

Disabling expiry pager task to terminate the task

Enabling it back will make the last exp_pager_stime
to go into effect. When exp_pager_enabled is false,
setting exp_pager_stime would update the sleeptime,
but only setting exp_pager_enabled to true would
make the new sleeptime to go into effect.

Line:2184, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This can cause the sporadic unit test failure. Please use the stat utility function "wait_for_stat_to_be..." instead.

Line:422, src/ep.cc -> We don't need to grab the lock when we schedule the expiry pager for the first time.

Line:2169, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Consider using checkeq() instead (here and below); as you give it both the expected and actual arguments separately it produces richer error messages when there's a mismatch.
