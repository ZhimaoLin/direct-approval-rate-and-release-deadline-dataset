MB-20697: Return false if commit2couchstore fails

This ensures that callers are notified of the failure, and
specifically we correctly increment the ep_item_commit_failed stat

Patch Set 2:

The calling code in EPStore::commit() is as follows:

    while (!rwUnderlying->commit()) {
        ++stats.commitFailed;
        LOG(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "Flusher commit failed!!! Retry in "
            "1 sec...\n");
        sleep(1);
    }

which looks like the flusher task will loop infinitely. This shouldn't be the case though because next time commit() is called the pendingReqsQ will be empty so commit2couchstore() is trivial and will return successfully immediately. 

So, net effect of the change is simply to fix the missing increment on the item failed commit counter, log and sleep for a second? The flusher threads will be doing a lot of sleeping, but I guess this is ok, since the disk is down anyway. 

My analysis correct? If so, I think the change is good. Would welcome discussion though.

DaveF,

The analysis seems ok to me.

Line:6466, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I believe it will be, given how we use files (open the directory each time the flusher runs).
