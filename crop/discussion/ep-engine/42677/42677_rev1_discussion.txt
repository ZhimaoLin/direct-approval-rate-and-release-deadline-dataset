DESCRIPTION

MB-12483: Don't allow recreation during vbucket deletion

When we delete a vbucket we have an option to recreate the file
immediately. Doing this is incorrect because we will not know
what the failover log of the new vbucket looks like until we
actually create it in memory. This can lead to a situation where
there is no failover log and as a result the local doc json will
be invalid. If the server is shutdown right after this happens and
then is restarted the vbuckets might be created with garbage values
in some of their fields.

I remember the vbucket recreate path/failover log was causing regressions with cbtransfer (MB-11830). perhaps it's a good idea to check with Parag after this is merged to ensure that regression does not resurface. thanks

Line:547, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> If we don't create an empty new file here, then we need to make sure that a new file is created properly by the flusher or vbucket snapshot task after the vbucket is reset.

Line:547, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We only did this in one place and there is a vbucket snapshot for the new vbucket scheduled right after the delete. If there is anything specific I should look for please let me know since as far as I can tell the current patch set should address this properly.
