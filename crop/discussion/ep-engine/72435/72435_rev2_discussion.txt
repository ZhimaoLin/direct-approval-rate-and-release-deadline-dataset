DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move HashTable::unlocked_addTempItem() to VBucket class

Adding a temp item is not a unique hash table function. It is just an
addition of a new StoredValue of type "StoredValue::state_temp_init"
to hash table.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:1962, src/vbucket.cc -> Style: Prefer something like the following, which will fail to build if EXT_META_LEN ever changes:

 uint8_t ext_meta[EXT_META_LEN] = {PROTOCOL_BINARY_RAW_BYTES};
 static_assert(sizeof(ext_meta) == 1, "expected EXT_META_LEN to be 1");

Line:1969, src/vbucket.cc -> And just drop `ext_len` and simply use `sizeof(ext_meta)`
