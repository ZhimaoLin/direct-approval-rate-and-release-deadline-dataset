Looks good to me. But test seems not enough. We should test this new stat in more unit tests to make sure it works in difference cases.  Please see inline comments.

Line:6128, ep_testsuite.cc -> since we query to get curr_items, shall we also check that? say,
check(curri == 1, "Expect one item")

Line:6137, ep_testsuite.cc -> better to add check(curri == 1, "...")

Line:6145, ep_testsuite.cc -> better to add check(curri == 1, "...")

Line:6275, ep_testsuite.cc -> we should add more tests in this unit test to test "temp_items".

Line:6337, ep_testsuite.cc -> we should add more tests in this unit test to test "temp_items".

Line:6623, ep_testsuite.cc -> we should add more tests in this unit test to test "temp_items".

Line:6686, ep_testsuite.cc -> we should add more tests in this unit test to test "temp_items".
