Line:33, src/dcp/producer.cc -> One minor one that can be addressed separately. I think this might be better fit for logic_error as isFull() doesn't actually mean arithmetic overflow errors.

Line:33, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I'm happy to change, however perhaps std::length_error (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/length_error) would be a better choice?
