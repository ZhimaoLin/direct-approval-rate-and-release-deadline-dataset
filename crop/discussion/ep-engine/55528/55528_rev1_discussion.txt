Line:1493, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Its not necessary, but a "break;" at this point perhaps, to avoid further checks?

Line:761, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Not related to this patch, but I think it would be better if we refactored stream_state_t to a class which had the state transition diagram internally with a 

    state_.transit_to(state);

(with a nice textual description on top documenting the legal transitions etc)

Line:1493, src/dcp/stream.cc -> I would say it's necessary.. With the current implementation you can go from pending to pending which doesn't make sense..
