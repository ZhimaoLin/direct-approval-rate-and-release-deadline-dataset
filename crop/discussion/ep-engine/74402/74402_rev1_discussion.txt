DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [9/N]: Revert thread limits to 512

A previous commit for this MB changed the limits to the number of each
type of worker thread to the number of CPU cores available. As this is
not optimal for synchronous, disk bound tasks returning the limit to the
previous 512 until a better limit is determined.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'd be more explicit here (as you were in HipChat) - say this breaks anyone who previously set a higher number of threads.
