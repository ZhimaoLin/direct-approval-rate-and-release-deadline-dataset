DESCRIPTION

MB-11876 Check for new priority buckets after wakeup

If threads do not check for the presence of newly registered
buckets, then a rare race condition can happen where a thread
is unaware of the presence of a low priority bucket and keeps
continously checking the high priority Q which has no work.
This would block normal shutdown
