DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Split setWithMeta operation across KVBucket and VBucket classes

The setWithMeta (non front end set op) is split across KVBucket and VBucket
classes such that the HT operations, conflict resolution and other
in memory operations involved are done in VBucket class.

This is a better abstraction and could help in modularizing HT and
in-memory operations involving sets/deletes and other operations which
involve updating/adding/deleting items.
