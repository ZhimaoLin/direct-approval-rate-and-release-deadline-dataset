DESCRIPTION

Make database file revision number as atomic

KV-engine increments a file revision number every time a ForestDB
file gets compacted. As a file gets compacted, another thread might
want to open a separate database file handle and perform a forestdb
operation. In this case, the other thread needs to atomically read
the file revision number in order to construct the file name.
