DESCRIPTION

Introduce addTmp() method in HashTable class

This method will be used to add a temporary item to the hastable
when a getMetaData() request is received for a key that isn't found
in memory. The temporary item will have no value and will be created
in the meta_pending state so that further getMetaData() requests can
be blocked until the key's metadata is fetched from the underlying
persistent store.

Line:742, stored-value.hh -> I don't think we need to define another enum type here, but instead can simply use the above add_type_t

Line:1393, stored-value.hh -> This is the almost duplicate of the second part of the above add function. I think we can simply call "add(itm, false, false)". As the seqno will be fetched from the disk, it should be fine.
