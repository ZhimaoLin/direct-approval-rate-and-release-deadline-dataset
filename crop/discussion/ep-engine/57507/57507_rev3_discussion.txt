hmm, thinking it's going to really need a merge of 3.0.x, not 3.1.3 to capture the performance changes

I expect we'll need both eventually. Perhaps merge 3.1.3 into 3.0.x first (waiting until 3.1.3 is out so we don't have to do another merge!) and then merge 3.0.x into sherlock. (and then merge sherlock into master !!)

Can you first merge 3.1.3 to 3.0.x and then 3.0.x to sherlock to master? I know "3.0.x" branch name seems inconsistent given that we have 3.1.3 branch, but 3.0.x will be used for 3.1.4 and subsequent minor releases if necessary.

We've done a fine job of confusing the 3.0x branch :S it seems logically that the current 3.0.x branch is what needs to go forward to sherlock, the 3.1.3 branch is redundant?

Patch Set 3:

We've created 3.1.3 branch because 3.0.x has some optimizations that were recently merged. We don't want to take a potential regression from those optimizations for 3.1.3 release given that we had only one week for 3.1.3 release.

3.0.x naming is the one suggested by the build team and they emailed the entire engineering team before to get any feedback or concerns.

I just checked 3.1.3 branch and don't think we need a merge from 3.1.3 to sherlock because 3.1.3 has only three commits that were backported from 3.0.x branch. Instead, it seems to me that we need a merge from 3.0.x to sherlock to master.

Like Chiyoung mentioned, we need to merge 3.0.x to sherlock.
