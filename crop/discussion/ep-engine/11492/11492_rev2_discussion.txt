DESCRIPTION

MB-4378: ep-engine is printing garbage in debug mode

This was caused by a log message that printed out what stats
calls were being made. Since we have a default stats command with
no extra argument this was printing out "(null) 0". This debug
line isn't really neccessary so I'm just going to remove it.
