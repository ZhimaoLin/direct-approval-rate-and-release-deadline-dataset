DESCRIPTION

MB-4378: ep-engine is printing garbage in debug mode

This was caused by a log message that printed out what stats
calls were being made. Since we have a default stats command with
no extra argument this was printing out "(null) 0". This debug
line isn't really neccessary so I'm just going to remove it.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

Please change the subject to "Print a debug message if stat key isn't null"

Line:3154, ep_engine.cc -> Then, we need to check
if (stat_key != NULL) {
    getLogger()->log(EXTENSION_LOG_DEBUG, NULL, "%s %d", stat_key, nkey);
}
