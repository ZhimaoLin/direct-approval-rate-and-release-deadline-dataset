DESCRIPTION

MB-12562: Avoid terminating all writer threads

With incremental writer thread scheduling, we
need to make sure that all writer threads aren't
deleted with multiple buckets.

Scenario:
- maxWriters is 4
- create bucket 1, numWriters=1
- create bucket 2, numWriters=2
- create bucket 3, numWriters=3
- create bucket 4, numWriters=4
- create bucket 5, numWriters=4
- delete bucket 5, numWriters=3
- delete bucket 4, numWriters=2
- delete bucket 3, numWriters=1
- delete bucket 2, numWriters=0, => change ensures 1
- delete bucket 1, numWriters=1

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Scenario:
- maxWriters is 4
- create bucket 1, numWriters=1
- create bucket 2, numWriters=2
- create bucket 3, numWriters=3
- create bucket 4, numWriters=4
- create bucket 5, numWriters=4
- delete bucket 5, numWriters=3
- delete bucket 4, numWriters=2
- delete bucket 3, numWriters=1
- delete bucket 2, numWriters=0, => change ensures 1
- delete bucket 1, numWriters=1


We should start to decrement the number of writers when a bucket 3 is deleted. Otherwise, we will have only one writer even if there are three active buckets.
