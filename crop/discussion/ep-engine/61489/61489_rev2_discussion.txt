implementation.

(5 comments)

Line:109, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.h -> This doesn't appear to be part of the public interface - it looks to be an implementation detail. Can it be moved back to the .cc file?

Line:24, tests/module_tests/couch-fs-stats_test.cc -> Nit: Indent the initialiser list marker by 4 spaces.

Line:31, tests/module_tests/couch-fs-stats_test.cc -> Nit: Not a big deal, but it's probably cleaner to create a StatFile constructor and assign all these member variables there.

Line:291, CMakeLists.txt -> Nit: the style is to keep the closing bracket at the end of the final line.

Line:293, CMakeLists.txt -> From my reading of https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_include_directories.html,  PUBLIC is only needed when the specified headers are part of the public interface of the target. Admittedly this is only a test program, but I think PUBLIC is unnecessary - should be fine with PRIVATE.
