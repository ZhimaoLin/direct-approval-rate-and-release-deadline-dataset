DESCRIPTION

Introduce basic tests for python tools

Adds tests which run cbstats and cbepctl to confirm they are both
valid Python 2.6 code. These are /very/ minimal tests, and essentially
test only for correct syntax and resonable functioning of the "--help"
code path. They do not assert anything beyond syntactic correctness for
code outside this coverage.
