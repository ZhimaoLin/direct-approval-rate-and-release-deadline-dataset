DESCRIPTION

MB-4772 Fix to handle backfill for closed checkpoint only tap

rollback() method was clearing the taplog items when a tap
connection is restablished in order to reset the cursor back to
the start of current checkpoint. Due to this condition, when
backfilled items are added to the taplog, it was getting cleared and
hence backilled mutations where never sent through the tapconnection
since it is empty. This patch adds a condition to handle backfill
with closed checkpoint only tap cursor.
