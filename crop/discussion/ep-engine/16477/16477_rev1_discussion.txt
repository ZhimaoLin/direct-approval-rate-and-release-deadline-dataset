DESCRIPTION

MB-4209: Evict command returns an error when key is dirty

We were returning success for for the evict command when a key
was dirty. As a result the item was not ejected, but returning a
success here is confusing. We now return EEXISTS for this case.

Line:806, ep.cc -> Looks like "Key Exists" is not the reason it cannot be evicted. The actual reason is that item is dirty or small. Err code like "operation failure " makes more sense to me. If no  better  error code to use, shall we create a new one to cover such failed operations?
