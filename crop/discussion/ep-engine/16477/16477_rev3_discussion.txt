DESCRIPTION

MB-4209: Evict command returns an error when key is dirty

We were returning success for for the evict command when a key
was dirty. As a result the item was not ejected, but returning a
success here is confusing. We now return EEXISTS for this case.

Patch Set 3:

Sorry for the whitespace. I saw it when I put the code up and didn't get a chance to fix it in time before someone else pointed it out.
