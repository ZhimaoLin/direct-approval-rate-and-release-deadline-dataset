DESCRIPTION

MB-9866 StoredValue now contains queued_item instance.

Use reference-counted Item (queued_item) class inside StoredValue
class so that CheckPoint Manger and Hashtable can share keys and
metadata of items instead of keeping separate copies.
This will greatly decrease memory usage for cases where there
is big number of small sized items.
