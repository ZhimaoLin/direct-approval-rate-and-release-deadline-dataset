Patch Set 1:

(7 comments)

We should also break down this commit a little bit more. I think it would make sense to have a commit for each command that gets added.

Line:31, src/upr-consumer.cc -> This stream should already have the UprConsumer stored in the engine specific field since the open connection command should be called first. I will add the code to store the engine specific in the open connection function for the previous change set. If there is no upr connection then we should return ENGINE_DISCONNECT.

Line:43, src/upr-consumer.cc -> The add stream command needs to initiate a handshake with the producer and should not add a vbucket to the stream list until that stream has successfully started.

Line:87, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:120, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:2533, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> All of these test cases should be added into the testsuite.

Line:2535, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> We need to do an open connection here, insert some items into the vbucket, and then call the upr flush command to verify that items are actually getting flushed.

Line:2551, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> We should insert a key and then check to make sure it is actually deleted.
