Line:991, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Same comment as the other one. We may end up persisting the wrong max CAS value.

Line:990, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Abhinav,

We should get a vbucket state from the cached array here because the cached array contains the most recent max CAS value among deleted items. It seems to me that this bug exists even before this change.
