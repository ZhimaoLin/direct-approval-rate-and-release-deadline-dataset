DESCRIPTION

MB-13910: In DCP consumer, if possible, process DCP message without buffering

If all DCP messages are put on buffer on consumer side and then batch processed
we might see spikes on producer side, due to the flow control.
Hence it seems better we process messages directly without putting them on
the buffer.

This  looks good to me, but we need to do some further verification before merging this. In particular we should create a toy build and run performance tests to verify that this change improves performance. Second, we should run some sanity tests against this. We should be able to do this with the toy build you created for the performance testing.

I found a couple of issues. Please take a look at them.

Line:378, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> err !=  ENGINE_TMPFAIL?

Line:196, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> i'm not sure if this condition is correct or not. If err is ENGINE_SUCCESS, then we treat it as a failure? It seems to me that if a given message was successfully processed without buffering, then we always print out the warning log here.
