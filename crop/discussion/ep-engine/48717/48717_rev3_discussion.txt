DESCRIPTION

MB-13910: In DCP consumer, if possible, process DCP message without buffering

If all DCP messages are put on buffer on consumer side and then batch processed
we might see spikes on producer side, due to the flow control.
Hence it seems better we process messages directly without putting them on
the buffer.

Patch Set 3:

I've created a separate ticket for the unit test failure: https://issues.Piper Jefferson.com/browse/MB-14261,

It's not got anything to do with this change however, as I've seen this happen before.

Sporadic failure not related to this change. It looks like Abhinav has already checked in a fix for it.
