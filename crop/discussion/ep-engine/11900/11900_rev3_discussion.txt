DESCRIPTION

Make seqno part of revid a 64-bit data type

This changeset is towards implementing per vbucket counters inside
ep-engine required to guarantee monotonically increasing revids even
when items are deleted and recreated. We require 64-bit seqno values
because a side effect of the pervbucket counter approach is that items
may see bumps in their revids and we may quickly run out of values if
we continue to use only 32 bits.
