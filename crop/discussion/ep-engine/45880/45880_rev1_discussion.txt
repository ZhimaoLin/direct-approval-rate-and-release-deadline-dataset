DESCRIPTION

observe_seqno: Fix spurious byteswap conversions

This was causing a crash since the nested conditionls would be
performing ntoh{s,ll} on an already converted value.

Line:4700, src/ep_engine.cc -> vb_id = htons(vb_id)

Line:4662, src/ep_engine.cc -> I don't think these extra variables are required.

Line:4662, src/ep_engine.cc -> They aren't strictly required, but not having them would mean you need to use 'req->message.header.request.vbucket' and similar on output. I personally find that very annoying to read.. but there might be guidelines elsewhere.

Line:4662, src/ep_engine.cc -> What I meant was, you could do something like this: 

vb_id = req->message.header.request.vbucket; 

vb_id = ntohs(vb_id); 

...

vb_id = htons(vb_id); 

Anyhow, the bug here is at line 4700 (base): vb_id = htonll(vb_id),
which should be vb_id = htons(vb_id)

Line:4662, src/ep_engine.cc -> Also lines 4713 and 4714..

line 4700 doesn't even make ep_engine crash -- (though it might end up confusing the client...).

the real problem is that it does a getPersistenceSeqno() for a given vBucket -- where the vBucket is out of bounds .. that given function will assert that the input is not out of bounds ... (which is probably something else you should fix - i.e. do bounds validation before actually crashing memcached)..

I'll leave it up to you.. you could also add to the already duplicated code and do the conversion in a block-local scope for both the failover and non-failover case.. since it's C++ there are other options, etc.

Line:4662, src/ep_engine.cc -> No, we return a NOT_MY_VBUCKET if vb isn't found. 

getPersistenceSeqno gets the persistenceSeqno held by the vbucketmap class. This would not assert as we already do the vb check by then.

getPersistenceSeqno and getHighSeqno would not even run if vb isn't found, so I don't see how they can cause a crash..

Line:4662, src/ep_engine.cc -> First of all, there are two almost identical code blocks - one is executed if there's a failover (L4685-4711), and the other one is executed in the normal case where a current 'uuid' is passed (4711-4723).

After line 4664, the vb_id is already converted into host order (LE). It's used again and again -- then on line 4713 it's converted again into network order (BE), and on line 4715 the BE-formatted vbid is passed into getPersistenceSeqno().

The htonll conversion only happens in the less common block (stale uuid)..
