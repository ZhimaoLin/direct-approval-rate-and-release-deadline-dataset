DESCRIPTION

Don't evict any items from PersistenceCallback.

Due to checkpoint support in 1.7, we should not evict any items
from PersistenceCallback because some of those items might be
visited by TAP cursors.

From 1.7, item eviction are fully controlled by both checkpoint
manager and item pager.
