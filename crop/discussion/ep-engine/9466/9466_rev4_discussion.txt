Patch Set 4: (5 inline comments)



Line:3683, ep_engine.cc -> I don't see any handling of the stale rev flag. Is that intentional because this is just the first draft of the code?

Line:3737, ep_engine.cc -> We're not setting the rev id received in the request i.e., the value of metabytes isn't used anywhere.

Line:139, command_ids.h -> Shouldn't we also define the new commands inside memcached as well? I was thinking CAPI will interact with memcached which in turn will call ep-engine. Please let me know if this isn't correct.

Line:161, command_ids.h -> Just curious: flags will be used to specify reading a stale revision, right? If so, do we need it to be 32 bits long, even factoring in future extensions?

Line:171, command_ids.h -> So, we don't send the expiration time back for regular GET commands? If so, why would we need to send it here?

Line:3683, ep_engine.cc -> Yes, the code currently only describes the packet format... it's not fully implemented, but just to get feedback if you're getting the information you actually need.

Line:3737, ep_engine.cc -> see above

Line:139, command_ids.h -> They will not go into the core memcached namespace. these are application specific. We should however come up with a global headerfile for all our extenssions..

Line:161, command_ids.h -> Yes. Only the future will tell how much we need.. we could for instance add other flags in the future that specifies: hey, just give me the last 2 revs, or that we start adding other metadata than the revisions history, and we could think that we would add potential filters here... This is the _on the wire_ protocol, and I don't think we'll solve world hunger by shaving off three bytes...

Line:171, command_ids.h -> We don't need to.. I just though you might want to know when data is set to expire on the other server. I just nuked this off.
