Patch Set 8:

> if it's not too late can we have get-with-meta return only metainformation ?

Because of the way we plan to do conflict resolution in v1, it makes sense to just return the revision and not the value -- something like a GET-META API instead of GET-WITH-META.

In v2, though, when we intend to add support for custom resolution functions, it may be required to also pass the value along if the function requires it. Perhaps then we could add the GET-WITH-META API.

For now, GET-META would suffice.

Patch Set 8:

When we need both value and meta we'll issue two commands.
