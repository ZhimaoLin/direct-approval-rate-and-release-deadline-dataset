Made a first pass. Will take another look again.

Line:262, stored-value.hh -> Don't we need to take a lock before incrementing?

Line:141, command_ids.h -> Comments need updating.

Line:262, stored-value.hh -> we're running in a locked context

Line:211, item.hh -> This is really a verification routine, right? Perhaps call it verifyMeta()?

Also declare method as const.

Line:238, item.hh -> Declare method as const.

Line:259, stored-value.hh -> When does an item has _isSmall set to true? Since we're not setting seqno for such items, does it mean they cannot be replicated using XDCR?

Line:5430, ep_testsuite.cc -> revid is 20 bytes long not 22, right? 22 bytes is the overall response size.

Line:3720, ep_engine.cc -> Just curious: Why should flags be a mandatory field for getMeta?

Line:160, command_ids.h -> We might still need this. The original idea was to delay updating an item's revid until a read request is received in the form of a GET or a TAP/Persistence cursor traversal.

A variation of GET which specifies that it's okay to read an item with a stale revid is an added optimization for clients that don't care about the revid at all.

Line:164, command_ids.h -> We should change the name to CMD_GET_ALLOW_STALE_REV.

Line:176, command_ids.h -> Typo in length.

Line:177, command_ids.h -> Minor nitpick: Leading space character.

Line:211, item.hh -> No, it decodes the meta section and assigns the sequence number... but it also use the "checksum" part ;)

Line:238, item.hh -> yeah, it should be..

Line:259, stored-value.hh -> zynga wanted this.. they don't care about cas and other fields. they basically want to store a shitload of items and strip away the fields they don't use. and yes, you would have a problem with the cdcr.

Line:5430, ep_testsuite.cc -> yes.. the "meta-encoding" for revid is 22 bytes long.. depending on how you interpret the comment or not it's either right or wrong as it is ;)

Line:3720, ep_engine.cc -> Because it is easier to be strict on the protocol level than allowing the user to save 4 bytes during transfer.. now that we're ditching the flags it won't be there anymore

Line:160, command_ids.h -> If one didn't care about the revid, why would one call this function at all? but we can probably drop it..

Line:164, command_ids.h -> Ditching this..

Patch Set 12: (5 inline comments)

Changes look good to me. Good to go after fixing a few minor pending things.

Line:211, item.hh -> Oh, right. I missed the fact that we're setting member variables.

Line:259, stored-value.hh -> Ok. I'll speak to Frank and Sharon so that they understand this.

Line:5430, ep_testsuite.cc -> Ok :)

Let's do whichever would be good from a code readability point of view.

Line:141, command_ids.h -> I don't see the updated comments. Is it just me?

Line:160, command_ids.h -> Oh.. I meant the GET command not GET_META.

If we go down the route of lazily updating revids, then certain clients that don't care about revids could call something like GET_ALLOW_STALE to get the value with possibly a stale revid so that ep-engine wouldn't have to worry about updating the revid just yet.

We could ditch this, though, like you said.
