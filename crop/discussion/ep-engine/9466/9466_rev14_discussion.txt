Patch Set 14:

1. What's the effort estimate for the mc-kvstore changes?
2. From a purely ep-engine perspective, would the regression tests be more effective if the mc-kvstore changes are also in place? Of course, since mccouch hasn't been modified yet, we wouldn't be passing revids to it just yet.

Patch Set 14: (4 inline comments)



Line:263, stored-value.hh -> Hmm, we will lose the seq number S2 retrieved from setWithMeta if we increment the current seq number S1 in hashtable and overwrite S2 with (S1 + 1)

Line:173, sqlite-kvstore/sqlite-strategies.cc -> I probably missed something, but not sure if we need seq number for sqlite database. If we need it for the future use, I think it should be fine.

Line:3740, ep_engine.cc -> As we only need to retrieve the meta data that is always maintained in hash table regardless of an item's residence, we don't need to block getMeta call for non-resident items. I think we can add something like "getMeta(...)" to EventuallyPersistenceStore class to return the meta data of a given item regardless of its residence.

Line:169, command_ids.h -> Looks like this definition is the same as protocol_binary_response_no_extras from memcached. Can we just change it to "typedef protocol_binary_response_no_extras protocol_binary_response_get_meta;" ?
