DESCRIPTION

MB-16338: Improve test_defragmenter logging and robustness

Improve the logging upon failure in test_fragmenter, and argjust some
of the test parameters to (hopefully) make it more robust and no
longer occasionally fail:

- Log the actual values of mapped bytes when the check fails
- Release any free memory at the start of the test (to hopefully have
  a more stable baseline memory usage.
- Use std::unordered_map instead of std::map (which should allocate
  less objects).
- Increase the number of documents operated on (from 40k to 50k) to
  give us more 'document' memory above the baseline.
- Start with the defragmenter disabled and only explicitly trigger
  when required, to present any 'early' defragmenter runs.
