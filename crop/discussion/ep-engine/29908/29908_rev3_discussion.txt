DESCRIPTION

Create uprConnMap before EventuallyPersistentStore is initialized

When EventuallyPersistent store is initialized it creates a job
that will persist engine stats periodically. As a result we need
to make sure an uprConnMap exists before creating the
EventuallyPersistentStore so that the stats tap call won't cause
a crash.
