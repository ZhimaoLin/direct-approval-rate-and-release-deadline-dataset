DESCRIPTION

(partially) intergrating couchdb backend with a mock MC engine into unit test suite

Introduce a mock MC engine and integrate it with CouchKVStore for the unit ep-engine test.
A virtual class namely AbstractEngine is created to define interface of mock MC engine.
Reorganize the unit test cases into two categroies: tests for all backends (sqlite and couchdb),
and tests for sqlite backend only.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

I haven't read all of it, but this approach means that we're testing another code path than we're running.. We shouldn't change anything inside ep-engine to make it use the mock server instead, but the engine test suite should "start" the mock server and make it available the same way as used by the other mechanism.. Then we need test cases that verifies that the code still works if the "external" service is unstable and "crash" (socket disconnects with partially read/written buffers etc)

Line:2, couch-kvstore/mock-engine.cc -> The first include file should be "config.h" it defines stuff that may change behavior on stuff (like __EXTENSIONS__ etc)

Line:5168, ep_testsuite.cc -> You should fix the testcases instead (rename the existing one if its no longer appropriate for couch (and skip it for couch), then create the equivalent test for your backend)

Line:5193, ep_testsuite.cc -> Why the indentation?

Line:5282, ep_testsuite.cc -> I find it harder to add/update testcases when that means updating multiple files. The resulting .cc file would not be self-contained and compilable so I dislike this..

Patch Set 2:

Trond, that's a great idea. I'm going first using a non-network mock to get it all working , then we'll mock using the same network interfaces (or whatever the communication channel ends up being).
