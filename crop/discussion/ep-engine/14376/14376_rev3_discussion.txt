DESCRIPTION

(partially) intergrating couchdb backend with a mock MC engine into unit test suite

Introduce a mock MC engine and integrate it with CouchKVStore for the unit ep-engine test.
A virtual class namely AbstractEngine is created to define interface of mock MC engine.

and tests for sqlite backend only.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(7 inline comments)

I've only looked at ep_testsuite.cc and I'd like the following fixed before we move on... (and please reformat the commit message to make the lines a bit shorter... I believe you get warnings right now?? (tip press esc-q in emacs to make it wrap it properly for you :) )

Line:34, ep_testsuite.cc -> Does this exists on win32?

Line:795, ep_testsuite.cc -> Isn't this debug output?

Line:5137, ep_testsuite.cc -> shouldn't this go in rmdb?

Line:5153, ep_testsuite.cc -> I'd prefer us to use the same backend...

Line:5174, ep_testsuite.cc -> Should be moved to rmdb...

Line:5183, ep_testsuite.cc -> THis will remove all  sqlite tests...

Line:5275, ep_testsuite.cc -> Please move the code back here where it belongs. those .cc-files can't be compiled by themselves and should therefore not be stored in the filesystem as .cc files...

Trond, this is a work in progress. No plans to submit yet, just getting some change I made back in so Junyi can make more progress.
