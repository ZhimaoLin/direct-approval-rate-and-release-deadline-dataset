DESCRIPTION

integrating couchstore with a mock MC engine into unit test suite

Introduce a mock MC engine and integrate it with CouchKVStore for the
unit ep-engine test. A virtual class namely AbstractEngine is created
to define interface of mock MC engine. Reorganize the unit test cases
into two categroies.

Patch Set 10: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(6 inline comments)

I have a few comments please check them before merging. Otherwise, I think the code is ready for review by wider audience. Thanks!

Line:563, ep_engine.h -> Couchbase coding standard suggest we do commenting codes minimally. You may want to double check with Damien and Chiyoung about it.

Line:16, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> You may not need to include mock-engine.hh && mc-engine.hh, since already included abstract-engine class?

Line:430, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Above changes made into the master already, aren't they?

Line:3256, ep_engine.cc -> strncmp(stat_key, "couchdbmock", 11)

Line:3824, ep_engine.cc -> We may want to check if the backend is couchdbmock only if the return case is false.

Line:190, Makefile.am -> I don't think you need couchstore dependency to build mock engine, right?

Line:4, couch-kvstore/mock-engine.hh -> you should use an mock engine that provides a listening socket the other engine can connect to. That way we can test the code we'll be running on our cluster instead of just bypassing it.

Line:564, ep_engine.h -> getWarmingUpState and returning bool?? When I read that function name I wouldn't expect it to return a boolean value.. isWarmingUp() or something makes it more intuitive that it is returning a boolean value.. I haven't looked at the implementation of it, but I would also assume that it should be const...

Line:815, ep_testsuite.cc -> WHy add dead code?

Line:898, ep_testsuite.cc -> Why add dead code?

Line:5175, ep_testsuite.cc -> move to rmdb

Line:5193, ep_testsuite.cc -> 0777 should be replaced with the correct constants

Line:5216, ep_testsuite.cc -> The space should be after if and before (, but not after (

Line:5262, ep_testsuite.cc -> WHy add dead code?

Line:5263, ep_testsuite.cc -> this should be part of rmdb

Line:5330, ep_testsuite.cc -> No.. you should rather add the missing commands to the mock I uploaded to Jasmin Rangel...

Line:5364, ep_testsuite.cc -> What's the motivation behind this, and why is it part of such a change. It just makes it harder to add a testcase, move a testcase...

Line:721, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This code means that we will not be testing the same stuff we're running. With this test you're completely bypassing all of the network problems we may have in order to connect to mccouch, mccouch crashing on you etc. You should use the mock server the way I uploaded to Jasmin Rangel earlier today

Line:1241, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Where else could it go?

Line:1171, ep.cc -> Remove this

Line:1, t/unit-test-backend-all.cc -> DON'T PUT THIS IN A SEPARATE FILE!

Line:2, t/unit-test-backend-sqlite.cc -> DON'T PUT THIS IN A SEPARATE FILE!

Line:3, abstractengine.hh -> I don't see the point of this class...

Line:25, kvstore.cc -> no.. use couchdb.. the test framework should provide the mock

Line:36, configuration.json -> remove this

Line:3256, ep_engine.cc -> Don't use a separate backend name for testing it..

Line:3818, ep_engine.cc -> NO NO NO NO NO

We should not use textual sting comparison every time this function is called. This function is called a lot of times and we don't change the backed @ runtime.

Line:3823, ep_engine.cc -> What kind of style is this?? Please use the same coding style as used elsewhere in the file..

Patch Set 10:

Junyi, good attempts to make it work. My concern is that this would add more complexities to our testing framework. The testing framework should have the mock server that can simulate various behaviors that can happen on the network connection.

I merged Trond's mccouch mock server implementation and his another change that can test both sqlite and couchstore backends. All the unit tests except for a couple of cases are passed with couchstore. I will fix those failures soon. Anyway, let's discuss it more on Monday.

Patch Set 10:

Junyi, as we discussed, please abandon this change. We should extend the couchKVStore unit tests on top of mccouch mock server.
