DESCRIPTION

Delete uncommitted log items from hash table and data store.

If a crash happens while writing items into the underlying data
store and the mutation log, there might be uncommitted items from
the mutation log. For consistency, we simply delete those
uncommitted items from the hash table and underlying data store.

Patch Set 1:

I don't expect that there are lots of uncommitted items from the mutation log. In the worst case, the number of uncommitted items should be equal to the transaction size. We can recover some of them by performing background fetches from the data store, instead of deleting them from hash table and the data store. Please let me know if you have a better suggestion on this.
