DESCRIPTION

Delete uncommitted log items from hash table and data store.

If a crash happens while writing items into the underlying data
store and the mutation log, there might be uncommitted items from
the mutation log. For consistency, we simply delete those
uncommitted items from the hash table and underlying data store.
