DESCRIPTION

MB-24246: Combine 'writeLock' & 'highSeqnosLock' into one in BasicLinkedList

Functionally 'writeLock' and 'highSeqnosLock' both result in the
serialization of the BasicLinkedList write and other list operations.
Hence this commit combines the 2 locks into one lock.

As a consequence this commit ensures that the writeLock is held on
the BasicLinkedList until the sequence number for the newly added,
updated and soft-deleted is generated.

The commit also adds documentation regarding the desired heirarchy of
the lock acquisition in BasicLinkedList.
