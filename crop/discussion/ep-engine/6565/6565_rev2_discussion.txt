DESCRIPTION

Invoke notifyIOComplete upon receiving an item from disk backfill

When the disk backfill thread fetches an item from disk, it should
invoke notifyIOComplete() to notify it to the paused TAP connection.

Otherwise, it can be blocked for 200 sec that is the default TAP
NOOP interval. Consequently, this causes EVBucketMigrator to be
timed-out (60 sec) and exited.
