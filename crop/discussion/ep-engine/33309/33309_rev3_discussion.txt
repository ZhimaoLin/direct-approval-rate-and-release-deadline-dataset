Line:122, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I'm not sure why we need to grab the stream lock to read the connectivity bool flag. This stream lock is not used when wet set or reset the flag in the connection map. You may want to declare the flag as volatile instead. I saw a bunch of places that we grab the lock unnecessarily.
