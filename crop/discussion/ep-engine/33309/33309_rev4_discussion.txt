Patch Set 4:

After reviewing the comments I think I got a little bit carried away with the locks. The reason I added them was due to some forward thinking in terms of how I could add a few other features. If we merged this change I don't think there would be much contention due to the fact the two threads will very rarely (maybe never) end up trying to grab the same lock. In any case these lock additions don't belong in this change. I will remove them and re-add them if needed in another change that actually needs them.

I gave this a try with pyupr.  dupe-connection test passing now although there's a compilation error(see comment)

Line:275, src/upr-producer.cc -> wants: active_stream_t
