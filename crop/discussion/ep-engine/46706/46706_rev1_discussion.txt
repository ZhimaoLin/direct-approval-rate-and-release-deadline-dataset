Line:85, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> We should add these into the configuration. One of the values should be the percentage of memory size that we allow for backfill overhead. The other should be the maximum amount of backfills we allow.

Line:187, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Size in a list is O(n)

Line:77, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> This needs to track backfills per bucket. I think we can add this variable and a counter into the EventuallyPersistentEngine instance.
