DESCRIPTION

Clear any stale DCP data before running dcp_stream

This fix is intended to address a sporadic failure seen
in tests:
- test dcp replica stream backfill
- test dcp replica stream in-memory
- test dcp replica stream all

..where a the ADD_STREAM_RSP (0x51) message is the last op
received by the replica vbucket, and when a producer is set
up at it, if no message has been received from it yet, the
test fails on this error:
    "Test failed: `Unknown DCP operation: Q' (false)"
