Patch Set 1:

I'm not sure why this didn't go in.

We did merge 2 more changes into 3.0.x after this, so I crushed all the remaining 3.0.x changes (that aren't in sherlock yet) into a single merge here: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/57671/.

Patch Set 1:

I think this couldn't be merged because it depended on another merge (that was already submitted), I'm not sure however. I've crushed this and the one that's dependent on this into:
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/57671/.

I thin the issue is U re-worked the commit message on the previous merge commit from the Jasmin Rangel web UI).

I will re-submit - given I've already tested my version it's probably best to stick with this one.
