DESCRIPTION

Reinstate bee8f07a - Some minor tidying up around the flusher

simple-test failure.

commit (bee8f07a).

The orginal commit message for bee8f07a follows:
<begin bee8f07a>
Refactor: Some minor tidying up around the flusher
1. Use a enum class for state
2. Tidy some of the exception and log messages
3. Remove the need for bucket::commit to re-look up the KVStore
<end bee8f07a>
