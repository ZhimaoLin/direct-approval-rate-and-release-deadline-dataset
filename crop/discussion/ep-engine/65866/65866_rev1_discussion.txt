DESCRIPTION

MB-20182: Update checkpoint snapshot correctly during TAP backfill

When we do a TAP backfill we must update checkpoint snapshot start
and end correctly. Otherwise, if we immediately proceed to DCP
after TAP backfill, the checkpoint mgr will have incorrect combination
of {snap_start, snap_end, vb_high_seqno}
