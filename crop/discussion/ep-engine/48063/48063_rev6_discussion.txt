Line:5438, src/ep_engine.cc -> This will cause the server to send cas 0 if ret == ENGINE_SUCCESS, but extra meta is not requested.

Line:9301, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't understand exactly why last_seqno is still same. Shouldn't it be high_seqno + 2?

Line:9301, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Then, I don't understand why NULL cookie should receive a sequence number. The test code doesn't look clear to me.

Line:9301, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> When mock_unknown_command is called with a NULL cookie, create_mock_cookie() is invoked to create a new cookie. By default, sending extras is enabled.

Line:9301, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Then, I don't think this is a good way of enabling or disabling the extra metadata in our test suite. I'm not sure why creating a connection cookie before calling mock_unknown_command disables the extra metadata.

Line:9301, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Okay. Would disabling the extra metadata by default be more agreeable? In the test, whenever we want extra metadata, it can be enabled explicitly.
