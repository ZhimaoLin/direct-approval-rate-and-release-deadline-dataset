(5 comments)

I think the pre_expiry hook approach is correct, but I'm concerned about the efficiency of it - see the suggestions below for simplifying / making more efficient.

Line:26, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> I assume this is unused - please remove.

Line:722, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Nit: Prefer declaring as late as posible - e.g.

 std::string xattr_data = to_string(xattr_value);

or even:

 auto xattr_data = to_string(xattr_value);

See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-introduce and http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#a-nameres-initaes22-dont-declare-a-variable-until-you-have-a-value-to-initialize-it-with

Line:728, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> There should be no need for sleeps in the single-threaded tests - the whole point of them is you can explicitly control the scheduling of tasks - not to mention that this immediately makes the test take at least 2 seconds to run :(

Suggest you instead just "time-travel" the ep-engine clock forward by 2 seconds - or actually in this case you can just explicitly specify the time you want "now" to be in the call to deleteExpiredItem - see the `startTime` argument).
