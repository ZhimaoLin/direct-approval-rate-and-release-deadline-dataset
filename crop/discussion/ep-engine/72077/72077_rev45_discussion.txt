Patch Set 45: Code-Review+1

Code looks fine - just a couple of minor suggestions.

Line:50, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Nit: Keep alphabetical (as much as it already is!)

Line:759, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Please flip the order of these args - expected value is the first, actual value is the second.
