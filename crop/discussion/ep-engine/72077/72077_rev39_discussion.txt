Line:397, src/vbucket.cc -> From a design perspective I don't think we should filter out any items here, but pass _all_ items to the callback.

Patch Set 39: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Code looks good. I think we need to check the revision IDs are correct after changing the body though, otherwise that could confuse clients / XDCR.

Line:420, src/vbucket.cc -> We should check if this is correct - logically the deleted item (with it's XATTRs) should have a different revision to the previous one. Could you add some checks to the tests you wrote that the revision changes when the value changes?

Line:136, src/item.cc -> Nit: Please keep these in the same order as they are defined in item_info (so it's easy to see they match).

(Ideally we'd add a constructor to item_info and use that, but that can be done down the line).
