Line:416, src/vbucket.cc -> Note that memcached cannot directly allocate any memory which is to be used by ep-engine - otherwise our memory tracking / watermarks etc will be incorrect.

memcached either has to call item_allocate() as part of it's callback, or ep-engine has to pass down some memory which memcached can manipulate.

I think the first one (memcached call item_allocate if necessary) is probably the preferred option, as then we only pay a cost for documents which have system XATTRs.

Line:797, src/vbucket.cc -> Given we have to make this check in all places before handlePreExpiry() is called, suggest you simply move those checks to the head of handlePreExpiry.

Line:416, src/vbucket.cc -> Modified pre_expiry callback to take an item_info as it was more preferred. Had to create an item object to pass to the callback.

Line:797, src/vbucket.cc -> Done
