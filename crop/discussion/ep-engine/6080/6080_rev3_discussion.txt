DESCRIPTION

Allow the checkpoint remover to create a checkpoint if required.

The checkpoint remover is periodically scheduled to remove all
closed and unreferenced checkpoints. If the current memory usage
is too high (85% of the max memory size by default), we need to
allow the checkpoint remover to close the current open checkpoint
and create a new checkpoint, because items in the open checkpoint
cannot be evicted from memory. In this way, more closed checkpoints
can be considered by the item pager for eviction.
