DESCRIPTION

MB-11434 distributed sleep on taskQ

Make shared thread pool workers sleep inside their respective
TaskQueue mutexes as opposed to a single global mutex to reduce
the CPU overhead of putting threads to sleep and waking them up.
We still try to wake only as many threads as ready tasks.
First try waking local threads, if still more tasks are ready,
then visit other TaskQueues to wake their sleeping threads

Results in 15% improvement in view operations local testing
Lowered scheduling overhead with larger number of threads
