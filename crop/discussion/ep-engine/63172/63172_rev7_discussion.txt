DESCRIPTION

MB-19255: Only update sendTime if successfully send noop

In the maybeSendNoop function when a DCP producer attempts
to send a noop to a consumer it can receive back
ENGINE_SUCCESS or ENGINE_E2BIG.

We should only set pendingRecv to true and update the
last sendTime if ENGINE_SUCCESS is returned.
