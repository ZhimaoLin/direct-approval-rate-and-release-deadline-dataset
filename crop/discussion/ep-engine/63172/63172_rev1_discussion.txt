DESCRIPTION

MB-19255: Only update sendTime if successfully send noop

In the maybeSendNoop function when a DCP producer attempts
to send a noop to a consumer it can receive back
ENGiNE_SUCCESS or ENGINE_E2BIG.

We should only set pendingRecv to true and update the
last sendTime if ENGINE_SUCCESS is returned.

The patch also simpifies the control-flow of the
maybeSendNoop function.

Line:968, src/dcp/producer.cc -> This function seems to do quite a few things. Might be worth breaking it down into 2 or 3 functions to make it easier to read.

1)  I vote for adding a unit test for this.
2) The change has 2 parts refactoring and bug fix.
     Would be very clean if we had 2 separate commits

Line:965, src/dcp/producer.cc -> This change is only fixing the issue when buffer is full. And so it still does not work per documentation.

Line:968, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Keeping structural change to a minimal in latest patch.  So will not break-up function.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> This change is only fixing the issue when buffer is full.  And so it still does not work per documentation.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
