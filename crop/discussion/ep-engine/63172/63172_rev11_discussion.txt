DESCRIPTION

MB-19255: Only update sendTime if successfully send noop

In the maybeSendNoop function when a DCP producer attempts
to send a noop to a consumer it can receive back
ENGINE_SUCCESS or ENGINE_E2BIG.

We should only set pendingRecv to true and update the
last sendTime if ENGINE_SUCCESS is returned.

(2 comments)

Line:112, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> minor: I think the return type of this function should be simply "bool"

Line:120, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> ditto

As they are minor comments, let's address them later, so that we can include this fix for the beta QE test over the weekend.
