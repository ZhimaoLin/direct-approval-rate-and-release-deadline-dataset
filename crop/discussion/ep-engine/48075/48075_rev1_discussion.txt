DESCRIPTION

MB-13771: Only snooze backfill due to memory after manager tasks

If we are out of memory and need to pause backfilling then we
should at least do all of the backfill manager management tasks
such as moving backfills around and cleaning up dead ones. This
is also a possible fix for the bug mentioned in the head of the
commit message.

Can you please add the unit test if possible? We should keep improving the unit test coverage in the dev side.

It would be extremely difficult to hit this case with any consistency in the current testing framework. To do so I would need to have to have many dead streams in the active queue and at that instant the memory usage would need to be above 90%.

This is something I noticed that could potentially be an issue, but I don't actually have any evidence that this is causing the problem in MB-13771 at the moment.

Looks good. Agree that we need to do backfill mgr mgmt tasks before pausing backfilling.

But not sure if it is a fix for MB-13771. This fix would maybe mask the problem seen in MB-13771 to some extant.

I'm not sure how it would mask the issue, can you describe why you think that would be the case?

What I meant is, we "may be" hitting MB-13771 due to memory corruption, potentially in a high memory use case. This fix could free up the memory usage because we do clean up of dead backfills. This in-turn could delay the MB-13771 issue being seen.

Ok. I've been meaning to run valgrind on ep-engine. I'll do that later today.

I would not like to merge this change until we verify that this fixes the actual issue.
