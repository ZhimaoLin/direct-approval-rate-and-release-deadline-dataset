DESCRIPTION

CBD-80 fix sporadic ep engine unit test failures on Linux

Add test_prepare func, wait_for_warmup_complete, to ensure that loading
of ep_engine completes before running test case. Bulk of test failures
on Linux were due to incomplete warmup of ep_engine prior to running
test cases.

Add wait_for_flusher_to_settle to ensure storing a new item persists on
the underlying database file (disk).
