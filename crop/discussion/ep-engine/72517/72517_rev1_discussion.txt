DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral] ep_test_apis: Make stop_persistence a no-op when Ephemeral

stop_persistence() is called in various places to turn off
persistence, and as a precondition of this it checks that the flusher
has drained all dirty items.

This check hangs forever with Ephemeral buckets, so in that case just
make the function a no-op - persistence is conceptually already
disabled.
