Line:43, src/common.h -> Just clarification, we don't need this condition anymore on 32 bit cygwin/mingw?

Line:60, src/syncobject.h -> Seems like we should adapt this API later such that it gets the relative wait time as its parameter, and then adapt the modules in ep-engine, so that they can pass the relative wait time.

Line:43, src/common.h -> Yes, this method just gives us the "timeout" return value instead of something else. Personally I don't think we need to know if it is a timeout or not (we never used the return value from the wait function).

Line:60, src/syncobject.h -> Yes. I don't think its that hard for us to just say that we want the sleep to be n ms in our code here.. (I just went the easy way initially so that we get the stuff to compile on windows with MSVC)
