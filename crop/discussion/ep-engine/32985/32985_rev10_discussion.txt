DESCRIPTION

Track the number of items per vbucket with the full eviction.

As the full eviction ejects an item from cache completely, we
need a new way of tracking the number of item per vbucket when
the full eviction is chosen.

This change basically adds a new flag to the hash table item
(i.e., StoredValue) to indicate whether an item is newly added
to the cache or not, and then increments the item counter. Then,
the flusher figures out whether the counter should be decremented
because the item already exists on the DB file.

Two very minor comments.

Line:350, src/vbucket.cc -> Just want to double check the above statement is correct.

Line:1420, src/stored-value.h -> We might be able to get rid of this variable and just use numNonResidentItems + numItems.

Line:1420, src/stored-value.h -> Yeah, I was trying to adapt it, but completely forgot. Thanks for a good suggestion.

Line:1420, src/stored-value.h -> It turns out that it is a little tricky because numItems also includes non-resident items in memory whose values are evicted in full eviction mode. Note that even with the full eviction, there are items in cache that are partially evicted. I rather go with the current implementation and will improve it later as I don't want to introduce the regression in tracking the number of items in the value eviction policy.
