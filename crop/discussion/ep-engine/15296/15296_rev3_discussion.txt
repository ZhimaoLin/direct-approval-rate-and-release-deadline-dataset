Patch Set 3:

In PS3,

1. add some comment in ep.cc, per Trond's comment

2. add 3 testcases in ep_testsuit.cc: 

- persist TTL for a resident item using set() 
- persist TTL for a non-resident item using set_meta() 
- two time travelings to make sure item expires as expected

Line:1920, ep.cc -> This isn't a thread safe as we released the hash table partition lock above (lh.unlock()). Please grab the resident info before releasing the lock.

Line:51, ep_testsuite.cc -> i don't think we need to include these header files.

Line:2173, ep_testsuite.cc -> You don't need this function as you can retrieve the key meta data from disk by sending "stats vkey key_name" command to ep-engine.

Line:2213, ep_testsuite.cc -> As mentioned above, we don't need this helper function.

Line:2282, ep_testsuite.cc -> Please remove this step (3) as it's not correct.

Line:5280, ep_testsuite.cc -> Please change the test title to something more meaningful (e.g., test TTL update and persist). We don't use the bug number in the test title.

Line:5280, ep_testsuite.cc -> Actually we do have some regression tests that are named just the bug report number.. I added it a while back..

Line:5280, ep_testsuite.cc -> I see. I didn't know it :) Let's then keep the same convention here.

Line:5280, ep_testsuite.cc -> For a test that test for an explicit bug I like that we're creating "regression tests", but when we add new features it should be listed as a "normal" test case.. So I would normally have added the testcase for the previous patch as a "test setMeta in kvstore", and this one as "mb-5013". It makes it easy to map back into a bug if that testcase fails and we want more information about what it is supposed to do.

Line:2173, ep_testsuite.cc -> Does "stats vkey key_name" fetch meta data from db file if it is resident? Here we want to get it from db file to make sure it is persistent (meta in memory is always correct, which is not part of this fix).

Line:2173, ep_testsuite.cc -> vkey == "verify key".  It's supposed to do that.  If it does not, your test should incorrectly pass before the change is applied and we'll need to fix that bug.
