Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:1919, ep.cc -> I think it would be good to add a comment here on how we can get into the persistence queue with an item that isn't resident and why it's safe to call setMeta... we know it today, but might not remember why in a few months from now..

Line:2200, ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't see how this tests your new function and not the old store mechanism? I would expect isResident() to return true here, causing it to use the "old" way of storing data to disk...

Patch Set 1:

Trond, you are right. This PS is not complete yet and I will add more testcases (that is why I did not add any reviewer yet, but you reviewed it a bit too early :-))
