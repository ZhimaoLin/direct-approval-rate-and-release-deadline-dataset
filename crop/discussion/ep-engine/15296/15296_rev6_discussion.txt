Patch Set 6:

In PS6, 

1) use "vkey" to check persisted exptime. 
2) query item residence before we free lock

BTW, I tried "vkey" after backing out the fix, the test failed as expected, hence it indeed fetched exptime from db file, no bug to fix.

Patch Set 6: Fails

The test failed sporadically:

Running test bug MB-5013... ep_testsuite.cc:2174 Test failed: `Failed to get stats.' (h1->get_stats(h, cookie, statkey1, strlen(statkey1), add_stats) == ENGINE_SUCCESS)
