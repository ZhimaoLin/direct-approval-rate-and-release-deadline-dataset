Looks like strlen() does not return length of a std::string.c_str() correctly. I rewrote this function and tried more than 10 times locally and it all passed.  


Please verify. Thanks.

Are you suggesting there's either a bug in our C++ compiler or its stdlib?

HI Dustin,

That sounds a bit weird and I could be wrong. In PS6, line 2165, occasionally strlen(statkey1) does not return the correct length of string statkey1, which hence failed the test. But I am not sure why. Did not get chance to look further. 


Thanks,

Junyi

Patch Set 7:

It's generally a mistake to assume the compiler, runtime, OS, etc... is wrong.  There is most likely a bug that was covered up with whatever change has since been made.
