Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Passed the unit tests, but I won't merge this change into the master until the similar API is available from couchstore.

Patch Set 8:

Chiyoung, how about I create a bug to provide set_meta in couchstore, then you can merge this fix to 2.0? I think we need to fix this issue on 2.0.
