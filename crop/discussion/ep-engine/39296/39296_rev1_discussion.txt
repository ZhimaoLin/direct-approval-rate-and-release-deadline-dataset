DESCRIPTION

MB-11629: Send cookie information when incr/decr session ctr

This is to ensure that the session counter be decremented
once for the cookie, for every time the session counter is
incremented in the cookie's context.
An underflow of the session counter could occur due to a
race between disconnection and successful execution of the
operation.
