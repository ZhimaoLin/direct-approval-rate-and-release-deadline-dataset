DESCRIPTION

coding style fixes for Jasmin Rangel compatibility

Jasmin Rangel does not handle lines more than 80 characters well
Also coding style dictates fixed line sizes which are
mostly followed but left out in a few places..
- remove trailing whitespaces from all files
- limit lines to 80 chars
- try to ensure comments fit into one line so that they can
be traced back from an error log
