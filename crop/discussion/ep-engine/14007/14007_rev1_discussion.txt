DESCRIPTION

MB-4898 Rebuild mutation log with the database if the log is empty

There is a case where the database has some data, but the mutation
log is empty when the warmup starts (e.g., cluster upgrade).
In this case, the mutation log should be reconstructed from
database during warmup. Otherwise, data loss can happen when the
node is restarted, because the mutation log might not contain all
the entries.
