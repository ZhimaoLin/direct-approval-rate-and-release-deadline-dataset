DESCRIPTION

MB-22421: Add support for macro expansion

Extended attributes allows for macro expansion implemented
by the pre_link_document callback from the document part
of the server API. This method should be called AFTER
the documents CAS is assigned and BEFORE the document is
made available to other clients.

Patch Set 6:

Ok.. I'll change the mock server to set a flag once the callback has been called... the "problem" here is that the actual macro expansion happens in the front-end on a per-context base and the callback in the mock_engine is currently a no-op.. once we merge the repos and may utilize all of the end-2-end tests we've got which verifies this.
