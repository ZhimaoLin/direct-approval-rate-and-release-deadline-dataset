DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Buckets]: Add a class that stores ordered sequence of items in memory

This commit adds an abstract base class 'SequenceList' that provides apis
to store ordered sequence of items in memory.

'BasicLinkedList' is a concrete class derived from 'SequenceList' that
implements in-memory ordered seq of items stored in our multi-threaded,
monotonically increasing seq model. 'BasicLinkedList' uses a boost intrusive
doubly linked list. It is essentially a linked list of 'StoredValues'.

'BasicLinkedList' works in tandem with already existing 'HashTable'
to achieve O(1) writes/updates and O(1) reads. Range read is also
implemented which is necessary for an in-memory DCP backfill. Range reads
provide point-in-time snapshots which is essential for our incremental DCP.

'BasicLinkedList' is NOT heavily multi-threaded. Writer threads and
'cleanStaleItems' threads block each other. (Stale items are a consequence
of point-in-time snapshots).

Since 'HashTable' and 'SequenceList' must work in tandem, some of the
functionalities that occur in 'HashTable' during a write have been moved
to 'VBucket' and a new class 'EphemeralVBucket' has been derived from
'derived' to do things differently in an Ephemeral Bucket.

This code is integrated with EPBucket for set() and is yet to be
integrated for the ephemeralBucket.

Finally a module test 'ephemeral_vb_test' has been added as a module test.

Note: This is still not fully integrated with the kv-engine.
