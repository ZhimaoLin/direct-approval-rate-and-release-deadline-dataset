DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Buckets]: Add a class that stores ordered sequence of items in memory

This commit adds an abstract base class 'SequenceList' that provides apis
to store ordered sequence of items in memory.

'BasicLinkedList' is a concrete class derived from 'SequenceList' that
implements in-memory ordered seq of items stored in our multi-threaded,
monotonically increasing seq model. 'BasicLinkedList' uses a boost intrusive
doubly linked list. It is essentially a linked list of 'StoredValues'.

'BasicLinkedList' works in tandem with already existing 'HashTable'
to achieve O(1) writes/updates and O(1) reads. Range read is also
implemented which is necessary for an in-memory DCP backfill. Range reads
provide point-in-time snapshots which is essential for our incremental DCP.

'BasicLinkedList' is NOT heavily multi-threaded. Writer threads and
'cleanStaleItems' threads block each other. (Stale items are a consequence
of point-in-time snapshots).

Since 'HashTable' and 'SequenceList' must work in tandem, some of the
functionalities that occur in 'HashTable' during a write have been moved
to 'VBucket' and a new class 'EphemeralVBucket' has been derived from
'derived' to do things differently in an Ephemeral Bucket.

This code is integrated with EPBucket for set() and is yet to be
integrated for the ephemeralBucket.

Finally a module test 'ephemeral_vb_test' has been added as a module test.

Note: This is still not fully integrated with the kv-engine.

(10 comments)

Line:486, src/vbucket.h -> The number of arguments here looks slightly (very) ridiculous and would be completely unreadable if anyone tried to set the `generateCas` argument

Line:88, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> You can avoid the below check if you dereference before the dynamic_cast. ie:

     auto& mockLL = dynamic_cast<MockBasicLinkedList&>(*seqList.get());

As dynamic cast will throw if you're casting a reference and it fails

Line:90, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> This should be an assert, you'll segfault if it the check fails

Line:164, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> std::vector supports the == operator (and seqno_t is a pod) so you should be able to do just do:

    EXPECT_EQ(expSeqno, actualSeqno);

Line:34, src/seqlist.h -> Here and in other places, prefer using over typedef (http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rt-using)

Line:99, src/seqlist.h -> Seems quite an important job, have you got an MB to track it? (and if so you should stick it here)

Line:194, src/seqlist.cc -> Remove debug

Line:233, src/seqlist.cc -> You should make your mutexes mutable so you can make this method const

Line:33, src/hash_table.h -> Prefer enum class: http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Renum-class

Line:53, src/hash_table.h -> ditto

Line:486, src/vbucket.h -> Agree this looks ugly. But again, this is legacy stuff, will change as part of code cleanup in future

Line:33, src/hash_table.h -> This requires some amount of refactoring in entire ep-engine.
Will do as part of a clean up in another commit, but not in this commit
