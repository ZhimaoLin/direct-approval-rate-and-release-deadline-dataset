(6 comments)

Line:41, src/queueditem.h -> Please remove this definition.

Line:115, src/queueditem.h -> Please move this definition to item.h

Line:181, src/item.h -> I don't think we need this additional constructor. Please see my comment below.

Line:245, src/item.h -> Can we simply set revSeq inside the constructor body without adding a new constructor?

Line:400, src/item.h -> it should be casted to uint8_t

Line:438, src/item.h -> I think uint8_t should be enough for operation enum type. If we use uint8_t, then we should reorder member variables to further reduce the memory overhead as follows:
...
int64_t bySeqno;
uint32_t queued;
uint16_t vbucketId;
uint8_t op;
bool deleted;
