hooks calls.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please create a ticket and use it in the commit title. Please also note that MB-100 is the dummy bug number for minor changes (logging, refactoring, spell correction, etc). I don't like the idea of referring to MB-100, but that's what we all agreed on at this time.
