Patch Set 5:

On one hand, it compiles, but on the other, all tests fail.  Can't tell if this causes tests to fail, or just lets me see it for the first time (since I couldn't compile before).

Patch Set 5:

Thanks for the quick tests. I didn't see any test failures on my machine with this change. I just compiled it with both memcached and couchstore master branches. But, I will take a look at it again soon.

Btw, does anyone have the same test failures with this change?

Line:172, configure.ac -> Should we allow to build without couchstore?

Line:178, Makefile.am -> why not just add the library the way we do for libsqlite? (with -L and -lcouchstore). This change force the existence of libtool files..
