Patch Set 6: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Thanks Trond a lot for making this much better. Yeah, my original changeset linked libcouchstore through -L and -l options, but I thought that libcouchstore would be necessary by default. Anyway, it works on my machine.

This compiles and passes at least some tests for me (hasn't finished yet).  I didn't look at the patch, but it appears to do what I need.
