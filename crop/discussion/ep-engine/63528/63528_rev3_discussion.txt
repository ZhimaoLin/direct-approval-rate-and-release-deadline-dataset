DESCRIPTION

MB-18580 [2/2]: Handle temporary failure in BackfillDiskLoad::run()

Testcase fails with the following error message:

    "CouchKVStore::getDbFileInfo: Failed to open database file
    for vBucket = 1 rev = 1 with error:no such file"

The for reason of this failure is a race condition between the thread
which creates couch-db and the thread which opens this file for read
operation (to get DbFileInfo).

To fix, if BackfillDiskLoad::run fails to obtain the item count for a
vbucket (due to the file not being ready yet), then snooze the task
and retry later.
