DESCRIPTION

PendingBackfill represents the number of remaining backfill threads

We check the validity of each backfill thread through its
TAP connection status instead of connection cookie, because of
using the named TAP connection. This requires us to change the
type of "pendingBackfill" variable to integer in order to keep
track of how many backfill threads are running for a given TAP
connection.

Note that there won't be many concurrent backfill threads for each
TAP connection, and no duplicate vbuckets among those backfill
threads.
