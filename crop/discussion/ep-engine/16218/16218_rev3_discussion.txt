DESCRIPTION

MB-5335 Fix resource leak in ep-engine testsuite

Mock server didn't release McConnection instances that it had created
during each unti test run. At the end of each individual test case,
it didn't destroy mccouchMock server. This would cause resource leak
including memory and socket. With randomized mock server failures,
this would cause died tests.
