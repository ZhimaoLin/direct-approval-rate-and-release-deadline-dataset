DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [13/N]: Checkpoint: Add getNumMetaItems() method

Add a new method to Checkpoint which returns the number of metaItems
in the checkpoint.

Initially this just returns a fixed value of 1 if the checkpoint is
open, or 2 if closed, as this matches the current checkpoint meta item
usage.

However subsequent patches will modify this to track the count of how
many meta items actually are in the checkpoint and hence allow us to
determine the meta item count when n queue_op::set_vbstate is added.
