DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Create a VBucket function where an in-memory item is deleted

We can potentially have in-memory items in a VBucket (partition) in
more than one data structure (like HT, seqList in future etc). Hence
it is good abstract out a delete function at VBucket level which would
delete all copies/presence of an in-memory item.
