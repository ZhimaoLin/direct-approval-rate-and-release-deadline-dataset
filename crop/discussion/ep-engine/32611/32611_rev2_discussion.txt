DESCRIPTION

Fix failing checkpoint test

The reason for this issue is that in the new checkpointing code we
don't give the checkpoint start and end messages sequence numbers.
As a result when we merge checkpoints together if a cursor is
pointing to a checkpoint start or end message we will think the
sequence number is 0 and assign the cursor to the beginning of the
checkpoint queues. This fix makes so that the checkpoint end
message has the same number as the last item +1  in the checkpoint
and also so that the checkpoint start message has the same number as
the last item in the previous checkpoint. The only time a conflict
will occur is when we merge two checkpoints together, but in this
case these items are removed so this is ok.

Line:1278, src/checkpoint.cc -> Can we simply use lastBySeqno instead of "+1". I think I should refactor the checkpoint implementation later so that we don't put those meta items into checkpoint.

Line:1278, src/checkpoint.cc -> I can try it, but I'm worried about what might happen if we need to place the cursors into a checkpoint and two items have the same sequence number.
