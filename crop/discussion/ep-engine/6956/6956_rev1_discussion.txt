DESCRIPTION

MB-3972 Set should overwrite an expired item that is not purged yet

We have potential memory leak in the following case for item expiry:

1) Set (k1, v1) with expiration time 5 sec.
2) After 5 sec, the item expired, but the expiry item pager was
not scheduled yet.
3) Set (k1, v2) with the same expiration time. The previous code
simply creates a new entry into the memory hashtable instead of
overwriting the expired item.
4) Repeat the above steps for other keys as well.

As the expiry item pager is scheduled every hour by default, this
can lead to huge memory usage and incorrect "curr_items" stat.
