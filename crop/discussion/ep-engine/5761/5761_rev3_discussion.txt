DESCRIPTION

MB-3618 Reset vbucket upon receiving OPAQUE_INITIAL_VB_STREAM message

ns_server is no longer deleting and recreating vbuckets on the
destination node, but instead relying on checkpoints.
However, if the destination node requests too old checkpoints that
are not in memory on the source node, the backfill will be required
from the source node.

If the backfill is required, the destination node should reset the
corresponding vbucket from memory and disk, so that it won't keep
any items that have been already deleted in the source node.

For supporting this, the source node will first send
"TAP_OPAQUE_INITIAL_VBUCKET_STREAM" message to the destination node
if the backfill is necessary, so that the destination node can reset
the target vbucket before receiving the backfill stream.
