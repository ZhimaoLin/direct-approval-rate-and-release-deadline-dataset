DESCRIPTION

MB-18256: Don't register checkpoint cursor if DISKONLY flag is set in stream req

If a DCP client wants to get items from disk only, there is no need to register
a cursor for the same with the checkpoint. (Once backfill is done, endStream is
sent to the DCP client.)

Line:1023, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> This function body seems the exactly same as get_ull_stat(). Why do you need this additional function?
