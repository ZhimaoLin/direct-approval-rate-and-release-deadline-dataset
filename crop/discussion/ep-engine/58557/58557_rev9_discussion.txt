DESCRIPTION

Create an active stream without acquiring the streamsMutex

Acquire the writer lock to streamsMutex before updating
the streams list with the newly created object.

This change is to avert potential deadlocks due to
lock inversion that will be induced by upcoming changes,
here's the scenario:
    In case of a set operation, vbucket state lock is
    acquired and then stream lock is acquired for notification.
    During markDiskSnapshot (for example), the stream lock is
    acquired before the vbucket state lock is acquired.
