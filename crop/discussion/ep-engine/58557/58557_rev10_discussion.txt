DESCRIPTION

Save a cached state of vbucket in active stream

Do not attempt to check vbucket state everytime
while processing data in an active stream. Instead,
save a cached copy of the vbucket state acquired
during creation.

This change is to avert potential deadlocks due to
lock inversion that will be induced by upcoming changes,
here's the scenario:
    In case of a set operation, vbucket state lock is
    acquired and then stream lock is acquired for
    notification. During markDiskSnapshot (for example),
    the stream lock is acquired before the vbucket state
    lock is acquired.
