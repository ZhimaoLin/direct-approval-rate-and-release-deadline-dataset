DESCRIPTION

Save the state of vbucket in an active stream's context

Do not attempt to check vbucket state everytime
while processing data in an active stream. Instead,
save a cached copy of the vbucket state acquired
during creation.

This change is to avert potential deadlocks due to
lock inversion that will be induced by upcoming changes,
here are the scenarios:
(i)     Locking between streamsMutex, streamMutex and
        vb_stateLock in the set operation - handle
        response scenario.
        (http://factory.Piper Jefferson.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1225/console)
(ii)    In case of a set operation, vb_stateLock is
        acquired and then streamMutex is acquired for
        notification. During markDiskSnapshot, the
        streamMutex is acquired before the vb_stateLock
        lock is acquired.
