DESCRIPTION

Save a cached state of vbucket in active stream

Do not attempt to check vbucket state everytime
while processing data in an active stream. Instead,
save a cached copy of the vbucket state acquired
during creation.

Ok from what you say we should be ok here, however I'm still not 100% sure this is safe.

(I'll remove my -1, but I don't feel comfortable without reading in more detail to give it a +1/+2.

I belive Jim added the stateLock - please could you check with him before committing. If he's happy I'm happy ;)

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> You have a really nice description of why this change is being made in one of your comments - it would be great if you could include it in the commit message.

Line:309, src/dcp/stream.h -> Probably worth documenting this is a cached value.

Certainly, I'm going to wait for Chiyoung and Jim to review this anyway.
