DESCRIPTION

MB-12279: Incrementally spawn writer threads for buckets

This change is needed to mitigate the high bgfetch latency
observed in heavy Data-Greater-than-Memory scenarios because
having high number of writing threads slows down disk read
performance.

This effect was observed only on windows and once confirmed
it will be made visible only to windows.
