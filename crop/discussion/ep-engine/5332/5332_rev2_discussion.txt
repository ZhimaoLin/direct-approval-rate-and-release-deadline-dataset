DESCRIPTION

MB-3591 Fix to the performance issue on incremental backup client.

We observed that the incremental backup client is quite slow
even if it runs on the local host because it currently does
a commit for every update operation. This change fixes this issue
by performing a single commit for every N updates where N is a
configurable parameter.
