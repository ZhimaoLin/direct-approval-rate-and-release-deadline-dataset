DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: Add VBucket level basic unit tests

This commit adds VBucket level unit tests which test add, update,
backill and soft delete of items. It also tests updates and soft
deletes when a simulated backill is running on the linked list
in the ephemeral vbucket.

Line:49, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> Would be nice to take it one step further and create a MockEphemeralVBucket which can inject in a MockBasicLinkedList object (which you can stash a non-owning pointer to), and then you don't need the dynamic casts in registerFakeReadRange() etc.
