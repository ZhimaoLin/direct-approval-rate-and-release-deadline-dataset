DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral]: Add VBucket level basic unit tests

This commit adds VBucket level unit tests which test add, update,
backill and soft delete of items. It also tests updates and soft
deletes when a simulated backill is running on the linked list
in the ephemeral vbucket.

Line:147, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> these basic tests are run in VBucketTest, but all tests of VBucketTest is run only for EPVBucket. Until we run the common VBucketTest for both EP and Ephe Vbucket, I thought we it is good to have these basic tests for sanity check

Line:74, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> As per my previous comment, this feels wrong. Can we not implement this without having to poke around inside the seqlist?

For example, you could use dependancy injection to specify the SequenceList subclass to use in the VBucket constructor, similar to how we do for the StoredValueFactory. Then you can subclass EphemeralVBucket (MockEphemeralVBucket) and override it's constructor to specify a MockBasicLinkedList (inheriting from BasicLinkedLIst) which can expose whatever extra stuff you need.

Line:259, src/linked_list.h -> Can we get away with not having this? I think it's reasonable for a Test Fixture to have access to it's "matching" class (VBucketTest -> VBucket), but things are not going to scale / get out of hand if we give friendship to all sorts of tests.

Moreover, if a higher-level test (e.g. EphemeralVBucketTest) needs friend access to a lower level object (BasicLinkedLIst) then that's feels like a code smell - the test is doing too much / testing the wrong thing.
