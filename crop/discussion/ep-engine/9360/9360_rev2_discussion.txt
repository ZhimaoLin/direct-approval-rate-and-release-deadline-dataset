DESCRIPTION

Allow TAP backfill to pass its vbucket filter to VBucketVisitor

TAP backfill can have an arbitrary number of vbuckets
(e.g., one vbucket for TAP takeover), we should allow TAP
backfill to pass its vbucket filter to VBucketVisitor, so that
the dispatcher can only visit vbuckets that belong to the vbucket
filter.
