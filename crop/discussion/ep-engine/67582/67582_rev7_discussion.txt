Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Looks good - just some minor things.

Line:934, src/ep.h -> Can we change the `plh` (LockHolder) arg to ref instead of ptr (to enforce not-null)?

Line:25, src/ep_types.h -> Maybe rename to `to_string` given we use that nomenclature for a number of existing similar functions.

Also probably doesn't need to be inline, given I expect this won't be on any hot paths.

Line:30, src/ep_types.h -> You'll probably need a default case to keep gcc happy :(
