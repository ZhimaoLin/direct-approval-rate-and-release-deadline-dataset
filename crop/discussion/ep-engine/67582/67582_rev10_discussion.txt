you could have added a pinch of const to the recipe ;-)

Line:929, src/ep.h -> const

Line:947, src/ep.h -> const

Line:28, src/ep_types.h -> const?

Line:36, src/ep_types.h -> why not throw std::invalid_argument?? We're not receiving this value from an external client so it would be an internal bug in ep-engine if we'd ever got one here..

Line:3518, src/ep.cc -> const

Line:3549, src/ep.cc -> const

Line:969, src/checkpoint.cc -> const

Line:547, src/checkpoint.h -> You renamed it ;)

Line:552, src/checkpoint.h -> const?

Line:307, src/vbucket.h -> const
