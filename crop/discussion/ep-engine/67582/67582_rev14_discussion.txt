Patch Set 14: Code-Review+2

(2 comments)

Just a query on the Lock being passed as a pointer - if it is passed as null then no need to change, if it isn't then it would be good to change to a reference.

Line:27, src/ep_types.h -> Nit: Might be nicer to keep this outside the global scope - i.e. move to within the to_string function below. 

Might have to convert to `using GenerateBySeqnoUType = ...` to have it scoped (I can't recall if typedefs have scope).

Line:3531, src/ep.cc -> Is plh ever passed in as null? Can we make this unconditional?
