Patch Set 3:

The test should fail if the items array exceeds the boundary.  There's a bit of a safety net there.

The test suite changes seem to do exactly what I would expect.  I still think there's too much code for something so simple, though.

Line:1451, ep_engine.cc -> Trong, current max_items is 54 and this new param (the last one in array) is the 52th.  Why shall we increase array size?

Line:1731, ep_engine.cc -> We moved it from ep.cc to ep_egnine.cc. Correct me if any misunderstanding.

Line:1451, ep_engine.cc -> I think it's fine.  The assertion verifies when we forget to extend.

Line:1731, ep_engine.cc -> Please see all the comments on patch 2.
