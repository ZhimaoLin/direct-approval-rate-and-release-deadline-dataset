Line:1802, ep.cc -> You should remove this change from the changeset (not related to the intended change and may in theory just make it easier to encounter a merge conflict)

Line:1449, ep_engine.cc -> You need to increase the size of the item array

Line:1451, ep_engine.cc -> Why not just pass in the pointer to flushAllEnabled and initialize that to the default value prior to this?

Line:1524, ep_engine.cc -> If you do the above you don't need this...

Line:1730, ep_engine.cc -> Remember the space between if and (, and one shouldn't test for == for boolean variables.. you should just say: if (!flushAllEnabled) {}

Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)

Doh, I was in the process of writing these things while the new change went up.  They all still seem to apply.

Line:1451, ep_engine.cc -> This is what I said last time.  :)  That's seven lines of code that can be deleted (or, another way to look at it, this change should only be four lines of code total for configuration -- five if you count field initialization).

Line:1729, ep_engine.cc -> I think this comment is a big distraction.  It literally says the same thing the code below it does, but in English.

Line:1731, ep_engine.cc -> Please look at the code below for consistency.  The spacing is very weird in these two lines.
