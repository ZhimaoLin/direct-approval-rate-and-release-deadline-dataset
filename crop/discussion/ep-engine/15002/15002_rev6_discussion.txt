Patch Set 6: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The tests look right (and pass) and the code looks good.  I'll leave the final +2 to Chiyoung.

Might want to poke Matt to get rid of his -2.

Line:1, Makefile.am -> Looks to be some kind of code review failure.  It's always the little things...  I blame you for waiting for the submission before looking.  :)

Out of curiosity, does that break a build anywhere?  If not, we should just remove it.  It didn't break anything for me, anyway.

Dustin,

It does not break anything in my box either. I am also curious what difference it makes. Chiyound just made another commit to revert it.
