DESCRIPTION

MB-11405 MB-11434 limit max writers to 8 (configurable)

In systems having 40+ cores, spawning 20 threads causes many
issues like heavy CPU and memory.
Limit number of writers to 8, readers to 16
Make these max limits configurable at runtime using
cbepctl set flush_param max_num_writers 1
