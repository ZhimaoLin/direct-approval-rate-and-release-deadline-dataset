DESCRIPTION

[Unittest] Increase max_size for test_memory_limit

Increase max_size by a bit for test_memory_limit,
as the initial usage on ubuntu is slightly higher
than in osX, causing the test to not behave as
expected on ubuntu platforms.

osx::       initial_usage = 1977224
ubuntu::    initial_usage = 2003528
