DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move 'add' functionality from hash table to vbucket

Add() functionality was a set on hash table wherein you could only
add a new StoredValue and updating an exisiting one was not allowed
unless it was deleted or a temp item.

Actually, this is a VBucket functionality. Hash table should just
provide functionalities of find, add new, update, soft delete and
delete. A module that contains/uses hash table (like VBucket) should
implement a functionality like 'add' using the hash table.
