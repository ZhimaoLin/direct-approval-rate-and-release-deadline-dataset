DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move 'add' functionality from hash table to vbucket

Add() functionality was a set on hash table wherein you could only
add a new StoredValue and updating an exisiting one was not allowed
unless it was deleted or a temp item.

Actually, this is a VBucket functionality. Hash table should just
provide functionalities of find, add new, update, soft delete and
delete. A module that contains/uses hash table (like VBucket) should
implement a functionality like 'add' using the hash table.

Line:19, tests/mock/mock_vbucket.h -> Comment needs updating.

Line:204, src/stored-value.h -> As per Coding Standard, I'd be tempted to flip the order of this so it reads easier:

        if (isTempInitialItem()) {
            markClean();
        } else {
            markDirty();
        }

Line:524, src/stored-value.h -> Ditto
