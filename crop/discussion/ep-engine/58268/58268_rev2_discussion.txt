DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite: Fix suspicious malloc() calls identified by clang analyzer

Potentially erronious uses of malloc were flagged by Clang static analyzer:

File:        ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite.cc
Location:    line 5977, column 43
Description: Result of 'malloc' is converted to a pointer of type
             'protocol_binary_response_header', which is incompatible
             with sizeof operand type 'uint8_t'

Note these uses are safe in this instance (we arn't actually expecting
size(uint8_t) to be sufficient to store a
protocol_binary_response_header; however simplify to silence the
error.
