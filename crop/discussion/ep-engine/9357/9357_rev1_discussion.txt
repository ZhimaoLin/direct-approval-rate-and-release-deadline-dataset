DESCRIPTION

Do not register checkpoint cursors for TAP connection with dump

As TAP dump simply sends the snapshot of each vbucket to the
client, it only requires backfill from memory (and disk if the
resident ration is below the thresshold). Therefore, we do not
need to register checkpoint cursors for TAP connection with the
dump option.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I can't think of anything that would cause this to break something :)
