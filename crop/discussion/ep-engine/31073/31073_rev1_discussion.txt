DESCRIPTION

MB-9638 UPR persistence sequence number command

Similar to the Tap checkpoint persistence command. But we use
sequence number instead of checkpoint id for UPR. The new memcached
command opcode is CMD_SEQNO_PERSISTENCE 0xb7.

David,

Please also add the unit test for this. You can refer to the unit test for checkpoint persistence.

Line:4127, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'm not sure why we should subtract 8 bytes?

Line:254, src/vbucket.cc -> whitespace

Line:256, src/vbucket.cc -> We should check these two predicates at the beginning of while loop like:

if (isBySeqno != entry.isBySeqno_) {
    continue;
}

We should iterate all the pending requests. Otherwise, it won't work correctly.

Line:64, src/vbucketmap.h -> Where do we update these values? I don't see it.

Line:574, src/checkpoint.h -> We should init it to zero in the constructor.

Line:4127, src/ep_engine.cc -> there're 8 bytes before the seqno in the payload according to the spec:
https://github.com/Piper Jeffersonlabs/cbupr/blob/master/commands/persist_seqno.md

Line:64, src/vbucketmap.h -> should be in ep.cc but was removed accidentally.
