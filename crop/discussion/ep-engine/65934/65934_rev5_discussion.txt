DESCRIPTION

MB-19837: Increase number of NONIO threads

We've found that the NONIO threads can become
heavily utilised. On smaller systems only 1 or 2
threads were created, easily overwhelmed during
rebalance leading to rebalance failures.

This commit changes the code from creating
NONIO as 10% of nCPU to be 30% of nCPU and
ensuring at least 2 are always present.

The % is still hardwired because the thread count is global
and would be intialised by the first bucket's config.

Given that we can already override with a config flag the changes
are hardwired to give better throughput for nearly all users.

Comparison of old vs new.

CPU count = 1 NONIO threads old{1} new{2}
CPU count = 2 NONIO threads old{1} new{2}
CPU count = 4 NONIO threads old{1} new{2}
CPU count = 8 NONIO threads old{1} new{2}
CPU count = 16 NONIO threads old{2} new{3}
CPU count = 32 NONIO threads old{3} new{7}
CPU count = 36 NONIO threads old{3} new{8}
CPU count = 64 NONIO threads old{5} new{8}
CPU count = 128 NONIO threads old{8} new{8}
