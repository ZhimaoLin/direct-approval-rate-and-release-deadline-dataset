DESCRIPTION

MB-19837: Increase number of NONIO threads

We've found that the NONIO threads can become
heavily utilised. On smaller systems only 1 or 2
threads were created, easily overwhelmed during
rebalance leading to rebalance failures.

This commit changes the code from creating
NONIO as 10% of nCPU to be 30% of nCPU and
ensuring at least 2 are always present.

The % is still hardwired because the thread count is global
and would be intialised by the first bucket's config.

Given that we can already override with a config flag the changes
are hardwired to give better throughput for nearly all users.

Comparison of old vs new.

CPU count = 4 NONIO count old{1} new{2}
CPU count = 8 NONIO count old{1} new{2}
CPU count = 16 NONIO count old{2} new{4}
CPU count = 24 NONIO count old{3} new{7}
CPU count = 32 NONIO count old{4} new{8}
CPU count = 36 NONIO count old{4} new{8}
CPU count = 64 NONIO count old{7} new{8}
CPU count = 128 NONIO count old{8} new{8}

Line:67, src/executorpool.cc -> Might be cleaner to use std::min / std::max to clamp?

 count = std::min(EP_MAX_NONIO_THREADS, 
                  std::max(EP_MIN_NONIO_THREADS, count));

(Shame we don't have C++17 yet :) : http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/clamp)

Line:67, src/executorpool.cc -> I did wonder, certainly more expressive with the min/max wrapping, validation needs a retrigger, so i'll push an update
