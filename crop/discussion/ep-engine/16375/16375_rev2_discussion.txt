Line:198, configuration.hh -> No, but if you look one function above (validateSize), we take care of ranges for size_t

Line:83, configuration.cc -> what is this? shoud this be size_t instead of ssize_t? I rebased to the latest label but cannot compile.

Line:91, configuration.cc -> should this be DT_SIZE?
