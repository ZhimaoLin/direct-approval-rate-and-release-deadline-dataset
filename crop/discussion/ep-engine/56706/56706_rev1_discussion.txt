DESCRIPTION

Simplify common.h: Remove unused headers [1/3]

common.h is included by a large number of files in ep-engine,
furthermore it's a pretty large and complex file. This unnecessarily
slows down compilation.

First patch removes <unordered_set>, <unordered_map> and <memory> from
common.h, adding them only to the files which actually use them.
