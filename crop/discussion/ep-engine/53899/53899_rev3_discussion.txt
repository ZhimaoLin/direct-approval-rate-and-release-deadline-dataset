Line:13368, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> There's so much duplicate code here.

How about adding a loop for the number of times you want to try this, something like this:

x = 0
while (x < 11) {
    snap_end = ..
    snap_start = ..
    start_seqno = ..
    end_seqno = ..
    vb_uuid = ...
    expect = ...
    dcp_stream_req(h, h1, 1, 0, start_seqno, end_seqno,
                   vb_uuid, snap_start, snap_end, 0, expect);
    x++;
}

Line:13368, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Then each iteration would be a separate case. As there is no correlation between an iteration and parameters, we will anyways need all the code you are seeing here. What I mean is in every iteration you will have to set      snap_end = ..
snap_start = ..
start_seqno = ..
end_seqno = ..
vb_uuid = ...
expect = ...

Line:13368, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> What I meant was this test case would look a lot shorter and cleaner, if you had the loop (like I mentioned before) and you pick up all the parameters from pre-populated vectors.
