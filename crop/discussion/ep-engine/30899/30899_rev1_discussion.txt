DESCRIPTION

MB-9638 UPR persistence sequence number command

Similar to the Tap checkpoint persistence command. But we use
sequence number instead of checkpoint id for UPR. The new memcached
command opcode is CMD_SEQNO_PERSISTENCE 0xb7.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:4194, src/ep_engine.cc -> Seq number %llu

Line:283, src/vbucket.cc -> This function is mostly same as the above one. Can we simply add one more parameter (i.e., isBySeqno) to the above function and remove this function?

Line:44, src/vbucket.h -> please rename chk.

Line:2422, src/ep.cc -> Unlike persisted checkpoint, this will cause a vbucket snapshot task to be scheduled for every commit because a persisted seq number will increase for each commit. I need to know more details on the seq number persistence. Let's discuss it offline.

David,

Please do not abandon your change to upload a new patch. It makes it difficult for us to compare two patch sets.
