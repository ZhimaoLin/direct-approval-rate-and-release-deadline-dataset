DESCRIPTION

Add prepare_ep_bucket function

the bucket is an EP bucket, otherwise return SKIPPED.

Line:218, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> why not just use strstr? not only is it shorter (and more readable as we don't have to wrap lines), but it also avoids creating an extra string...

Line:218, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> I generally prefer std::string as it's safer. This is only test code, so the perf shouldn't matter really. Also this works if test->cfg is null, which is wouldn't with strstr()

Line:218, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> from looking at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/string/ it doesn't look like that:

"If s is a null pointer, if n == npos, or if the range specified by [first,last) is not valid, it causes undefined behavior."

Line:218, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> Hmm, ok. Either way, I prefer the C++ style string approach where possible ;)

Line:218, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> then we should move the creation of the string outside the if and assign it to a value iff test->cfg != nullptr... then the if won't span multiple lines
