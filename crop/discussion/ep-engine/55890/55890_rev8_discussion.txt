Some of them are minor comments, but I found some functional bugs too. Please take a look at them and let me know if you have any questions or more clarifications.

Line:221, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I suggest to do the sanity check on kvsHandle:

if (kvsHandle != nullptr) {
 ...
} else {
    LOG(...);
}

Line:1026, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please log this error with the vbucket id and rollbackSeqno.

Line:1034, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ditto

Line:1048, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ditto

Line:1055, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Using an iterator to get the doc count is quite expensive. Instead, you can get the number of doc count from fdb_kvs_info API above.

Line:1064, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ditto

Line:1068, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This will cause a compiler warning due to type mismatch with num_kvs_markers

Line:1090, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same as above comment

Line:1125, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please log the rollback seq number too.

Line:1139, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Suggestion: please use C++11 style iteration using auto

Line:1141, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This won't return the rollbacked item because the rollback operation was already performed above and consequently fdb_get would not return the rollbacked item anymore. For this, we need to retrieve each rollbacked item's disk offset while iterating in line 1096 - 1111, and then use fdb_get_byoffset API here and finally check if an rollbacked item was deletion or regular set.

Line:1143, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I'm not sure why we need to create a dummy item and pass it to the compaction expiry callback below.

Line:1152, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This log message seems the same as the line 1033. Can we differentiate this by adding more context.

Line:284, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Let's use std::vector given the fact that we have the fix number of vbuckets. Please refer to the corresponding variables in CouchKVStore.

Line:1098, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Using fdb_iterator_get_metaonly API will be less expensive as it doesn't need to fetch a doc body. In addition, you may want to pre-allocate fdb_doc instance as we only need to retrieve an item's key and metadata whose max size are known.

Line:1141, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Yes, calling get on a rolled back item would result in a ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT. The callback in Rollback class handles it as a deletion.

Line:1143, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT handling in the callback needs an Item to hold the key and vbucket id

Line:1141, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Yeah, you're right. I think fdb_get on the rollbacked KV store makes sense to me.

Line:1143, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Then, can we change queue_op_empty to queue_op_del?
