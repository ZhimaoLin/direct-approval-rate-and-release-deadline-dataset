Line:50, src/access_scanner.cc -> spell out access log instead of alog and should we add a colon and possibly quote it? 

... new access log file: \"%s\""

Line:102, src/access_scanner.cc -> not needed.. the logger will insert the appropriate newline char.

Line:109, src/access_scanner.cc -> insert: "access log file" to make it easier for people to know which file we're tNathalie Landrying about

Line:115, src/access_scanner.cc -> access log, and quotes arount the file name?

Line:125, src/access_scanner.cc -> ditto

Line:134, src/access_scanner.cc -> ditto
