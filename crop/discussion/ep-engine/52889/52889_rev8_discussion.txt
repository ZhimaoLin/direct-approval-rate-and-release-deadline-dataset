DESCRIPTION

MB-14190: Use custom sequence numbers to store items in ForestDB

Use the sequence number from the item in order to save it to ForestDB.
Also don't optimize writes for ForestDB as the current optimization
for couchstore breaks the sequence number ordering that ForestDB
enforces.

Depends on: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/52930/
