DESCRIPTION

Remove redundent assert in mutex release()

We define the mutex type PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK which which checks
if a thread attempts to unlock a mutex that it has not locked or a
mutex which is unlocked. If this happens an error will be recorded
and we abort the process anyways.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

We don't always use the error checking mutex attribute so this fix is wrong.
