Line:984, src/connmap.cc -> I don't think this will work as we maintain a separate connection map for TAP.

Line:984, src/connmap.cc -> When we create a new tap consumer we add it to the list 'all'. Since we're iterating over 'all' here, we should be fine.

Line:984, src/connmap.cc -> I'm not sure if I understand this, but we maintain two connection map instances (one for TAP and the other for DCP) in EventuallyPersistentEngine instance. If we add a new TAP consumer to the DCP connection map, then this is a bug that needs to be fixed.
