What about needing to handle the reverse case - when a TAP stream is added we need to check to see if there's an existing DCP stream? 

We may need this as we have tNathalie Landryed about converting customers "back to TAP" to work around issues with DCP - in particular we talked about it with respect to Amadeus's current issue. Thoughts?

I also want to note that this fix seems like something we could easily have a unit test for.

Patch Set 2:

@Dave - TAP doesn't ship sequence numbers, we generate the sequence numbers for items as they are received at the consumer. So in the scenario that we move from DCP to TAP, there shouldn't be any assertions raised. I'll give that a second look again, to see if its a good-to-have check anyway.

@Mike - Yes, I'm going to write up a unit test for this on the next patch.

Abhinav,

Can you add the unit test to this commit?

Hang on though - can't it still be a problem if theres a DCP stream, we add a TAP stream which changes the vbucket sequence number and we subsequently hit an assert on the DCP side (caused by the TAP stream that changed the sequence number)?

Fundamentally, it seems like the behavior is not well-defined if we have 2 streams open against the same vbuckets - and "not well-defined behavior" is not something we want, right?

Patch Set 2:

Dave,

Base on my discussion with Aliaksey, adding TAP consumer while DCP consumer already exists won't happen in the current rebalance implementation, but as you suggested, we can check that condition for safety.
