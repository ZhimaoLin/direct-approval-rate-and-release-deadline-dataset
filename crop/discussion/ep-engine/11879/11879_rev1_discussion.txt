Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I looked back through the history to find the change that introduced what you're fixing here and I'm *pretty* sure this is right.  Is there any chance you've got a test that breaks with the current code?

This looks correct. I've been investigating the crash in hashtable::visit that happened in production yesterday, but didn't find any correlation between this bug and the crash yet.

Patch Set 1:

I was just reviewing all the relevant code paths related to that hashtable::visit crash and found this. I don't have a specific test-case, but I'm pretty sure this will cause incorrect behavior.

Chiyoung, this needs to go into other branches as well. What's your current branching strategy?
