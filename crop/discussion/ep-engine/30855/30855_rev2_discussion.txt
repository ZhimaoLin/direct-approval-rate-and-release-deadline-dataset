DESCRIPTION

MB-9585: Add support for upr stats

This change refactors the TAP stats related functions and added
UPR support. Client such as cbstats should be able to retrieve
"upr" or "upragg" stats. We'll add comprehensive stats for UPR
later on. Also modified some upr test cases that depends on stats.

I will merge this after the upr mutation changes since I think there will be conflicts.
