DESCRIPTION

MB-17534: Initialize drift counter to zero

The drift counter was previously set to the largest
negative value allowed for a 48-bit integer. This
was done so as to determine whether the drift counter
was ever set by XDCR or not.
    The drift counter will now be set to 0 so that
when time_sync is enabled, drift counter can be used
as is to determine the adjusted time.
