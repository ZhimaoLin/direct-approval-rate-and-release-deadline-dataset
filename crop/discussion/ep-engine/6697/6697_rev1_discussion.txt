DESCRIPTION

MB-3925  - Always run mbdbconvert and with right src-strategy

The previous performance optimization of using a straight file copy
wasn't incorporating WAL files.  The safest approach is to always
invoke mbdbconvert, at the cost of performance.

mbdbconvert must also be invoked with the right src-strategy,
depending on how many kv_VBUCKET tables the source database has.
