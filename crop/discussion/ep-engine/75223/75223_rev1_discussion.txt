DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral] Add support for paging out items

If ephemeral_full_policy is set to 'auto_delete', then Ephemeral
buckets should page out items by deleting them - this differs from
Persistent buckets where items are paged out by just ejecting them
from memory.

Add support for this, by implementing 'paging out' as deletion for
Ephemeral. Add unit tests for this case.
