DESCRIPTION

Introduce restoreMeta() method in StoredValue class

Similar to the restoreValue() method, this method will be called upon
completion of a background fetch of a temporary item's metadata. After
restoring the metadata, this method also sets it to expire after a
predetermined amount of time (default is 60 secs). Any number of
requests within this window will be served with the fetched metadata.
