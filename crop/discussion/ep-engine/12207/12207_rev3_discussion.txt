DESCRIPTION

Introduce restoreMeta() method in StoredValue class

Similar to the restoreValue() method, this method will be called upon
completion of a background fetch of a temporary item's metadata. After
restoring the metadata, this method also sets it to expire after a
predetermined amount of time (default is 60 secs). Any number of
requests within this window will be served with the fetched metadata.

Patch Set 3:

Is this intended to be called while holding a lock only?  It's unclear that this is the case.

Patch Set 3:

Good point. Will rename the function appropriately. On a related note, I think we should also rename the older restoreValue() function in order to be consistent.

Patch Set 3:

Make sense.  I think Trond started this pattern and I thought it looked a little silly to me, but it's pretty hard to get wrong.
