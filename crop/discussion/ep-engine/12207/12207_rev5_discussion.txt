DESCRIPTION

Introduce unlocked_restoreMeta() method in StoredValue

Similar to the unlocked_restoreValue() method, this method will be
called upon completion of a background fetch of a temporary item's
metadata. After restoring the metadata, this method also sets it to
expire after a predetermined amount of time (default is 60 secs). Any
number of requests within this window will be served with the fetched
metadata.
