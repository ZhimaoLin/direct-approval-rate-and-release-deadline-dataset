Line:13571, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> If '-1' is a magic conflict resolution mode (INVALID, not assigned)? then could you add an enum for it.

Line:10572, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I'm not sure I understand what you mean here.

Line:13571, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> last_conflict_resolution_mode flag is initialized to -1 in the test suite, comparing it to -1 is to just ascertain the fact that no conflict_resolution_flag was received.

Line:10572, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Isn't this of type enum conflict_resolution_mode ?

Line:13571, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Hmm, ok, that's a bit type unsafe but I guess works. We could just create an explicit bool conflict_res_found = false which might be better.

Line:10572, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Right, I'll update this.

Line:13571, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Yes, and that would mean 2 variables then : )
