DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 3/4 Add support for float and boundless ranges for configuration

* Creates a float range validator based on whether the type of the config option
is a float rather than if the validation range is not a rounded number.
* Allows for leaving one of the validation range boundaries unspecified which will
result in the validation in that direction being set to maximum.
