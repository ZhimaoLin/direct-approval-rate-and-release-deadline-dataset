DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 3/4 Add support for creating float range validators and boundless ranges for configuration

* Creates a float range validator based off whether the type of the config option
is a float rather than if the validation range is not a rounded number.
* Allows for leaving one of the validation range boundaries unspecified which will result in the
validation in that direction being set to maximum.

Line:46, tools/genconfig.cc -> Ampersand next to type, not variable.

Line:49, tools/genconfig.cc -> Ditto

Line:63, tools/genconfig.cc -> Maybe re-phrase - your current error message is ambiguous on if you are allowed both min and max.

Line:125, tools/genconfig.cc -> Now you're now just concatenating strings, you can simplify this to just string1 + string2 + ...

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: This is a bit long - see if you can get it under 80 chars (ideally 72).

(the lines below also need wrapping).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Grammar - off -> on ?
