Line:2567, ep.cc -> This should be updated after underlying->commit(). Please update it right after updating the commit time stat. To avoid the race, we can use lock to update the commit time stat and commit size synchronously. But, that's not necessary at this time.

Line:3544, ep_engine.cc -> We should consider the outgoing queue size as well, which is stats.flusher_todo
