DESCRIPTION

MB-3603 Fix to the checkpoint synchronization failure.

TAP sequence number is uint32_t type and is reset to 0 when it
reaches to the maximum value. When the sequence number is reset to 0,
we should set the sequence number to 1 and reset the last sequence
number for each vbucket to 0. In this way, when we receive
a subsequent ack, we can determine if a given checkpoint is
synchronized, by comparing the current acked sequence number with the
last sequence number for the corresponding vbucket.
