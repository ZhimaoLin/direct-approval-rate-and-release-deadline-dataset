DESCRIPTION

Create latency peformance tests for ep-engine

Create a new test library (ep_perfsuite.so) for performance benchmark
tests, and add test to measure latency of front-end operations.

The new testsuite initially has two tests:

* "baseline latency" - Measure the latency of Create, Get, Replace and
  Delete operations to a single vBucket; with default configuration
  options.

* "defragmenter latency" - Measure the latency of Create, Get, Replace
  and Delete operations to a single vBucket; with the ep-engine
  Defragmenter task configured to run essentially constantly.

Example output (requires UTF-8 for graphs):

    === Latency [Baseline] (µs) ==================================================
