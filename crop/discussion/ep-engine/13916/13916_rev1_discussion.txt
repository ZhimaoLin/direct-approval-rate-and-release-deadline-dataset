DESCRIPTION

Help valgrind to not report false positives for uninit reads

Running valgrind on my mac reports multipe uninitialized reads
caused by the mutexes / syncobjects. We're initializing these
objects with the pthread_xxx_init methods, but it seems to leave
some of the internals uninitialized (and probably read out a
word including these bytes). Add a --enable-valgrind so that we
can define VALGRIND and memset the variables in these cases.
