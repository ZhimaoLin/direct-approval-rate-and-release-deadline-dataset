Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

I know this change is mainly for refactoring the UPR implementation to support a modular test, but we need to be cautious in code refactoring given our release schedule. I would like to understand this change more to see if it is really necessary at this time.

This is part of a sequence of changes. It is needed if we want to be able to unit test the upr stream.

Patch Set 5:

I know this is part of a series of changes, but as I mentioned, the level of code refactoring should be carefully committed, unless we really don't have any other way of doing a functional test in UPR.
