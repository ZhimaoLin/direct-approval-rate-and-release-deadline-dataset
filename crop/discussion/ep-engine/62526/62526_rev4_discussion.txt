Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I actually think this is a step backwards:

1. Instead of being able to open the file in my IDE "dcpconnmap.h" I get a list of two files, which I have to check which is which.

2. The class inside the file is named "DcpConnmap" - therefore most C++ naming conventions would have the file named dcpconnmap.h/.cc

3. It makes it harder to jump between different branches.

All-in-all, I see many downsides and not many upsides...
