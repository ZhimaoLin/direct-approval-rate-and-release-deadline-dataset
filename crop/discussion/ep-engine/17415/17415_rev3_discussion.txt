DESCRIPTION

CBD-369 Optimize warmup by loading active vbuckets before replica

Optimization in couch-kvstore loadDB for warmup. Put active
vbuckets before replica vbuckets for data loading during warmup.
It also avoids loading any dead vbuckets. It is not done for
keysOnly loading and individual vbucket loading for backfill.
Add warmupVbStates to CouchKVStore to save cost of reading
vbuckets states again. It is populated during Warmup::initialize,
reused during data loading, and is emptied at the end of warmup
data loading.

have a minor comment, but all looks good. thanks.

Line:836, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I know it should never happen; but can you see if it is a good idea that we add assert() here if (visit == warmupVbStates.end()) - which case is certainly a bug.

Line:516, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> You can simply call clear() here

Line:822, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> As loadDB is always invoked after listPersistedVbuckets() and only used for warmup, I don't think we need to check it here again.

Line:886, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please simply invoke clear()
