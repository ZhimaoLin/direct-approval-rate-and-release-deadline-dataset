DESCRIPTION

CBD-369 Optimize warmup by loading active vbuckets before replica

Optimization in couch-kvstore loadDB for warmup. Put active
vbuckets before replica vbuckets for data loading during warmup.
It also avoids loading any dead vbuckets. It is not done for
keysOnly loading and individual vbucket loading for backfill.
Add warmupVbStates to CouchKVStore to save cost of reading
vbuckets states again.
