DESCRIPTION

CBD-369 Optimize warmup by loading active vbuckets before replica

Optimization in couch-kvstore loadDB. Put active vbuckets before
replica vbuckets for data loading during warmup. It also avoids
loading any dead vbuckets. It is not done for keysOnly loading
and individual vbucket loading for backfill.

Line:817, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I would make initVbStates as a member of CouchKVStore and populate it during the first call of listPersistedVbuckets() so no need to call the function again here. After the completion of loadingDB, you can release internally allocated memory by initVbStates.clear().

Line:839, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> looks like you don't need replicaVBuckets vector anymore. Unless we will be needing a separate loading strategy (if loadingData) for differentiating replica and active vbuckets, you can just put all replica & active vbuckets to vbuckets vector above.

Patch 2 is uploaded.

Line:817, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:839, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> The use of replicaVBuckets is to temporarily store all replica vbucket_ids and to write to after those active ones in vbuckets. It is required because I have to write active vbucket_ids to vbuckets first.
