DESCRIPTION

Move persistence cursor into list of all cursors

We have a lot of duplicate code for handling the persistence and
tap cursors. All of this code functions in the same way so it's
better if we just keep all of the cursors in the checkpoint manager
in one place.

Good refactoring. My comments are minor bug fixes and further refactoring.

Line:1025, src/checkpoint.cc -> The above two stmts should be executed for the persistence cursor.

Line:1104, src/checkpoint.cc -> This variable should be reset to "-1";

Line:112, src/checkpoint.cc -> I saw multiple places where "persistence" string is used. Can we define a const static string variable and use it instead?
