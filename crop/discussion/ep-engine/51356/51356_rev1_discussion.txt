DESCRIPTION

Taskable - Task layer abstraction.

Add an abstraction layer to the executor/task code so that it is not
dependent upon every task being owned by an EventuallyPersistentEngine*.

The technique uses an abstract adapter class to proxy task code onto any
other object. Thus the task code generally only needs to know about
objects built from Taskable. There's still some use of engine* where
ObjectRegistry calls are needed.

A version was scrapped which uses inheritance but fails as it breaks
external users of engine pointers.

Only EventuallyPersistentEngine* actually owns tasks at this patch level
but this patch allows other entities in the future to create and own tasks.
