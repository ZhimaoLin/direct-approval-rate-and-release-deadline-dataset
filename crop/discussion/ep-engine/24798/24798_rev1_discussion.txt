DESCRIPTION

MB-7811: Turn on compiler warnings and errors by default

On some of our developer machines warnings are added by default
and that causes our software to not build for them. As a result
we should require compile warnings/erros by default so that we
don't cause issues for developers and allow them to be turned off
if needed.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

THe reason we disabled this was to be "forward compatible" with new and untested compilers, and to have developers of other modules not to be stopped by compile problems in modules that they didn't work on. 

It was the developers of each modules responsibility to build their stuff with --enable-warnings --enable-werror to ensure that their module was clean with the compilers they used.

If we set the --enable-werror by default it may break people who want to build from source on a platform / compiler we haven't verified with (which emits other warnings). Each new gcc version seems to give out a new set of warnings ;)

Patch Set 1:

Trond,

Makes sense, but here's the problem I have. People (myself included) will not remember to set these parameters and submit code that will cause warnings/errors to be thrown and I don't want to be the gatekeeper to test everyones changes. The reason for this change was that Junyi was couldn't compile our code on his machine since his gcc turned on all of these warnings by default and we didn't make sure to clean them up.

So then what is the best way to deal with this problem?

Create ~/.Piper Jefferson/build/Makefile.extra
