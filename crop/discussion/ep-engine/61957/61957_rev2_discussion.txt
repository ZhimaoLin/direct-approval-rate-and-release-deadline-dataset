DESCRIPTION

MB-18669: Fix for intermittently failing test 'stream_req_partial'

Test fails intermittently with an error message like one below:
ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc:559 Test failed:
(Expected `100', got `25' - Invalid number of deletes)
This commit includes fixes for following tescases:
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial;
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial_with_time_sync.
The reason these tests fail is that the following wait condition
wait_for_stat_to_be(h, h1, "vb_0:num_checkpoints", 2, "checkpoint");
which is used to identify if 100 items have been deleted is not
appropriate, i.e. it is being satisfied much earlier and for much
smaller number of items being deleted.
As this looks to be the best known wait condition for dcp flow
(please let me know otherwise), the testcase was modified to
delete smallest number of items which triggers this wait
condition (given values of sequence range and checkpoint buffer
size (max number of items) for this testcase).

Line:1452, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> I dont see that there should be any difference if the number of items is reduced from 100 to 10. The DCP is expected to still stream the items from seqno start to end. stream_req_partial means we want data from start to end, but not 0 to end.

wait_for_stat_to_be(h, h1, "vb_0:num_checkpoints", 2, "checkpoint"); should not have any effect on this.

We are passing ctx.seqno = {95, 209};
But we are expecting 105 mutations (96 - 200)
and 100 deletions (201-300). 

Can you trace how end seqno is set in DCP streamRequest() ?
Then can you ascertain whether we must expect deletions from 201-209 or from 201-300

Line:1452, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Start and End SegNo are set to (95-209) on Producer as well as Consumer sides. There are two Snapshot Segments on Producer side: (95-200) and (201-300). 
All 105 mutations on Producer side (SeqNo 96-200) belong to the first Snapshot Segment. All 100 deletions on Producer side (SeqNo 201-300) belong to the second Snapshot Segment.
Consumer has same number of mutations and deletions as Producer.
Though Start and End SeqNo are set to (95-209), deletions in the range up to SeqNo 300 are being transmitted, i.e. everything till the End of Snapshot Segment is included in transmission.
