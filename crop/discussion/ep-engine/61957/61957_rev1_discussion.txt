DESCRIPTION

Test fails intermittently with an error message like one below:
ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc:559 Test failed:
(Expected `100', got `25' - Invalid number of deletes)

This commit includes fixes for following tescases:
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial;
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial_with_time_sync.
This commit also includes fix for testcase 'est_vb_move' already
checked-in in spock branch, which also fails occasionally in watson.

Line:327, tests/mock/mock_dcp.cc -> Should go in as a separate commit

Line:1202, tests/ep_testsuite_tap.cc -> Please have a separate commit for this change

Line:1466, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Can you explain (in the commit or where you are declaring num_deleted_items = 10) why with 10 is good ? why not 100 (that is num_items/2) as before ?
On my PC, both 10 and 100 seem fine

Line:1483, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> This should be num_deleted_items not hard coded to 10
