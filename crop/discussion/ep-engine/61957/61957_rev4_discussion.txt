DESCRIPTION

MB-18669: Fix for intermittently failing test 'stream_req_partial'

Test fails intermittently with an error message like one below:
ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc:559 Test failed:
(Expected `100', got `25' - Invalid number of deletes)
This commit includes fixes for the following tescases:
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial;
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial_with_time_sync.
The following wait condition:
wait_for_stat_to_be(h, h1, "vb_0:num_checkpoints", 2, "checkpoint");
which is used to identify if 100 items have been deleted is not
appropriate. Multiple run results show case of just 1 checkpoint
being enough to register all 100 deleted items.
Fix includes more precise test specific wait condition.

(4 comments)

Line:1473, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Why are you adding num_deleted_items and vb_0:num_checkpoints ?
You are adding item number and checkpoint count.

Line:1475, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Why should we for this condition here ?
Could you please explain in comments why it is needed ?

Line:1477, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Also could you explain what problem is this change to the existing testcase fixing ? 
I mean, what was the cause for the sporadic failure and how is this fix addressing it ?

Line:1526, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Same comments as above
