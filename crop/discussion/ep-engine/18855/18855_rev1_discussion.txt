DESCRIPTION

MB-5872 do not return MUTATION_FAILED if set fails due to no db file

CouchKVStore returns MUTATION_FAILED if a set request fails because
the target couchstore db file is not found. This is a bug. Instead
CouchKVStore must continue and set requested data by openning
the couchstore file with the initial revision number, 1.
