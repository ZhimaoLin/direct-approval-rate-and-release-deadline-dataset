DESCRIPTION

MB-5872 Don't return FAILED if set fails due to no db file

CouchKVStore returns MUTATION_FAILED if a set request fails
because the target couchstore db file is not found. Instead,
CouchKVStore must continue and set requested data by openning
the couchstore file with the initial revision number, 1.
