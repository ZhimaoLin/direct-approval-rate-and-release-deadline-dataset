DESCRIPTION

Dynamically create disk or in-memory (placeholder for now) backfill

Create the DCP backfill object dynamically in the vbucket object.
So if the vbucket object is of type persistant then disk backfill obj
is created and if it is of type ephemeral then in-memory backfill obj
can be created.

Currently we just have a placeholder for creating the backfill obj in
ephemeral vbuckets. It will be filled in once we have implementation
of in memory backfill in an upcoming commit.

Line:105, src/ep_vb.h -> Prefer returning a unique_ptr

Line:946, src/vbucket.h -> `stream` would be more self-documenting.
