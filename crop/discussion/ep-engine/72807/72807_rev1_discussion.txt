Line:192, src/ep_bucket.cc -> The expectations surrounding null and the ability to fail seem extremely confused between these two. I know this is just a copy+paste but it seems much more relevant now with the ability for them to actually be null.

Line:57, src/ep_bucket.h -> style: usually docblocks leave a blank line

Line:192, src/ep_bucket.cc -> I agree it's not ideal. I did consider subclassing KVShard (EP and Ephemeral variants), and only having the EP one have the bgFetcher and flusher members, but that felt overly complicated; certainly before we've refactored KVShard to be simplified.

Note it can't really "fail" - if startBgFetcher() returns false then the bucket initialisation fails and the bucket is never created - so while maybe not as "structured" as say throwing an exception, it ultimately has the same effect.
