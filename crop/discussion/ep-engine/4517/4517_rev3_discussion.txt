Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I don't think we should break the library for this one app use case.  It's trivial to catch the correct exception in the application one time and do the right thing.

We also want the application to exit with a proper error code and not send arbitrary strings to stdout.

Line:42, management/stats -> If you really need this, just do

   if stats:

Making a list of all of the keys on every request is kind of wasteful.

Line:261, management/mc_bin_client.py -> I don't think you should catch all exceptions here -- or any for that matter.

It's a poorly behaved API that prints out a message on an error condition and returns an unexpected value.  That'll cause potential confusion in the caller when the stats call succeeds, but doesn't return the requested stats, and some app ends up with a random string interleaved within its output.
