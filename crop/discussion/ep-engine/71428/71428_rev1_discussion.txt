DESCRIPTION

[Refactor ht calls 1/N]: Call ht.unlocked_set() only from VBucket class

ht (Hash Table) is a member of VBucket class. It should be a private member
and the functions of ht must be called only by VBucket class. But currently
it is a public member and any module can access ht functions.

This commit makes sure ht.unlocked_set() is called only from VBucket class.
The final intention is to make ht private to VBucket.
