DESCRIPTION

MB-18286: Enable sequence iteration in forestdb

For streaming out vbucket mutations over DCP streams, we need
to iterate them by sequence number. This requires the underlying
storage engine (forestdb) to support by-sequence indexing & iteration.
So we must set this option to SEQTREE_USE since it is not the default
option in forestdb.
