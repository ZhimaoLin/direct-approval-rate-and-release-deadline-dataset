DESCRIPTION

Fix memory leaks in ep_testsuite / mock_dcp using get_dcp_producers()

mock_dcp.cc get_dcp_producers() allocates a struct and returns a raw
pointer. Not all callers of it correctly deleted the pointer, causing
memory leaks.

Solve by returning an owning smart pointer (std::unique_ptr);
guaranteeing cleanup when it goes out of scope.
