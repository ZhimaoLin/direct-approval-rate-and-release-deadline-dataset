DESCRIPTION

Refactor rollback func such that it can be dynamically changed at run time

Break up rollback function into actual rollback of disk/data structure,
and post processing of rollback.

This helps us do the rollback in different ways for ep buckets and
ephemeral buckets at runtime.

Line:301, src/ep_bucket.cc -> same as line 310, could use unique_ptr so there's no need to delete

Line:310, src/ep_bucket.cc -> could use a unique_ptr for the local ownership here, it looks like you want to always delete.

Line:346, src/ep_bucket.cc -> Can use std::make_shared

Line:127, src/ep_types.h -> nit: default

Line:128, src/ep_types.h -> Need to initialise the other members

In addition to Jim's comments...

Line:289, src/ep_bucket.cc -> This is a somewhat ambiguous / vague name - consider giving it a more descriptive name - for example EPDiskRollbackCB ?

See also: https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly

Line:351, src/ep_bucket.cc -> Unless the function needs to share ownership of the vb - for example passes it to another task which runs asynchronously, prefer just passing as the primitive type - i.e. (const) reference. See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-smartptrparam

Line:980, src/vbucket.h -> Bit nicer if you make this take a RollbackResult (for at least 3 of the args).

Line:1824, src/vbucket.cc -> Similar to previous comment, better to change CheckpointManager::clear() to take a plain VBucket& and then you don't need the ref-counted pointer cost/complexity.

Line:117, src/ep_types.h -> Note: you don't need to name these differently, the standard guarantees that initialiser lists with the same param name as a member variable to the expected thing.
