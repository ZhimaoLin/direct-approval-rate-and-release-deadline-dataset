DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [2/N]: Add ExecutorPool tests

Testing that readers, writers, auxIO and nonIO threads can be limited.

Only tests which are valid prior to dynamic thread changes can be added
here - e.g., can't test that the number of workers can be increased
beyond the original value, because it can't yet.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> Made cleaner, but yes, 2 seconds for the thread to get new work, and 1 second timeout waiting for the thread to threadUp and notify us.

reduced it to 2500ms ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Line:155, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> Without introduces a warning - 
 executorpool_test.cc:151:63: warning: must specify at least one argument for '...' parameter of variadic macro

but changed to using ::testing::PrintToStringParamName() to avoid that anyway :)
