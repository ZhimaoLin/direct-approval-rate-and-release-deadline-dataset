DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [4/N]: Add ExecutorPool tests

Testing that readers, writers, auxIO and nonIO threads can be limited.

Only tests which are valid prior to dynamic thread changes can be added
here - e.g., can't test that the number of workers can be increased
beyond the original value, because it can't yet.
