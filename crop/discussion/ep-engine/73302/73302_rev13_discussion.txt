DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [4/N]: Add ExecutorPool tests

Testing that readers, writers, auxIO and nonIO threads can be limited.

Only tests which are valid prior to dynamic thread changes can be added
here - e.g., can't test that the number of workers can be increased
beyond the original value, because it can't yet.

Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:60, tests/module_tests/thread_gate.h -> isComplete is a better fit

Line:50, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> worth running clang-format on this new file, this would look subtly different when formatted

Line:80, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> does this need to be heap allocated? (Same comment on next test)

Line:153, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> use a std::unique_ptr and rid yourself of the delete or can this be a stack allocated object?

  TestExecutorPool pool(args...);

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:153, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> ... yeah it can :P Not sure why I went for a pointer here, and a unique pointer earlier ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Fixed!
