Line:306, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I rather put the assertion here, and get rid of if clause below.

Line:325, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we should avoid calling fdb_get_metaonly for a regular bg_fetch operation. Otherwise, we would have two API calls (i.e., fdb_get_metaonly and fdb_get API) to process a single regular bg fetch task.

Line:325, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I am curious to know as to what you have in mind for deleted items. fdb_get would return KEY_NOT_FOUND. Then, call fdb_get_metaonly in case we need to fetch deleted items?
