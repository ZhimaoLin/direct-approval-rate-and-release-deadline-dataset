Line:301, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We should NOT open a given KV store for each GET operation. As I suggested before, we should open it iff its KVS handle is not created yet.

Line:311, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please avoid calling strlen as it requires scanning, but instead use the member function from std::string.

Line:313, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> If fetchDelete or getMetaOnly is true, then we should use 'fdb_get_metaonly' API to retrieve the metadata of a key including deleted ones. Note that fdb_get would return key_not_found to the client for a deleted key.

Line:318, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> meta and value

Line:335, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This will try to free the memory of key string that belongs to 'key' string instance. We should reset the key pointer of rdoc to NULL before calling fdb_doc_free API.

Line:360, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We should use 'deleted' variable from fdb_doc.

Line:363, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Btw, shouldn't we call ntohll or ntohl for some fields (e.g., cas, exptime, rev_seqno)?

Line:368, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> (uint64_t) rdoc->seqnum

Line:397, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> it->setRevSeqno(rev_seqno)?

Line:341, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Why do we need kvsHandle in this function?

Line:335, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I was wrong. fdb_doc_create allocates a memory for key passed. Please ignore the above comment. Btw, to avoid the memory allocation overhead for a key, we can directly manipulate the member variables of fdb_doc.
