DESCRIPTION

MB-11592: Create snapshots when getting items from the chk queues

This change introduces a new flag to indicate whether or not
ep-engine should create a new checkpoint for this snapshot. This
flag is used internally by ep-engine and only ep-engine. We are
also changing the flags values for snapshot markers since they
weren't really flags previously. Below are the new values.

Disk 0x01
Memory 0x02
Checkpoint 0x04
