Line:580, src/upr-stream.cc -> I don't understand exactly why we need this additional flag. I think we can still keep the current logic so that the consumer can create a new checkpoint every time it receives checkpoint_start message from the producer.

Line:720, src/upr-stream.cc -> I don't exactly understand why we need to send the snapshot marker to the consumer. It seems to me that sending this message doesn't have any impact on the consumer side.

Line:879, src/checkpoint.cc -> As the lock is already grabbed, it is safe to use a reference type "queued_item &qi" here.

Line:883, src/checkpoint.cc -> If this condition is satisfied, then please move the cursor to begin() position of the next checkpoint, so that the checkpoint remover can purge this closed checkpoint if no cursors are sitting on that checkpoint.

I've added some responses to your comments. Let's discuss this more tomorrow.

Line:580, src/upr-stream.cc -> The reason for the additional flag is that when we send a snapshot it might be very small and could only be one item. These snapshots won't be equivalent to a checkpoint on the active vbucket so this extra flag helps us determine where the actual checkpoint really ends. This prevents the replica vbucket from having a lot of really small checkpoints and for keeping the checkpoint manager looking similar between active and replica vbuckets.

Line:720, src/upr-stream.cc -> If I recall correctly I added this because the snapshot marker switches us from backfill to non-backfill phase. In the current code we send a snapshot marker before sending each set vbucket state message.

Line:879, src/checkpoint.cc -> I'll fix this.

Line:883, src/checkpoint.cc -> I'll fix this.
