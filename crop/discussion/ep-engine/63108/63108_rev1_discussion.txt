DESCRIPTION

MB-19303 Use error string and OS error for CouchKVStore::getAllKeys

Previously just the error number was logged which is hard to read
and does not include the OS error in the event of an os-level issue.

This change amends this by making logging follow the rest of
CouchKVStore and get those two bits.
