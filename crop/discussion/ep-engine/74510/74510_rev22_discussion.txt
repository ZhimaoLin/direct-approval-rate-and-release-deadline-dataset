DESCRIPTION

MB-22018: Add tasks stats to cbstats

Initial work on adding a "top" like tool showing tasks running and
sleeping in a cluster.

This can be viewed by running

    cbstats host:port tasks

This shows the information about the tasks such as the state, next
runtime, description, type etc.

Future additions to the tool are intended to add features such as load
averages for task types (of the style shown by `uptime`) and percentage
utilisation over a period of time per thread.

(6 comments)

Line:235, src/globaltask.h -> Feels like one of these should be a duration and not a time_point.

Line:110, src/executorthread.cc -> Can this not be moved inside updateTaskStart() - then if that function is ever caller elsewhere we'll not miss updating the time.

Also ensures that the definition of `now` is the same between the two calls.

Line:118, src/executorthread.h -> Please comment this - particulary the definition of "current" if this is called from outside the Thread itself...

Line:27, src/executorpool.cc -> Ideally these should all be /after/ the local ("") includes.

Line:908, src/executorpool.cc -> Prefer to put these as close to as possible where they are first used (~line 946) - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-scope

Line:139, src/executorpool.h -> Please add a description to this method.
