Good optimization, we had this in our back burner for things-to-do for a while. Thanks!

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We should detect the duplicate items from the dirty item list. That's the one of the reasons why we did sort them. If we send duplicate dirty items for the same key, it will be an issue for the view index engine.

Patch Set 1:

My understanding is that we dedup items beforehand calling this optimization method. Should double check as Chiyoung's comment is correct.

Patch Set 1:

Chiyoung is right, the dedup happens after the optimization is done (the queue is being sorted by key). Thanks much for pointing this out!
