Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

-1 as this is in-progress stuff, but so that others can see it

Seems to be going well.

Line:33, management/mbbackup-incremental -> This will exit 0 if err is None

Line:134, management/mbbackup-incremental -> Is this a block comment?

Line:9, management/util.py -> doctest would be perfect here (if it weren't for the filesystem requirements, I guess).

Line:84, management/mc_bin_client.py -> This doesn't feel right.  Perhaps we should just add all the other parameters in the exception that goes out?  Or return the status?

Line:9, management/util.py -> In the man page, I changed # to %.  Actually, that man page should become part of this commit, technically.

thx, will incorporate feedback.

Line:134, management/mbbackup-incremental -> Yes, block comment just so tests would pass at the moment -- and I was too lazy to ask google or (re-?) learn the right emacs binding.

Line:84, management/mc_bin_client.py -> Yeah, smells funny now that I think about it.  I think I'll just add yet another helper function that _handleKeyedResponse() will invoke, for the sake of api compatibility.
