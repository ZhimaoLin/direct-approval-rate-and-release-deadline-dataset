DESCRIPTION

MB-21917: Make use of SerialisedDocKey

StoredValue and MutationLog both store keys, but in a pre-allocated,
larger block, thus they need SerialisedDocKey.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:547, src/stored-value.h -> Similarly here.

Perhaps there's a static_assert we can use to enforce this - something like:

 static_assert(offsetof(StoredValue, key) + sizeof(SerialiedDocKey) == sizeof(StoredValue)

?

Line:335, src/mutation_log.h -> Maybe add a comment that this must be the last element in the class (as it uses a variable-length allocation?
