DESCRIPTION

MB-21917: Make use of SerialisedDocKey

StoredValue and MutationLog both store keys, but in a pre-allocated,
larger block, thus they need SerialisedDocKey.

(2 comments)

Line:80, src/item_pager.cc -> emplace

Line:63, src/access_scanner.cc -> nit: should be replaced with emplace_back (saves a StoredDocKey copy, there might be a second copy that can be avoided if it's done carefully)
