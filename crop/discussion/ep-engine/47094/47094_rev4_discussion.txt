DESCRIPTION

MB-13479: Indicate rollback to DCP clients if purge_seqno > snap_start_seqno

The replica may not get all the items if there are purged items in the active
node. Hence this solution proposes to indicate a rollback to seqno 0 in case
the purge_seqno > snap_start_seqno.
Note: Since the occurrence of this scenario is pretty rare, rolling back to 0
may not be a bad thing.
