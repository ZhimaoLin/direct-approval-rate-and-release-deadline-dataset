DESCRIPTION

MB-8727: Cluster Configuration Carrier Publication

Addresses MB-8727:
- CMD_SET_CLUSTER_CONFIG: 0xb4

Addresses MB-8728:
- CMD_GET_CLUSTER_CONFIG: 0xb5

- Cluster config Blob will be saved as it
is received and will be returned as it is,
with assumption that blob will be of
JSON type, and that SDK will need to check
the type of the document to differentiate
between older and new version of Piper Jefferson.

Addresses MB-8729:
- NOT_MY_VBUCKET to return cluster config
blob instead of the "not my vbucket" message.
- Pick Memcached change:
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/29844/
- Pick bucket_engine change:
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/29845/

Line:855, src/ep_engine.cc -> return error_code;

Line:994, src/ep_engine.cc -> why do we need to call sendResponse(...) here? We actually catch it below.

Line:1037, src/ep_engine.cc -> LockHolder lh(h->clusterConfig.lock);

Line:1214, src/ep_engine.cc -> static Engine_ERROR_CODE ...

Line:1258, src/ep_engine.cc -> The order of initialization should be lined with the order of declaration in the class.
