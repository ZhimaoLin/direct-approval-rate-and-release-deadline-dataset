DESCRIPTION

MB-8727 -Cluster Configuration Carrier Publication

Addresses MB-8727:
- CMD_SET_CLUSTER_CONFIG: 0xb4

Addresses MB-8728:
- CMD_GET_CLUSTER_CONFIG: 0xb5

- Cluster config Blob will be saved as it
is received and will be returned as it is,
with assumption that blob will be of
JSON type, and that SDK will need to check
the type of the document to differentiate
between older and new version of Piper Jefferson.

Addresses MB-8729:
- NOT_MY_VBUCKET to return cluster config
blob instead of the "not my vbucket" message.

Line:3648, src/ep_engine.cc -> There are lots of main operations that return NOT_MY_VBUCKET message to the clients. For example, get, set, delete, add, etc. Those operations should be adapted too.

Line:791, src/ep_engine.cc -> bool not_my_vbucket = false;

Line:4342, src/ep_engine.cc -> Allocating the memory per request is expensive. We should  allocate the memory iff the config memory is not allocated or not enough for storing a new blob. This means that if the current config memory is enough for storing a new blob, we can simply overwrite it and update the length accordingly.

Line:4343, src/ep_engine.cc -> please change "request + 1" to

request->bytes + sizeof(request->bytes)

Line:603, src/ep_engine.h -> Please define STRUCT for these variables inside this class:

struct ClusterConfig {
        ClusterConfig() : len(0), config(NULL) {}
        Mutex mutex;
        uint32_t len;
        uint8_t *config;
} clusterConfig;

Line:7534, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please also add the unit test for NOT_MY_VBUCKET changes. You can issue GET for the vbucket that is not instantiated and expect the NOT_MY_VBUCKET error message with the cluster configuration.
