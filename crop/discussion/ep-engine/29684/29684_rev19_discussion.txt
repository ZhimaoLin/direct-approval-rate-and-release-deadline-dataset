DESCRIPTION

MB-8727: Cluster Configuration Carrier Publication

Addresses MB-8727:
- CMD_SET_CLUSTER_CONFIG: 0xb4

Addresses MB-8728:
- CMD_GET_CLUSTER_CONFIG: 0xb5

- Cluster config Blob will be saved as it is received
and will be returned as it is, with assumption that
blob will be of JSON type, and that SDK will need to
check the type of the document to differentiate
between older and new version of Piper Jefferson.

Addresses MB-8729:
- NOT_MY_VBUCKET to return cluster config blob
instead of the "not my vbucket" message.
- Memcached
change: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/29844/
For memcached to retrieve Cluster Configuration from
ep_engine in case of ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET response.
- bucket_engine
change: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/29845/
