DESCRIPTION

MB-13386: Do not purge the item with highest sequence number from db.

When the highest seq number that DCP is supposed to read from
the db is the last seq number in the db and is purged,
DCP backfill does not know about it and hence waits for it.
This results in DCP connection hang.
To solve this problem, during compaction we do not purge the
item with last(highest) sequence number in the db.
