DESCRIPTION

UPR consumer add_stream command

The upr add stream command is used in order to force a
consumer to initiate a connection with a producer. When
this command is received by a consumer it will initiate
an upr handshake over the same connection. Upon handshake
completion or failure a response for the add stream
command will be sent indicating the status  of the stream.

Chiyoung,

I added a short description of the command to the commit message. Please let me know if you would like to add more details. Also, you can find a description of exactly what the command does in the document linked below. See the section on initial handshake at the beginning of the document.

Line:164, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I know it is not related to this change, but why those UPR functions defined in EventuallyPersistentEngine are implemented in upr-consumer?

Line:2655, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please add some comments to indicate which functions are producer or consumer parts.

Line:2214, src/tapconnection.cc -> So, start_seqno, vbucket_uuid, and high_seqno are all started with zero in the UPR consumer?

Line:2251, src/tapconnection.cc -> I'm not clear why we pass add_opaque two times.

I'll get these comments fixed up later today, but for now I have provided some explanations.

Line:164, src/upr-consumer.cc -> That's just where Trond initially put them. My guess is because the ep_engine.cc is already 4k lines of code and that this would make it easier to find only upr things by having them in a seperate file. We can move them into ep_engine.cc later if you would prefer them to be there.

Line:2214, src/tapconnection.cc -> No. I only did this because the sequence number change wasn't in yet, but since it is now I will do something better here.

Line:2251, src/tapconnection.cc -> It's because of something in the memcached api that I need to remove. I will fix that and then update this change.

Line:164, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Then, I rather create a separate UPR module that invokes its APIs from the ep_engine public APIs.
