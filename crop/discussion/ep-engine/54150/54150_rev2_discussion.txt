DESCRIPTION

MB-15914: File deletions to be handled only by RW instances

Adding sanity checks to ensure that file deletions are
handled by only read-write instances of the underlying
store and not the read-only instances. Log warnings
when a read-only instance is denied permission to delete
a file.
