DESCRIPTION

MB-15662: Optimization while supporting producer's compression

When an active stream does a backfill, if value compression
is enabled on the producer side, put an optimization in
place, so that items retrieved from disk are not decompressed.
This would ensure that the producer wouldn't have to
compress them again before transmitting.

Dave, I've just addressed your inline comment with this patch. Let me think a bit on how I can test this optimization, and once I have that ready I'll put together another patch.
