DESCRIPTION

MB-15662: Optimization while supporting producer's compression

When an active stream does a backfill, if value compression
is enabled on the producer side, put an optimization in
place, so that items retrieved from disk are not decompressed.
This would ensure that the producer wouldn't have to
compress them again before transmitting.
