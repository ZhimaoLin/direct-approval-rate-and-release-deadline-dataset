(5 comments)

Line:190, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit, prefer brace '{}' initialisation in modern c++ (to avoid an accidental most vexing parse)

Line:214, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Comments need updating

Line:567, src/hash_table.cc -> Why not a reference?

Line:575, src/hash_table.cc -> Please just go fix the const correctness of Item/Blob instead (as a patch before this one), it doesn't need nonconst as it's just used for a memcpy (Also why make it const in the first place if you're going to immediately remove the const?)

Line:604, src/hash_table.cc -> Nit: prefer accessor methods (ie. data()) for generality. It's inline so it'll boil down to the same generated code but means we can trivially swap out to any other standard container if needed (e.g. std::string_view when we get c++17).
