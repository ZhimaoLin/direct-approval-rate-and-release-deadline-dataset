DESCRIPTION

MB-11642 Batch load dcp mutations if replication

Instead of loading 1 mutation per vbucket send out 10
dcp mutations per dcp step() if it is a intra-cluster
replication stream.
This is done so that intra-cluster replication is always
faster than XDCR and views.
Local testing shows 2-4X speed up for intra-cluster replication

Line:220, src/upr-producer.cc -> We need to make it configurable as a separate commit if necessary.

Line:323, src/upr-producer.cc -> I don't think we need to check resp here as "i" should be non-zero if any message is copied into the buffer.

Line:220, src/upr-producer.cc -> Looks like ns-server replicators are unable to handle large buffers, i see erlang vm crashes with large batch size.

Sundar,

One thing that you can try is to increase the connection buffer size in UPR consumer side if the buffer is filled up quickly in your test. It can be changed by setting "dcp_conn_buffer_siz" engine param. By default, it is set to 10MB. I thought that 10MB buffer size should be enough, but you can give it a try.
