DESCRIPTION

MB-11642 Batch load dcp mutations if replication

Instead of loading 1 mutation per vbucket send out 10
dcp mutations per dcp step() if it is a intra-cluster
replication stream.

This is done so that intra-cluster replication is always
faster than XDCR and views.
Local testing shows 2-4X speed up for intra-cluster replication

This doesn't appear to handle an E2BIG error. If we get one of these then I'm pretty sure the mutations will be dropped.

Line:208, src/upr-producer.cc -> I think we can avoid a string match overhead by adding a new variable to DCP-Producer class, which indicates if a producer is for replication or not.

Hmm, the current implementation even doesn't correctly handle ENGINE_E2BIG from DCP producers callback, and simply drops an item instead. Regardless this new change, we have to handle that case correctly.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

the Idea is that you internally in the dcp should do something like:

while (dcp.message_producer(stream.peek()) == ENGINE_SUCCESS) {
     stream.pop();
}

(and handle the other return codes gracefully of course..
