DESCRIPTION

Minor change: reorganized variable declarations

Change-Id: I5131d6cf48d771f60accd089486d7fe9ba9c7e36

Added static qualifier to module local helper functions

Change-Id: I009ca8d096ecfa4c1648b8bff3e116badf7ca400

Avoid occasional test failure

We were doing out of bounds indexation on the "params" vector. This made the test
case die often at the very end.
