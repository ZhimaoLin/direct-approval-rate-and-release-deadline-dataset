Line:524, src/item.cc -> There's already a hex at line 514 (it persists until you flip back to std::dec - which I should probably add).

Line:524, src/item.cc -> Ah.. didn't see that ;)

Btw. should we add some sort of "escape character" so that you know that its escaped and not just the key: "deadbeef" ? \de\ad\be\ef

Line:524, src/item.cc -> Well, they are space-separated, and we always print the hex form with two characters (and the isprint() will be one) so I think its unambiguous enough.

I didn't want to add too much line noise.
