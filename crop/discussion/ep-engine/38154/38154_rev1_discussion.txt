DESCRIPTION

MB-11377: Don't rollback to start_seq when snap_start_seq == start_seq

We should never attempt to rollback to the snap_start_seqno when it is
the same as the start_seqno otherwise we risk potentially having the
server response by constantly asking the consumer to rollback to the
same seqno.
