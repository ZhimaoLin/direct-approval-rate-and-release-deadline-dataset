DESCRIPTION

MB-24094: Add Item to SequenceList on TTL update

In the Get Path , when the item is expired, we update the expiry
time. In the case of ephemeral buckets, that item should be updated on
the sequence list.

Line:267, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> Could you also add a final sanity check - read out all the items (see the new RangeIterator which Manu added) and verify that their sequence numbers are increasing.

Line:267, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> I think that case is inherently handled. First we check seqno for numItems and then numItems+1 and then numItems+2.

Line:267, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> I don't see where we actually check that the items come back from the Seqlist in order - yes, we check the highSeqno on the VBucket is correct, but not that the actual items are in the correct order.

There was certainly one variant of this bug where you'd have the correct number of elements, but they were out-of-order - e.g.

 1, 3, 2
