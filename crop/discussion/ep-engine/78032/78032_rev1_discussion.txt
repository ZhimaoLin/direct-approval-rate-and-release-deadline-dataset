time. In the case of ephemeral buckets, that item should be updated on
the sequence list.

Line:360, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Can you check if we indeed NOT change update stats ?
You could track "vb_active_ops_update" stat to see what exactly happens on GAT in Couchbase bucket.
I suspect opsUpdate is incremented there and so might have to do the same here as well. Then we may not need justTouch flag

Also needs some tests adding. Suggest you look at ephemeral_vb_test.cc - you should be able to say store two items, touch the first and then inspect the sequenceList and verify the items are in the correct order.

Line:1447, src/vbucket.cc -> What's the reason for this re-ordering of these two statements?

Line:1483, src/vbucket.h -> Please document the new param.

I'll add test cases. Wanted the code review to go on as I wrap the test case.

Line:1447, src/vbucket.cc -> I'll reorder them back. I had moved that code out initially and then put them back . That is why this happened.

Line:1483, src/vbucket.h -> Done
