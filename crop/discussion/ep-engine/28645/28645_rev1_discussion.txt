Line:1159, src/stored-value.hh -> I don't see why the original code becomes an issue here. If an item is locked, we shouldn't allow any mutations until the lock is released. Comparing the cas values won't be enough to guaranttee that the original lock holder can only do the deletion. I know this is a customer issue, but if it's not that critical, we shouldn't merge it into 2.2.0 branch at this time because we locked down the 2.2.0 branch and only allow the fixes to the blockers.

I'll move this to the master branch, but please see my comment inline.

Line:1159, src/stored-value.hh -> If a mutation comes in that contains the right cas value for an item then we allow it to be unlocked before the item expires. Since the cas is changed when the key is locked that only allows the client that locked the key to unlock it. We do something similar in the set function in stored-value.h. I can move this to the master branch if you don't want this in 2.2 though.

Line:1159, src/stored-value.hh -> Hmm, it seems to me that we do the CAS comparison for SET operation for a locked item. I think your fix makes sense to me although we don't support to guarantee that the original lock holder only can do the mutation on that locked key. We can discuss it furthermore tomorrow during bug scrum, but I don't think this should be merged for 2.2.0 release at this time.

Line:1159, src/stored-value.hh -> Yeah, you're right. I forgot that we return CAS "-1" to the other clients if a given item is locked
