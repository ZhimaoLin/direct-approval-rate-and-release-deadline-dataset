Patch Set 5:

Mike,

Our previous fix still can cause the deadlock between the memcached worker thread and the ep-engine dispatcher thread although its occurrence is quite low. The memcached worker thread, which already grabbed its own lock, should grab the notify_sync and reconnection_mutex locks to execute TapConnMap::newProducer(). On the other hand, the ep-engine dispatcher thread, which already grabbed notify_sync and reconnection_mutex locks, should grab the memcached worker thread's lock in notify_io_complete().

My new change still uses an extra lock to synchronize notifying / releasing TAP connections. Let's test this change once the QE team finishes the test to verify the previous fix.
