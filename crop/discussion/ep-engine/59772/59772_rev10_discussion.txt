DESCRIPTION

MB-17534: explicitly disable application of drift counter

The drift counter for each vbucket was added to aid in built-in
time synchronization. XDCR is planning to use the NTP server
for that purpose. Thus, as per requirements, disable the
application of drift in the following places

- Calculating CAS using Hybrid Logical Clock
- Shipping adjusted time using DCP (saves 11 bytes over the network)
- Skip unit tests that are related to testing time sync with drift

Note that getAdjustedTime will apply the drift and setDriftCounterState
would still set the drift. Otherwise, the semantics of those APIs will
be broken.

Line:46, src/vbucket.h -> Given the fact that the new XDCR requirements are still WIP in this area, I would rather put this as an engine parameter instead of putting it as a global variable. This will give the XDCR team more flexibilities when they want to enable the drift counter, and won't cause any code changes in our side because they can pass true through the ns-server when the bucket is created.
