DESCRIPTION

MB-17534: explicitly disable application of drift counter

The drift counter for each vbucket was added to aid in built-in
time synchronization. XDCR is planning to use the NTP server
for that purpose. Thus, as per requirements, disable the
application of drift in the following places

- Calculating CAS using Hybrid Logical Clock
- Shipping adjusted time using DCP (saves 11 bytes over the network)
