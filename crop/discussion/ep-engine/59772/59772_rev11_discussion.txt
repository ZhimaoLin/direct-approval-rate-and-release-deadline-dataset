DESCRIPTION

MB-17534: provide options to disable the drift counter

The drift counter for each vbucket was added to aid in built-in
time synchronization. XDCR is planning to use the NTP server
for that purpose. Thus, as per requirements, disable the
application of drift in the following places

- Calculating CAS using Hybrid Logical Clock
- Shipping adjusted time using DCP (saves 11 bytes over the network)

Note that getAdjustedTime will apply the drift and setDriftCounterState
would still set the drift. Otherwise, the semantics of those APIs will
be broken.
