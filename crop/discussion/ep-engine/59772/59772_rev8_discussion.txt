DESCRIPTION

MB-17534: explicitly disable application of drift counter

The drift counter for each vbucket was added to aid in built-in
time synchronization. XDCR is planning to use the NTP server
for that purpose. Thus, as per requirements, disable the
application of drift in the following places

- Calculating CAS using Hybrid Logical Clock
- Shipping adjusted time using DCP (saves 11 bytes over the network)
- Skip unit tests that are related to testing time sync with drift

Note that getAdjustedTime will apply the drift and setDriftCounterState
would still set the drift. Otherwise, the semantics of those APIs will
be broken.

Line:50, tests/ep_testsuite_common.h -> Why is this a temporary change
Could we just not remove the test?

Line:44, src/vbucket.h -> why is it only temporarily being disabled?

Line:50, tests/ep_testsuite_common.h -> Please see reasoning in other place. The test would be re-enabled once the drift is enabled.

Line:44, src/vbucket.h -> The requirement for LWW for watson is to not use the drift for time synchronization but instead only rely on NTP. At a later point in time, maybe for GA of LWW, the drift along with NTP could possibly be used. That is why the temporary disabling.

Line:44, src/vbucket.h -> Could we just not pull it out, and then re-add if the drift counter is required?

I was just concerned of introducing a new variable and checks which would end up always being set to false.

Line:44, src/vbucket.h -> I am just trying to put in minimal changes to adapt for changing requirements. For the next release, the drift could potentially be used again in which case, we can just remove the variable and the associated checks as opposed to recoding them. Or, it may never get used again, in which case, we can remove them as suggested. Or, it may have to be made into a configurable parameter like time_sync_enabled, with flexibility to enable/disable from the client-side. At this point, it isn't clear as to how it is going to be used later on.
