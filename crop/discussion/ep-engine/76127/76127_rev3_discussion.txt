DESCRIPTION

MB-23454: Fix data race in createTapQueue

Appears to be caused by the same buggy string COW as MB-19688 and
MB-18510.

Upon updating the name of a tap connection, the old value was deleted.
This was considered by ThreadSanitizer to be racy with changes made in
one of multiple tasks.

Resolved in the same manner as MB-19688 - forcing an explicit
copy of `std::string name` in `ConnHandler::setName()`.
