It's probably a bit overkill for a simple script like this - it'll take the LICENCE from the repo anyways (Apache 2.0). Personally I doubt we care if someone steals this...

Line:27, scripts/unmerged-commits.py -> nit: it would be slightly more pythonic to do something like:

```
$ python
Python 2.7.11 (default, Jan 22 2016, 08:29:18)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> b = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> for down, up in zip(b, b[1:]):
...     print down, up
...
a b
b c
c d
```
