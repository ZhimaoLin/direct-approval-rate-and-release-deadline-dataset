DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Split deleteWithMeta across KVBucket and VBucket classes

VBucket and HT related functions in KVBucket are moved to VBucket class.
Also, cas and ItemMetaData paramters are passed as reference instead of
ptr as the function logic assumes that they are passed always.

Line:1598, src/vbucket.cc -> Note for future: you can just throw std::logic_error or similar - this is just gcc being dumb ;)
