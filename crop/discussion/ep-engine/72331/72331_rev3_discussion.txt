DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Split deleteWithMeta across KVBucket and VBucket classes

VBucket and HT related functions in KVBucket are moved to VBucket class.
Also, cas and ItemMetaData paramters are passed as reference instead of
ptr as the function logic assumes that they are passed always.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Just minor things.

Line:316, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Nit: "reference" now

Line:328, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Nit: clearer if this is moved down to the deleteWithMeta declaration (will also show up better in Doxygen, etc)

Line:1602, src/vbucket.cc -> Style: Similar to comments on previous commits, given all of the case statements just set `ret` and then essentially end up returning at the end, I'd argue it would be clearer to just return immediately (the reader doesn't have to keep reading down the function to "see if anything else happens, they can see the function has immediately completed, e.g. at line 1573).
