DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Split deleteWithMeta across KVBucket and VBucket classes

VBucket and HT related functions in KVBucket are moved to VBucket class.
Also, cas and ItemMetaData paramters are passed as reference instead of ptr
as the function logic assumes that they are passed always.

Line:320, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Could you add the generateCas method to the deleteWithMeta documentation here?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: over 80 characters

Line:1592, src/vbucket.cc -> Again, I think yoda conditions hurt readability.

Line:320, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Strictly speaking out of scope of this change, but since you have mentioned i will add it. 
Out of scope because it just doesn't end at generateCas. There is bySeqno that is not documented as well. Further, same is the case with many other functions I am refactoring

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:1592, src/vbucket.cc -> I am tuned to think about the advantages of yoda comparision.

Will change here

Line:1592, src/vbucket.cc -> For the record I don't have a particularly strong opinion - given they are a way to prevent a class of bugs (accidentally assigning instead of comparing) which can be a significant issue.

I'd say that if clang static analyzer can reliably catch such bugs then maybe we could say they are not part of our coding style, but if that's *not* the case then I'm happy if people want to write that way.

Line:1592, src/vbucket.cc -> iirc there's a compiler warning in either gcc or clang for accidental assignment in an if statement. It forces you to wrap with an additional set of brackets to explicitly convert the assignment to a value.
