DESCRIPTION

MB-9723: Spawn threads based on CPU core count

Spawn fixed number of threads based on the number of CPU
cores present in each machine and allocate these threads
to the various Task Groups as follows...
1. Spawn 2 X number of cpu cores threads in total
2. ceil(10 % of total threads) are aux io threads
3. ceil(10 % of total threads) are non io threads
4. floor (half of the remaining threads) are writer threads
5. finally the remaining threads are reader threads
Examples:
CPU COUNT | # READERS | # WRITERS | # AUX IO | # NON IO
2         | 1         | 1         | 1        | 1
4         | 3         | 3         | 1        | 1
8         | 6         | 6         | 2        | 2

Line:216, configuration.json -> Please rename it to max_global_threads as they are no longer limited to the IO operations.

Line:218, configuration.json -> Please rephrase the description like "maximum number of threads in a global thread pool.

Line:303, src/scheduler.cc -> We should rename it to maxGlobalThreads as we have a global thread pool, which is not limited to IO operations.
