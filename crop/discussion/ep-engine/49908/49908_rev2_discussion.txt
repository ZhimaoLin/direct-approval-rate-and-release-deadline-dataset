DESCRIPTION

MB-14388: Process all buffered items on consumer before state change

All buffered items on the consumer side will need to processed
before marking the stream as dead, as failing to do this would
result in a state where the checkpointManager's highSeqno is
inconsistent with the snapshot sequence numbers.

Can we add the unit test for this if possible?

Line:731, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> If this consumer can't process buffered items due to the high memory usage (i.e., cannot_process), then we might end up with looping this while clause continuously. The problem is that if the high memory issue is caused by the operational deadlock, then we don't have any way of getting out of it.

Line:731, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> Shouldn't we handle 'cannot_process' return code ? In case of ENGINE_ENOMEM or ENGINE_TMPFAIL this will loop forever.
