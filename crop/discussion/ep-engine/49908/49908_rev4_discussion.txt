DESCRIPTION

MB-14388: Process all buffered items before closing stream

All buffered items on the consumer side will need to be
processed before marking the stream as dead, as failing to do
this could result in a state where the checkpointManager's
highSeqno is inconsistent with the snapshot sequence numbers.
