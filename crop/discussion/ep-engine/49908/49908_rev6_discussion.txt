DESCRIPTION

MB-14388: Process all buffered items before closing stream

All buffered items on the consumer side will need to be
processed before marking the stream as dead, as failing to do
this could result in a state where the checkpointManager's
highSeqno is inconsistent with the snapshot sequence numbers.

Chiyoung, I'd like to give Aruna a toy build with these changes to ensure that this does fix the problem before we actually get this merged. Also I will add a unit test after hearing back from Aruna.
