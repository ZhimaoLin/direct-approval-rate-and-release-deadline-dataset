DESCRIPTION

MB-14388: Process all buffered items on consumer before state change

All buffered items on the consumer side will need to processed
before marking the stream as dead, as failing to do this would
result in a state where the checkpointManager's highSeqno is
inconsistent with the snapshot sequence numbers.
