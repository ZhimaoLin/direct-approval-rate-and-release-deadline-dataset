DESCRIPTION

MB-16402:  Ensure objectregistry has an engine when
deleting the VBucketMemoryDeletionTask.

Ensure the VBucketMemoryDeletionTask is finished before shutting down
to avoid the vbucket deletion occuring on the task with no engine pointer
in thread-local storage (for ObjectRegistry).

This is a backport to 3.0.x of MB-14041
