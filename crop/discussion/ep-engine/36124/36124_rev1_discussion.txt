DESCRIPTION

MB-10918: simplified rollback logic for notifier stream

Seems notifier stream requests are most useful for latest
entry of failover table.  Therefore notifier logic can be set
to return ROLLBACK response only when vb_uuid is not in
failover table and allow the Stream to return END if start_seqno
is already passed or not yet reached.

There is a corner case where provided vb_uuid is from older table, and
this change handles it by returning rollback to get clients to
update failover table.  An alternative would be to accept request
and then immediately return STREAM_END, although that requires additional
checks that notifySeqno is not higher than the older table entry,
otherwise stream will hang again.
