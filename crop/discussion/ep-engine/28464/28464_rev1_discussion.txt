DESCRIPTION

MB-8869 Use atomic queue to push notifications for TAP producers

We saw the frontend ops/sec performance regression from the
previous fix to the OBSERVE replication latency issue. To address
this issue, this change uses the atomic queue to push
notification events for TAP producers, and schedules the
daemon task to grab those events and notify them to the
corresponding TAP producers.
