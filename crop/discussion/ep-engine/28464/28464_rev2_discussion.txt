DESCRIPTION

MB-8869 Use atomic queue to push notifications for TAP producers

We saw the frontend ops/sec performance regression from the
previous fix to the OBSERVE replication latency issue. To address
this issue, this change uses the atomic queue to push
notification events for TAP producers, and schedules the
daemon task to grab those events and notify them to the
corresponding TAP producers.

Abhinav,

Can you please create a toy build for this change and test it with your OBSERVE replication latency case?

I'd like to make sure that we still won't have high latency in OBSERVE replication.

Thanks!

Patch Set 2:

Results show a variation of observe to replica latency ranging from ~200ms up till ~950ms.

Thanks Abhinav,

That's something that I expected with this change as we don't directly wake up a paused Tap Producer. We need to improve this inconsistent performance improvement in the next major release.
