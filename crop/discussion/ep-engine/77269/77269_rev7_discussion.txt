DESCRIPTION

MB-24055 [Ephemeral]: disable Bloom filter

The Bloom filter is still enabled for Ephemeral buckets, however this
is a waste of memory; as it serves no purpose for Ephemeral buckets.

Disable it - as well as saving any maintenance cost, it also reduces
the RSS of an empty Ephemeral bucket from:

    57800 KB
to:

    44632 KB
