Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Just a couple of things I spotted - will review further when passing tests etc.

Line:38, src/linkedlist.h -> Prefer to use `using MemberHookOption = ...` in new C++11 code.

Line:41, src/linkedlist.h -> Ditto

File Comment: tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Running clang-format on this file adds a lot of noise. Suggest you revert the clang-format changes, or do them in a separate patch before the main one.
