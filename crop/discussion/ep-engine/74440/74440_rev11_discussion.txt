DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Add a class that stores ordered sequence of items in memory

This commit adds an abstract base class 'SequenceList' that provides apis
to store ordered sequence of items (StoredValues) in memory in our
multi-threaded, monotonically increasing seq model.

It also adds 'BasicLinkedList', a concrete class that implements SequenceList.
'BasicLinkedList' uses a boost intrusive doubly linked list. It is essentially
a linked list of 'StoredValues'.

Currently, only appendToList() functionality is implemented. But the goal is,
'BasicLinkedList' works in tandem with already existing 'HashTable' to achieve
O(1) writes/updates, O(1) reads and range reads. Range read is necessary for
an in-memory DCP backfill. Range reads provide point-in-time snapshots which
is essential for our incremental DCP.

And a module test is added as well.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

(8 comments)

Line:171, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Style: You could just put the toOrderedStoredValue() call inline, then you don't need the temporary - e.g.

 try {
     seqList->appendToList(lh, *v->toOrderedStoredValue());
 } catch (...)

IMHO it makes the code simpler / easier to follow.

Line:62, src/seqlist.h -> Given this is empty (and hence the same as the compiler-generated default, might as well remove this.

Line:188, CMakeLists.txt -> Nit: Should probably name `linked_list` given we translate CamelCase class names to camel_case.cc filenames.

Line:160, src/stored-value.cc -> static_cast<> is preferred (we are performing a downcast).

Line:41, tests/mock/mock_basic_ll.h -> You can just use std::copy:

 std::copy(seqList.begin(), seqList.end(), std::back_inserter(allSeqnos));

Line:60, src/linkedlist.h -> I think these comments need updating with the current plan (as disused on HipChat yesterday).

Line:549, src/stored-value.h -> Please document this method.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: As per other patches, should wrap at 72 chars (most editors will handle this for you): https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72
