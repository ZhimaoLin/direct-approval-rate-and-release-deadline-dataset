DESCRIPTION

MB-8955 Prevent ExTask starvation

If many tasks of the same priority are inserted,
it is possible that some tasks can be starved due
to the weak ordering of std::priority_queue.
Adding a taskId to the CompareByPriority can help
alleviate this by forcing a FIFO ordering since
newer tasks will have higher taskIds in them

schedule to futureQueue first to avoid itsÂ 
starvation
