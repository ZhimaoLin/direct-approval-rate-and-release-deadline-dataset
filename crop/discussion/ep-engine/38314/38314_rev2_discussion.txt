DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-11325: Use isBackfillPhase instead of checking chk id num"

This reverts commit 2469a551fabdcd68d6e589adde1181d7cf81ded3.

I meant to make things a little bit cleaner with this change. It
wasn't actually meant to fix a particular problem. Since it instead
just created issues we can revert it without having to find any
other fix.
