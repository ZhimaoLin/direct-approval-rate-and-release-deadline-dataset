Just a couple of questions from me..
thanks

Line:271, src/tapconnmap.h -> Is the call in ep_engine.cc which calls this function changed also?

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> if possible can we avoid the second lookup by maybe passing an optional boolean parameter to closeConnectionByName_UNLOCKED which allows this routine to do the all.remove() call itself?
thanks

Line:271, src/tapconnmap.h -> yes

Line:897, src/tapconnmap.cc -> good suggestion. Let's do that at a later time. Some of the code will still need to be refactored.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:899, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Returning null here will cause an assertion to be thrown. If someone connects with the same name then we need to close the old connection and create a new one.

Line:926, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Same thing with the null returned here.

Line:93, src/upr-producer.cc -> Please process the flags. We have one defined in upr.h, it is call UPR_OPEN_PRODUCER.

(4 comments)

Line:86, src/upr-consumer.cc -> We should not be creating a new connection here. Your test case should make the open connection call to the consumer before receiving any mutations.

Line:119, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Same comment as above for the deletions.

Line:2467, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> None of these test cases have been added to the testsuite. Please add them.

Line:2468, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can you add a check here to make sure that the connection is actually open? For example we can check stats tap to see if the connection exists and that it is actually a the right kind of connection.

Line:86, src/upr-consumer.cc -> the unit test case will directly call this API and would fail without this code I copied from the tap side. I assume that what they're intended for? what do you mean by "Your test case should make the open connection call to the consumer"? I'm tNathalie Landrying about the engine_tests case that call the api.

Line:2468, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> why need this check? I don't see it in the tap test case.

Line:93, src/upr-producer.cc -> I'd rather incorporate memcached upr.h change later in the next checkin because I don't want to take integration risk now.

Patch Set 2:

(3 comments)

Line:86, src/upr-consumer.cc -> A connection needs to be opened with the open connection command before the consumer can receive items. You need to do an "h1->upr.open" call and specify that a new consumer connection should be opened. Then you can call the mutation/deletion api's.

Line:2468, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This only checks that the return code is valid, but it doesn't actually check to see if the stream exists on the server. I have already run some tests on this code and the connection doesn't appear in the stats.

Line:93, src/upr-producer.cc -> This command is incomplete without that flag and we cannot have the ns_server team begin any integration without that flag. You will also need this flag for your upr mutation test.
