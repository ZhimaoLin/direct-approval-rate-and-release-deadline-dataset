DESCRIPTION

Send NOOP messages to the eBucketMigrator periodically.

The upstream server should send TAP NOOP messages to
the eBucketMigrator periodically even in non-idle state because
each disk backfill task might take a long time in case of the long
waiting backfill dispatcher queue. Otherwise, the eBucketMigrator
will get timeout if it does not receive any messages from the
upstream server for 300 sec. Note that TAP NOOPs are just dummy
messages and consumed by the local eBucketMigrator only, but not
propagated to the downstream server. Therefore, this change won't
cause any bad overhead.

Patch Set 1:

Tap noop messages should not be consumed locally and transferred over to the destination node (if they are swallowed by the local ebucketmigrator we could might as well just ignore sending them. The whole idea of sending them was to ensure that the tcp connection wasn't idle and terminated by some of the components along the route).

Sending 24 bytes once in a while really isn't that much overhead so we can might as well do it... (but I'd rather just send it if it's been a while since the last time we sent something on the link ;))
