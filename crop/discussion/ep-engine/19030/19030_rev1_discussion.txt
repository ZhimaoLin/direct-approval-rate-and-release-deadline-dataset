Patch Set 1:

As mentioned, I didn't get much information about what the consistence view's requirements are and what needs to be supported in the ep-engine. I'm not comfortable with reviewing the code that I don't have clear understanding.

What I only heard so far is that the flusher periodically sleeps for hundreds milli seconds. I removed that unnecessary sleep in the recent changes, so that the flusher will go into the temporal pause state iff the write queue is empty.
