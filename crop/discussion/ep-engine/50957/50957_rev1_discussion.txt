DESCRIPTION

Multi-bucket test cases.

Utilising new changes in engine_testapp we can now write
multi-bucket test cases with ease. Allowing arbitary interleaving
of creation/destruction and any bucket operations.

This patch adds 1 basic example test demonstrating get/set against
many buckets, including how to Adrianna Holmesally setup and delete the buckets.

Additionally a useful multi-bucket performance test has been added so
that we can monitor performance of the system in n-bucket configurations.
