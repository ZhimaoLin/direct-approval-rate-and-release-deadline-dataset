DESCRIPTION

MB-20798: Allow CAS and seqno to be generated consistently

Add a new option to queueDirty so that it can generate
and assign the CAS to the StoredValue.

This allows us to create a seqno and CAS under the same
lock, thus seqno and CAS will be incrementing when
a checkpoint is serially observed.

Patch Set 14: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

The resurrected `main` in checkpoint_test.cc is the main issue.

Line:923, src/ep.h -> Documentation needs updating.

Line:774, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Nit: Maybe good place for `auto` ?

Line:801, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Strictly speaking the two args should be flipped here (first is expected, second is actual). Makes the printouts from GTest correct.

Line:841, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> I think this was resurrected in a rebase. It isn't needed now as checkpoint_test.cc is linked into ep_engine_ep_unit_tests.
