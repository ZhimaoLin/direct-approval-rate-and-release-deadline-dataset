DESCRIPTION

MB-20798: Allow CAS and seqno to be generated consistently

Add a new option to queueDirty so that it can generate
and assign the CAS to the StoredValue.

This allows us to create a seqno and CAS under the same
lock, thus seqno and CAS will be incrementing when
a checkpoint is serially observed.
