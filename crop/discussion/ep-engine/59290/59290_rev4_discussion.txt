DESCRIPTION

MB-17766: Close passive streams on vbucket state change

Upon vbucket state change, close passive streams into
the vbucket as well along with the active streams from
it. This is to avoid a bad scenario (which could
result in an incorrect high seqno or a crash) when
the mutations coming in to the consumer clash with
the front end operations.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:773, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Minor: close the brace started before vb in the print string

Line:901, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> setDead returns bytes cleared.

This should be used to update the flow control calculations.
(just like how it is done in closeStream function)
