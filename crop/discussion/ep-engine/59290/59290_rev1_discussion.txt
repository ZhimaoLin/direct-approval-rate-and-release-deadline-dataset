DESCRIPTION

MB-17766: Close passive streams on vbucket state change

Upon vbucket state change, close passive streams into
the vbucket as well along with the active streams from
it. This is to avoid a bad scenario (which could
result in an incorrect high seqno or a crash) when
the mutations coming in to the consumer clash with
the front end operations.
