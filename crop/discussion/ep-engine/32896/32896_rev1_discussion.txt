I saw bunch of error logs that are INFO level instead of WARNING. Do you think it is enough for debugging the UPR issues? I'm just curious.

I've just been setting the log level to info when I'm running tests. My current plan was to just do that and then figure out what log messages were the most useful. I can always bump then to warning level later. If you think it would be better for me to just make them warning then let me know and I will change them.

Patch Set 1:

Well, we should bump error-related messages to the warning level at least. Using INFO for those case doesn't seems correct to me.
