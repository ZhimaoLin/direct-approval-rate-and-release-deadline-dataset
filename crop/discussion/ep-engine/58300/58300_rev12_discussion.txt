DESCRIPTION

MB-16919: Process buffered items at consumer one vbucket at a time

It is observed that the DcpConsumer's ProcesserTask takes too
long in certain scenarios. This is because the processer task
iterates over all vbuckets every time the task runs.

To avoid long run times for the ProcesserTask, this change
modifies the processing logic such that every time the task runs,
the buffered items of only a single vbucket that was notified
are processed.

In a minimal test with a sample set of 1000, no apparent
regressions were seen in Observe-REPLICATE_TO_ONE latencies:

                    <---------- (Percentiles) ----------->
(ms.)       MEAN    80th    85th    90th    95th    99th
Before:     204.40  210.24  210.39  210.58  210.82  211.28
After:      195.49  210.31  210.86  211.50  211.71  211.99
