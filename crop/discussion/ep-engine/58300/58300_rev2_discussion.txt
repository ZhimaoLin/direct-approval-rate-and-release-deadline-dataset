DESCRIPTION

MB-16919: Process buffered items at consumer one vbucket at a time

It is observed that the DcpConsumer's ProcesserTask takes too
long in certain scenarios. This is because the processer task
iterates over all vbuckets every time the task runs.

To avoid long run times for the ProcesserTask, this change
modifies the processing logic such that every time the task runs,
the buffered items of only a single vbucket that was notified
are processed. The vbuckets will be processed in a round robin
fashion.

In a minimal test with a sample set of 1000, no apparent
regressions were seen, Observe-REPLICATE_TO_ONE latencies:

                   <---------- (Percentiles) ----------->
(ms.)       MEAN    80th    85th    90th    95th    99th
Before:     204.40  210.24  210.39  210.58  210.82  211.28
After:      203.84  210.08  210.19  210.35  210.65  211.09

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:756, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I've reverted this similar data structure from 3.0.x because profiling revealed it to be a little more costly than a std::queue + Mutex.

Line:766, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> In 3.0.x I've a change here too. In the case where stream is null we've wasted cycles constructing stream, we can just test streams[vbucket] directly

Line:756, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> If that be the case, let me change this to a std::queue and mutex then.

Line:766, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I'll change this too then.

Patch Set 2:

@Jim, I'll wait for your producer changes (from 3.1.4) to be merged in to master, so I can re-use the data structure you've used: DcpProducerReadyQueue.
