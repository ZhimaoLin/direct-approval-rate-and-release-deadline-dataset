Line:6185, src/ep_engine.cc -> getLatestEntry acquires a lock. Would it be fine to use getLatestUUID, which doesn't require a lock?

Line:6190, src/ep_engine.cc -> Using sizeof() on the variable could be useful. So, even if the type of the variable changes, we don't have to explicitly update this. Any thoughts?

Line:12844, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> same here as well

Line:6185, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think getLatestUUID should do the trick here.

Line:6190, src/ep_engine.cc -> Fair enough.
