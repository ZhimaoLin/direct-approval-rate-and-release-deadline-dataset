DESCRIPTION

refactor: Moved stat writing template generator stuff into a header file.

This makes it easier to delegate stat writing down to other stat
containers.

However, this has a nasty side-effect of identical duplicate template
functions being generated in separate compilation units and then
making the linker angry when bringing them back together.  I'm
generating them in different namespaces with a gross mix of templates
and cpp.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

As mentioned, it would generate the same functions from the template functions, but having different namespaces makes sense to me.
