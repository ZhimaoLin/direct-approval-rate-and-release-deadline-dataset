DESCRIPTION

Add basic xerror support to mc_bin_client.py

A very na√Øve implementation of the xerror support - for now just adds
the mapped error name and description to the printed error. This is not
overly useful and would require further work.

Also adds subclasses for each current exception, to allow except-ing a
specific error.

Patch Set 12: Code-Review-1

I think it'd be nice to have a getErrorMap() function that other programs (e.g. cbstats) can use as a documented interface. This could also handle caching and only make a call to the server to update the error map if we have to.
