DESCRIPTION

Remove unused VBucket::updateStoredValue() and addNewStoredValue() added wrongly

These functions were made pure virtual functions and implemented in derived
classes in 61eaced57a2beeaffceb3d72707fa0310d2d0c69.

However they crept back-in in a future commit
0dd9f135975845f42b4b37506203afc5e079370d.

Removing them again.
