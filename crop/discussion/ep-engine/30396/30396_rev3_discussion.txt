DESCRIPTION

CBD-1039 Delete expired non-resident items as part of compaction

This change allows us to delete an expired non-resident item
as part of compaction when the full eviction is selected.

For this, we create a temp item in the hash table and mark it
as deleted and then push the deletion into the checkpoint queue
for the replication and persistence.
