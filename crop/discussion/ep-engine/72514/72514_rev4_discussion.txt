DESCRIPTION

Skip tests which are not applicable without Full eviction

A number of our ep_testsuite tests are only applicable with Full
eviction - they are not valid for either value eviction or Ephemeral
buckets.

For such tests, add a new prepare_full_eviction() method which checks
the current configuation, and skips the test if not running with full
eviction.
