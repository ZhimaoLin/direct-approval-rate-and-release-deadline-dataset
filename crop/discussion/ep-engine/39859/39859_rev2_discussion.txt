DESCRIPTION

MB-11801: Grab vb_mutex iff there was state change

- In the vbucket visitor task that populates the list
with vbuckets whose snapshotting is to be scheduled,
filter out those vbuckets whose state didn't change.

- Track state change with a flag in the vbucket class,
set this flag to true when there was a state change
before we schedule a snapshot, and set it to false
once the vbucket snapshot task completes.
