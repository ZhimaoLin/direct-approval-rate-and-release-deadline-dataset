Patch Set 1: Verified

Please note:

The code change in this patch uses std::const_reverse_iterator which is known to be less efficient than const_iterator. However, given the fact that the maximum vbuckets per data bucket is 1024 the performance tradeoff by using the reverse iterator is very minimal.

I measured elapsed times for both iterator with a simple map of 10,000 elements and found the reverse iterator took just 16ms more.
