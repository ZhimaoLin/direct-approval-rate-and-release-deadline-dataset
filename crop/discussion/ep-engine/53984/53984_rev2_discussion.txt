DESCRIPTION

Consolidate arguments while initializing scan context

While initializing scan context, noDeletes and
deletesOnly would never both be set to true.
Therefore, remove these 2 parameters, and introduce
an enum that covers all cases.

enum = {ALL_ITEMS, NO_DELETES, ONLY_DELETES}

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Generally looks good - thanks for the cleanup. Just a couple of style comments.

Line:167, src/kvstore.h -> Naming: doc_options_t is a bit vague - given this enum controls what type of updates are received; maybe rename to 'UpdateFilter', 'ScanFilter' or similar?

Style: You might prefer to use a C++11-style scoped 'enum class' - see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum. 

This has a number of advantages compared to the older variant.

Line:1246, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Probably worth changing this to a switch statement - makes it more obvious the parameter is an enum and also easier to spot places to update if/when new elements are added to the enum.

Line:119, src/backfill.cc -> Is it worth refactoring the keys boolean as well so that it is a enum? So  when reading the call site we're not reading true/false, but something descriptive.

Line:119, src/backfill.cc -> Hey Jim, good suggestion. Dave made the same comment here:
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/53960/1, reason why I pushed this change. As for the keys, I will make it part of that change (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/53960) since it introduces other parameters.
