DESCRIPTION

Remove misleading comments from PassiveStream::process{Mutation,Deletion}

These comments imply that errors during
PassiveStream::process{Deletion,Mutation} are not handled; however
this is incorrect - the caller checks the return value and re-queues
the mutations in the event of an error.
