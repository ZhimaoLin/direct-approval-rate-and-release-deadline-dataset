DESCRIPTION

MB-19627: Log the actual last seqno sent before closing the stream.

When a DCP stream closes, we log the last sent seqno at the time when
stream transitions to dead state. However, we further stream items in
the readyQ from  dead state as well. This commit adds the correct
last seqno sent.
