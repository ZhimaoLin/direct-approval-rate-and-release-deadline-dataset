DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Fix ConnMap so notifications don't go missing.

There's a reliance on an atomic bool and cmpxchg to
prevent the producer of notification from queueing
himself if he's already got a notification scheduled.

There's an ordering issue though where the producers code
can execute, see the flag is true and not bother queueing
a notification, yet the consumer side is about to clear the
flag and finish. The notification thus never gets queued
and the producer side thinks he will get a notification.

In my terminology:
producer is ConnMap::notifyPausedConnection
consumer is ConnMap::notifyAllPausedConnections

Patch Set 2:

I would like to write a test-case. I feel though we will be better placed to test this upstream using the DCP unit test instead of ep-testsuite.

I can craft an ep-testsuite test, but it won't be reliable as proof (usual retry n thousand times).
