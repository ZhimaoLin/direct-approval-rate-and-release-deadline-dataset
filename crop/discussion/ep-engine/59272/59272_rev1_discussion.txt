DESCRIPTION

MB-16262: Log filtering [2/2]: Reduce view engine DCP clients to WARNING

When a DCP client connects whose name starts with 'mapreduce_view' or
'spatial_view' reduce the minumum log level from NOTICE to WARNING.

This significantly reduces the noise in the memcached logs from DCP
messages triggered by the view engine.
