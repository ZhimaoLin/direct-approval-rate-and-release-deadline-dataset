Line:1376, src/ep_engine.cc -> We need to pass the flags to the snapshot marker function

Line:2584, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we just make this "bool exp_disk_snapshot"? Then when we receive a snapshot we can just check what the first one is. I think this will still work with the code you already have since there is a variable in this function for the number of expected snapshots.
