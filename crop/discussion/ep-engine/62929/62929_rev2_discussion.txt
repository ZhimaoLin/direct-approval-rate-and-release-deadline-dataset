DESCRIPTION

MB-16656: Send snapshotEnd as highSeqno for replica vb in GET_ALL_VB_SEQNOS call

For replica vbucket we must send snapshotEnd received in the last snapshotMarker
as the high seqno. Sending lastClosedChkSeqno can cause problems for view engine
which builds an index from replica vbucket.

Previously this was sent correctly in seqno stats, now adding it for
GET_ALL_VB_SEQNOS as well.
