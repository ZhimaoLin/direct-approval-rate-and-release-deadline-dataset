DESCRIPTION

MB-3748 Init StoredValue pointer array elements to NULL.

calloc performs all-bit-zero initialization in memory.
All-bits-zero representations actually correspond to NULL pointers
on many machines, but it has been reported that there are some
other machines where this condition is not true.

This change explicitly resets StoredValue pointer array elements to
NULL values when it is created through calloc.

Line:172, stored-value.cc -> Good catch. I discussed this change with Trond, and we agreed to NOT push this change into the master at this time. Once we have this issue again, we will investigate it more.

Patch Set 1:

This change doesn't have anything that does harm to the ep_engine :) but actually didn't fix the bug MB-3748.

I will abandon this change.
