Line:2552, ep.cc -> The two get calls require two times of locking in config instance. Can we maintain those two tap throttle config parameters in TapThrottle class? We don't need to use Atomic for these params as they don't need strict atomicity.

Line:423, configuration.json -> Can we make this parameter configurable at runtime? Please also update docs/engine-param.org
