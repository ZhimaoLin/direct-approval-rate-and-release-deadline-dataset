Line:1082, src/vbucket.cc -> I think this should be one higher than the current StoredValues's revSeqno.

Additionally - the VBucket unit test should be updated to verify the revid - see for example VBucketTest, unlockedSoftDeleteWithValue

Line:1082, src/vbucket.cc -> I believe it is being incremented in line 1113 prior to calling processSoftDelete
