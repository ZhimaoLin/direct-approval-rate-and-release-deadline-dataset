DESCRIPTION

Ephemeral: Remove vb_N:persisted_checkpoint_id stat

Remove the stat 'persisted_checkpoint_id' from the 'checkpoint'
statistics group as it is not applicable to Ephemeral buckets.

Implement this by modifying
KVBucketIface::getLastPersistedCheckpointId() to return a pair of
{chkId, bool}, with the bool indicating if a persistence cursor exists
(i.e. this is a persistent bucket).
