Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Few minor things, otherwise looks good.

Line:32, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> Style: Align with opening bracket.

Line:61, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> I think this needs updating / removing (now per-doc flag is gone).

Line:48, src/conflict_resolution.h -> Can this be const?

Line:58, src/conflict_resolution.h -> Nit: Add `override` qualifier?

Line:63, src/conflict_resolution.h -> Nit: Add `override` qualifier?

Line:313, src/ep.cc -> Would be nice to change conflictResolver to be a owning pointer (unique_ptr)

Line:48, src/conflict_resolution.h -> Since the functions assumes v is not null then this ought to be a reference
