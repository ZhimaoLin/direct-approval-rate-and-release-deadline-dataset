Patch Set 2: (5 inline comments)

Trond, this looks great overall. Just few minor comments...

Line:355, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> I think we should rename dump to key_only for indicating if keys are only preloaded with their metadata.

Line:417, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> hmm, why do we need to decode meta data again here? I guess you forgot to remove this after debugging.

Line:2545, ep.cc -> If we still support the sqlite as the underlying storage engine for 2.0, I think it would be better to put the different log messages by checking the following condition:

if (getROUnderlying()->isKeyDumpSupported()) {
    getLogger()->log(EXTENSION_LOG_DEBUG, NULL,
    ...
} else {
   getLogger()->log(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, NULL,
   ...
}

Line:1180, stored-value.hh -> As the item is still locked and marked as non-dirty here, I don't think we need additional "dirty" bool param in StoredValue;:setValue().

Line:156, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> I guess you forgot to remove this commented line.
