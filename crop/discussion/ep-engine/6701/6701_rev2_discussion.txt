DESCRIPTION

Simplify checkpoint remover to purge unref checkpoints immediately

The checkpoint remover previously returned all the items in the
unreferenced checkpoints for post processing. But, as this feature
is no longer needed, we simplify the checkpoint remover by allowing
it to purge unref checkpoints and their items immediately.
