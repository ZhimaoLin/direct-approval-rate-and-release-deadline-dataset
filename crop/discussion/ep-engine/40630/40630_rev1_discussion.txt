DESCRIPTION

MB-11945 Remove the assertion check on sequence number in the flusher.

We sporadically observe the sequence number mismatches between the
flusher and Couchstore. This is not a regression from any recent
changes, and mostly existed much earlier. We will investigate this
issue separately to see if there are any bugs in ep-engine or
Couchstore.
