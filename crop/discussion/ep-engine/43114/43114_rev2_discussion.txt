DESCRIPTION

MB-12636: Release the lock before deleting a finished backfill

The DCPBackfill class contains a reference counter for a Stream
and in the desctructor for the Active stream we take a lock in
the BackfillManager. As a result we must make sure that we do not
hold the BackfillManager lock when deleting a DCPBackfill.
