DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Move getAllKeys to std::string

Future changes are adding more structure to keys, and this code
works with raw pointers/lengths, now passing via std::string through
the callback.

The ep_engine buffer code is also tidied to use a std::vector to
simplify the memory management.
