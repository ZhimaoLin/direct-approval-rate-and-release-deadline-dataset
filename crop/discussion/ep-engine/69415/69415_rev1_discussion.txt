DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Move getAllKeys to std::string

Future changes are adding more structure to keys, and this code
works with raw pointers/lengths, now passing via std::string through
the callback.

The ep_engine buffer code is also tidied to use a std::vector to
simplify the memory management.

Line:2407, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't know if it's going to be an issue, but we have introduced an additional memory allocation / copy here (into the std::string you pass into the callback). Any idea how hot this is? (I assume this is just used by the UI for the Doc browser)?

Not sure on the hotness, but did think about this. This patch was extracted from my upcoming one where std::string was our own StorageKey, and we need to hide the first meta-byte from the client.

The future change you can imagine just switches std::string to StorageKey, and the code return getProtocolKey.data() instead of data()

This patch could remain and send the pointer/len pair through the callback and my future change could have a pre-allocated specialisatiion of StorageKey that doesn't heap allocate

Thanks for the background. I'm fine with this as-is (with the allocation) for now; as I don't think this is a hot path.

I've some experiments upstream too which may enable a non-allocating key constructor
