Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Line:6058, src/ep_engine.cc -> Probably simpler to just call buffer.reserve() on the required length; the vector itself will manage reallocating the underlying storage as necessary.

Line:6072, src/ep_engine.cc -> Can we also drop length and just use std::vector::size() ?

(3 comments)

Line:6108, src/ep_engine.cc -> If you're going to fiddle around with this, a make_shared would be better (saves a memory allocation).

Line:2416, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> ditto

Line:399, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Since you're already tidying up the nested template style issue, may as well shift this ampersand
