DESCRIPTION

MB-19184: Add AtomicUnorderedMap class & use for DcpProducer::streams

Create a new container class AtomicUnorderedMap. AtomicUnorderedMap is
a thread-safe unordered map (associative array).  Elements can be
added, removed and found concurrently from different threads safely.

Update DcpProducer::streams to use the new class (instead of a vanilla
std::map + external locking).

Good job!, Dave,

I was wondering the performance impact of using std::mutex instead of reader-writer lock on 'streams' map. If this change doesn't cause any notable regression in DcpProducer's performance, then it should be OK.

I asked Jim about this (he added the reader/writer mutex originally) and he didn't think there was a significant performance reason to go with the reader/writer - it was just "more accurate".

I ran some performance benchmarks using the ep_perfsuite micro benchmarks, and they didn't show any regression. Obviously they are a small, simple set of tests but they at least are a useful initial number. 

Given this is for master (and we won't be releasing from that for a while), I think it's reasonable to commit this now and we can see what the full-stack tests show in due course.
