DESCRIPTION

MB-19184: Add AtomicUnorderedMap class& use for DcpProducer::streams

Create a new container class AtomicUnorderedMap. AtomicUnorderedMap is
a thread-safe unordered map (associative array).  Elements can be
added, removed and found concurrently from different threads safely.

Update DcpProducer::streams to use the new class (instead of a vanilla
std::map + external locking).

Line:20, tests/module_tests/atomic_unordered_map_test.cc -> Is this meant to be here? I would expect the third param to be an RCPtr by default

Line:251, src/dcp/producer.h -> super nit: redundant comment is redundant as the typename even has 'atomic' in it.
