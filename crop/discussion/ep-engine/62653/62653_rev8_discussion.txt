DESCRIPTION

MB-19184: Add AtomicUnorderedMap class& use for DcpProducer::streams

Create a new container class AtomicUnorderedMap. AtomicUnorderedMap is
a thread-safe unordered map (associative array).  Elements can be
added, removed and found concurrently from different threads safely.

Update DcpProducer::streams to use the new class (instead of a vanilla
std::map + external locking).

I like, and may need something similar for a std::set down the line, so some good ideas to build on
