I have some other comments that I will discuss with you separately.

Line:244, src/upr-consumer.cc -> We should just call isValidOpaque()

Line:2062, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't think we should use the create flag here since if we are rolling back the file should already exist.

Line:2079, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please add the vbid, lastSeqno, and rollbackSeqno to the log message. Also remove the "warning" since the log level will make it clear that this is a warning level message.

Line:2087, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Don't use the create flag since the file should exist. We should also handle an error case by at least logging a message.

Line:2944, src/ep.cc -> I don't think we should pass around this pointer since it can be deleted in other parts of the code while rollback is running.
