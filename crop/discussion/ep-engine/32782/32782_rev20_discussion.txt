Line:227, src/upr-consumer.cc -> We should free this item instance within this function.

Line:239, src/upr-consumer.cc -> We should free this item instance at the end of if stmt.

Line:240, src/upr-consumer.cc -> If we should check if item is deleted or not through it->isDeleted() and then delete that item from hashtable.

Line:247, src/upr-consumer.cc -> If key is not found, then gcb.val.getState() should return "ENGINE_ENOENT". Please check the return value explicitly.

Line:2114, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think we need to move this rewind while loop to the line 2100 and then pass "info.last_sequence" to couchstore_changes_count() as its start seqno.

Line:2140, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We only need to retrieve the list of keys since lastSeqno + 1. So, this flag should be set to true.

Line:2114, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I had this while loop here, just so that we don't need to open another dbHandle if the rollback is greater than 50%.

Line:2114, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I understand what you're trying to do it, but it can cause the rollback to be more than 50%
