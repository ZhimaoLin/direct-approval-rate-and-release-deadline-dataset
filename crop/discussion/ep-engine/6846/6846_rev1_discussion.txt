DESCRIPTION

VBucket messages with higher priority should be sent before backfill

TAP VBucket messages (TAP_VB_SET, TAP_INITIAL_VBUCKET_STREAM, etc.)
should be transmitted to the destination before sending backfilled
items. Otherwise, the destination might lose some backfill items
after processing VBucket messages.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

We don't need this change as we always send vbucket messages with high priority before actual replication.
