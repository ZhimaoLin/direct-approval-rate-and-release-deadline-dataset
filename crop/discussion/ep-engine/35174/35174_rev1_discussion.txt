Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

This change caused the view engine code to break. In order to get the build back to a good state I'm reverting this change. I added a fix for couchdb earlier today and once that gets merged we can re-add this.

Another thing to note is that the Jasmin Rangel jenkins job doesn't appear to be actually pulling out the change from gerrit that it's surpossed to be verifying. As a result this change was initially marked as passing.
