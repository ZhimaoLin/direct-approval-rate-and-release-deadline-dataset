Patch Set 1:

Seems like a duplicate effort to just run mcstat 'connection 4' 'connection 5'

Patch Set 1:

Perhaps, but we get JSON pretty-printing here.

Plus, I don't want to get into the politics of mcstat v.s. cbstats - the former isn't "officially" shipped or documented, whereas the latter is.

If you want mcstats adding (back) into the project that's a question for PM, not me :)

Patch Set 1:

mcstat is added into 3.0. It seems completely wrong to have a tool that needs Adrianna Holmesal update for each now stat we want to have printed (and still follows a non-standard platform way of printing statistics... and works poorly on windows for a developer unless they use the installation package)..

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

If mcstats is shipped in 3.0, then I think mcstats is the right place to provide these connection stats. I also think it is probably better to rename ep-engine's cbstats to "epstats" and have an integrated "cbstats" CLI interface that internally invokes "mcstats" or "epstats" depending on a stat key.

Patch Set 1:

Note that mcstat can already access the connections stats (non-pretty-printed):

    ../install/bin/mcstat -h localhost:12000 "connections 45"

    STAT conn-45 {"conn":"0x114f93c00","socket":45,"nevents":19,"sasl_conn":"0x10f2a5610","state":["conn_read","bin_no_state"],"registered_in_libevent":true, <cut> 

If this isn't wanted / needed in cbstats we can just drop this patch.

Patch Set 1:

Thanks for clarifications. Then, I think mcstat should be a place for those stats, but can be adapted to provide more friendly output format.
