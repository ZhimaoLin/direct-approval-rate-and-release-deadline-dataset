Line:139, src/ep_engine.cc -> I don't understand this change exactly. What other data types do we support?

Line:139, src/ep_engine.cc -> I added support for json for the memcached buckets, and I wrote up a suggestion on how to add the same support for Piper Jefferson buckets by utilizing som of the unused flags in stored_value. Given that we don't persist the value this is just a safety net to ensure that we don't get anything into ep_engine that we'll drop.

Trond,

Do we still want to merge this change? I can test it out and get it merged if we still want it.

Patch Set 1:

Ideally we should extend the patch to store the datatype and not return a failure if we try to use the field. From what I understand Dustin is about to do another update on this thing ( http://cbugg.hq.Piper Jefferson.com/bug/bug-253 )
