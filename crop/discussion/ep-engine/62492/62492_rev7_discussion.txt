DESCRIPTION

Add error injection tests to test logging in CouchKVStore

This patch adds injection of FileOps and a no buffering
flag in order to allow injection of couchstore's MockOps.

This is used in conjunction with a new MockLogger to allow
verification of CouchKVStore's logging output.

Line:410, src/kvstore.h -> I don't think it is a good practice to have a direct dependency on Couchstore specific class 'FileOpsInterface' in this abstract class. I would rather define an abstract class here to make it more extensible for various storage engines. Note that ForestDB also supports the file ops implementation that can benefit from this abstraction.

Line:430, src/kvstore.h -> See my comment above.

Line:446, src/kvstore.h -> I don't think it is a good practice to have Couchstore specific class 'FileOpsInterface' in this abstract class.

Line:447, src/kvstore.h -> Can you put some comments to explain what this flag means?

Line:835, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please put some comments to explain what this flag means. Any impact on the performance or is it mainly for testing?

Line:1357, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:410, src/kvstore.h -> > in this abstract class

This isn't an abstract class. This is in fact the only concrete implementation of KVStoreConfig. 

Config subclasses could in theory be added for CouchKVStore and ForestKVStore however we would need to further investigate what requirements ForestDB would potentially have for that in the future.

Line:410, src/kvstore.h -> I understand KVStoreConfig is not an abstract class. My word 'abstract class' was a little confusing. My main point is that we should not directly refer to Couchstore's specific class 'FileOpsInterface' in this high-level config class.

I'd rather define 'KVStoreFileOps' abstract class in kvstore.h and have CouchKVStore and ForestDBKVStore extend it through Couchstore and ForestDB file ops implementation.

Line:410, src/kvstore.h xxx@xxx.xxx Given that we already have a factory method for constructing the explicit subclasses of KVStore, we could just add a argument to CouchKVStore's constructor specifying the FileOps to use.

That has the nice property that we keep one Config class, and also that the config class stays as simple primitive types (uint16_t, string, etc).

Line:410, src/kvstore.h -> Dave,

I like your suggestion as it also removes the dependency in the config class and allows a given KVStore subclass to use its storage engine file ops implementation.
