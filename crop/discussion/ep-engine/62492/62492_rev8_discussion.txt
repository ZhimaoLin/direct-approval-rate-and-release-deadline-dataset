DESCRIPTION

Add error injection tests to test logging in CouchKVStore

This patch adds injection of FileOps and a no buffering
flag in order to allow injection of couchstore's MockOps.

This is used in conjunction with a new MockLogger to allow
verification of CouchKVStore's logging output.

Functionality looks good, just some minor formatting / style issues.

Line:253, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> If you're reformatting this please update the initialiser list style - i.e.:

 CouchKVStore::CouchKVStore(...)
     : KVStore(...),
       dbname(...),
 ...
 {

Line:288, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> As above

Line:611, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> s/wrap/wrapped/ ?
