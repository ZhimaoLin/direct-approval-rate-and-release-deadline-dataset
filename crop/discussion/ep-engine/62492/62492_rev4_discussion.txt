DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Add error injection tests to test logging in CouchKVStore

[WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT ALL TESTS WRITTEN YET]

This patch adds injection of FileOps and a no buffering
flag in order to allow injection of couchstore's MockOps.

This is used in conjunction with a new MockLogger to allow
verification of CouchKVStore's logging output.
