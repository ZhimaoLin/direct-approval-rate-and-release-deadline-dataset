DESCRIPTION

Add error injection tests to test logging in CouchKVStore

This patch adds injection of FileOps and a no buffering
flag in order to allow injection of couchstore's MockOps.

This is used in conjunction with a new MockLogger to allow
verification of CouchKVStore's logging output.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(13 comments)

Generally good, just a few minor issues.

Line:399, src/kvstore.h -> Adding something to the base-class interface which only one subclass implements / supports is generally undesirable. 

If the caller needs to know it's a specific subclass to make use of some functionality, then it's probably better to just add these new methods / member variables to the subclass, and have the caller dynamic_cast to the CouchKVStore type and use that.

Line:351, CMakeLists.txt -> Nit: Please keep in alphabetical order.

Line:33, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> We try to keep "system" headers separate from the module's headers - please move memcached / kvstore headers to the previous paragraph (and use #include "" instead of <>".

Line:130, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Maybe add a brief description of what this (and the next class) are used for (the "why")

Line:361, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> normally written as one word.

Line:407, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Can be const reference to save copying.

Line:413, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This might be a bit small (I think log messages can be up to ~4K or so normally). Given none of this is performance-sensitive you can just call vsnprintf() twice - once with a size of zero to calculate the needed buffer size (use std::string) and then a second time to actually format the string. That will support arbitrary lengths.

Line:455, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Nit: Add a blank line before `protected:` to separate the different method visibilities.

Line:467, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Nit: Use a auto-ref then you don't have to copy the item.

Line:477, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Ditto

Line:484, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Given you don't change it after creation you can make this const.

Line:69, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.h -> What's the purpose of this new argument? If this is the base file ops to be wrapped, probably better to name `base_ops` or similar, and add a brief description to the function.

Line:24, src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> Nit: long line, please wrap.

Line:417, src/kvstore.h -> These should return references (not copies of the whole config).

Line:423, src/kvstore.h -> Ditto

Line:39, src/kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't we be getting the buffered flag from the config?

Line:48, src/kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:399, src/kvstore.h -> Discussed this with DaveR and came to the conclusion that this would add a lot of complexity and that sort of discussion would be better suited for a time when ForestDB wants its own config options.
