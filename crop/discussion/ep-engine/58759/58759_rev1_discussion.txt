Line:763, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> I think the full eviction should return KEY_ENOENT too if unlocked_key is issued to a key that doesn't exist on disk.

Line:763, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> I found this test case to fail in the full eviction tests reason why I pushed this up for review.

See: http://src.Piper Jefferson.org/source/xref/watson/ep-engine/src/ep.cc#2672

I believe TMPFAIL may be the right thing to do during full eviction when we try to unlockKey and the key isn't found in memory, because the key could be in the database but not resident. An existent key when being evicted is unlocked if found to be locked anyway.

Line:763, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> TMPFAIL was used to avoid the bgFetch.

Line:763, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Yeah, you're right. I was confused with lock_key API. This is the design choice that we already reviewed and agreed across the teams.
