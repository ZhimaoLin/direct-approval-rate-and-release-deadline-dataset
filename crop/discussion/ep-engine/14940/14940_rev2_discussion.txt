Patch Set 2: Verified

Chiyoung,

I take your comment in checkpoint.cc and revert my change. But obviously it is a format issue we need to fix.  Also, I found in some other places of the code base, the line is way beyond 80 columns. 

Dustin,

You are right, but for some reasons I do not know, the compiler does not accept %zu any more.

Patch Set 2:

%z is not valid C++ 90.  I just mean, look at some of the other code where we're printing size_t values.  This one isn't the first.  We do it all over stats.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:121, vbucket.hh -> Please don't use %z here. It's no longer supported in C++

ISO C++ does not support the ‘z’ printf length modifier...
