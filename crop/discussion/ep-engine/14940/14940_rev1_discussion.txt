Please check if "%zu" is more portable way to print size_t objects. Thanks.

Hi Jin,

Looks like "%z" is no longer supported by ISO C++. 


Junyis-MacBook-Pro:ep-engine Macie Morton$ make
make  all-am
  CXX    ep_la-backfill.lo
cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors
In file included from backfill.cc:3:

Thanks for looking into this. I think 'z' here is a wide specifier instead of being a type specifier (meaning we probably have to use with %zu). Can you double check please?

Jin,

Actually I replaced "%ld" with "%zu" and got the error in above comment. :)

btw, "%zu" does work on branch-2.0 either. The compiler we use does not support "z".

Ok, thanks :) I think mc_engine.cc use the specifier in a few places (at least in 2.0) you may want to change them as well then.

Yes, I have already changed that. I will tNathalie Landry to Chiyoung if we shall merge my fix on 2.0, or forward merge this fix from 1.8.1 to 2.0.

Patch Set 1:

%z is the correct way to format a size_t in c99.  We do format many size_ts throughout the C++ code, however.
