DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-15213: Disable DCP flow control if buffer size passed by client is zero

We have documented that if DCP client sets flow control buffer size to zero
the DCP producer would not do flow control. So if the flow control buffer
size is set to zero, the producer does not start flow control or disables the
flow control setup before.
