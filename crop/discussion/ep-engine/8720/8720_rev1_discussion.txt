DESCRIPTION

Add vbucket stats details

Some of our stats are aggregated out of all vbuckets. When we're just
presented with an aggregated number that seems wrong it's a bit hard
to figure out where it comes from. This commit introduce the support
for "stat vbucket-details" to get the stat from the individual
vbuckets.
