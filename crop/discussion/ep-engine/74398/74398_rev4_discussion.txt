DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Expose collection-length through get_item_info

Collection-aware DCP will need to transmit the collection length
for mutation/deletion/expiration messages, allowing the client to
know the collection.

Note this is currently an extra scan/search on the key looking for the
separator. Two points:

1. When separator changes are added this can go wrong. If the
   get_item_info engine call back is made with a key "c::k" and the
   separator has just changed from "::" to "-", we will report
   a collectionLen of 0, instead of 1.
   We would need to block separator changes if we know this bug could
   be possible, e.g. if DCP queue is not empty cannot change
   separator. Or read 2...

2. This extra search could be removed if all StoredValue/Item carry
   the collectionLen from construction onwards. Note we will have
   scanned the DocKey at SET time for collection validation and thus
   could save the collectionLen at that point removing the need for
   this extra scan and at the same time addressing point 1.
   This would be at the cost of 1 extra byte per Item/StoredValue.
