Line:159, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> We need a better way than just sleeping here. If no backfills can run then the cpu will just eat cycles.

Line:29, src/dcp-stream.cc -> This should be done in bytes as opposed to the number of items.

Line:159, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> Yes, can we wake up the paused backfill task when it can resume streaming?

Line:90, src/kvstore.h -> The initialization order of those variables is now inconsistent with their byte addresses. Please correct it.

Line:229, src/dcp-stream.h -> The number of items ?

Line:30, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Can we use the DCP buffer size for flow control instead?

Line:159, src/dcp-backfill.cc -> Right, I want to make this code a little bit smarter.

Line:90, src/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:229, src/dcp-stream.h -> Yeah, this will go away later though since I'll do something that allows us to better control the memory usage.
