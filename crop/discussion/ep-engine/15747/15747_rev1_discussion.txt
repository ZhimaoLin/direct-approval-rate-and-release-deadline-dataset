This commit takes Trond's comment in previous commit to make class item_metadata follow C++ name convention.

I think docs would be good and some minor interface changes to make things be a bit more encapsulated.

Line:127, item.hh -> This would be a pretty good opportunity to document the interface.

Line:346, item.hh -> Wouldn't this be better as a

    ItemMetaData(const uint8_t *data, size_t len)

Or at least

    ItemMetaData::decode(const uint8_t *data, size_t len)

?

Line:127, item.hh -> Well, right there.  We use doxygen all throughout the project (though new things keep popping up undocumented).  Look at any of the documented classes.

Running "doxygen" from the top of the source tree will generate the documentation into the docs/doxy directory so you can see what it looks like and what's obviously missing.

I'd like to make this const correct once it goes in.  This looks like something that would be very useful for my work.
