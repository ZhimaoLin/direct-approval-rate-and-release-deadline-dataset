DESCRIPTION

Provide options for persisting vbucket_state changes

There are cases where vbucket_state changes need to be
persisted and committed to disk like state changes and
in some cases such level of durability is not needed.
Hence provide options to provide more flexibility.

Line:619, src/kvstore.h -> Nit: whitespace is out.

Line:922, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Are there any other possible options? If so should check if invalid options were passed and throw std::invalid_argument or similar.

Line:318, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> I assume this is an overridden virtual method - if so you can use the `override` keyword to make this explicit to the reader.

Line:1197, src/ep.cc -> I think snapInterval can be made const.

Line:1106, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Should check for valid options and error if not valid - at the moment if you specified options which wasn't one of these two, the function would simply return true, which is very misleading IMHO.

Line:619, src/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:922, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> The only other option that can be specified would be the VBSTATE_UPDATE_CACHE_ONLY. We needn't check that option as we have to update the cached vbucket state in any of the 3 available options.

Line:318, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:1197, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:1106, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> The only other option that can be specified is the cache update option which needs to update the cache in all of the 3 options.

Line:922, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> What I meant is that if this function was called with not WITH/WITHOUT_COMMIT - i.e. VBSTATE_UPDATE_CACHE_ONLY, then is is correct to just closeDatabaseHandle() and return true?

Line:1106, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As per the previous comment - would it be correct to do essentially nothing in this function (i.e. just return true) if the user specified the other unhanded option (UPDATE_CACHE) ?

Line:922, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> True. This function won't do anything if the other options is specified. There are only 2 clients for this reset and snapshotVBucket. Both functions update the cached VB state before calling this function. In order to ensure that this function does what it is supposed to do, I shall refactor this to ensure that the state is updated here.

Line:1106, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I am not sure if this function is doing nothing. if UPDATE_CACHE is specified, we still end up updating the cached vb state.

Line:922, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Slight change from my previous comment. I have made this function take only WITHOUT_COMMIT and WITH_COMMIT with everything else taking an exception. Functions that call this function are expected to update the cached vbucket state.
