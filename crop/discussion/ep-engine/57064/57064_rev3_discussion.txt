DESCRIPTION

Provide options for persisting vbucket_state changes

There are cases where vbucket_state changes need to be
persisted and committed to disk like state changes and
in some cases such level of durability is not needed.
Hence provide options to provide more flexibility.

Line:229, src/kvstore.h -> Please use 'enum class' as above

Line:232, src/kvstore.h -> Can you put some comments to explain what each option means? In addition, if we want to differentiate a commit case, then I rather prefer to name them as follows:

VBSTATE_CACHE_UPDATE_ONLY,
VBSTATE_PERSIST_WITHOUT_COMMIT,
VBSTATE_PERSIST_WITH_COMMIT

Line:987, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> setVBucketState() below also updates the cached vbucket state that is already done by updateCachedVBState() here. Can we simply invoke updateCachedVBState() inside setVBucketState()?

I think we can simplify this function from this line as follows:

if (!setVBucketState(vbucketId, vbstate, cb, options)) {
    ...
}
...

Line:959, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to check if VBSTATE_COMMIT is given or not before calling the commit API?

Line:1204, src/ep.cc -> I'm not sure why we don't need to make ForestDBKVStore's behavior different from CouchKVStore.  It seems to me that CouchKVStore invokes the commit API with VBSTATE_PERSIST while ForestDBKVSTore doesn't.

Line:969, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Should check for any other unhanded options specified and raise an invalid_argument exception or similar.

Line:354, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Nit: long line, please wrap.

Line:1013, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Again, should check a valid option has been specified.

Line:229, src/kvstore.h -> enum class doesn't allow me to combine options.

Line:1204, src/ep.cc -> The granularity of commit is at a file level. In case of CouchKVStore, once all the changes for the file (i.e., vbucket) have been persisted, it can be committed immediately. I didn't want to separate the 2 cases for CouchKVStore.

Line:228, src/kvstore.h -> The common style in ep-engine is to use _t - vbstate_persist_options_t

Line:230, src/kvstore.h -> can you comment to indicate that the values are for individual bits.

Line:987, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't know if setVBucketState updates the cached vb state. It takes the cached VB State and saves it to disk.
