DESCRIPTION

Provide options for persisting vbucket_state changes

There are cases where vbucket_state changes need to be
persisted and committed to disk like state changes and
in some cases such level of durability is not needed.
Hence provide options to provide more flexibility.

(3 comments)

Line:489, src/kvstore.h -> As I commented in the other places, the underlying KVStore should maintain this stat and return it to the caller via this API.

Line:320, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> I don't think we need a parameter to this function.

Line:180, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> I think the underlying KVStore (CouchKVStore or ForestDBKVStore) should maintain this stat and return it to the caller.
