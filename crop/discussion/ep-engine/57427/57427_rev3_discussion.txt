DESCRIPTION

MB-16915: RollbackTask to hold ref count ptr for DCP consumer instead of raw ptr

Rollback task is spawned when a DCP consumer is asked to rollback by a DCP
producer. Rollback runs in background and there is a possibility that the DCP
consumer object gets deleted before rollback task completes. We can avoid this
if RollbackTask holds a ref counted ptr of DCP consumer instead of a raw ptr.
