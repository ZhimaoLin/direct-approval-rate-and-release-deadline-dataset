DESCRIPTION

Fix to the bug in wait_for_persisted_value function in the unit tests.

wait_for_persisted_value function does not wait for a commit to be
completed. This results in sporadic failures in unit tests related
to persistence. This fixes the above issue by waiting until a commit
is executed.
