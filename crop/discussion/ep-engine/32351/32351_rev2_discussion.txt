Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:69, src/upr-consumer.cc -> When do we free the stream instance from memory?

Line:196, src/upr-stream.h -> I rather define setState(...) in Stream class and make transitionState(...) pure virtual function in Stream class. Let's enhance it later as a separate commit.
