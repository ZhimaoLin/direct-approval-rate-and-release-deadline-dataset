DESCRIPTION

MB-23994: Update deletedTime when deleted SV is re-deleted

When re-deleting an already deleted item (for example when the deleted
item has a body and that body is changed), the DeletedTime was not
updated.  As such, it may be purged too early - the purge age should
be based on the last modification of the item.

Fix by ensuring the deletedTime is updated whenever the item is
(re)deleted, not just the first time.
