Patch Set 1: Do not submit

You should probably read this:

Also, none of these changes should touch mc-kvstore.  This has nothing to do with a memcached client.

Patch Set 1: (7 inline comments)

There's a ton whitespace errors (I stopped marking them after a while), brackets in unusual places and optional braces omitted.  There are no optional braces in our code.  It's not too far off, but needs to look more like the rest of the codebase.

Line:104, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> ws

Line:443, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> There are no optional braces.

Line:87, kvstore.cc -> Why was this line deleted?

Line:24, kvstore.cc -> Why don't we make a "couchstore" backend?  This greatly changes the meaning of all the mckvstore code.

Line:53, Makefile.am -> ws

Line:162, Makefile.am -> ws

Line:55, item.cc -> Why would this use an output variable instead just a return value?

It's actually my bad forgetting to run a whitespace removal script before Junyi grabbed the codes. Will ensure to run the script before uploading the next patch. Thanks.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Heh, my first commit was much the same in terms of small mistakes, but not as ambitious Junyi. Thanks for the pointing out the issues Dustin.

My one question to Dustin is, why would we want to support 2 backends to CouchDB?

(nobody gets their first commit through)

The mv kvstore is a memcached backend.  If we don't want to support it, we can remove it (separately).  However, it's actually a very good thing along the path of a multi-tier storage mechanism I discussed with Zynga folk for separating their very high traffic from their long tail.

Patch Set 1:

Dustin, we'll defer to your best judgement here and create a mccouch option in kvstore.cc
