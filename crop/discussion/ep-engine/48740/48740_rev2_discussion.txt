Line:5805, src/ep_engine.cc -> We may want to consider having a constant for the 1000. It could help avoid computing the initial buffersize again if we happen to change it later.

Line:5805, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'm fine with that, but would prefer to add it into a separate commit since this change is only about moving the code to a different place.

Line:180, src/kvstore.h -> RollbackCB is passed into a function in the KVStore so I think it's still needed. I'm actually going to move this class in another change anyways and I'm planning on pushing that change to review soon.
