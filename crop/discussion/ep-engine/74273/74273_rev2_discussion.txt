DESCRIPTION

Implement StatsVkey functionality only in EPBucket and EPVBucket.

StatsVkey (stats key validated) is done only in persistent buckets wherein
you get the stats of a key from the disk. We do not want it in Ephemeral
buckets.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Mostly looks good, few minor comments.

Line:65, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> As per the existing methods in ephemeral_bucket.h which are not supported, suggest you put the implementation in the header as it's essentially self-documenting then.

Line:65, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Given there's already an error code for this, I suggest you just return ENOTSUP or similar - simpler code.
