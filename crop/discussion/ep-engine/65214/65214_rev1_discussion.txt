running on the same file. So, reschedule vbucket deletion as a
workaround.

Line:605, src/kvstore.h -> Please document what the return value signifies. 

(If you want to simplify you could just move the function comments from the subclasses to the base class here - we don't need duplicated, redundant descriptions of what the method does).
