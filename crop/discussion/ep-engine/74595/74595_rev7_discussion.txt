DESCRIPTION

MB-22960: Test to ensure no data loss with cursor dropping

There was a concern that if we have dropped the DCP cursor and the
persistence cursor moves forward by the time we re-register the DCP
cursor in the ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot then we might lose data.

Therefore a test was created to investigate what happens in this
particular scenario.  The test showed that the endSeqno provided to
markDiskSnapshot is not the DCPBackfill::endSeqno but is instead the
last persisted seqno, which is provided by underlying storage engine.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> You imply it, but maybe add a final sentence / clause to make explicit that there actually isn't any data loss risk.

Line:116, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Given the complexity of this test I think it's worth including a description to the test function outlining what the test is testing for.
