DESCRIPTION

MB-11731 Replace the shard-level vbstate snapshot with individual tasks.

As we replace a shard-level lock with a vbucket-level lock to synchronize
the flusher, vbucket deletion, vbucket compaction, vbucket state
persistence tasks, this changes also replaces the shard-level vbstate
snapshot task with individual vbstate persistence tasks.
