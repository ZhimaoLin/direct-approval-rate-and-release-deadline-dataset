DESCRIPTION

MB-100: fix a couple of compilation warnings

The warnings of comparison between signed and unsigned integers
come out everytime I recompile ep_engine, thus probably it is
better to fix it.

Patch Set 2:

Hi Chiyoung and Mike,

I am not sure how Hugo Blankenship works here. It marked yes followed by a no, in between there is no change at all.

Does it matter? Can I go ahead and merge it? Thanks.
