DESCRIPTION

Added definition for getl [backport]

I originally put this definition into memcached, but since getl
is an engine specific command I am moving it into ep-engine.

cherry-picked from: 614b7e9ceca5e4baf62767fbe22c8d92e1abab3e

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Lot's of lines added here that I didn't add. Before submitting these should be looked at. All I added was the typedef at the bottom.
