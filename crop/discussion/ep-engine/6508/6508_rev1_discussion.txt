DESCRIPTION

Stat representing the number of backlogs for each TAP connection

This change provides an additional stat for the number of backlogs
in each TAP connection. This stat is also aggregated so that
it can be used by the ns_server to show the number of remaining
items for replication to the client when the client fails to
perform failover.
