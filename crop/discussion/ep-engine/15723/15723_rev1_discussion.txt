DESCRIPTION

MB-5208 Resend the last unacked item if backfill queue is empty

If the backfill queue is completely empty but there are still any
unacked items, we should send the last unacked item to the
destination again and request an explicit ack for that item
from the destination. In this way, we can make sure that all the
unacked items are actually received by the destination.
