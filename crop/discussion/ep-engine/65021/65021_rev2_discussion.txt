DESCRIPTION

MB-19892: Ensure backfills are terminated when closing DcpProducer's streams

There is a memory and FD leak if a DCP Producer is closed when
backfills are still present - for example if the connection is
disconnected while backfill is still running.

The issue is that there is a circular reference between DcpProducer
and its ActiveStreams (in the `streams` map). This means that while
all /external/ references to DcpProducer are correctly reduced to
zero, the refcount is held at 1 by any ActiveStream objects, and
vice-versa.

The effect is that the DcpProducer object is never deleted, and in
turn we do not close open couchstore files the DCPBackfill tasks have
open.

Arguably the issue is that the circular reference exists; however the
simplest way to fix this issue is to:

1. Ensure that when all streams are closed
   (DcpProducer::closeAllStreams) we terminate the DcpProducer's
   backfill manager.

2. In BackfillManager::terminate(), in addition to cancelling the
   managerTask, also cancel and delete all present backfills -
   functionality which used to occur in the destructor (which also was
   never called as we never destroyed the owning DcpProducer).

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Dave, I think there should not be a deadlock (due to circular reference) because we explicitly get rid of the reference held by the backfill to a dead stream at http://10.5.2.251/source/xref/watson/ep-engine/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc#224

I still +2 this because I do not see any problem with the change. Also the change quickens the deletion of circular reference

We don't - as there's no guarantee that code will be executed. 

See the parent patch (http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/65020/2) which demonstrates the problem. It fails commit validation due to us leaking a BackfillManager task (and related objects / FDs): http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-Jasmin Rangel-watson/839/label=ubuntu-1204/valgrindResult/
