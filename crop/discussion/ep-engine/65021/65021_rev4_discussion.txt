DESCRIPTION

MB-19892: Ensure backfills are terminated when closing DcpProducer's streams

There is a memory and FD leak if a DCP Producer is closed when
backfills are still present - for example if the connection is
disconnected while backfill is still running.

The issue is that there is a circular reference between DcpProducer
and its ActiveStreams (in the `streams` map). This means that while
all /external/ references to DcpProducer are correctly reduced to
zero, the refcount is held at 1 by any ActiveStream objects, and
vice-versa.

The effect is that the DcpProducer object is never deleted, and in
turn we do not close open couchstore files the DCPBackfill tasks have
open.

Arguably the issue is that the circular reference exists; however the
simplest way to fix this issue is to:

1. Ensure that when all streams are closed
   (DcpProducer::closeAllStreams) we destroy the DcpProducer's
   backfill manager.

2. Rely on ~BackfillManager to cancel and delete all backfills, and
   also cancel the backfillManager task if still running. Note that
   previously this destructor was never called as we never destroyed
   the owning DcpProducer.

One slight sublety is the fact that the BackfillManagerTask (which
runs on a seperate background AUXIO thread) also needs to have a
pointer to the backfill manager object, and we need to ensure that
this task doesn't keep the backfill manager alive after the
DcpProducer has reset() its pointer. We solve this by making
BackfillManagerTask have a /weak/ pointer to the backfillmanager. For
the duration of the run() method the weak_ptr is promoted to a
shared_ptr, giving the task temporary shared ownership, but as soon as
that method completes the (shared) ownership is dropped and the
backfillManager can be deleted.

The patch also adds a Unit test which opens a DCP producer, opens a
stream and when deletes the bucket (with the stream still
connected). This leaks memory (and a couchstore FD) without the fixes
present here.
