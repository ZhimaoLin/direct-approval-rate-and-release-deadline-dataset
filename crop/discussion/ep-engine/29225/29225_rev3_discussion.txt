Line:522, src/checkpoint.cc -> This will ensure that we will not remove a checkpoint that has not been persisted because we will not update pCursorPreCheckpointId until the items are actually written to disk.

Line:693, src/checkpoint.cc -> We should set the pCursorCheckpointId to one less than the checkpoint id the persistence cursor is in because it is possible that in between the calls to getAllItemsForPersistence() and itemsPersisted() the open checkpoint when we got the items has become a closed checkpoint.

Line:693, src/checkpoint.cc -> During the backfill phase, the open checkpoint is empty and its id is set to zero. Please make sure that we won't have an underflow issue.
