DESCRIPTION

Move src/sizes.cc to the test directory and GTESTify

It's easy to make this test fail compilation because it's dependent
modules are so constrained. Adding to ep-engine_ep_unit_tests as a
disabled test keeps it compiling despite changes to other source
files.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

./ep-engine_sizes was a nice and quick way to show the sizes of different types. Moving it into a Disabled GTest makes it pretty hard for people to "get at" it - they have to remember the correct GTest incantation to make it run.

Perhaps it would be preferable to just link it with the ep_obj library (assuming that solves the compilation dependancies?)

If not, at the very least we probably want to document exactly how to run it, or maybe add a simple CMake target (`make sizes`?) which will run it.
