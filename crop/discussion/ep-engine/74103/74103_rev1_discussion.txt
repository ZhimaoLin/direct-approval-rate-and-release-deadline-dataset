Line:32, src/mutation_log_entry.cc -> do we want to record in memcached log if this happens?

Line:103, src/mutation_log_entry.h -> = default; ?

Line:181, src/mutation_log_entry.h -> why does the _key need to be the final member?

Line:32, src/mutation_log_entry.cc -> no, this commit has only moved existing code, and logType is only used by the ostream operator, it is changing as well in future commits for this MB

Line:103, src/mutation_log_entry.h -> You can't default an operator, again just moving code

Line:181, src/mutation_log_entry.h -> MutationLogEntry is only the header of a bigger block, the key is stored in _key and overflows outside of this class

Line:103, src/mutation_log_entry.h -> upstream this now throws (we should never call delete on this object, only on the underlying buffer)
