DESCRIPTION

MB-19952: Ensure that simultaneous tasks use separate file/kvstore handles

ForestDB doesn't allow separate file and KV store handles be used
simultaneously by 2 different threads. As part of this commit, the
following changes are made to ForestKVStore

- Use separate file handles for readers and writers.
- Synchronize the writer tasks (flusher, snapshot, delete vbucket, flush bucket).
- Open a separate file and kvstore handle for the infrequent tasks. For
  example, stat calls, backfill, getAllKeys.
- There is a possibility that as compaction is running, a file is being moved
  from 0.fdb.1 to 0.fdb.2. A thread trying to open a handle on 0.fdb.1 could
  fail as soon as compaction completes. In order to prevent that, use a
  handleLock to synchronize closing the handle before compaction and a
  separate thread opening a new handle. As long as there is an open
  file handle on the file, the file should ideally not be removed
  according to ForestDB semantics.

Only looked at this briefly, hence the +1. I'll look in more detail tomorrow (and hopefully give +2) if no-one else gets there first.

I don't see any new test cases for the issues this patch is trying to address (compaction running at same time as other tasks, etc).

Line:437, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Any reason this can't be made the constructor of ForestKvsHandle?

Line:1017, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:711, src/vbucket.cc -> Done

Line:437, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> There are private members of ForesKVStore that are being accessed to create the handle. Hence, thought it might be better to keep it here.
