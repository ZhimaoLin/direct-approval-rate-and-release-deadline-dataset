DESCRIPTION

MB-19952: Ensure that simultaneous tasks use separate file/kvstore handles

ForestDB doesn't allow separate file and KV store handles be used
simultaneously by 2 different threads. As part of this commit, the
following changes are made to ForestKVStore

- Use separate file handles for readers and writers.
- Synchronize the writer tasks (flusher, snapshot, delete vbucket, flush bucket).
- Open a separate file and kvstore handle for the infrequent tasks. For
  example, stat calls, backfill, getAllKeys.
- There is a possibility that as compaction is running, a file is being moved
  from 0.fdb.1 to 0.fdb.2. A thread trying to open a handle on 0.fdb.1 could
  fail as soon as compaction completes. In order to prevent that, use a
  handleLock to synchronize closing the handle before compaction and a
  separate thread opening a new handle.
