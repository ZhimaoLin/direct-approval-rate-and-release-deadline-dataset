DESCRIPTION

MB-8955 Prevent ExTask starvation: order by taskId

If many tasks of the same priority are inserted,
it is possible that some tasks can be starved due
to the weak ordering of std::priority_queue.

Adding a taskId to the CompareByPriority can help
alleviate this by forcing a FIFO ordering since
newer tasks will have higher taskIds in them

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Please push all incoming new tasks into the future queue. Otherwise, we will have a starvation issue in the future queue.
