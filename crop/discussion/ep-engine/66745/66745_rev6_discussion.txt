DESCRIPTION

MB-20529: Create bloom filters for vbuckets upon bucket creation

Backport of MB-16827 to sherlock branch.

Set up bloom filters for vbuckets immediately as opposed to waiting
for the first compaction to run for the following scenarios:
- upon creation of the bucket
- during rebalance

During warmup, the bloom filters will not be set up as we're not
aware of the deleted items and/or non-resident items at the moment.
The first compaction following the warmup will still be responsible
for setting up the bloom filters.
