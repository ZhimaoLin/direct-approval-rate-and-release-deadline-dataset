Line:796, src/vbucket.cc -> This is incorrect - you're passing a non-boolean argument (item_eviction_policy_t) to a boolean parameter.

Also - the previous code always called this with wantsDeleted:true, and the rest default, not dependant on evictionPolicy):

 vb->fetchValidValue(blh, key, bucket, true);
