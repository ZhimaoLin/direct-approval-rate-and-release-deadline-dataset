DESCRIPTION

MB-3980 Fix to the race condition in purging expired items.

There was a race condition between gathering expired items by the
item pager and purging them from memory hash table. This change
fixes this issue by checking if each collected item still expired
or not right before deleting from memory hash table.

Patch Set 3:

Dustin/Trond/Matt, can anyone please review this change when you have some time? If this looks good, we need to merge this into the refresh so that Farshid can kick off the build and test it more. We have some issues in creating a toy build for refresh branch now.
