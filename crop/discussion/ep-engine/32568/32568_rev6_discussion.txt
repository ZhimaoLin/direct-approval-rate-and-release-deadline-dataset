Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Line:24, src/random_num_generator.cc -> cb_rand_t is not an int on windows.. you should probably just have an "initialized" variable to check on

Line:28, src/random_num_generator.cc -> you should keep the mutex the entire function. cb_rand_* does not give any promises that it is thread safe

Line:29, src/random_num_generator.h -> Should we rename this to RandomGenerator, and put it in the platform library?

Line:29, src/random_num_generator.h -> Yeah, that's better. I can put it there tomorrow (about to taking off now :)). If you have some time today, appreciate it if you can add it to the platform library.
