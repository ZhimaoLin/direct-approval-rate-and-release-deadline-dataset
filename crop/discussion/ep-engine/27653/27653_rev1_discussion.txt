DESCRIPTION

MB-8581
1. Fixed a bug that prevent warmup to load access log
2. Added a loadingData step after loadingAccessLog to meet warmup watermarks.
   In the loadingAccessLog phase we save the keys of the items that loaded to
   hashtable and pass it to the loadingData phase. We then use it to only load
   items that are not already loaded earlier.
