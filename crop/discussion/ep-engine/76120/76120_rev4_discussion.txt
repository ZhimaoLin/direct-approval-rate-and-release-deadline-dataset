DESCRIPTION

Delete-with-value: Fix count of deleted items

Prior to Spock, the valid state transitions for StoredValues (relating
to deletion) were:

    /---\
    |   |
    |   V
    Alive --------> Deleted
          <--------

With the advent of Deleted Bodies for system XATTRs, Deleted SVs can
optionally have a value (Blob) associated with them, which can be
changed (or removed) without going back to Alive:

    /---\              /---\
    |   |              |   |
    \   V              \   V
    Alive -------->   Deleted   ----------> Deleted
      ^   <--------  with-value <---------- no-value
      |                                         |
      |                                         |
      \-----------------------------------------/

Given that Deleted-with-Value and Alive both are moved-to using
updateStoredValue(), we need to handle increasing numDeletedItems in
additional code paths - specifically whenever the value changes.

Fix this in HashTable::unlocked_updateStoredValue, and add tests for
these cases to the Delete-with-value tests.
