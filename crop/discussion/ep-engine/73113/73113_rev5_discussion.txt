DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Add SystemEventFactory

The SystemEventFactory creates Item objects representing
the following system events.

- create collection
- begin delete collection

An Item which represents a SystemEvent will eventually flow through
checkpoints to the flusher and DCP.

A simple test checks the Item is as expected.

- The operation is system_event.
- The flags return the detailed event type.

(4 comments)

Line:38, src/systemevent.cc -> should this be DeleteEventKey?

Line:43, src/systemevent.cc -> Did you add the std:: prefix? - might have picked up the old one we had in our namespace.

Line:29, src/collections/collections_types.h -> Just curious - what's the rationale behind the single-colon on the end here - would it be more consistent to use double-colon?

Line:24, src/systemevent.h -> Given you're specifying the storage type, any reason to not use uint8_t ?

Patch Set 5:

(5 comments)

Line:38, src/systemevent.cc -> At the moment, BeginDeleteCollection is a delete of CreateCollection, so must have the same key.

Line:43, src/systemevent.cc -> will try

Line:29, src/collections/collections_types.h -> no real reason, can be anything I guess

Line:24, src/systemevent.h -> Ah upstream they are stored in flags of an Item, so i guess i could drop the size specifics from this patch and move that to the one it makes more sense in, but that's the reason for uint32 as flags is a uint32

Line:38, src/systemevent.cc -> Ah, so we also need some context (Mutation vs Deletion)? to distinguish between them?

Should we use something like the isDeleted() flag?

Line:43, src/systemevent.cc -> Might be because of the braced-initialised DocKey - try making the type of that explicit - something like:

 make_unique<item>(DocKey{key, DocNamespace::System}, ...);

Line:38, src/systemevent.cc -> isDeleted is based on the operation type, i've a later patch which relies on these Items being distinguished as system events.

I did at one point have system_event and del_system_event

Line:43, src/systemevent.cc -> same :/  will try without any constructor argument defaults, which this Item constructor has in spades

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:43, src/systemevent.cc -> fixed - when i tried without the brace initialise i forgot <Item> on make_unique

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:24, src/systemevent.h -> Makes sense - but I think it's worth adding a comment here explaining the reason for the uint32_t to assist the future reader.
