DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Add SystemEventFactory

The SystemEventFactory creates Item objects representing
the following system events.

- create collection
- begin delete collection

An Item which represents a SystemEvent will eventually flow through
checkpoints to the flusher and DCP.

A simple test checks the Item is as expected.

- The operation is system_event.
- The flags return the detailed event type.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:33, src/systemevent.cc -> deletion "marker" may change as we refine how DCP will convey a collection delete

i.e. this may become a special "begin-delete" marker and only once we've wiped out the collection do we wipe out all the collection markers
