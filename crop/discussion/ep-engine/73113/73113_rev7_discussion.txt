DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Add SystemEventFactory

The SystemEventFactory creates Item objects representing
the following system events.

- create collection
- begin delete collection

An Item which represents a SystemEvent will eventually flow through
checkpoints to the flusher and DCP.

A simple test checks the Item is as expected.

- The operation is system_event.
- The flags return the detailed event type.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Code looks good - would be good to expand a couple of the comments:

Line:48, src/systemevent.h -> Worth documenting the fact that the `flags` field is used to encode the type? Or is that not the case for all?
