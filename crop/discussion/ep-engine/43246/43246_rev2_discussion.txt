DESCRIPTION

test_memory_limit: Increase document size for TEMP_OOM test

When running under jemalloc we appear to have a lower mem_used for
this test, with the result that occasionally it will fail as the
second store() passes when it's expected to hit TEMP_OOM.

Fix this by increasing the size of the docuement we set.
