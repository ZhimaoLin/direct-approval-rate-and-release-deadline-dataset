Patch Set 1:

Wouldn't it be better if we used the official python SDK to access our cluster? instead of keeping an additional client in there?

Patch Set 1:

This is a quick-and-simple client which allows us to actually test this functionality ahead of ns_server support. The official Python SDK is built on lcb, and I don't know if we'd ever want to expose these kinds of internal commands to end-users.

This was useful to me for testing, if you don't think it's useful to push upstream then it's not a big deal.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

I spoke with Bin regarding if the CLI team manages mc_bin_client or not. He told me that our CLI package has its own mc_bin_client (its actual name is cb_bin_client), but is a subset of ep-engine's mc_bin_client library. I don't know the exact reasons why we maintain two separate versions of mc_bin_client, but am okay with this change as long as we don't want to expose this command through our Python client library.

Abandoned

Don't really need this now that ns_server has support for config reload.
