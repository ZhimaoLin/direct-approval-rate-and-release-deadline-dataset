DESCRIPTION

Check to make sure flush/tap params are numbers

atoi returns 0 if the c string passed in is not a number. This can cause
people to mess up cluster parameters if they accidentally give a param
value that is not a number.

Looks good, but let's move this to the master branch as the 1.8.1 is now in the blocker fix phase.

Line:118, ep_engine.cc -> I don't think we need this log.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Wrong branch and better fix in master already. Completely abandoning.
