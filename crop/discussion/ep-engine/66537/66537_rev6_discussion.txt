DESCRIPTION

MB-20425: Change options parameter to correct values

Updates epstore get to use the options passed in.
Requires the call to ep_engine get from ep_engine
arithmetic to be updated to use the following
options:
QUEUE_BG_FETCH | HONOR_STATES |
TRACK_REFERENCE | HIDE_LOCKED_CAS

Requires the call to ep_engine get from epstore
store to be updated to use the following options:
QUEUE_BG_FETCH | HONOR_STATES | TRACK_REFERENCE |
DELETE_TEMP | HIDE_LOCKED_CAS

Also adds an associated test, where the bloom filter
is disabled which in the presense of the bug will
cause the test to hang.
