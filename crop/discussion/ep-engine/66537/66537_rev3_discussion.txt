DESCRIPTION

MB-20425: Change options parameter to correct values

Updates epstore get to use the options passed in.
Requires the call from ep_engine arithmetic to be
updated to use the following options:
QUEUE_BG_FETCH | TRACK_REFERENCE |
HONOR_STATES | HIDE_LOCKED_CAS

Requires the call from epstore store to be updated
to use the following options:

is disabled which in the presense of the bug will
