DESCRIPTION

WIP - Make VB deleter schedule task (needs more code refinement)

Tests?? We do have coverage, thinking we could do with some MT tests
maybe battle compaction and delete, also consider flushAll and delete

A bucket flush previously would "reset" all VB (via KVStore::reset)
and at the end of the flush you would have x.couch.1 (for all VBs),
this is no longer the  case. To ensure that deleteVB doesn't get
scheduled after the flush, and delete  x.couch.1, reset must move the
revision forwards.

CouchKVStore begins file revisions at 0 and VB creation increments, so
the first VB file will be x.couch.1

CouchKVStore::delVBucket no longer re-adds a "dead" cachedVBState, so
once  deleted the cached state matches the state before it was
created, i.e. nullptr
