Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:54, tests/module_tests/defragmenter_test.h -> Style - if you want to markup methods like this, suggest Doxygen syntax (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/Adrianna Holmesal/docblocks.html) - e.g.

 xxx@xxx.xxx docSize The size in bytes of each items blob.

Line:66, tests/module_tests/defragmenter_test.h -> Prefer to return out parameters from the function - makes it explicit at the call-site that it's a result.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> vbucket

Line:66, tests/module_tests/defragmenter_test.h -> The problem I had with explicitly returning was that the ASSERT_* (from test) assume they are in functions which return void. I can split it out in to an internal function (i.e. the one we already have) and public one which checks the out argument and returns a value based on this. However this seemed to be overkill at the time
