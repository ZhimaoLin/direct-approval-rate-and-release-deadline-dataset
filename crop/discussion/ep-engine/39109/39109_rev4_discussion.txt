Sriram,

I should've identified the atomic issue in the replace implementation earlier. I saw that both the old and new implementations don't support the atomic replace operation. Please see my comment inside.

The unit test looks good.

Line:2128, src/ep_engine.cc -> As it is also commented in the old implementation, the whole replace implementation is not atomic. There is a race where an item gets deleted by another thread between get and set calls in this routine. I think we need to add replace API to EPStore to support the atomic replace operation.
