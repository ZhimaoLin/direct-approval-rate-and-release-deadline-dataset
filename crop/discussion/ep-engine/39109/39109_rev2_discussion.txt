Can you add the unit test for this?

Line:1481, src/ep.cc -> This won't work if the item is in "temp_inital_state".

Line:1450, src/ep.cc -> This additional bool parameter is too specific to replace operation. Can we figure out if we need a bg fetch or not before calling this function by checking the ejection policy?
