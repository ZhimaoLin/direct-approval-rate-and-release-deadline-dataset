One minor comment in the code. Also, we need to change the format of the withMeta messages to have variable length. I'll discuss this with you guys later today.

Line:295, src/ep.h -> Adding these comments is a good thing to do, but you should add it as a separate commit next time because changing the comments doesn't have anything to do with this change.

Line:2033, src/ep.cc -> Please move this code into the setDriftCounter function.

Line:2033, src/ep.cc -> Mike, the reason i have this code here is because setDriftCounter is also invoked by the setInitialDriftCounter API which sets the initial driftCounter, without checking the adjustedTime.
