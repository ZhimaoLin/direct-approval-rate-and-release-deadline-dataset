Line:5145, src/ep_engine.cc -> Previous xdcr versions will set adjusted time to 0 which will cause issues.

Line:112, src/ep_engine.h -> If bytes left is 0 then you should set an error code.

Line:117, src/ep_engine.h -> We need some better error checking here. I can see a case where this goes into an infinite loop due to an invalid packet being received.

Line:85, src/ep_engine.h -> Also, I think we should have an encode and a decode function in this. I can explain when you get into the office. We can also put it in it's own file and then import it into the testsuite to reduce code duplication.
