Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

(1 comment)

Line:57, CMakeLists.txt -> I don't understand why we are adding another API / method to set the build type - and if we were why we are adding it to ep-engine (when it's applicable to all components). Just build with:

 make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS="<whatever still you want to pass to CMAKE">

in your case:

 make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"

Or, if you prefer (and have already built once), edit `build/CMakeCache.txt` and change the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE from the default (RelWithDebInfo) to Debug.

Patch Set 2:

Dave, that would turn on debugging for ALL the Piper Jefferson modules not just ep-engine.
For debugging race conditions it would be great if we can have a way to selectively turn on optimizations only for ep-engine and keep other modules compiled with full optimizations turned on.
If there is another way to do this, please suggest?
thanks
