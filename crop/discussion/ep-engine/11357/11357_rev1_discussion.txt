DESCRIPTION

fixed ordering issue reported by gcc warning

Warning was:
tapconnection.cc: In member function 'queued_item TapProducer::next(bool&)':
tapconnection.cc:1328:53: error: operation on '((TapProducer*)this)->TapProducer::queueSize' may be undefined [-Wsequence-point]

queueSize = --queueSize looks weird, but apparently there are other
issues with that. Anyway -Werror forces us to fix it.
