DESCRIPTION

Fix Coverity Scan warning due to a paranoid nullptr check

*** CID 161947:  Null pointer dereferences  (REVERSE_INULL)
/ep-engine/src/vbucket.cc: 1491 in VBucket::deleteItem()
Null-checking "v" suggests that it may be null, but it has already been
dereferenced on all paths leading to the check.
1491         if (v && v->isLocked(ep_current_time()) &&
1492             (getState() == vbucket_state_replica ||
1493              getState() == vbucket_state_pending)) {
1494             v->unlock();
1495         }

We do not need a this redundant (paranoid) nullptr check as all paths
leading to it have been checked before and dereferenced.

Line:1499, src/vbucket.cc -> We can also remove this check if 'v' is guaranteed to be present at this point.

Line:1499, src/vbucket.cc -> Ok.
(Strictly speaking processSoftDelete()) could delete it. But that would be bad coding practice to delete the value of a func param by getting its address.)

Line:1499, src/vbucket.cc -> processSoftDelete() actually can't modify `v` itself as it gets passed a reference to `*v` not `v`. If processSoftDelete got the address it would get the address of the thing v points to.
