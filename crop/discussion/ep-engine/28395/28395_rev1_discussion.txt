Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

I briefly looked through this so I will post more comments later. One thing you will need to do is remove extra whitespace which is marked in red in the reviewed files.

Line:115, src/common.hh -> There are 365 days in a year. Also, I assume this would mean 2030? It might make sense to make this a little bit larger if so.

Line:26, src/locks.hh -> Please add these on separate lines since this differs from our usual coding conventions.
