DESCRIPTION

Use forward_iterator_tag for histogram

Looks like we're missing some methods in order to be
a random iterator (getting tons of errors with MSVC).
Since we're not using them in both directions anyway
the easiest solution was just to move it to a forward
iterator (errors from template code generates a LOT
of unreadable errors ;-) )
