DESCRIPTION

MB-3695 Don't clear checkpoint's key index until removed from memory

Even if a given checkpoint is closed, we still should keep its key
index because the key index is used by the item pager in determining
items to be evicted from memory. A checkpoint's key index will be
automatically garbage-collected when its checkpoint is removed from
memory.

TODO: The memory overhead caused by maintaining a checkpoint's key
index will be added to "ep_overhead" stat soon.
