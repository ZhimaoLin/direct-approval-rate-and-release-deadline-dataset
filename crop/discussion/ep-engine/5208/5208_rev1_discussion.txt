Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(2 inline comments)



Line:649, ep_engine.cc -> Why not just make this a member method for the engine? and rename it to handleGetLastCxxx or something?

Line:656, ep_engine.cc -> I personally don't see the point of returning such strings from the core when we got a unique error code explaining the reason why it failed (and the opcode is part of the response so the client may know what it asked for)... I've heard the argument that it makes the life easier for the client because it may just show the error message, but it's an ignorant answer because english isn't the native language for a lot of people ;)
