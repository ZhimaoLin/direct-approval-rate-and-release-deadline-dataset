DESCRIPTION

MB-11887: Properly send the snapshot start and end seqnos

Currently we always set the snapshot start and end seqno to be the
same as the start seqno. This is incorrect if we recently were
disconnected and need to resume from a partial snapshot.

Line:1843, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't see this file is removed when the full snapshot is persisted. Otherwise, we will still open the snapshot local doc even if the snapshot is fully persisted.
