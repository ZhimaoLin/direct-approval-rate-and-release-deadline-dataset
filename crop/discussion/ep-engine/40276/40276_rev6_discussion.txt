DESCRIPTION

MB-11887: Properly send the snapshot start and end seqnos

Currently we always set the snapshot start and end seqno to be the
same as the start seqno. This is incorrect if we recently were
disconnected and need to resume from a partial snapshot.

Please feel free to grab me if you have any questions on my comments.

Line:1104, src/upr-stream.cc -> My understanding is that snapshot_start and snapshot_end are based on checkpoint_start, which means that we need to check if MARK_FLAG_CHK is set or not. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Line:1158, src/upr-stream.cc -> I'm not sure why we need to set the snapshot_start and snapshot_end using the same number here. Does this mean that the current snapshot is fully received?

Line:2057, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Is there any specific reason why we need to add a separate doc for this? Can we use the existing vb_state local doc? I think having a new local doc can affect the backup and restore tools. Please confirm it from Bin to make sure that they are not affected.

Line:2085, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't we add the logs if we fail to read a local doc?

Line:2502, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't we update them in the rollback function?

Line:434, src/vbucket.h -> We need to make them atomic as they are accessed by more than one thread.

Line:2734, src/ep.cc -> I think there can be a racing issue in getting these values because they can be updated by processing snapshot_end message in the passive stream.

Line:2735, src/ep.cc -> please make it more readable:

else {
    if (items_flushed) {
        vb->setCurrentSnapshot(snapshotStart, snapEnd);
    }
}

Note that these will be addressed in patch-set 8.

Line:1104, src/upr-stream.cc -> The snapshots do not correspond to the checkpoint start and end if the cursor is in the open checkpoint. I can discuss this in more detail with you if needed.

Line:1158, src/upr-stream.cc -> Yes, this means the snapshot is fully received. Let me see if I can do something to make this clearer. I may actually be able to remove this line too.

Line:2057, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I can move it into the same one.

Line:2085, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> No. The way I did this was that if the local doc doesn't exist then this is not a partial snapshot. As a result this case is expected.

Line:2502, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This is the rollback function, can you be more specific?

Line:434, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:2734, src/ep.cc -> I'll address this.

Line:2735, src/ep.cc -> Done
