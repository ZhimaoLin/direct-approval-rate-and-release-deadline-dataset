DESCRIPTION

Fix sporadic unit test failure in upr end stream test

Because we now se flow control the actual end stream reasponse is
processed by another thread. As a result it is possible that the
other thread hasn't processed this item when we check the stats. As
a result we need to wait until the stat changes.
