DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: DcpConsumer, initial collections integration

Add functional paths that allow us to drive collection changes from
the DcpConsumer.

Add unit tests to use MockDcpConsumer to drive the changes by
calling the functions with data we will eventually be extracting from
DCP network messages.
