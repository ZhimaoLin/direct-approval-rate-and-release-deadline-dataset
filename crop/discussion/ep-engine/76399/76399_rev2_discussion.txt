DESCRIPTION

MB-23267: Prevent changing inapplicable options from cbepctl

Check requirements in setFlushParam and setTapParam for the following
configuration parameters:

 "tap_keepalive"
 "access_scanner_enabled"
 "alog_sleep_time"
 "alog_task_time"
 "ephemeral_full_policy"

this will prevent them being set if their requirements are not met.
