Line:176, observe_registry.cc -> Definitely a protocol issue, where the protocol spec is ambiguous -- so that needs fixing and clarity.  From reading the spec, for example, in the binary protocol, the key might be "<key> <cas>" or the key might be "<key>".  A client implementer shouldn't have to read this server code implementation to find out the answer.

I prefer the later way where key equals "<key>", actually, as it's less surprising.

Line:176, observe_registry.cc -> Ok, fair. I updated the protocol docs.

Stats has to return the key and cas as the stats key because most of the clients use a hash to keep the stats data. I haven't looked in the server code, but my guess is that we use a hash there too.
