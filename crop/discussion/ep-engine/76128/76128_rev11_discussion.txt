DESCRIPTION

MB-23711: [Ephemeral] Allow pageOut of Deleted-with-value document

A Deleted-with-value should be able to be paged out under Ephemeral
buckets (if we're low on space we should be able to remove the deleted
body), however this currently fails as it is not permitted to delete
an item which is already marked as deleted.

Given the semantics of Deleted documents are slightly different now we
have Deleted Bodies, we /should/ be able to delete something which has
a deleted value.

Update StoredValue and HashTable to correctly set the deleted flag in
this case, and correct the count of items in the HashTable.
