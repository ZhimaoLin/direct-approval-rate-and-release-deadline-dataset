DESCRIPTION

Don't create a failover entry after a clean shutdown

We are only required to create new failover entries after a crash
so we should check to see if that happened before creating one
during warmup.

Line:425, src/warmup.cc -> This logic is wrong. Even if ep_force_shutdown stat is found in stats and has "false" value, we will stll set "cleanShutdown" to false, which is wrong.

You can simplify them like:

if (it == session_stats.end() || it->second.compare("false") != 0) {
    cleanShutdown = false;
}
