added item as an ensemble.

Line:2415, src/vbucket.cc -> I am not too sure of the value add this function provides. This seems to update only the rev seqno and that too with the maxDeletedSeqno and isn't actually used anywhere else.

Line:2415, src/vbucket.cc -> It is better for readability, makes code easily movable/maintainable.
If you see my next review you will see that this is called from more than one place.

Line:2523, src/vbucket.cc -> Note this function mostly deals with VBucket / StoredValue, and only uses the Item to "copy" the result. 

Given that Item objects are essentially transient elements which are used to communicate between the server and engine, I suggest you remove the Item parameter and simply have this update the StoredValue object. Then in the call-site (addNewStoredValue) unconditionally copy the StoredValue::seqno to Item.

This gives a simpler abstraction - the user only has to think about the one object being modified in here.
