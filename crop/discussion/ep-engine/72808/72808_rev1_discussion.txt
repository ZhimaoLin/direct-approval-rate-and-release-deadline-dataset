DESCRIPTION

Remove Flusher statistics from Ephemeral

These statistics report properties of the Flusher. As such they are not
applicable to Ephemeral buckets and should only be reported for
persistent buckets.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This commit message doesn't accurately reflect what the code actually checks. While it is correct that if the flusher doesn't exist that it's probably an ephemeral bucket I don't think it's incredibly clear.

Either:

a) The code is not explicit that it's actually meant to be checking for ephemeral bucket
b) The commit message is misrepresenting the patch

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'll try to reword the commit message to make it more explicit.

The situation is essentially (a) - EPEngine deliberately doesn't know anything about different KVBucket subclasses. The intent here is that EPEngine is just an interface to memcached, implementing the engine API, and that it tests the behaviour of the underlying bucket to determine what to return. So in this case - if the bucket has a flusher, it will expose flusher statistics.
