Line:101, src/warmup.h -> Please don't use a static variable as this won't work for warming up multiple buckets.

Line:303, src/warmup.cc -> If the callback status is set to ENGINE_ENOMEM, then CouchKVStore::recordDbDump() returns COUCHSTORE_ERROR_CANCEL to Couchstore, so that Couchstore stops scanning the rest of remaining KV items for warmup. If not, we should fix it in either CouchKVStore or Couchstore.

Line:312, src/warmup.cc -> As I mentioned, this isn't a good approach and won't work for warming up multiple buckets.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The commit title is too long. Please limit it to 80 columns. The commit title usually represents what a commit does, instead of describing what the issue is. You can put the issue description and a detailed description of your change in a commit message body.

Line:312, src/warmup.cc -> Can you please clarify: it was my understanding that warmup happens only once and everything is in one bucket only (at least for each executable). 
Or we support (will be supporting in the future) case with warming up several buckets independently for one executable?
Thanks.

Line:312, src/warmup.cc -> I'm not what you mean by one executable. We support multiple buckets in a single KV-Engine process and can warmup them concurrently.
