Please stop by my desk to discuss these comments more.

Line:359, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> "Opening the KV store instance for vbucket %d failed ..."

Line:388, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> If we get an error from ForestDB, then we need to record it in the callback instance, so that we can requeue it in PersistenceCallback.

Line:421, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same as above comment.

Line:62, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> I don't think we need to have dbDOC instance inside ForestRequest as it is not needed upon a commit operation.
