Line:111, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> It seems to me that all the variables except for dbDoc are duplicated in CouchReqest class. I think it would be better to define a parent abstract class 'IORequest' that has common variables among different KV storages. Defining common classes or functions in KVStore layer will allow us to plug a new storage engine easily in the future.
