Line:19, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Why do we need couch-kvstore header?

Line:175, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I know we use 'exptime' to purge tombstone items as part of compaction. It was a workaround at that time as we didn't want to change the couchstore file format.

As this is a brand-new storage engine, I think we can use a new field to store the tombstone expiration time instead of overwriting 'exptime' field.

Line:351, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please directly pass 'false' instead of using a variable.

Line:111, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Please reorder these variables to reduce the memory overhead.
