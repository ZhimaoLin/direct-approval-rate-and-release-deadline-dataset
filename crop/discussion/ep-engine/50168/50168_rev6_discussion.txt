Line:178, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This if-else clause is the same logic as CouchRequest except for texptime assignment. I rather move it to the parent's constructor.

Line:214, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Let's move this to parent's constructor. I think it is okay to start the timer from the parent's constructor.

Line:360, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we need to discuss whether we should use the same batch write approach as CouchKVStore. ForestDB doesn't provide multi SET API, which means that we can simply call fdb_set API directly inside this function, instead of batching up them until a commit operation is issued. The current batch approach causes more CPU and memory overhead due to additional memory alloc and dealloc.
