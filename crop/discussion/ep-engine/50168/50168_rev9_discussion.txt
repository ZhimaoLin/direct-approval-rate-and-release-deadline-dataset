Line:3133, src/ep.cc -> I am doing this temporarily only for forestdb. Ideally this should work for CouchKVStore as well. But there requires more invasive changes inside CouchKVStore which needs to be tested more extensively to ensure no regressions. I will address it in a separate commit.

I have a couple of major comments. I rather address them in this commit.

Line:54, src/kvstore.h -> Let's use enum type if it makes sense.

Line:460, src/kvstore.h -> I think we should define the return type for this new API. Otherwise, the caller doesn't know if the operation is successful or not.

Line:462, src/kvstore.h -> It would be better to pass 'vbucket_state' instance instead of individual states.

Line:283, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As I mentioned, we need to define the appropriate return type for this new API.

Line:319, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please initialize fdb_doc instance directly by assigning the above memory pointers (e.g., keybuf, state.c_str()) to fdb_doc's pointer variables, instead of creating separate copies of them.

Line:452, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We need to log the KV open failure here at least. In addition, shouldn't we push 'req' to the pending queue here, so that we can notify the failure through PersistenceCallback and requeue the failed item again?

Line:497, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:53, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> I don't think we need this method anymore. Please remove it.

Line:61, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> int8_t getStatus(void) const { ...}
