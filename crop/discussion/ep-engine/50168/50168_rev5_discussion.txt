No. It isn't. In patchset 4, I had accidentally reverted changes I incorporated in patchset 3. I just restored it.

Line:207, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we should avoid creating another copy of key, metadata, and value instances for fdb_doc instance. Instead, we can directly assign the pointers of key, metadata, and value instances to fdb_doc's variables, to avoid malloc and memcpy overhead.

Line:31, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> As I mentioned in the old patch, please define the parent class like 'IORequest' in KVStore layer and subclass it in ForestDBKVStore and CouchKVStore.
