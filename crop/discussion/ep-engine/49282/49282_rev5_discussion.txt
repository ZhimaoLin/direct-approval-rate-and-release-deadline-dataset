(2 comments)

Line:95, src/kvstore.h -> Please use 'struct DBFileInfo' instead of using typdef.

Line:343, src/kvstore.h -> Please make this function as a pure virtual function. In addition, please add the comments to this API function. As I mentioned, it is better to explicitly put a parameter name like 'db_file_id'.
