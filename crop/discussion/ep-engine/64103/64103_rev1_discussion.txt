DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Fix ConnMap so notifications don't go missing [2]

Previous patch[1] cleared the isNotificationScheduled flag
at the wrong place and meant things could then never
again get scheduled.

This is because we only cleared the flag if tp->isPaused()
yet we still pop the notification from the queue, so we
left tp->isNotificationScheduled yet the queue is empty.
Now no more notifications will ever get scheduled!

So we need to clear the notification scheduled boolean
unconditionally of the other flags on tp.
