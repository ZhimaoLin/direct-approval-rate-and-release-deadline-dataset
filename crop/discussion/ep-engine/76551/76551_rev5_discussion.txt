DESCRIPTION

Introduce testing exception for rescheduled dead tasks

In http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/76394/ the ability to reschedule a
cancelled (and now in state TASK_DEAD) GlobalTask was fixed.

it does not appear that any tasks other than the ItemPager for ephemeral
buckets are rescheduled once dead, but to avoid changing existing
behaviour this introduces an exception if any task other than the
ItemPager is rescheduled, to bring them to our attention.

NB: This patch will be reverted to remove this exception for Spock.
