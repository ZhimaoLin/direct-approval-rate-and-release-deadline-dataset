this could result in an assert while ep engine attempting to set
the new item id twice.

Patch Set 3:

Hi Jin,

If we have multiple set/update in queue on the same key, after we remove duplicates, how do we make sure only the last update will be applied to db file? Thanks.

Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

couchkvstore does the batch writes, which means that their callbacks are also batched. This caused duplicate writes because we mark an item as "clean" in the callback function.

We should remove them before pushing them into the flusher queue. The flusher always looks up the hash table to get the latest value and meta data for a given key right before passing it to the underlying kvstore.
