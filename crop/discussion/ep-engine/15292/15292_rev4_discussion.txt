Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:5534, ep_testsuite.cc -> Would this be still valid for the nonexistent key?

Line:5560, ep_testsuite.cc -> I'd assume a different status should return here, KEY_ENOENT?

Patch Set 4: (2 inline comments)



Line:5534, ep_testsuite.cc -> Yes.

We first create a temporary item with a certain cas and schedule a bgfetch of its metadata. If the key isn't found, we mark the temp item's state as state_nonexistent_key and return the cas. The returned cas may later be used to do either a set_with_meta or a delete_with_meta.

The cas is required to avoid a race condition with another set or delete that's issued between the get_meta and the set/delete_with_meta.

Make sense?

Line:5560, ep_testsuite.cc -> For a cas mismatch, stored-value.hh returns INVALID_CAS which is then mapped to KEY_EEXISTS in ep.cc.

I still kept the message as "Expected invalid cas error" as this is the real cause of the error. It will be helpful in debugging if the test fails for some reason.

Patch Set 4:

Thanks for the explanation. The set value for the returned cas makes sense to me. In a separate patch we may want to change/add more comprehensive error code from ep.cc (instead of KEY_EEXIST).
