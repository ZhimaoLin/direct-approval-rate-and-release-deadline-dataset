DESCRIPTION

MB-19948: CouchKVStore metadata tests

This commit contains some new tests to exercise the code
which assembles our metadata into couchstore.

There are upstream fixes and refactoring which will utilise
these tests for some positive vibes about maintaining correctness
as the code is changed.
