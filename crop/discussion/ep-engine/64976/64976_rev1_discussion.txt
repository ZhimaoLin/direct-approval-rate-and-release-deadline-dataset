DESCRIPTION

MB-19948: CouchKVStore metadata tests

This commit contains some new tests to exercise the code
which assembles our metadata into couchstore.

There are upstream fixes and refactoring which will utilise
these tests for some positive vibes about maintaining correctness
as the code is changed.

Line:98, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> If you instead create a std::string from {output.buf, output.len} you can use EXPECT_EQ() directly on the two strings and it'll print the contents if the two differ.

Line:108, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> You could consider looking at GoogleMock here, as it essentially does a bunch of this kind of thing for you.

Line:1153, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Nit: maybe split these into two paragraphs to make the statics more obvious.

Line:1159, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Nit: alignment out.

Line:1171, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This should be 'char[]' to ensure that array delete is used.

(Alternatively you could just use a std::vector here.

Line:1176, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> In C++11 you can combine initialisation of static variables (assuming they can be const) with declaration:

 static const size_t sizeofV0 = 16;

Line:1224, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This looks reasonable to include - commented out for debugging?

Line:1274, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> I think the first instance of this probably warrants a comment describing how this works - that the GetCallback does the various checks). Maybe a block comment at the start of the tests?
