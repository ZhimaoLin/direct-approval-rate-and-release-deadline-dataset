DESCRIPTION

Add unit tests for get_meta

The following cases are covered by these unit tests:
1. get_meta for an existent item
2. get_meta for a deleted item
3. get_meta for a nonexistent item

A new function add_response_get_meta() has also been added to allow
decoding the flags attribute in the response to a get_meta request.
The flags attribute contains information about whether the item being
queried is deleted or not.
