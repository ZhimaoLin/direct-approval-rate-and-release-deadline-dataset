DESCRIPTION

MB-19428: Don't schedule backfills on dead vbuckets

This is an updated version of the patch which uses
a virtual function to achieve the same outcome as:

Only ActiveStream implements setActive, all other stream
types use the base class version which is a no-op.

Functionality looks good - thanks for the refactor. Couple of small comments.

Line:36, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Given this should always be non-null can use a reference.

Line:41, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> `expectedTaskName` ?

Line:69, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Given we have other methods with this name (on engine / store) which just *schedule* the task but don't execute it, maybe rename this to something like `setVBucketStateAndRunPersistTask` (or something more snappy if you have a better idea :)

Line:164, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Could you add a high level description of what this is testing - maybe highlight where we used to fail before the fix.
