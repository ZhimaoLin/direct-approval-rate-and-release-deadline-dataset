Line:79, src/taskqueue.h -> Can we rename it to "pendingQueue"? In addition, it would be better to have a pending queue per shard? Otherwise, tasks belonging to other shards will be repeatedly requeued over and over.

Line:149, src/taskqueue.cc -> As I mentioned earlier, we might requeue tasks belonging to other shard unnecessarily over and over if we have a single pending queue.
