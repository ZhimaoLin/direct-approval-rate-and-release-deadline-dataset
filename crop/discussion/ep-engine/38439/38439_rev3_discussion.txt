DESCRIPTION

MB-11361: Implement upr noop command

The upr noop command is used to detect dead connections. It is sent
once every 3 minutes and waits 3 minutes for a response. If no
response comes in that time the connection is deemed to be dead. The
noop command is only sent when flow control is turned on by the
consumer.

Line:200, src/upr-producer.cc -> Make sure that we set the thread local to NULL before calling this function and set it to the engine handle after that. Otherwise, it will cause the memory accounting to be inaccurate.

Line:209, src/upr-producer.cc -> Please define this part in a separate function "noop".
