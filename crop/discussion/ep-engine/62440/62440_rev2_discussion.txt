DESCRIPTION

MB-18974: Fix intermittant failure in test_expiration_on_warmup (3)

There is an *another* issue with the expiration_on_warmup test which
can cause it to fail intermittently - investigation shows that the
curr_items stat is not synchronous with respect to expired_pager.

Specifically, for non-temporary, expired items we call
unlocked_softDelete (soft-marking the item as deleted in the
hashtable), and then call queueDirty to queue a deletion, and then
increment the expired stat. Only when that delete is actually
persisted and the deleted callback is invoked -
PeristenceCallback::callback(int&) - is curr_items finally
decremented.

Therefore we need to wait for the flusher to settle (i.e. delete
callback to be called) for the curr_items stat to be accurate.

This is hopefully the last patch needed to address this issue (however
I did say that last time :/)
