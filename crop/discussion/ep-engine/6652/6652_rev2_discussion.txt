DESCRIPTION

Retain items from checkpoints with IDs > new open checkpoint's ID

We allow a replica vbucket to create a new open checkpoint
during backfill phase to avoid high memory usage on the replica
node. Consequently, this might results in having a replica vbucket
with the higher open checkpoint ID than the active vbucket right
after backfill.

After backfill, the active vbucket sends live mutations including
checkpoint start/end messages to the replica. Therefore, the replica
should retain all the items belonging to the checkpoints whose IDs
is greater than the new open checkpoint ID received from the active
vbucket after backfill, until those items are consumed by the
persistence and TAP cursors.
