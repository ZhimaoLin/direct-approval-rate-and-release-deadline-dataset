DESCRIPTION

MB-21784: Don't use opencheckpointid to determine if in backfill phase

The opencheckpointid of a bucket can be zero after a rollback.
If an opencheckpointid was zero it was assumed that the vbucket was in
backfilling state.  This caused the producer stream request to be stuck
waiting for backfilling to complete.

Ths patch uses the vb->isBackfillPhase() to determine if the vbucket is
in a backfill state as opposed to using an opencheckpointid of zero.

Line:825, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Nit: Indentation incorrect.

Line:839, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Should ASSERT that the return value is as expected (ENGINE_SUCCES?)

Line:849, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Ditto

Line:208, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Style: Format these as per one would normally format an output stream if it doesn't fit on one line - e.g.:

 EXPECT_EQ(ENGINE_SUCCESS, store->rollback(vbid, initial_seqno))
     << "rollback did not return ENGINE_SUCCESS";

Line:215, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Ditto

Line:222, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Nit: Indentation is incorrect.

Line:233, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> Style: error formatting.
