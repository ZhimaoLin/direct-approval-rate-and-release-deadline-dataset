DESCRIPTION

MB-21784: Don't use opencheckpointid to determine if in backfill phase

The opencheckpointid of a bucket can be zero after a rollback.
If an opencheckpointid was zero it was assumed that the vbucket was in
backfilling state.  This caused the producer stream request to be stuck
waiting for backfilling to complete.

Ths patch uses the vb->isBackfillPhase() to determine if the vbucket is
in a backfill state as opposed to using an opencheckpointid of zero.

Line:281, tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> The only reason the other tests are in a separate function is because they pass in a parameter (so we can share common code). If there's just one version of this test then it's simpler to just put the code in here.
