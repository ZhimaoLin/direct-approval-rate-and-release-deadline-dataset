DESCRIPTION

MB-21784: Don't use opencheckpointid to determine if in backfill phase

The opencheckpointid of a bucket can be zero after a rollback.
If an opencheckpointid was zero it was assumed that the vbucket was in
backfilling state.  This caused the producer stream request to be stuck
waiting for backfilling to complete.

Ths patch uses the vb->isBackfillPhase() to determine if the vbucket is
in a backfill state as opposed to using an opencheckpointid of zero.
