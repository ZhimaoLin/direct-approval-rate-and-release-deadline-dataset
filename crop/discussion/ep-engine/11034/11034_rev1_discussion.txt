DESCRIPTION

MB-4455 Disable backfill phase for checkpoint-unaware TAP producer

If the TAP producer (e.g. 1.6.5) does not support checkpoints, the
TAP consumer should disable backfill phase support, but instead
simply put backfilled items into the checkpoint and create a new
checkpoint itself based on the time bound or the number of items
in the current checkpoint.
