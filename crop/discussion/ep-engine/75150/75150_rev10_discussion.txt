DESCRIPTION

HashTableVisitor: Include bucket lock in visit()

To allow HashTable visitor implementations to peform a larger range of
modifications to the item which is being visited (for example:
deleting the item), include a reference to the hash bucket lock in the
signature of HashTableVisitor::visit().

Also removed HashTableStatVisitor as it wasn't driven by the normal
visitor pattern and was simpler to inline the functionality than add
support for the bucket lock param.
