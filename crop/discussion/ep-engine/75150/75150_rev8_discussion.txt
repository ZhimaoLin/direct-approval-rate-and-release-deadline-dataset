DESCRIPTION

HashTableVisitor: Include bucket lock in visit()

To allow HashTable visitor implementations to peform a larger range of
modifications to the item which is being visited (for example:
deleting the item), include a reference to the hash bucket lock in the
signature of HashTableVisitor::visit().

Also removed HashTableStatVisitor as it wasn't driven by the normal
visitor pattern and was simpler to inline the functionality than add
support for the bucket lock param.

Line:76, src/item_pager.cc -> looks like StoredValue cannot be null.  Therefore should it not be a reference?

Patch Set 8:

(1 comment)

Line:76, src/item_pager.cc -> True, but that would require changing the type of every visitor (replace '->' with '.') and hence significantly increase the noise / churn in this patch.
