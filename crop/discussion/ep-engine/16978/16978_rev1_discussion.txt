DESCRIPTION

CBD-351: CAPI forces ep_engine creates new checkpoint

This change-set allows ep engine to create new checkpoint only if
current open check point is not empty. The forced checkpoint creation
is required by XDCR to monitor flusher to make sure all items
in write queue have been persisted before XDCR creates a checkpoint.
