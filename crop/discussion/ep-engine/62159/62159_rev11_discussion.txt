DESCRIPTION

Remove code duplication in BG fetch completion

completeBGFetch() and completeBGFetchMulti() perform very similar
tasks, the main difference being completeBGFetchMulti handles multiple
items. Refactor the code to move all the common work into a new
completeBGFetchForSingleItem function.
