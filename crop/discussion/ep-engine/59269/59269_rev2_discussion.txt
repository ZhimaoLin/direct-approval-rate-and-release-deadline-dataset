Line:926, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I'd expect this to be a WARNING message as something must've gone wrong with the DCP connection if this was logged - as there were no operations received, in which case a NOOP message should've been sent received periodically (to keep connection alive).

Line:202, src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Isn't this more of a WARNING message, considering that memory usage is above 96% the memory quota?

Line:926, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Again, this isn't warning (May indicate that an error will occur if action is not taken). It's at most a problem with the network.

Note btw you will see both WARNING and NOTICE by default in the logs, this is just about making WARNINGS stand out more.

Line:202, src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> As per syslog spec[1], notice is: "Events that are unusual, but not error conditions."

Warning is: "May indicate that an error will occur if action is not taken."	

By my interpretation this message should be 'notice'.
