DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Do not pass HT lock as a param to VBucket::queueDirty()

VBucket::queueDirty() must just put an item on a queue for persistence
and/or replication. Hence the HT lock and notification logic are removed
from it. It should be upto the VBucket to decide when to release the HT
lock and when to notify any clients of a new seqno
