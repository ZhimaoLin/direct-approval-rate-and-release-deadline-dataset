DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Do not pass HT lock as a param to VBucket::queueDirty()

VBucket::queueDirty() must just put an item on a queue for persistence
and/or replication. Hence the HT lock and notification logic are removed
from it. It should be upto the VBucket to decide when to release the HT
lock and when to notify any clients of a new seqno

(6 comments)

Line:1091, src/vbucket.cc -> This comment probably wants updating  - it's slightly misleading as queueDirty doesn't do anything with locking now.

Line:1157, src/vbucket.cc -> Same

Line:1228, src/vbucket.cc -> This probably warrants a comment discussing the locking semantics here.

Line:1475, src/vbucket.cc -> Similar here - maybe just remove the comment?

Line:1089, src/vbucket.h -> Could you document what changes are made to this when it's queued.

Line:1095, src/vbucket.h -> This needs updating.
