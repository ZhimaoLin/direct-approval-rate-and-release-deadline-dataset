DESCRIPTION

MB-23562: [Ephemeral] Don't permit deleted items to be pagedOut

We should not allow a StoredValue which have already been deleted to
be pagedOut again, as we end up counting the delete twice.

    Note: Strictly speaking we shouldn't even /try/ to pageOut a
    deleted SV, as it ideally shouldn't stay in the HashTable, but we
    are currently using the same appoach as EPBucket, which deletes
    from the HashTable in two phases:

    1. Mark item as deleted (leaving in HashTable); queueDirty.

    2. Later, when flusher callback (deletion) is invoked, remove item
       from HashTable.

    Ephemeral buckets currently do (1) the same as EPBucket, but don't
    currently do (2), hence the (soft) deleted Items remain in the
    HashTable.
