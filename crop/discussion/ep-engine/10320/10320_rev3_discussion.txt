DESCRIPTION

Disabled notifications to TapConnMap by default

During _normal_ load the server will receive data mutations causing the
system to process events all the time. Grabbing the mutex just to send
a notification will only lead to contention on the mutex.

To avoid the thread to busy-loop we're going to do a 1 sec sleep if
there isn't _any_ work to be performed.
