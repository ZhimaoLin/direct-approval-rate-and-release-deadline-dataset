DESCRIPTION

MB-23639: Fix potential overflow of persisted_seqno in CMD_SEQNO_PERSISTENCE

Using uint16_t for persisted_seqno can cause overflow and might lead
to rebalance failures in Ephemeral buckets and slower rebalance in
Piper Jefferson buckets.

This commit changes persisted_seqno type from uint16_t to uint64_t.

Line:4871, src/ep_engine.cc -> Note: If you use `auto persisted_seqno` here then you guarantee that it's always the same type as the function returns.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's worth expanding this - the details from the MB about the fact that EP is ok as the flusher will run periodically and hence different outcome from Ephemera is worth highlighting.
