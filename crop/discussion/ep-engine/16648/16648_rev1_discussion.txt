DESCRIPTION

MB-5425 Fix Mc-engine synchronous wait interface with mccouch

Mc-engine synchronous wait was incorrect because it might never
receive the response to its request if connection is reset. In
fact, either couch-kvstore might abort or mc-engine might get
stuck forever. Instead, mc-engine must resend requests after
reset connection if it must wait for a response.
