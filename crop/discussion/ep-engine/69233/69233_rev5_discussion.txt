DESCRIPTION

MB-19672: Fix intermittent failure of 'test producer stream request (partial)'

This test was making incorrect assumptions about how / when
checkpoints would be created - it wasn't taking the checkpoint period
(how often we forcefully create new checkpoints) into account in it's
assuptions of checkpoint layout. As such it would occasionally fail if
it took longer than expected to run.

Fix this by essentially disabling chk_period (setting it to an
arbitrarily large value). At the same time make the tests expectations
explicit and check them where possible.
