DESCRIPTION

Pause the expiry pager if the persistence queue is too large

We observed that if there are lots of items that expired at
the same time, it will cause the persistence queue to grow
significantly in a very short time. Consequently, this causes
other write operations (e.g., set, add) to wait in the queue
for a long time. As write operations are more important,
deleting expired items should be backed off if the persistence
queue is too large.
