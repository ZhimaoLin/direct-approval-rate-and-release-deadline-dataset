DESCRIPTION

Change the flow control buffer to 10MB

The original size of 2MB is too small and causes rebalanace to
become slow. We should increase the buffer to 10MB by default
in order to speed things up. Note that the amount of consumer
connections on a node will be small so this should be okay.
