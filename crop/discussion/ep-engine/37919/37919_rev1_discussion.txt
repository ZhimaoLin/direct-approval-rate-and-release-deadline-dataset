DESCRIPTION

Change the flow control buffer to 10MB

The original size of 2MB is too small and causes rebalanace to
become slow. We should increase the buffer to 10MB by default
in order to speed things up. Note that the amount of consumer
connections on a node will be small so this should be okay.

Line:341, configuration.json -> The max size of a value that we support is 20MB. Do you think 10MB won't cause any issue when a value size 20MB?

I think we can address it later, but can we make it configurable at runtime at least, or even better approach is to adjust the buffer size dynamically?

Line:341, configuration.json -> The code will be able to handle values bigger that the buffer size. What currently happens is that the items are sent as long as the buffer has space available.

As an optimization we should make the buffer dynamic, but that will need to be done in a separate change.
