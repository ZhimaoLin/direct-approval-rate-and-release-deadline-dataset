Line:363, src/ep_engine.h -> I don't get this part... it should always be set to json.. as per definition the end result is just a single number and that is legal json.. this part (and the test below) is just wasting cycles ;)

Line:394, src/ep_engine.h -> same as above...

Line:363, src/ep_engine.h -> If we agree to always treat a single number as JSON even if the client doesn't enable datatype support, then we can always set its datatype to JSON regardless of that.
