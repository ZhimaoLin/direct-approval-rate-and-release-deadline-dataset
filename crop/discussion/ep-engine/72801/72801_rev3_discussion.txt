DESCRIPTION

Push FlusherCB construction down to EPBucket subclass

makeVBucket() takes a parameter of a flusherCB - a callback object to
be invoked when 'interesting' items are enqueued onto the
CheckpointManager. This callback is only needed for persistent (EP)
bucket types, for Ephemeral it is not necessary.

As such, push the construction of this callback to down into
EPBucket's implementation, removing it from makeVBucket()'s signature.
