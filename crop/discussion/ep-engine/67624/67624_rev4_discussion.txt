DESCRIPTION

Remove default parameter from deleteItem

The EventuallyPersistentStore method deleteItem has a parameter
called tapBackfill, which is defaulted to false.  The parameter
is used to specify if an item deletion is from a TAP backfill
stream.

However the deleteItem method is never passed a tapBackfill
parameter and therefore the default of false is always used.

This patch removes the unrequired parameter from the deleteItem
definition and simpifies the body of the method.
