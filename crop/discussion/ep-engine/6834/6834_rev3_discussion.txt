DESCRIPTION

Don't schedule backfill for vbucket that is receiving backfill items

In the replica chain A->B->C, if B is still receiving backfill items
for a given vbucket from A, B does not need to kick off backfill for
that vbucket for C when C connects to B. B will schedule backfill for
C separately when the backfill from A is completed.
