DESCRIPTION

Modify DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN to delete instead of relying on visibility

By deleting the functions instead of just declaring them it becomes
harder to use the macros wrong. It also means more meaningful compiler
errors are generated if someone tries to use the deleted functions.

This also removes an unused private variable that can now be statically
proven by the compiler as unused (and therefore generates a warning).
