DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Adjust collections warmup test shutdown code

This test creates a "real" engine so that warmup will easily run but
tripped over a few issues in having a clean shutdown.

The change is to make the test gully manage the TearDown, don't re-use
base-class, we must stop reset everything before finally calling
destroy_engine.
