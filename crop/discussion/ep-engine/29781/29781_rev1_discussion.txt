DESCRIPTION

CBD-1039:Purge Expired Items in disk via compactor

With the compactor moved into ep-engine, this transaction
adds a new way of purging expired items from disk even if
we do not maintain meta data fields for non-resident items
in memory.

When compacting items, we examine if they have expired, if
so, place these items into the appropriate queues to handle
their deletions
