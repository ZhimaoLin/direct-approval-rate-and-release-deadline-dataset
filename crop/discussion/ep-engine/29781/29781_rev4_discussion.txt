DESCRIPTION

CBD-1039:Purge Expired Items in disk via compactor

With the compactor moved into ep-engine, this commit
adds a new way of purging expired items from disk even if
we do not maintain meta data fields for non-resident items
in memory.
When compacting items, we examine if they have expired, if
so, place these items into the appropriate queues to handle
their deletions

Improved unit test for better code coverage

Line:589, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please remove it or log it with the debug level

Line:465, src/ep.cc -> Please simply do "return". There can be case where a temp item has non-zero revid.

Line:467, src/ep.cc -> This should be executed after softDelete() because the rev number is incremented in the softDelete()

Line:471, src/ep.cc -> This can cause the race condition. If a given expired item is SET again during the compaction. We then should not queue "deletion" into the checkpoint queue. Otherwise, it will incur data loss.

Sundar,

Let's not address the full eviction case in this commit at this time. Once we merge the full eviction, we can then discuss how we delete a non-resident item through the compaction.
