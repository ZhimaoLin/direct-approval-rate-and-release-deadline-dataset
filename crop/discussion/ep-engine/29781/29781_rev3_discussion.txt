DESCRIPTION

CBD-1039:Purge Expired Items in disk via compactor

With the compactor moved into ep-engine, this commit
adds a new way of purging expired items from disk even if
we do not maintain non-resident items in memory.
When compacting items, we examine if they have expired, if
so, place these items into the appropriate queues to handle
their deletions

Patch Set 3:

In this patchset, comments from Chiyoung are addressed - we can now purge expired items even if their key and metadata has been fully evicted. 

The change is to attempt to evict from memory, then purge expired items to the dirty queues anyway.

Also added a more comprehensive code coverage test case.
