DESCRIPTION

CBD-1039:Purge Expired Items in disk via compactor

With the compactor moved into ep-engine, this commit
adds a new way of purging expired items from disk even if
we do not maintain meta data fields for non-resident items
in memory.

When compacting items, we examine if they have expired, if
so, place these items into the appropriate queues to handle
their deletions

Line:913, src/ep.cc -> This won't' work with the full eviction because "deleteExpiredItems" function assume that the keys and metadata of expired items are still in memory.

Sundar, I think you assume the value eviction at this time, which seems okay. We need to adapt this after we merge the full eviction.
