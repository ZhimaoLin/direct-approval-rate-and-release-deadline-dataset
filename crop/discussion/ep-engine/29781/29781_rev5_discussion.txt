DESCRIPTION

CBD-1039:Purge Expired Items in disk via compactor

With the compactor moved into ep-engine, this commit
adds a new way of purging expired items from disk even if
we do not maintain meta data fields for non-resident items
in memory.
When compacting items, we examine if they have expired, if
so, place these items into the appropriate queues to handle
their deletions

Improved unit test for better code coverage

Line:478, src/ep.cc -> Please move the above stmts inside "else if (v->isExpired(startTime) && !v->isDeleted()) {"

It's a little confusing, and can introduce the bug when we adapt this function later.

Line:912, src/ep.cc -> I think we need to delete expired items for active vbuckets only because we replicate them to the replica vbuckets.
