DESCRIPTION

MB3360 - support restoring from WAL'ed db files

If SQLite version is older than 3.7, it won't be able to recover a
WAL-mode database files and report an error of "file is encrypted
or is not a database".

Any datbase file can be deliberately changed out of WAL mode so that
any older version of SLQite can once again access the db file.
    PRAGRAM journal_mode=DELETE;
