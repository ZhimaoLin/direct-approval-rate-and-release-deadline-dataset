DESCRIPTION

MB-22082: Log if cannot find connection when requesting takeover stats

The referenced MB is failing rebalance because when dcp takeover stats
are requested the specified connection cannot be found.

This is a relatively rare event, and when it happens it is useful to
know the connection name and the associated vbucket.  Therefore a
NOTICE log message is being added.

(1 comment)

Line:5748, src/ep_engine.cc -> This shouldn't be logged (at least not in release) - not specifying a present conn (or even an empty one) is a valid option - as per the fact we send the aggregate stats.

You could put it at INFO if you like (but you'd have to change the reported level at runtime).

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog for descriptions of the various levels.
