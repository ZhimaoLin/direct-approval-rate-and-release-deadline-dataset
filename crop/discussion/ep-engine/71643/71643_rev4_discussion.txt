DESCRIPTION

MB-22082: Log if cannot find connection when requesting takeover stats

The referenced MB is failing rebalance because when dcp takeover stats
are requested the specified connection cannot be found.

This is a relatively rare event, and when it happens it is useful to
know the connection name and the associated vbucket.  Therefore a
INFO log message is being added.
