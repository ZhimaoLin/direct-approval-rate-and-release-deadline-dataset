DESCRIPTION

MB-22082: Log if cannot find connection when request takeover stats

The referenced MB is failing rebalance because when takeover stats are
requested the specified connection cannot be found.

This should be a relatively rare event, and when it happens it is useful
to know the connection name and the associated vbucket.  Therefore a
NOTICE Log message is being added.
