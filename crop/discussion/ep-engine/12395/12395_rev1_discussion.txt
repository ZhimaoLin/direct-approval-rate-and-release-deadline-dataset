DESCRIPTION

Added an enum config validator for string types.

        "backend": {
            "default": "sqlite",
            "dynamic": false,
            "type": "std::string",
            "validator": {
                "enum": [
                    "blackhole",
                    "couchdb",
                    "sqlite"
                ]
            }
        }

Patch Set 1:

This blows up on me with an uncaught exception, but other validators do as well, so I think it's OK.

Patch Set 1:

I did this so I could add this to the mutation logger:


       "klog_sync": {
           "default": "commit2",
           "descr": "When to sync the log.",
           "type": "std::string",
           "enum": [
               "off",
               "commit1",
               "commit2",
               "full"
           ]
       },
