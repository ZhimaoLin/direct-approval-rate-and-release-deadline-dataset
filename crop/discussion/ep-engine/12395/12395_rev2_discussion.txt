Patch Set 2: Verified

I updated with your comment.

I've validated that this does what I want, but the validator itself fails upstream a bit and the process crashes (for any validation).  Should that be considered good enough?

Patch Set 2:

All validators throw a runtime exception if they're illegal.. That means that the code calling them needs to wrap that with a try / catch block and give a graceful error message... I'll look into that
