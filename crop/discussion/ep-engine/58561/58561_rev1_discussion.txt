DESCRIPTION

[Unit Test] Skip running test_get_delete_missing_file for forestdb

This particular test tries to check if a get after deleting an
existing file results in TMP_FAIL. But this use case doesn't
apply for forestdb as backend as the forestdb file handle isn't
opened and closed on every single operation

Line:2057, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This should be OK to make the unit test passed at this time, but we need to come up with a way of returning a consistent error for the same type of erroneous case regardless of KV storage types. Please put the TODO comment for the future reference.
