DESCRIPTION

[Unit Test] Skip running test_get_delete_missing_file for forestdb

This particular test tries to check if a get after deleting an
existing file results in TMP_FAIL. But this use case doesn't
apply for forestdb as backend as the forestdb file handle isn't
opened and closed on every single operation
