DESCRIPTION

MB-13102: Event-driven flusher notifications

Notify flusher only in case of operations awaiting
persistence, otherwise allow the flusher to sleep
until notified.

+ Observed that flusher snoozes on an idle bucket as
opposed to never snoozing without this change.
+ Observed CPU usage dip below 10% at times with the
change, when it never fell below 25% before in a
scenerio with no front end load over 40+ buckets.
