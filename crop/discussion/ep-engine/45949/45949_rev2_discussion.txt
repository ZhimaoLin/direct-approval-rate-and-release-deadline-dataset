Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

This change is too invasive and would cause some pending queue to grow quickly. We need to find a simpler way of notifying a new mutation arrival to the flusher when it is in idle state.

Line:84, src/flusher.h -> As I commented in the other place, this will flood the pending queue quickly.

Line:560, src/checkpoint.h -> This will flood the atomic queue in the flusher as we push a vbucket id for every mutation. We should come up with a simpler way of notifying an mutation arrival to the flusher if it is in the idle state.

Line:2720, src/ep.cc -> We don't need to pass the list of all VB ids to the flusher for FLUSH_ALL event as these VB ids are not necessary for resetting the database files.
