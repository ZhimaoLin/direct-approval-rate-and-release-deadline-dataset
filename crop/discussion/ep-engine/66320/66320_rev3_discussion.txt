DESCRIPTION

Initial Phosphor Support

Adds initial support for phosphor. Can be tested by running the
ep_unit_tests or using a Couchbase Bucket with memcached.

    $ PHOSPHOR_TRACING_START="save-on-stop:ep_unit_tests.%d.%p.json" ./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests

Will dump a file of the form 'ep_unit_tests.<timestamp>.<pid>.json'
in the current directory.

Patch Set 3:

Not sure about which of these events should go in with the initial lot, I'm thinking the tasks are good as well as maybe some of the scan context / commit stuff in couch kvstore

I think all the Task events should be fine.

I'm not sure about the LockHolder ones - in the uncontended case (esp were the lock scope is small - e.g. below) the cost of the tracing may dominate.





    {
        TRACE_EVENT0("ep-engine/couch-kvstore", "scanLock");
        LockHolder lh(scanLock);
        scans[scanId] = db;
    }

Could you perhaps put together a benchmark (maybe in ep-engine?) which compares the cost of Tracing with other "common" functions to help guide our choices here? I'm thinking of:

* LockHolder acquire/release (uncontested)
* Memory allocation (new) - both small (<1 cache line) and large (< 1 page).
* LOG() call (enabled)
