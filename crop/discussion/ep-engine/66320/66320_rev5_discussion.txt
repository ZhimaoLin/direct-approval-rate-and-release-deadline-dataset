DESCRIPTION

Initial Phosphor Support

Adds initial support for phosphor. Can be tested by running the
ep_unit_tests or using a Couchbase Bucket with memcached.

    $ PHOSPHOR_TRACING_START="save-on-stop:ep_unit_tests.%d.%p.json" ./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests

Will dump a file of the form 'ep_unit_tests.<timestamp>.<pid>.json'
in the current directory.

In this patch all of the ep-engine tasks have trace points added
as well as a few other occasionally called functions like
CouchKVStore compaction.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(8 comments)

Mostly looks good - few minor things.

Line:44, src/htresizer.cc -> Again, maybe add vbucket ID?

Line:49, src/connmap.cc -> I suspect this might be scheduled very frequently when there's DCP clients up. I suggest you either remove this one for now, or do a test with at least 2 nodes and say a 10k op/s pillowfight test to confirm / deny.

Line:416, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Whitespace - please revert.

Line:884, src/ep.cc -> whitespace-only change

Line:1234, src/ep.cc -> ditto

Line:329, src/ep.cc -> Maybe add the vBucket ID to this as an arg?

Line:355, src/ep.cc -> Same here

Line:679, src/tapconnection.cc -> Maybe add conn address.
