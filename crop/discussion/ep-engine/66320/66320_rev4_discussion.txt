DESCRIPTION

Initial Phosphor Support

Adds initial support for phosphor. Can be tested by running the
ep_unit_tests or using a Couchbase Bucket with memcached.

    $ PHOSPHOR_TRACING_START="save-on-stop:ep_unit_tests.%d.%p.json" ./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests

Will dump a file of the form 'ep_unit_tests.<timestamp>.<pid>.json'
in the current directory.

In this patch all of the ep-engine tasks have trace points added
as well as a few other occasionally called functions like
CouchKVStore compaction.
