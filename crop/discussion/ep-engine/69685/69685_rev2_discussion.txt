this patch may be held back for a bit, it kinda breaks upgrade as it assumes keys on disk are escaped with the meta-flag

Line:120, src/storagekey.h -> This is at byte 0 primarily so that HashTable hash just needs to iterate StorageKey::data(). I think we should pull hash into StorageKey and then the meta-flag doesn't have to live in the vector bytes. But having it in the vector bytes makes compare operators much cleaner. SerialisedStorageKey again can keep the flag separatley.
