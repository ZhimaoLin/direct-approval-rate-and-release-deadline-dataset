DESCRIPTION

DCP Backfill: Use size_t instead of uint32_t to record mem usage

We keep a record of DCP backfill memory usage to ensure that backfill
memory usage is bounded by a finite size (backfill buffer size).

We must consistently use size_t instead of uint32_t so that there is
no overflow error.
