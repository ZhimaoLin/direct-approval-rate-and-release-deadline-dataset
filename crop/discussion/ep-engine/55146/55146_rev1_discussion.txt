My comments could go in a separate patch (cleaning up the entire DCP log events), but the log level seems wrong on a lot of these events. I'd rather bump the level on what we're including in our logs by default and have it tagged correctly than logging everything as WARNINGS...

Line:152, src/dcp-stream.cc -> should this be changed to NOTICE instead?

Line:173, src/dcp-stream.cc -> From the sound of it this doesn't look like a warning to me..

Line:697, src/dcp-stream.cc -> NOTICE?

Line:872, src/dcp-stream.cc -> NOTICE?

Line:960, src/dcp-stream.cc -> NOTICE

Line:979, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I would assume that not all of these cases are warnings, but some are "normal" behavior?
