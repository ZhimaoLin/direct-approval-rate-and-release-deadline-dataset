DESCRIPTION

MB-20943: Set state to dead when deleting vbucket

When executing the VBucketMemoryDeletionTask the vbucket state is
unchanged.  notifyAllPendingConnsFailed is called in the run
function of VBucketMemoryDeletionTask.  This inturn calls fireAllOps,
which ensures all pending ops are cleared if the vbucket is in an
active state.

However if the vbucket is in a pending state is does nothing and
therefore the pending operations remain.  This results in connections
not being closed down.

The solution provided is to set the vbcuekt state to dead before
calling notifyAllPendingConnsFailed.

A corresponding test has been added, which without the fix will hang.
