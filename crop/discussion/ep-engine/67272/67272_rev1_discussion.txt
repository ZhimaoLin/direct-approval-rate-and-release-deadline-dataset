Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Again, I'm not sure this logic should reside in ep-engine.

At the very least we need to have a clear, explicit description of what abstractions in the Store layer are visible to ep-engine - i.e. it's fine to have the Shard and VBucket concept inside ep-engine, but I don't think ep-engine should know (or care) that sometimes only a Shard can be compacted and sometimes only a VBucket.

This logic should be refactored down into the concrete subclasses. If that means adding some new concept in the subclasses - for example adding a StorageProperty for "enum compactionMode { perVbucket, perShard} then that seems reasonable.

You can rest assured that this won't get checked into KV-engine. It is basically a hack to trigger compaction when we are in forestdb mode.
