DESCRIPTION

turned assignment by mistake to comparision

active() method is clearly for checking flag, not setting it. And
we're using it from a bunch of places in assert().

Line:1521, stored-value.hh -> This is really bad practice. To overload the function to both set and check the state. One of them should be called isActive (and be const), and the other one should be setActive()

Folks, I agree with Trond. But my commit just fixes one trivial bug (perf highlighed this as particularly hot place, somehow). Can we merge it and then you can discuss style guidelines after that?

Patch Set 1:

Well, I prefer that we fix the bug properly when we fix it (history has thought me that when we're adding hacks they tend to live on forever).

I just spent the 5 minutes refactoring the code to use better naming.. pushing to Jasmin Rangel when make test completes
