Line:75, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Done

Line:4757, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Takeover is not being tested here, note that no set_vbucket_state message will be sent across. The effect of a vbucket state change is being tested, where when the stream is closed the reason for its closure should be END_STREAM_STATE.
