Line:780, src/warmup.cc -> Why do we pass "false" for noDeletes flag?

Line:816, src/warmup.cc -> Same as above comment.

Line:122, src/backfill.cc -> What if ctx is NULL? Can we put a warning log at least?

Patch Set 2:

(3 comments)

Line:780, src/warmup.cc -> I kept the code the same as it was previously. I agree that we should skip deletes though and have fixed this.

Line:816, src/warmup.cc -> Done

Line:122, src/backfill.cc -> This would only happen if the database file didn't exist and we log an error in couchkvstore. If you want to add a second one here I can do that.
