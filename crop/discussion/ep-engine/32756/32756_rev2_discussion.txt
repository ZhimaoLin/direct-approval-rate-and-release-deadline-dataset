Line:35, src/upr-consumer.cc -> i'm not still clear why we need to maintain this "uuid" and "high_seqno" in Stream class. Are they used for matching a consumer with its corresponding producer?

Line:35, src/upr-consumer.cc -> We can remove them if we want. The only reason I had put them there in the first place was to allow them to be displaying the stats for debugging.
