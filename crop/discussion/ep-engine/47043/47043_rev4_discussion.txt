DESCRIPTION

MB-13517: Initialize numActiveSnoozingBackfills to zero

The failure to initialize this parameter would sometimes
give it a garbage value, which would cause the check of
the current active and snoozing backfill count against
the threshold value to fail, thereby backfills will never
be added into the active queue.
