Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)



Line:132, ep.cc -> In ep engine, flush indicates really two operations:
1) disk flush - delete entire data of data bucket
2) set/del data - write either set or del data to database file

Just an opinion, to keep coherency of these "flush" operations, you may want to change the class name to  something like BGFetch(Multi/Batch/Commit)Callback?

Line:1280, ep.cc -> Per our recent encounter of a bug where list<GetValue>'s iterator->getValue()->getKey() != list<fetch_request>'s iterator->first, please consider add an assert checking such error case (assuming orders of both lists are aligned)
