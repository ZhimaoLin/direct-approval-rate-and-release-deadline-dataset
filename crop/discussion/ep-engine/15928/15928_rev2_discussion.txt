DESCRIPTION

MB-5164 Batch read support

 KVStore now has a getMulti() that can be used to retrieve multiple
 items by their rowIDs. Its assumed rowID is a KV-store specific cookie
 that can be used for efficient access to a specific item.

 Removed the assumption from StoredValue that rowID never changes once
 set. Made sense for SQLite where rowID was an index into a SQLite
 table, but in Couchstore its an index into a mutation log.

 EventuallyPersistentStore keeps a background fetch queue per vbucket,
 that is only accessed from the read-only dispatcher.
