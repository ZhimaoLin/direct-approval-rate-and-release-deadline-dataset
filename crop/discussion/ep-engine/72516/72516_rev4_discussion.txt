DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral] Add persistence flag to CheckpointConfig

Add a new boolean flag to CheckpointConfig - persistenceEnabled. This
is true for EP buckets, but is false for Ephemeral buckets.

This is used for controlling CheckpointManager behaviour which is
specific to the persistence mode - for example if the persistence
cursor should be registered.
