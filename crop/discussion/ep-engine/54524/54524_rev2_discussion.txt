DESCRIPTION

MB-13533: Adding an initial schedule time for expiry pager

Initial schedule time by default is set to -1, meaning
the expiry pager will sleep for the specified sleeptime
upon initialization before running. exp_pager_task_time
can be set during run time using cbepctl to a value in
range (0, 23), which would schedule the expiry pager at
that hour, and after that the expiry pager would run in
an interval specified by exp_pager_stime.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:197, management/cbepctl -> I think this is a little vague - how about something like:

What time the first expiry pager run should commence, as UTC hour (0..23). Specify 'disable' to not delay expiry pager, and start first run after `exp_pager_stime` seconds.

Line:2198, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Prefer checkeq() over cb_assert() when comparing two values in a testcase - the former will print the expected and actual values upon a mismatch.

Line:2202, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can I suggest expanding these tests to check the rollover case - i.e. where task_time is less than the current hour (and hence invoke the code to calculate difference to next day.

Can you also verify that the task's snooze time is correct?

Line:212, configuration.json -> Nit: "... scheduled to to *first* run"

(I assume that after this initial run it will subsequently run every exp_pager_stime seconds).

Line:243, docs/stats.org -> Again, I'd expand this to mention this is the initial run time.
