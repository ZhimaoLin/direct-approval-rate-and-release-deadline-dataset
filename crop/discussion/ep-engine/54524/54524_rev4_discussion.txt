DESCRIPTION

MB-13533: Adding an initial schedule time for expiry pager

Initial schedule time by default is set to -1, meaning
the expiry pager will sleep for the specified sleeptime
upon initialization before running. exp_pager_task_time
can be set during run time using cbepctl to a value in
range (0, 23), which would schedule the expiry pager at
that hour, and after that the expiry pager would run in
an interval specified by exp_pager_stime.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

This is kinda +0.5 - code itself looks good but I think some changes to naming etc would improve understandibility of it.

Line:333, src/item_pager.cc -> Nit: 1 or 2 lines between methods is probably sufficient.

Line:115, src/item_pager.h -> Could do with a brief description - of what constitutes "update"

Line:210, configuration.json -> Personally I feel this is an abbreviation too far - at least with "task_time" I had a reasonable change to guess the meaning from the name, "ttime" could mean anything!

I'm not sure it's worth saving 4 characters for the loss of meaning - personally I'd go the other direction and give it a name which is self-descriptiive - say:


 exp_page_first_run_time 

or 

 exp_page_initial_run_time 


This is particularly relevant in epctl, which *is* exposed to customers and hence having a self-explanatory name is valuable.
