DESCRIPTION

Fix unit-test failures on Win32

Due to CBD-1740 we have had unit test running disabled on Windows. That
issue has now been resolved (by moving to the newer Jenkins on
cv.jenkins). However in the interim a couple of bugs have entered our unit
tests meaning they fail on Windows:

* ep_perfsuite uses the non-standard '%n' formatter which MSVC doesn't
  support. Fix by removing the use of the formatter.

* gethrtime() has lower precision compared to other platforms which means
  two calls can return the same value. This resulted in warmup duration
  being calculated as zero, which prevents the ep_warmup_time stat from
  being generated. Fix by adding the hrtime_period to the warmup duraiton.

All ep-engine unit tests now pass on my local Windows 7 VM.
