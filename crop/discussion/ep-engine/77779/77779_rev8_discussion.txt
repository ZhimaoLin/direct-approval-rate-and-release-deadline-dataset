DESCRIPTION

MB-24246: update highestDedupedSeqno when an existing value is changed

Without this, rangeReads are allowed to stop "too early" - potentially
missing out on items that have been updated, i.e.,

^ = HDDS (HighestDedupedSeqno)

 A₁   B₂   C₃            Initial items
[A₁   B₂   C₃]           rangeRead 1-3
[A₁   B₂   C₃]  B'₄       Update B
 A₁   B₂   C₃   B'₄       RR ends
[A₁   B₂   C₃]  B'₄       new rangeRead, still consistent
 A₁   B₂   C₃   B'₄       RR ends
 A₁        C₃   B'₄       purger removes stale B
!A₁        C₃!  B'₄       RR 1-3 could be requested, but would be
inconsistent. The HDDS serves to extend the end of a rangeRead to the
most recently deduped item, in this case B' replaced an older B.
