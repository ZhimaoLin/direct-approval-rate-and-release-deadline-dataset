DESCRIPTION

MB-24246: update highestDedupedSeqno when an existing value is changed

Without this, rangeReads are allowed to stop "too early" - potentially
missing out on items that have been updated, i.e.,

^ = HDDS (HighestDedupedSeqno)

 A₁   B₂   C₃            Initial items
[A₁   B₂   C₃]           rangeRead 1-3
[A₁   B₂   C₃]  B'₄       Update B
 A₁   B₂   C₃   B'₄       RR ends
[A₁   B₂   C₃]  B'₄       new rangeRead, still consistent
 A₁   B₂   C₃   B'₄       RR ends
 A₁        C₃   B'₄       purger removes stale B
!A₁        C₃!  B'₄       RR 1-3 could be requested, but would be
inconsistent. The HDDS serves to extend the end of a rangeRead to the
most recently deduped item, in this case B' replaced an older B.

Line:315, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> This is pretty nasty - relying in internal knowledge of the seqList. 

Suggest you instead add a new virtual method to SequenceList - getHighSeqnosLock().

Line:332, src/linked_list.cc -> Don't use SpinLock - they are basically an anti-pattern in multi-CPU userspace code. See for example https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/SpinLock.h#L17
