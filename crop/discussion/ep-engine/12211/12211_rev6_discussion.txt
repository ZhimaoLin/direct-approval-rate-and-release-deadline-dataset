DESCRIPTION

Expire temporary items created in response to get-meta requests

Upon restoring deleted items from the persistent store, we set them
to expire after a predetermined amount of time (default is 60 secs).

This change set modifies the Deleter class to also look for temporary
items and delete them when the following conditions are met:
1. They are either in the meta_available or non_existent states i.e.,
   the background fetches for these items have completed. If a fetch
   is in process, we let it finish.
2. They have expired.

Also, upon deleting temporary items, we don't put them on the check-
point queues as don't need to be either persisted or replicate to
another node.
