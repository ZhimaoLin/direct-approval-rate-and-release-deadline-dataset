DESCRIPTION

MB-18650: Move TAP tests into ep_testsuite_tap

The TAP tests (26 of them) are only ~10% of the number of tests in
ep_testsuite, but take ~20% of the runtime. Move them into their own
suite, for better maintainability and to allow them to run in parallel
(and hence reduce overall wall-clock time).
