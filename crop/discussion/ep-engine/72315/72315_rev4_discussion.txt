Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(1 comment)

Line:287, src/ep_engine.h -> If possible would be preferred to turn this into a static check - i.e. make `cas` be a reference, and then it's not possible to pass a null CAS.

(Obviously that may just move the check up one level to the caller of this function, but that's generally a desirable property as it means arguments are validated sooner (and hence errors don't have to be propagated so far down the stack).
