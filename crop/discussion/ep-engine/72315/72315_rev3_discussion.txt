Patch Set 3:

(4 comments)

Line:284, src/ep_engine.h -> I *think* in the logging spec there aren't spaces around the colon (I haven't seen it in a while).

Line:317, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Would you mind updating these to describe which ones are out params?

Line:730, src/vbucket.h -> nit: doxygen blocks have specific flags for in/out params:

   xxx@xxx.xxx
   xxx@xxx.xxx
   xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:733, src/vbucket.h -> What is a bgFetchDelay?

Line:284, src/ep_engine.h -> Done

Line:317, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Done

Line:730, src/vbucket.h -> leaving @param[in] as xxx@xxx.xxx
Updating others

Line:733, src/vbucket.h -> It is  the delay in scheduling the bgFetch task. I thought the name was self explanatory
