DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Revert the logging of ignoring request to notify stream ready

Change I75f2d25af5d0f11175beb7b23300486092aa86fa added logging when
ignoring a request to notify that a stream is ready due to the
associated vbucket already being in the ready queue.

Unfortunately this is unexpectantly flooding the logs therefore this
patch reverts the addition of this logging.
