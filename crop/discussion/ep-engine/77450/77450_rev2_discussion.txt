DESCRIPTION

Enable xerror in python tooling

A number of errors are explicitly handled and give reasonable errors,
but the remaining exceptions will now print the associated message from
the error map too. Errors which would previously lead to being
disconnected as the client would not understand are now received and
raised appropriately.
