DESCRIPTION

MB-10514: Wait for the backfill queue to drain before scheduling backfill

It is possible that after a vbucket takeover the entire backfill
queue has not drained. This means that if we schedule a backfill
may miss some items. This change causes the backfill task to wait
until all of the backfill items have been persisted before
scheduling the a new backfill.
