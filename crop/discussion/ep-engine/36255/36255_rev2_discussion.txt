DESCRIPTION

MB-10514: Wait for the backfill queue to drain before scheduling backfill

It is possible that after a vbucket takeover the entire backfill
queue has not drained. This means that if we schedule a backfill
may miss some items. This change causes the backfill task to wait
until all of the backfill items have been persisted before
scheduling the a new backfill.

Line:122, src/upr-stream.cc -> Does this mean that vbucket takeover operation with UPR doesn't wait until all the backfilled items are persisted in a new master?

Line:363, src/vbucket.h -> We don't need this as we already maintain a last persisted seqno in vbmap.

Line:2555, src/ep.cc -> We don't need this as we can get it from vbmap, which is updated below.
