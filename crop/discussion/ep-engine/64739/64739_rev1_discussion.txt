DESCRIPTION

Address compiler warning by using temporary integer for snprintf

snprintf returns a temporary signed integer. Assigning to an unsigned
integer and checking for a negative value doesn't work. Hence, use
a temporary integer to address the issue.

Line:784, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> In general it's only an error if is a negative return value, so this should probably be `keylen < 0`. Having said that in this case we expect at least len(partition) bytes so zero would also be an error...
