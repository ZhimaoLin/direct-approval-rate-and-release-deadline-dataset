close that stream.

Patch Set 2:

We will probably use pieces of it as time moves on, but I think we can remove it for now. It's easy to add back later anyways. What happened here is David modified the upr code based on how tap works. It will be difficult to test as is so it makes sense to add back the parts that work over the next week or so. I'll upload a new patch set.
