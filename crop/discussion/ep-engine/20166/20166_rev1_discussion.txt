Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We need to fix the makefile. This change will case the sequence number to be sent incorrectly on the wire. I got backed up with other stuff on Friday. I will definitely fix this tomorrow.

Sure thing, thanks. Though you may still want to consider to find a way to use the generic htonll instead of memcached's. I may be wrong but it may not be as easy as just modifying the makefile.

Jin, I think Mike already fixed in the other commit. Thanks for bringing this issue and working on it.
