Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(4 comments)

Line:1569, src/dcp/stream.cc -> grammar nit: this should be "should've" or "should have"

Line:230, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Possibly worth giving n a slightly more descriptive name or a comment (Or just moving the below comment with describes the calculation up to here).

Line:233, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> It looks like you don't modify these so prefer to make const.

Line:236, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> ditto
