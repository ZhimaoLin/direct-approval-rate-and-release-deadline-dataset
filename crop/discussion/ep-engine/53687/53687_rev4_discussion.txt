DESCRIPTION

Handling the race between flusher and snapshot tasks

If a snapshot task hasn't run when the first flusher
task runs, and there is no entry in cachedVBStates,
create a new entry for the particular vbucket, rather
than asserting.

Can you also add the unit test for this?

Line:3222, src/ep.cc -> Why do we need to pass this value to the underlying store?

Line:3223, src/ep.cc -> Passing the entire failover table for each vb commit can be expensive as there are no changes in the failover table during the steady state. We need to pass the failover table iff there are changes in the table.

For this, I would rather have the VBucketStatePersist task create a new cached entry if not exist.

Line:3223, src/ep.cc -> Is it possible to have a const std::string& toJSON() method to remove the string construction/copy, we can lock failovers underlying string whilst flushing, flushing performance should be the goal
