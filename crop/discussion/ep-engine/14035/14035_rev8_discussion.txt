Patch Set 8:

Looks like we've got rid of parts of the stuff we've had problems with. It would be great if we could ditch the sending of the notificaiton messages from here and rahter have the clients poll for the current position via the stats. That should be a relatively easy change? (and also allow us to stop open/lseek/close all the time)...
