Oops, didn't mean to merge. FYI, my change on top of Trond's was 1 line to fix a compiler warning of a uninitialized struct member from XCDR work. Should back out if there are any other build or runtime problems (besides XCDR issues).

Everything looks OK, and I verified the code with testrunner view test + rebalance + some Adrianna Holmesal tests. However, this review does not allow me to enter review scores (+1/2, verified, etc).
