DESCRIPTION

Add a HashTable function to remove (not delete) a StoredValue from it

In Ephemeral Buckets we have a requirement to remove items from HashTable
and mark them as stale rather than deleting them immediately.

Here we create a general HashTable function to just remove a StoredValue
from it and not delete it. Also since this logic is pretty much the
same as HashTable::unlocked_del() we reuse the code by calling remove
before deletion.

The last couple aborted/failed ep-engine-Jasmin Rangel-master jobs were caused by me attempting to reconfigure that job; my apologies. They can likely be ignored.

Could you clarify in the comment? - thanks
