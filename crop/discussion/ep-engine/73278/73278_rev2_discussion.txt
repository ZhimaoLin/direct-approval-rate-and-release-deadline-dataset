DESCRIPTION

Add a HashTable function to remove (not delete) a StoredValue from it

In Ephemeral Buckets we have a requirement to remove items from HashTable
and mark them as stale rather than deleting them immediately.

Here we create a general HashTable function to just remove a StoredValue
from it and not delete it. Also since this logic is pretty much the
same as HashTable::unlocked_del() we reuse the code by calling remove
before deletion.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Line:409, src/hash_table.h -> Suggest this is named differently to the unlocked_remove below (given they have different semantics).

To clarify - this takes the StoredValue of the HashTable's "ownership", but doesn't actually delete the StoredValue - if that's the case how does one then find the StoredValue (to eventually free / clean up?)

I suggest you have this return a StoredValue* so the caller is then made responsible for the ownership of this item.

Also - maybe this would be better named `unlocked_release` - modelling on unique_ptr naming?

Line:385, src/hash_table.cc -> This is slightly misleading - the HashTable isn't necessarily empty, just the specified bucket. Please reword to clarify.
