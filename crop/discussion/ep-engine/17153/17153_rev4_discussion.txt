DESCRIPTION

CBD-368 Add separate dispatcher for tap replication & backfill

The new separate taprDispatcher is for backfill and other tap
replication BG fetches. Add a new tapUnderlying as well. It is
probably OK to share roUnderlying between backfill and BG
fetch for couch-kvstore but not for sqlite.
