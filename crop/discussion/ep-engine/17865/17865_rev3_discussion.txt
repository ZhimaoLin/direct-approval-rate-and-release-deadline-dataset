persisted.

Line:540, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> The overall logic looks great. However, we may want to refactor below code after 2.0. Create a helper function for doing the verification and update + better variable names like cachedState = it->second, etc. Thanks.

Line:567, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need this continue here. We can do this at line #551 above.

Line:540, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Yes, agree. We need to revisit lots of other things including this in couchkvstore to libcouchstore

Line:567, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Good catch. Will address it soon
