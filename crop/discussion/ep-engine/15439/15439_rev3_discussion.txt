DESCRIPTION

Test races between delete_with_meta and set/delete

Following scenarios are covered:
1. A set is interleaved between a get_meta and the subsequent
   delete_with_meta for an existing key. The delete_with_meta should
   fail.
2. A set is interleaved between a get_meta and the subsequent
   delete_with_meta for a deleted key. The delete_with_meta should
   fail.
3. A set is interleaved between a get_meta and the subsequent
   delete_with_meta for a nonexistent key. The delete_with_meta should
   fail.

4. A delete is interleaved between a get_meta and the subsequent
   delete_with_meta for an existing key. The delete_with_meta should
   fail.
5. A delete is interleaved between a get_meta and the subsequent
   delete_with_meta for a deleted key. The delete should fail and the
   delete_with_meta should pass.
6. A delete is interleaved between a get_meta and the subsequent
   delete_with_meta for a nonexistent key. The delete should fail and
   the delete_with_meta should pass.
