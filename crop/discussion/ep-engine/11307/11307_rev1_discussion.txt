DESCRIPTION

MB-4359: get/sets take up to 3 seconds during large rebalance

This bug was causing get and set operaitont o take a long time
during rebalancing a 25 node cluster. The cause of the bug has
to do with vbucket state changes not happening quickly due to
other jobs on the nio dispatcher taking a long time. The result
is a temporary drop in performance.

This fix moves the vbucket state change job off of the nio
dispatcher and onto the tap notify thread.

Great work, Mike! Some minor comments.

Line:748, ep.cc -> Let's limit this call for the state transition from pending to active.
if (vb->getState() == pending && to == active) {
    engine.getTapConnMap().notify();
}

Line:3600, ep_engine.cc -> Let's change the function name something like "notifyPendingConnections"
