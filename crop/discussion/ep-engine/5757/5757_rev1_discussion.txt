DESCRIPTION

Added definition for getl

I originally put this definition into memcached, but since getl
is an engine specific command I am moving it into ep-engine.

Line:129, command_ids.h -> I think this should be moved to memcached "include/memcached/protocol_binary.h"

Line:129, command_ids.h -> No, include/memcached/prototype_binary.h are for official messages...

Line:129, command_ids.h -> Heh, it just came from there.

memcached won't be supporting getl.  It's pretty much an ep-engine only extension.
