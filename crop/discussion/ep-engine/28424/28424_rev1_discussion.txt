DESCRIPTION

MB-8530 Set TAP paused flag upon returning TAP_PAUSE response.

We should set the TAP paused flag to true only if there are no
items to be sent to the destination. Otherwise, we invoke
too many unnecessary notify_io_complete calls.

Mike,

I saw some improvement in performance with this change, but not that much. I'd like to merge this change. I still need to investigate it furthermore.
