DESCRIPTION

MB-20022: In DCP consumer, while adding new str on a vb, erase dead str if any

In a DCP consumer we store streams in a map with vbid as the key. Before
adding a new steam, we must erase any existing dead on that vb. Otherwise the
new stream created will not be stored in the map and hence would be deleted
immediately.
