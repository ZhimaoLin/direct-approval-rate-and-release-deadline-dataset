DESCRIPTION

MB-16632: Use a background task to handle snapshot creation

Frontend threads are delayed by large snaphots due to the time taken
in processing the items into the readyQ.

Moving this work to a background task frees frontend threads to
do other work.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:284, src/dcp-stream.h -> Does the return value have ownership semantics? If so should probably document this and state that the caller is responsible for deleting it.

Line:219, src/dcp-producer.h -> Does this need to be deleted in the destructor?

Or ideally changed to a reference so we don't have to worry about pointers...

Line:495, configuration.json -> As per previous patch, would be good to keep this (semi) sorted.

Line:112, src/priority.cc -> Nit: Indentation

Line:616, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Related to our discussions earlier today, is there any issue here if the ActiveStream is deleted before we get around to processing thist list? In other words do we need a shared_ptr or similar for this queue?

Line:152, src/dcp-producer.cc -> It might be too big change for 3.1.3 release, but as an experimental purpose, you may want to create a separate background thread pool for replication and compare it with AUXIO thread approach to get more performance data points and understand if that's a better scheduling approach or not. As another approach, we may need to consider splitting AUX-IO tasks into different groups (e.g., short or long-running task groups) and schedule them based on their priorities and task group.
