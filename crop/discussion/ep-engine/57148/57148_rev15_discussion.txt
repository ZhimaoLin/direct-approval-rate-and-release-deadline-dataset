DESCRIPTION

MB-16632: Use a background task to handle snapshot creation

Frontend threads are delayed by large snaphots due to the time taken
in processing the items into the readyQ.

Moving this work to a background task frees frontend threads to
do other work.

Line:282, src/dcp-stream.h -> As a separate enhancement for debugging, it would be better to append the name of the corresponding DCP producer

Line:630, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Style: please use C++ type cast (static_cast in this case)

Line:658, src/dcp-stream.cc -> where is "iterations" incremented?
