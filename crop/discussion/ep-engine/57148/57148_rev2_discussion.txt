DESCRIPTION

MB-16632: Use a background task to handle snapshot creation

Frontend threads are delayed by large snaphots due to the time taken
in processing the items into the readyQ.

Moving this work to a background task frees frontend threads to
do other work.

Replace itemsReady with an atomic bool to allow some lockless
notifications.
