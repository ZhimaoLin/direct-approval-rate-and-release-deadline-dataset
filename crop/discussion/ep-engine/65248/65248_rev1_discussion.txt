DESCRIPTION

Rename backfills map to scans maps as the scan context is more generic

Performing a scan over the items over the KVStore is more generic
and not strictly attached to backfill. Hence, rename backfills to
scans and move it to abstract KVStore class.

(3 comments)

I'm not convinced about this change - we are moving data up the inheritance hierarchy, even though nothing in the base-class actually uses `scan` and related objects. 

Just because the two current subclasses both use some data doesn't mean we should promote it to the base class - this would potentially make it harder to create additional subclasses in future as we are imposing a specific implementation (the scan map etc) on them.

I'm fine with renaming members to better reflect their use, but could you explain the rationale for moving to the abstract base class?

Line:751, src/kvstore.h -> Please add some comments on what these members are for.

Line:1233, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> What scope is does the lock need to be held for? If it's just for updating the `scans` map, please add a new scope such that we release the lock ASAP.

Line:1258, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Similar - please use a scope here for the lock.

Patch Set 1:

CouchKVStore and ForestKVStore were both performing scans. I thought it might be better to move it to a more common place. If the concern is other subclasses may not necessarily need, I can keep it to CouchKVStore and ForestKVStore.
