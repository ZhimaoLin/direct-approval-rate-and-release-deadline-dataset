DESCRIPTION

MB-17508 2/4 Expose detailed range errors to SET_PARAM requests

Exposes detailed validation error messages from the configuration validators
further down the stack out on the body of the response instead of a generic
'out of range' style message.

The primary purpose of this is to expose error reasons when using epctl.
Sample output:

> $ ./cbepctl localhost:12001 set flush_param exp_pager_initial_run_time 25
> setting param: exp_pager_initial_run_time 25
> Error: Validation Error, exp_pager_initial_run_time takes values between -1 and 23 (Got: 25)
