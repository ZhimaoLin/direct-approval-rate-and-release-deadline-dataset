DESCRIPTION

MB-4337 Provide an option for keeping closed checkpoints.

If "keep_closed_chks" engine parameter is set to true, we can
keep closed checkpoints as long as the current memory usage
is below the high water mark. However, the number of retained
checkpoints won't exceed the max number of checkpoints allowed
per vbucket.
