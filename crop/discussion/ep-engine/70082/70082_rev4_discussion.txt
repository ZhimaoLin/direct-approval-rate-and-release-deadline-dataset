DESCRIPTION

MB-21685: Use EWOULDBLOCK variant of delVBucket

The test can occasionally fail because a delete overlaps
the test code which has set the VB active and written data.
The data in the overlap gets deleted from disk.

MB-21687 covers the overlap issue for delVBucket without the async=0
parameter.
