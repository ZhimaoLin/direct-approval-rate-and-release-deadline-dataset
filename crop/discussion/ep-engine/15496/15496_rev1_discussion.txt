DESCRIPTION

[Backport] MB-5171 Don't decrement numNonResident during warmup

Decrementing numNonResident during the warmup caused the total
resident ratio and cbstats' num_non_resident attributes to become
negative. Each initial insert of items during the warmup should
never decrement the numNonResident.
