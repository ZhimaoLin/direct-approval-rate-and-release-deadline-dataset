DESCRIPTION

Set NRU from Item instead of explicit parameter

When storing items into the HashTable there is an optional argument to
specify the nru (not recently used) value for a StoredValue. This is
inconsistent with all other properties, which are passed via the Item
object; additionally it complicates the various HashTable add/set
calls as they have a defaulted argument.

Change to use the Item's NRU when populating the HashTable.
