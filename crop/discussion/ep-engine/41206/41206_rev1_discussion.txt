DESCRIPTION

remove warmup wait dead code to prevent accidental deadlock

Since we should never have a front-end thread wait for background
thread, having a warmup wait logic will ensure that we do not use
it accidentally in the future and cause a deadlock

Chiyoung, I cannot remove those parameter from configuration.json since ns_server is still calling into memcached with them. 
I will co-ordinate with ns_server team to remove it soon, but we need to keep these parameters for now. thanks

Patch Set 1:

I'm now a little confused. Then, we shouldn't remove this logic, but instead fix the deadlock issue.

Patch Set 1:

This change fixes the deadlock by removing use of vb0 and waitforwarmup, from ep-engine, but if we remove these parameters from configuration.json, then the babysitter process in ns-server will crash because it will try to pass vb0 and waitforwarmup default values into memcached.
So I am keeping these values in configuration.json for now and will remove them once they are also removed from ns-server.
