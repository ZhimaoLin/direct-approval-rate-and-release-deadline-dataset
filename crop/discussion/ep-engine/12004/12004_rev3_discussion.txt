DESCRIPTION

Added validation for missing checkpoints while merging backup

If we specify a valid existing backup file as output using
-o outputfile.mbb, current mbbackup-merge-incremental script does not do
any valdation for missing checkpoints. This patch adds validation for
merging input backup files to an existing valid backup file which is
specified as output file. It throws an error message and exits when
checkpoints are missing.
