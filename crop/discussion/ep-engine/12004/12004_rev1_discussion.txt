DESCRIPTION

Added validation for missing checkpoints while merging to an existing backup file

If we specify a valid existing backup file as output using -o outputfile.mbb, current
mbbackup-merge-incremental script does not do any valdation for missing checkpoints.
This patch adds validation for merging input backup files to an already existing
valid backup file which is specified as output file. It throws an error message and exits
when checkpoints are missing.
