DESCRIPTION

Added validation for missing checkpoints while merging to an existing backup file

If we specify a valid existing backup file as output using -o outputfile.mbb, current
mbbackup-merge-incremental script does not do any valdation for missing checkpoints.
This patch adds validation for merging input backup files to an already existing
valid backup file which is specified as output file. It throws an error message and exits
when checkpoints are missing.

Please limit a commit title and body to 80 columns.

Line:216, management/mbbackup-merge-incremental -> The error message is a little unclear. I think it should be rephrased like "There are missing checkpoints between the merged output file and input backup files"

This line is also too long. Please split it into two.

We need the commit message to wrap much shorter.  This doesn't even fit on the Jasmin Rangel display.  This is a good writeup:  http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

Line:216, management/mbbackup-merge-incremental -> And the source lines need to be shorter.
