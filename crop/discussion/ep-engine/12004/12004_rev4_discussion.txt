DESCRIPTION

Add validation for missing checkpoints while merging backup

If we specify a valid existing backup file as output using
-o outputfile.mbb, the current mbbackup-merge-incremental
script does not do any valdation for missing checkpoints.
This patch adds validation for merging input backup files
to an existing valid backup file which is specified as an
output file. It throws an error message and exits when
checkpoints are missing.
