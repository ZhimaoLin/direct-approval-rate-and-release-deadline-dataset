DESCRIPTION

[MB-5072] Fix bgfetch of metadata to return ENGINE_SUCCESS

Both ENGINE_SUCCESS and ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT are a success for the fetch
of a non-resident key. In both these cases, we should return
ENGINE_SUCCESS so that a blocked memcached connection could be
unblocked and the get-meta request retried.

Do you have any plan to add the basic test cases for XDCR to the ep-engine test framework?

I know you tested them through the QA regressions, but I still think we should support the basic tests on the ep-engine.

Line:196, stored-value.cc -> It isn't related to this change, but we should change this log message like "The underlying storage returned %d for get_meta.\n". This should be a separate commit.

Yes, I'll be adding ep-engine unit tests this week.

Line:196, stored-value.cc -> Good point. Will make this change separately.
