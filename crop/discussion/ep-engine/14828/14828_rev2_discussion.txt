DESCRIPTION

[MB-5072] Fix bgfetch of metadata to return ENGINE_SUCCESS

Both ENGINE_SUCCESS and ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT are a success for the fetch
of a non-resident key. In both these cases, we should return
ENGINE_SUCCESS so that a blocked memcached connection could be
unblocked and the get-meta request retried.
