DESCRIPTION

Initial version of the SYNC command

This is still a work in progress.
Missing:

- well defined request and response messages (flags, response information);
- sync for replication;
- check keys' dirtiness before blocking client;
- more tests

Added static qualifier to avoid compiler error

On some g++ versions, this caused a compilation error
