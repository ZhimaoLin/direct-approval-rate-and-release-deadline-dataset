DESCRIPTION

Initial version of the SYNC command

This is still a work in progress.
Missing:

- well defined request and response messages (flags, response information);
- sync for replication;
- check keys' dirtiness before blocking client;
- more tests

Added static qualifier to avoid compiler error

On some g++ versions, this caused a compilation error

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

-1 for WIP (haven't actually looked at the code yet).

If at all possible, try to keep this broken up into smaller parts.
