DESCRIPTION

CBSE-1350:  Fix deadlock in checkpoint persistence command

We need to release the hpChkMutex before notifying memcached in
order to prevent a deadlock. The deadlock occurs when the flusher
trys to notify memcached of checkpoint persistence at the same
time a memcached worker thread is trying to add a new checkpoint
persistence request.
