Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

I still don't think this is totally necessary, but it's probably better to be consistent.

Line:164, management/dbconvert.cc -> This is aligned inconsistently with the others.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo:  should be "program"

Line:134, management/mbdbupgrade -> Was this supposed to be part of this change?
