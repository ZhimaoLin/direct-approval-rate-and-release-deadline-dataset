Line:1978, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think putting this log as DEBUG means that the local doc won't exist if a vbucket is newly created, which is not an error. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Line:1978, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Yes. For a newly created vbucket, there is no local document.

Line:1978, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Then, why should this be treated as an error?

Line:1978, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> readVBState isn't always called on a newly created vbucket. Its also invoked during rollback.

Line:1978, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Then, this logic is wrong and we shouldn't throw an exception if this function is invoked by CouchKVStore::initialize() because couchstore will return DOC_NOT_FOUND if the database is empty.

I rather change this function's return type to ENGINE_ERROR_CODE and let the caller decide whether an exception should be thrown depending on the context.
