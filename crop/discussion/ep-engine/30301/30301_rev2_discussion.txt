DESCRIPTION

MB-9532 Find a new compacted file upon receiving a temp failure

When the flusher receives a temp failure from the mccouch, it
should check if a new compacted file exists or not before
re-writing dirty items. This is required especially when the
deletion of the old file fails due to some external issues.
Otherwise, the flusher will keep writing dirty items into the
old file and receiving a temp failure over and over.
