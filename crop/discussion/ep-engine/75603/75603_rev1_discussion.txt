DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Collections DcpProducer

1. Enable SystemEvent Items in "Item::shouldReplicate"
2. Update DcpProducer so that it grabs the various bits of collection
   data for the transferred events and calls through the engine's dcp
   system_event callback

An update synchrounous engine test now links a MockDcpConsumer to
a MockDcpProducer and drives events from one to the other.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

Code looks good, just a couple of documentation improvements.

Line:476, src/dcp/response.h -> Comment needs updating now this is a unique_ptr

Line:526, src/dcp/response.h -> Given these are non-owning, would be useful to document where the pointed-to data actually resides (I assume somewhere inside `item` ?)

Line:935, src/dcp/stream.cc -> For future consideration, but it would be nice if `items` held owning pointers so we can remove all this Adrianna Holmesal management :)
