DESCRIPTION

Simpler API for EventuallyPersistentStore::addMutationEvent()

The second parameter, the vbucket's ID, is not necessary as it can be
obtained from the first parameter (an Item instance). For all the current
use cases, the passed vbucket ID is the same as the one found in the given
Item.
