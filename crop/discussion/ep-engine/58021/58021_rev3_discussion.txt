Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Manu,

Regarding another change that has a dependency on this change:

>this is needed for http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/57969/2/src/ep.cc
>The lock is acquired in line 3360 and should be released in line 3378.

You can simply wrap the critical section using { ... } to limit the lock scope.

Patch Set 3:

If that is the coding guideline we find better to follow, then I have no problem with it.
But, will it be able to handle the below case ?
func()
{
    acquire_lock();
    if () {
        release_lock();
    } else {
        ...
    }
    ...
    ...
   // release_lock() in destructor
} 

I suggest we have the code ready to release the lock wherever we need. But use it only if it is really necessary (that is, if we cannot limit the scope by braces).

Patch Set 3: -Code-Review

Manu,

I agree that we may need to have explicit lock and unlock functions in some cases, but it seems to me that another change depending on this commit doesn't need these functions at this time. If any subsequent commits require this commit, then I'm fine with it.
