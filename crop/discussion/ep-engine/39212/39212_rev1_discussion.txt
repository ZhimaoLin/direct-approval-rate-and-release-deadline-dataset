DESCRIPTION

MB-11629: In CompactVBTask, set completeBeforeShutdown to true

Possible race condition between handleDisconnect and notify from
CompactVBTask, causing the session counter to be
decremented for a compactVB task before it completes execution,
and when it does run later, results in an underflow of the
session counter.
