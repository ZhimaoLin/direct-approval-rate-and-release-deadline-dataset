Patch Set 4: (9 inline comments)



Line:1158, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> ldoc isn't being used anywhere in this function.

Line:111, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This should be a pointer to a pointer:
"const DocInfo **docinfos..."

Line:113, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> idx is not initialized.

Line:114, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> 1. If rev_seq isn't the same type as max, use explicit conversion.
2. We should only do this for deleted docs. Since a batch may contain all docs, we need an explicit check for the deleted flag here.

Line:115, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> here too..

Line:1081, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> The new max should be saved only if it's greater than the old saved max.

Line:1201, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Guess this is redundant, right?

Line:1205, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Perhaps rename function to something like: readVBState() or something similar.

Line:1246, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Rename function..
