Patch Set 11: (11 inline comments)

Sorry, I missed a number of comments as I was quite busy all day. I think many of these are critical from a code safety point of view. I'd really appreciate it if you can spend some time addressing this. Do let me know if you've any questions of if you'd like to discuss something.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:251, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This doesn't look safe. It doesn't look like couch store_docinfo_by_id() needs a non-const pointer id.buf to look up a doc's info.

I think we should modify couchstore_docinfo_by_id() to accept a const pointer. Then we wouldn't have to do a const_cast here.

Line:119, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Use the std::max function.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:269, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Seems redundant. The following should suffice:

getMetaOnly = rc && rc->val.isPartial();

It might also be better from a readability perspective if this statement is moved to where the getMetaOnly is used (down below). In fact, we can even get rid of the variable and just use the condition since that's the only time we ever need it and it is simple enough.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:277, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't this be an error since we return immediately after this? In that case, we can do this for both getData and getMeta and get rid of the the enclosing if statement.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:318, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Confirmed with Damien. This if block seems redundant. We can get rid of it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:508, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> vbState is uninitialized and can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if readVBState does not initialize it (for whatever reason), then we will end up passing it in that state to saveVBState().

I propose the following:
1. Intialize vbState appropriately.
2. Pass its reference to readVBState(). If the local doc exists and is readable, vbState will get populated accordingly. Otherwise the initial values will remain unchanged.
3. After readVBState() returns, pass vbState to saveVBState().

In fact, these two functions can be combined to something like updateVBState(). This would greatly simplify the logic.

Let me know if this makes sense.

Another benefit will be that new function's API will be simpler. RIght now it returns an integer to indicate it couldn't access the local doc for some reason (what reason, it doesn't say). With the proposed logic, the new function could just return a boolean to indicate it was successful in doing what it was asked to.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1094, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> The comment is misleading unless I'm missing something. We call save_documents() for the entire batch, not for individual items, right? If so, can you please fix it?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1109, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why don't we simply return errCode instead of casting it? Just change the function's signature. All the casts make the code look confusing.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1229, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> As I mentioned above, I think this function can be greatly simplified. I'll spend some more time thinking about it and let you know.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1263, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We should have some error handling code to catch exceptions resulting from conversion of arbitrary strings to numbers. Please take a look at strtoul() documentation for possible errors.
