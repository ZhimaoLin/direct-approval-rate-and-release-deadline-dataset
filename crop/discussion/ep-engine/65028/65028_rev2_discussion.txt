the 2 checkpoints, the DCP cursor from one of them is dropped.

Sure, my point is we could migrate this test over to the EPStore unit tests. It's fine for now, but if we have any more problems / improvements in this area I'd say ditch the ep_testsuite test (which is brittle) and move to the unit tests.
