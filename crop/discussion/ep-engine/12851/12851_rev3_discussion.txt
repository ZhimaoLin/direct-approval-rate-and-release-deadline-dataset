DESCRIPTION

Track a histogram counter by object size.

This is a counter and not a gauge, so it is used to accurately show
growth by value size.  It does not give you any idea what you
currently have stored, just what your object patterns look like.
Because it's a counter, you can measure how the object sizes change
over time, even in very small time windows.

Example stat capture:

 item_alloc_sizes (102920 total)
    0 - 1         : (  0.01%)    10
    1 - 2         : (  0.02%)     8
    2 - 4         : (  0.04%)    20
    4 - 8         : (  0.08%)    44
    8 - 16        : (  0.16%)    82
    16 - 32       : (  0.33%)   178
    32 - 64       : (  0.66%)   341
    64 - 128      : (  1.30%)   656
    128 - 256     : (  2.71%)  1455
