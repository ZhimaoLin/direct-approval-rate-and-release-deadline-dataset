DESCRIPTION

Track a histogram counter by object size.

This is a counter and not a gauge, so it is used to accurately show
growth by value size.  It does not give you any idea what you
currently have stored, just what your object patterns look like.
Because it's a counter, you can measure how the object sizes change
over time, even in very small time windows.

Example stat capture:

 item_alloc_sizes (102920 total)
    0 - 1         : (  0.01%)    10
    1 - 2         : (  0.02%)     8
    2 - 4         : (  0.04%)    20
    4 - 8         : (  0.08%)    44
    8 - 16        : (  0.16%)    82
    16 - 32       : (  0.33%)   178
    32 - 64       : (  0.66%)   341
    64 - 128      : (  1.30%)   656
    128 - 256     : (  2.71%)  1455
    256 - 512     : (  6.22%)  3609 #
    512 - 1KB     : ( 16.71%) 10791 ####
    1KB - 2KB     : ( 35.54%) 19384 ########
    2KB - 4KB     : ( 68.34%) 33759 ##############

Patch Set 2:

There are a few things I don't like about this, but didn't want to make major changes to fit them in.

Primarily, I don't think the object alloc histo belongs int he timings stats.  It's just easy to do that since it's expecting histos and knows how to display them.  That makes this the second none-time timings stat I've added.  We should lay this out a bit differently.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

I worked on a couple of customer issues where this sizing histogram would be very useful. Thanks for adding this.
