DESCRIPTION

MB-9372: Store keys of in-memory HashTable sorted

Store the keys of same in-memory HashTable sorted by size
in descending order.
This makes the unlocked_find faster since look-ups can
return eary when it finds a larger key than largest known

While inserting typically the load starts with smaller keys
and gradually goes to larger ones. Thus if we return early
when searching for larger keys it makes the lock contention
smaller thus speeding up overall Couchbase Server operation
