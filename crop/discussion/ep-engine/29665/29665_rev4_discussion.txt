DESCRIPTION

MB-9373: Store keys of in-memory HashTable sorted

Store the keys of same in-memory HashTable bucket
sorted in descending order of key size.
This reduces the number of memcmp operations and 
makes the unlocked_find much faster since a serial scan 
is eliminated when a larger key is added.

While inserting typically the load starts with smaller keys
and gradually goes to larger ones. Thus if we return early
when searching for larger keys it makes the lock contention
smaller thus speeding up overall Couchbase Server operation.

Did not find any regression and it shows good improvement in
local testing.
