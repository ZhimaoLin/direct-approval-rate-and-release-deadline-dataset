DESCRIPTION

MB-9373: Store keys of in-memory HashTable sorted

Store the keys of same in-memory HashTable bucket
sorted in descending order of key size.
This reduces the number of memcmp operations and 
makes the unlocked_find much faster since a serial scan 
is eliminated when a larger key is added.

While inserting typically the load starts with smaller keys
and gradually goes to larger ones. Thus if we return early
when searching for larger keys it makes the lock contention
smaller thus speeding up overall Couchbase Server operation.

Did not find any regression and it shows good improvement in
local testing.

Sundar,

I would not like to submit this change for the master branch at this time. If we have lots of kv use cases that have different key lengths, then we should think about this kind of optimization later.

Line:162, src/stored-value.h -> In many kv use cases, all the keys are usually in the same length, which means that we won't get much benefits from this optimization.

Line:1205, src/stored-value.h -> We don't use goto in our code base. I know it's arguable point, but I rather would like to avoid it.

Hi Chiyoung, I agree with you at this point. I have been testing a lot recently but this change has not yet demonstrated any huge performance improvements in the default case. 
So I am not going to merge this for now - but I would like to keep it in Jasmin Rangel for a few more days if possible.
thanks

Sundar,

Do you still need this change? I think we know the issue and need to address it in a different way.

Abandoned

Change not needed - problem lies elsewhere.
