DESCRIPTION

MB-11621: Grab streamMutex before reconnecting stream during rollback

When we reconnect a stream we notify the memcached layer that the
stream has been reconnected. The notification mecachism in the
consumer assumes that we already are holding the stream lock so we
need to make sure we grab it in order to avoid a race condition we
modifying the ready queue.

Also note that the opaqueMap relies on the streamMutex which is why
we grab it where we do.
