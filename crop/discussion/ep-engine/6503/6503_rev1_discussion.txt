DESCRIPTION

TAP empty() should consider the number of remaining bg fetch items

The number of remaining items for background fetch should be
considered in TAP empty() instead of isPendingBackfill().
TAP's isPendingBackfill() simply indicates if the backfill thread
completes dumping all items into the queue.
