Line:31, item_pager.hh -> As we have only two phases, can we simplify this config class? Probably, we don't need to have paging config class anymore. We can maintain the bool variable inside ItemPager class, which indicates if the current phase is "unreferenced" or "random".

Line:170, item_pager.cc -> This variable name and type is still confusing. Can we simply change it to "bool randomEvict". Btw, as we discussed, let's keep PagingConfig class for now.
