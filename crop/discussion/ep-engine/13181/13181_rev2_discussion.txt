DESCRIPTION

cbrestore multithreading fix.

The current code base does not actually propagate the value assigned
to opts.threads (-t). Even the DEFAULT_THREADS is also not
propagated. The script "cbrestore" always create one thread instance
for worker function. As a result, it can restore only upto 700
items/sec.

This bug fix is tested in our production platform and we've managed to
restore db files at 3.5k to 5k items/sec on each node running
cbrestore process to all nodes in parallel. For nine node-cluster, we
were able to restore at 30k to 36k items/sec. At 100 million items, we
were able to restore it within an hour.

opts.threads is not properly propagated to worker threads instantiation.

Previously, there's only one thread worker will be instantiated even
if the DEFAULT_THREADS is 4.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(1 inline comment)

I think this mostly looks right, but the abs() thing confuses me a bit.  It seems like it might cover up a bug or something.

Line:220, management/cbrestore -> It's unclear what the purpose of abs() is here.
