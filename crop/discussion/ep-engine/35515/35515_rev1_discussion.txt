DESCRIPTION

MB-10411: Don't include the start seqno in the backfill case

The stream request response shouldn't contain the seq number with
which it was started. This is handled correctly when the mutations
are already part of the checkpoint but wasn't handled in the case
of backfill. An assumption that is being made is if the start
sequence number happens to be 1, all the mutations are requested
and thus include sequence number 1 in the response as well.

This looks good. I just added a few comments. I'll show you what you need to do in order to test the rest of this stuff when you get back from lunch.

Line:495, src/upr-stream.cc -> We don't actually use sequence number 0 so I think we should just be able to set the backfill start seqno to lastReadSeqno + 1

Line:496, src/upr-stream.cc -> Please remove this tab.

Line:501, src/upr-stream.cc -> If what I proposed above works then I we can remove this if statement.

Added a fresh review for this at http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/35578 as I had lost the original commit during a Jadyn Serrano. Comments for this review have been addressed in the new review.
