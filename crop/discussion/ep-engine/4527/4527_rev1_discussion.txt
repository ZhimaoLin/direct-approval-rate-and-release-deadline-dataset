Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:1492, ep.cc -> We should probably just push the whole QueuedItem in, since the key isn't enough to uniquely identify the item (also needs vbucket, etc...)

Line:1500, ep.cc -> Perhaps we should just move the uncommitted list into the transaction context and let it track these things and have callbacks from there.
