DESCRIPTION

Use ep_real_time() in checking the time bound on a checkpoint.

ep_current_time doesn't return the relative time correctly while
initializing the ep_engine instance and activating vbuckets and their
checkpoints. ep_real_time doesn't invoke any sys call and is actually
as efficient as ep_current_time. We will fix the ep_current_time
issue during the warmup time as a separate change.
