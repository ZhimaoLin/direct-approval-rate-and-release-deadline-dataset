DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-17517: Check for and disard an invalid max_cas in _local/vbstate

If there is an invalid max CAS value on disk (in _local/vbstate),
discard it (resetting it to zero). Instead will need to rebuild the
max CAS value from the items we load from the file.

Dave - what happens for folks using full eviction that don't read all the metadata before serving requests? Will max_cas be zero at the time we decide to do our first set?

Yes - It'll be whatever it would have been after a 2/3.x -> 4.x upgrade.

Line:2073, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> wrap earlier?

Line:2078, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> why do you need to format this instead of just typing -1 ;-)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> missing c

This commit has already gone into sherlock (Chiyoung merged it yesterday), so while I /could/ change this backport I'd rather keep it as close to the original to simplify maintenance etc.
