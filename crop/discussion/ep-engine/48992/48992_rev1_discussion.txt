Looks good, but ew will need to make a toy build and do some testing before we merge this. Also, we shouldn't merge this until after the developer preview is finished.

Line:3637, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't like the fact that the function already has too many parameters. We shouldn't keep adding new parameters to this function, which makes it inconvenient to use this function. We need to define a structure that has these variables instead. Let's address this as a separate commit.

Line:511, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Seems like this is the same as the one that you added to backfillReceived function. Please make a separate function that creates ExtendedMetaData instance.
