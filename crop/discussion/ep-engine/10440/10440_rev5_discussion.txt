Line:37, ep.cc -> Please move this into command_ids where you define the package struct (and give it a more "unique" name).. clients of the struct may also need this constant to know the bit we're tNathalie Landrying about.

Line:1329, ep.cc -> THis assumes that you passed in a flag that was originially initialized with 0? is thats intended?? I would have expected it to unconditionally set the value ??

Line:483, ep.hh -> missing description.
