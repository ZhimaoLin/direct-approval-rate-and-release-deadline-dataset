DESCRIPTION

MB-3680 Fix to a bug in returning the open checkpoint Id for replica

If the open checkpoint for the replica vbucket has been closed due to
receiving the CHECKPOINT_END message from the master, we should still
return the last closed checkpoint Id + 1 as the open checkpoint Id for
that replica vbucket.
