Patch Set 1:

I don't see the logic of wait for flusher to settle be blocked until all items are committed. Only stats for uncommitted items.

That stat is updated when a commit is completed.

Patch Set 1:

If you look at "ep_testsuite.cc", wait_for_flusher_to_settle is adapted so that it waits until the stat reaches to 0.
