DESCRIPTION

Remove ConnHandlerDelete/Mutate and use the ConnHandler API's

This change moves the tap mutation and deletion API's to the
TapConsumer class. It also removes code that was used for 1.x
compatibility. This means that we now expect that all tap
messages contain a meta data section.

Line:2406, src/ep_engine.cc -> Just for clarification, we don't plan to support the online upgrade from 1.8.x to 3.0?

Line:2458, src/ep_engine.cc -> Seems too many parameters. It is better to create "Item" instance and pass it to the function along with other parameters. I know that it also affects the UPR as well. We may need to address it in a separate commit later.
