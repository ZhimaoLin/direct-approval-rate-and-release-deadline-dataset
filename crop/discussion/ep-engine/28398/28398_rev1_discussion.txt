DESCRIPTION

MB-8825 Use seq num and cas only for delete conflict resolution

Recently, we decided to use an expiration field for tombstone
purging, which can break the conflict resolution for the case
where the source and destination have the same seq number and
cas value. To resolve this issue, the change allow us to use
seq number and cas value only for delete conflict resolutions.
