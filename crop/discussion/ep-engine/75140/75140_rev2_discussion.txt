DESCRIPTION

Unit tests: Add TimeTraveller helper class

Add TimeTraveller - a class which moves time forward when created by the
given amount, and upon destruction returns time to where it was.

Allows tests to manipulate server time, but need to ensure any
adjustments are restored so as to not affect other later tests.
