DESCRIPTION

MB-11661 Move cursor to the next checkpoint if reached to the end

If a cursor is already reached to the end of its current
checkpoint, then the cursor can be moved to the next checkpoint.
In this way, a checkpoint can be immediately freed from memory
if the checkpoint doesn't have any cursors.
