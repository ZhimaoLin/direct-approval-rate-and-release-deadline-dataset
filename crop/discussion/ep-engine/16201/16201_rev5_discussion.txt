DESCRIPTION

MB-5297 Don't schedule cascading backfill for a vbucket

When a given vbucket is reset by the new backfill stream from
its master, we should not schedule the cascading backfill
because the cluster manager will re-establish TAP connections
to schedule the cascading backfill to another slave.
