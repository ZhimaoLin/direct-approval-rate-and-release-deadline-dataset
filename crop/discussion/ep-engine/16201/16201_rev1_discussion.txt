DESCRIPTION

MB-5297 Disconnect TAP producers whose vbuckets are backfilled.

If a given vbucket is reset by receiving the new backfill stream
from its master, we should close all the TAP producers that
replicate that vbucket to another slave. The cluster manager will
re-establish the TAP connections without including that vbucket.
