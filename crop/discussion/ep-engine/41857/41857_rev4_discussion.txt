Line:65, src/bloomfilter.h -> This is inefficient. A bool by default is one byte and I'm pretty sure you only need a bit to hold each of these. You can reduce your memory usage by at least 8x by using a different structure. Take a look at the c++ standard lib bitset structure.

Line:29, src/murmurhash3.cc -> tab

Line:28, src/bloomfilter.cc -> You should initialize all variables. (filterSize, noOfHashes)

Line:65, src/bloomfilter.h -> I don't think bitset allows dynamic resizing, I'll look around though.

Line:65, src/bloomfilter.h -> Note that the STL provides a specialisation of std::vector for <bool> which uses 1 bit per element: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector_bool
