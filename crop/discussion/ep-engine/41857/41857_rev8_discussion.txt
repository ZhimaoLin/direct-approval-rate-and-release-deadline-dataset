Line:63, src/bloomfilter.cc -> This function doesn't look clear to me. Why do we need to have bool parameter to set the bloom filter state? The parameter should be the enum bloom filter state that you want to set. You may need to use a state machine instead. This will also make enable() unnecessary.

Line:82, src/bloomfilter.cc -> Please use switch for this. You can address it in a separate commit.

Line:94, src/bloomfilter.cc -> Please remove this comment. This function can be invoked by any modules  and shouldn't mention the restriction.
