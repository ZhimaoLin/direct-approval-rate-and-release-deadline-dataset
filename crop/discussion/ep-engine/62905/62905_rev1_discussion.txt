DESCRIPTION

MB-19204: hash_table_test: Fix TSan issues

Fix issues with hash_table_test on 3.x:

* The default number of HashTable locks (193) causes problems for
  ThreadSanitizer as it exceeds the maximum number of acquired locks
  it can track. Given that the tests where we do not already set the
  lock count are single-threaded, change these to have 1 lock.

* Remove alarm() calls - the tests take longer when run under TSan,
  and given that CTest already enforeces a test-level timeout these
  are redundent inside the test functions.

* Fix data race on AccessGenerator::size test harness.
