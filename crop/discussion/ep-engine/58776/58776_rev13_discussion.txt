DESCRIPTION

Update CMakeLists to run tests in full eviction mode

Also feed dbname information along with the eviction mode
to support the scenario where tests are run in the value-
only eviction mode and the full eviction mode in parallel.

Custom targets:
- engine-tests...................testsuite, value-only eviction
- basic-tests....................testsuite_basic, value-only eviction
- test-perfsuite.................perfsuite, value-only eviction
- full-eviction-tests............testsuite, full eviction
- full-eviction-basic............testsuite_basic, full eviction
- test-full-eviction-perfsuite...perfsuite, full eviction

Line:212, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> This is a bit hacky - we shouldn't be hardcoding test names in common code.

A better way to handle all this would be to add the option to *append* a suffix to the standard dbname - i.e. all your value / full eviction CMakeTests would just specify a "_ve" / "_fe" db_name_suffix parameter, which is added to the normal dbname. This would permit any existing tests which change the dbname (e.g. the whitespace test" to work in both cases.

Line:408, CMakeLists.txt -> "ve" is a bit ambiguous to me - could be "negative" tests...? Given this isn't something a human ever has to type, just use the full name "value_only_evict_test" or similar.

Line:412, CMakeLists.txt -> I'm not a big fan of all these custom targets. They add code duplication, and as Daniel discovered the other day unless you are careful you need to escape the semicolon in the engine config string.

Given you can happily run `ctest -R <test_name>` to run a specific test, I don't see what value these custom targets add.

(Note: The -R is a regex, so you can specify multiple tests if you wish)

(Note 2: You can use the `-N` parameter to ctest to list all test names it knows about if you need to check a name).

Line:428, CMakeLists.txt -> Ditto

Line:466, CMakeLists.txt -> Is this target even in use these days? The commit-validation scripts use the standard CTest 'dashboard' `ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck`, which can run all tests under Valgrind (and even creates all the correct output files).

I suggest we drop this custom target, or at the very least don't add another one to it in this patch (and clean up in subsequent patch).

Line:31, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Please revert this - it's required by the whitespace test in here.

Line:212, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> Hmm, wouldn't that mean we'll need to add a new parameter to configuration.json?

Line:408, CMakeLists.txt -> All right.

Line:412, CMakeLists.txt -> I'll get rid of the custom targets.

Line:466, CMakeLists.txt -> Done

Line:212, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> Or perhaps set in engine_testapp when we process test.cfg and default_cfg, which by the way I don't think would be a nice place to append dbnames.
