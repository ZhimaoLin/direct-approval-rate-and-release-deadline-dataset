Chiyoung,

This is what I had in mind for separating our tests from our api calls. ep_testapi.h has a nice view of all of the different api calls you can make without having to search all over our current ep_testsuite.h. Please review this file and comment on the general direction. If this looks like a good idea then I will move the other api calls into this file an post it for review.

It looks great overall. As you mentioned, there are lots of engine API functions in ep_testsuite.cc. Please move them to the new separate module.
