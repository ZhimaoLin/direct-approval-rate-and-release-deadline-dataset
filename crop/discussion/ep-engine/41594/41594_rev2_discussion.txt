Line:955, src/stored-value.h -> Is this correct? We need to understand if "cas" and "itm.getCas()" are different or always same.

Line:955, src/stored-value.h -> In the case of setWithMeta itm.getCas() contains the CAS of the incoming mutation whereas the CAS that was passed into the function always happened to the same as the CAS of the already existing item. My best guess of why this was done could be to bypass the INVALID_CAS condition that setWithMeta will throw because of a different CAS. But since the CAS values are the same, we will always unlock a locked item and then update it which doesn't seem to be desirable behavior.
