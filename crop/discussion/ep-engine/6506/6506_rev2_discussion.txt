DESCRIPTION

Rename TAP getBacklogSize() to getBackfillRemaining()

As we don't interleave backfill items with live mutations that do
not require any background fetches due to checkpoint support,
it makes more sense to rename TAP getBacklogSize() to
getBackfillRemaining().

We will provide a separate stat representing the number of total
backlogs that is equal to getBackfillRemaining() +
getRemainingOnCheckpoints().
