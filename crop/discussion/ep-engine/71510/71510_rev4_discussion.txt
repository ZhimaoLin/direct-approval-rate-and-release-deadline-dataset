DESCRIPTION

MB-22159: Use unsigned type for Task histograms

There is a potential out_of_range exception thrown, causing tests
attempting to parse the result to fail if a request is made for
runtimes or scheduler stats and a task has zero duration (or wait
time).

This should instead be changed to a unsigned type.

Note: This only affects tests, product should not be affected.
