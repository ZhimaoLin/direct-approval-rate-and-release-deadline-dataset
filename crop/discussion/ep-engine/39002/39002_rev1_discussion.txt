DESCRIPTION

MB-11387: Handle backfill condition where end_seqno_ is equal to curChkSeqno

There is a possibility that the when the end_seqno_ is the same as the current
checkpoint seqno, the flusher has only persisted items till end_seqno_ - 1.
Given that the item that has curChkSeqno will be streamed from memory anyways,
the backfill can just be scheduled to curChkSeqno - 1. This will ensure that
the backfill task is not blocked until the item with end_seqno_ is flushed to disk.

Sriram,

Did you verify your fix? I need to make sure that this should be included in the beta release or not.

make engine-tests and make simple-test passed. When Pavel runs his test with this fix, only then we can be sure if this resolves the performance bottleneck.
