DESCRIPTION

MB-4576 Don't create a new checkpoint on active vbuckets via TAP

If TAP producer does not support checkpoint operations (e.g.,
membase 1.6.5.x) and replicates items to active vbuckets on the
1.7.x slave node, checkpoint creation on the 1.7.x slave node
should be enabled by setting an engine parameter
'inconsistent_slave_chk' to false.
