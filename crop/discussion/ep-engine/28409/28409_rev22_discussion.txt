DESCRIPTION

CBD-1051 Global IO Manager Common Thread Pool

This changes enhances the global IO manager by introducing the
common shared thread pool and maintaining a global disk read
queue and a write queue per bucket priority (i.e., High, Medium,
Low).

Threads basically visit any disk read or write queues if there
are any IO tasks waiting in the queues. We also allocate more
threads to the buckets that have higher prioirties, but also
prevent the starvation from occuring in the low priority buckets.

Patch Set 22:

Sundar,

I removed the vbucket snapshot changes that you made. As I commented in your change, we still need to use the existing vbucket state snapshot implementation. We can make a separate commit for further optimizations. We shouldn't do too many different things within a single commit.

Please review my last changeset and discuss it more if you want.
Thanks,
