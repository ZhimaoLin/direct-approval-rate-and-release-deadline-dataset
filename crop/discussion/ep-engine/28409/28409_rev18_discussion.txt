(6 comments)

Line:1184, src/ep_engine.cc -> Seems like you forgot to remove those debug stmts.

Line:110, src/flusher.h -> As we have a separate lock per shard, I'm not sure if we need this atomic variable anymore.

Line:718, src/ep.cc -> I rather rename this macro to "ALL_SHARD_VBUCKETS"

Line:760, src/ep.cc -> Can we de-duplicate a single vbucket snapshot task as well?

Line:777, src/ep.cc -> The same comment as above.

Line:876, src/ep.cc -> Per our discussion, please do the deduplication of shard snapshot tasks.
