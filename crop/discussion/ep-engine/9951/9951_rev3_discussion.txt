DESCRIPTION

Added basic observe command hooks and tests

Ep-engine will correctly parse and respond to observe and
unobserve commands and has basic testing functionality to
check that these new commands work correctly. Note that in
this change ep-engine always returns success when it sees
either an observe or unobserve command.

Line:431, ep_testsuite.cc -> Might be interesting to call observe twice!  That'd be more than a basic_observe I guess.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)



Line:431, ep_testsuite.cc -> All of this stuff is going to be evolving so this test will become increasingly complex in order to provide good testing for the observe command. For the present code though I think this is sufficient.
