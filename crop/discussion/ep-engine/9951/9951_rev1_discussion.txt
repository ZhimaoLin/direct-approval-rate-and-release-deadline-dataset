DESCRIPTION

Added basic observe command hooks and tests

Ep-engine will correctly parse and respond to observe and
unobserve commands and has basic testing functionality to
check that these new commands work correctly. Note that in
this change ep-engine always returns success when it sees
either an observe or unobserve command.

Line:487, ep_engine.h -> I thought the observe command doesn't take an expiration value any more, and expiration is part of the separate, explicit collection creation command?

Or, did you decide to go back to implicit collection creation?

In revisiting the protocol spec, I see the first Overview / example section tNathalie Landrys about a create collection command, but that command isn't specified later.  So the protocol spec needs another pass to be consistent with whatever way you're going.

Line:487, ep_engine.h -> I forgot to delete that on my last pass of the documentation. It's gone now. The code is correct. Since we will broadcast all observe commands there is no need for a create command.

Line:199, command_ids.h -> Even though it looks like a touch command, I think it'd be better to have it explicitly separate and not "depend on" the touch definition.

Line:199, command_ids.h -> This is how we did getl. I'm leaving it up to a vote by the other reviewers since I'm okay either way.
