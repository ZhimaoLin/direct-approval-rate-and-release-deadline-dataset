DESCRIPTION

Added basic observe command hooks and tests

Ep-engine will correctly parse and respond to observe and
unobserve commands and has basic testing functionality to
check that these new commands work correctly. Note that in
this change ep-engine always returns success when it sees
either an observe or unobserve command.
