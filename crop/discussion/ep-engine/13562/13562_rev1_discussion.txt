DESCRIPTION

MB-4828 Check backfill completion in TapProducer::nextFgFetched()

As backfill is performed by the separate dispatcher thread and
replication/takeover is performed by the memcached tap thread,
the tap thread should check the backfill completion before
poping the next item from the queue.
