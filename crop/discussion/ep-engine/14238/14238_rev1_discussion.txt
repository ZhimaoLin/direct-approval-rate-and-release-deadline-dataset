Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:2329, ep.cc -> Two comments here:
1) I thought that we didn't write temporary items into disk. If so, we then don''t need to delete them from disk here.
2) v->isTemItem() should be invoked before releasing the lock lh.unlock()

Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)



Line:2329, ep.cc -> 1) We may have to "delete" a temporary item to the disk in the following case: a delete_with_meta command is issued on a key that's either non-existent or it was previously deleted. In either case, we need to update Couch with the winning data center's meta info (specified in the delete-with-meta command). This can be easily achieved by introducing a delete mutation on the temporary item (which must have been created by a prior get_meta command) and placing it on the checkpoint queue for local persistence and tap replication. Does this make sense? I'll also add some more clarifying comments to the code.

2) Thanks for pointing this out. Will fix and upload a new patch.
