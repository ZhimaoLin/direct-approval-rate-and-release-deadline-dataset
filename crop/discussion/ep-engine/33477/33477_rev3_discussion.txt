DESCRIPTION

Return ENGINE_WANT_MORE when upr step should be called again

When the engine wants the memcached layer to call the step function
again then we should return ENGINE_WANT_MORE. For example, this
error code should be returned when the engine has more messages that
are ready to be written to the wire. If the engine does not have any
more messages to send then we should return ENGINE_SUCCESS. This will
cause the memcached layer to stop calling the step function. When
more messages do become ready then we need to notify the memcached
layer that more messages are ready.

There is a corresponding change in the memcached layer that allows us
to use these two error codes. This change corrects the engine code to
return the proper error codes when we merge the memcached change. A
later change will allow us to get the full behavior for pausing and
resuming the calling of the step function.

Line:266, src/upr-consumer.cc -> so ENGINE_SUCCESS will never be returned for step()? same goes for the producer side?

Line:266, src/upr-consumer.cc -> In the future it will be returned, but we need to implement the pausing first.

Patch Set 3:

This is a pre-existing error code. I don't think changing it is an option.

Line:234, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Same comment as the one that I put in the producer side.

Line:114, src/upr-producer.cc -> "ENGINE_SUCCESS"?  I'm not sure why we should return WANT_MORE even if the queue is empty. Do you plan to make a separate change to determine if there are any messages to be grabbed?

Line:114, src/upr-producer.cc -> I plan on making a separate change. When the connection pausing is completed this will return ENGINE_SUCCESS.
