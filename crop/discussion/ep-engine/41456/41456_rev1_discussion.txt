DESCRIPTION

Adding config listeners to checkpoint config shouldn't be static

Making this function static means that applying config changes will
cause all buckets to be changed instead of only the bucket the
changes were applied to.

Line:700, src/checkpoint.h -> This static function doesn't enforce the configs across all the buckets. If you look at the function implementation, it adds the config listeners to the corresponding engine's checkpoint config.
