DESCRIPTION

MB-20054: Regression test - bucket is deleted with DCPBackfill running

Regression test for MB-20054 - the following abort is encountered when
a DCPBackfill task is still running when a bucket is deleted:

    Assertion failed: (engine), function verifyEngine, file
    ep-engine/src/objectregistry.cc, line 58.

This issue occurs because the DCPBackfill object (and associated
objects ActiveStream and importantly ActiveStreams' readyQ of Items)
is not deleted earlier in the shutdown sequence (via EvpDestroy), as
we use ref-counted pointers for it and there is a still an outstanding
reference by the AuxIO Thread which is running the task. Hence the
DCPBackfill object is only deleted when we finally unregister the
deleted bucket from the shared ExecutorPool - see the following
backtrace:

To actually reproduce the issue is somewhat involved - we need to
orchestrate the world such that we delete the engine while a
DCPBackfill task is still running. We spin up a separate thread which
will run the DCPBackfill task concurrently with destroy - specifically
DCPBackfill must start running (and add items to the readyQ) before
destroy(), it must then continue running (stop after) _stopTaskGroup
is invoked.  To achieve this we use a couple of condition variables to
synchronise between the two threads - the timeline needs to look like:

    auxIO thread:  [------- DCPBackfill ----------]
     main thread:      [--destroy()--]       [ExecutorPool::_stopTaskGroup]
