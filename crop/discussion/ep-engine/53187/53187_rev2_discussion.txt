DESCRIPTION

[Unittest] Fix sporadic failure in test_item_pager

This sporadic failure is because item pager doesn't
run due to inadequate memory pressure. Tweek the
test case so that the item pager is forced to run
if it hasn't already. This can be acheived by setting
mem_high_wat to a value less than mem_used.

Line:11646, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't understand exactly why we need to adjust high/low watermark here. If we receive TMP_FAIL above, then we expect the item pager to be scheduled at least once.

Which line this test failed at?

Line:11646, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> TMP_FAIL would wake up the item pager, but what I noticed was mem_used dropped to slightly lower than the mem_high_wat (once flusher settled) - before the pager ran sometimes, causing the pager to not run at all. In that scenario this test fails at line 11672 below:

wait_for_stat_change(h, h1, "ep_num_non_resident", 0);

Line:11640, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Then, let's set high and low watermark to 85% and 75% of mem_used, respectively:

std::to_string(mem_used * 0.85).c_str();
