DESCRIPTION

[Unittest] Fix sporadic failure in test_item_pager

This sporadic failure is because item pager doesn't
run due to inadequate memory pressure. Tweek the
test case so that the item pager is forced to run
if it hasn't already. This can be acheived by setting
mem_high_wat to a value less than mem_used.
