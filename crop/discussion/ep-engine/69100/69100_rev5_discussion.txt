DESCRIPTION

MB-20746: Delete bloom filter only if temporary filter is created

During compaction, a temporary filter is only created in the
bloom filter callback function. There is a possibility that this
function will not get invoked if there is no data present during
compaction. So, before swapping the filter, ensure that a temporary
filter is created before deleting the original filter.

Line:1069, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Would be preferable to do this at the unit-test level (we shouldn't need to involve any code other than the VBucket class to test this).

Line:1069, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Wouldn't we still need to add data to the vbucket to verify that the bloom filter is still functional and the background fetches don't happen? The current test reproduces the exact scenario that is being reported.

Line:1069, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I agree the current test "works", but it's more complicated than necessary - it create a full EPEngine with background tasks, Shards, a storage layer etc when the actual bug constrained to a single class breaking an invariant - that after calling VBucket::swapFilter with a null temp filter there should be a bloom filter present.

If you instead create a (class-level) unit test, we have a much more precise, simple test which will be easier to maintain and keep working.

I believe the unit test should be as simple as (something like):

 VBucket vb(0, vbucket_state_active, ...);
 vb.createFilter(1, 1.0);
 // Check preconditions
 ASSERT_FALSE(vb.isTempFilterAvailable());
 ASSERT_NE("doesn't exist", vb.getFilterStatusString());

 // Regression test:
 vb.swapFilter();
 EXPECT_NE("doesn't exist", vb.getFilterStatusString());
