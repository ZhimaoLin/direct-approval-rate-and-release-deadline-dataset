DESCRIPTION

MB-11410: Use last persisted seqno as end seqno for disk only upr stream

This will allow upr streams to function properly when a consumer
requests a disk only snapshot and the flusher is paused. Note that
this is also more correct in terms of what the disk only stream is
going to send anyways.
