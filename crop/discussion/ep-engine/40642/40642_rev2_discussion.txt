DESCRIPTION

MB-11958: Make sure mutations and snapshot ranges are updated together

There is a race condition where an items seqno is updated and the
flusher runs and persists both the seqno and old snapshot range
before the new snapshot range can be updated.

Line:2172, src/tapconnection.cc -> I'm not sure if we really need to synchronize this for TAP as we alway set the same value to snapshot_start and snapshot_end. We should avoid grabbing a lock every mutation if possible.
