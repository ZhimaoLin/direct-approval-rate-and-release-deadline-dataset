Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

This broke a bunch of the pyupr tests because the upr thread was never woken back up when new mutations became available. It's blocking people who are developing upr consumers so I am just going to revert it for now. I'll fix up the change and add it back to review soon.
