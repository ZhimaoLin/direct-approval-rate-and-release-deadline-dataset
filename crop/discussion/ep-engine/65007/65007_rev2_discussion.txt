DESCRIPTION

MB-19719: Cleanup reading of vBucket stats when couchstore file doesn't exist.

This partially reverts commit 9093bad3061648184101cae992403cb468102d75
- the test improvements have been kept. It also reverts commit
06bf584672d7b1c4f6af2cb7811bad18e86b5729.

This removes the incomplete / unnecessary checks on vbucket files
existing, and simply relies on the getNumPersistedDeletes() method
throwing an exception if it fails.
