DESCRIPTION

AllocHooks: Switch to newer AllocHooks:: functions

Memory allocator hooks are exposed via a AllocHooks class, which was
added during the cbmalloc functionality. To assist in migration,
mc_XXX functions were kept around which called down to the equivient
mc_XXX function. Complete migration to the new AllocHooks::XXX static
functions, which will allow the compatibility functions to be deleted.
