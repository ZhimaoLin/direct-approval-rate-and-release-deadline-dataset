DESCRIPTION

Identify backfill completion for the client with no ACK support.

If the TAP client with no ACK support connects to the server, the
server still should identify backfill completion and then send
any live mutations from the checkpoint to the client. From 1.7,
we don't allow backfill to be interleaved with live mutations.

Patch Set 1:

Mike,

This change allows your TAP client to not specify "ACK" connection flag for dump operation.

But, I think your TAP client should use "ACK" flag to make sure that all the items are received from the server.

Patch Set 1:

I am already able to do dump correctly without specifying the ack flag.
