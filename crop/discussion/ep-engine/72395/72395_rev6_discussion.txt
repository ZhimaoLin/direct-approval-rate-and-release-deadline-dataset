Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Code looks good, couple of documentation / style comments.

Line:69, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Nit: Good practice to make it explicit where something happens (e.g. "... as we clean it up at the end of this method in clearItems()"). 

The reason for this is that someone might add new code to the end of this method, or maybe refactor this paragraph of code into a new method, and people don't always update comments close-by.

Line:24, src/kvstore.h -> I think you need to work on your alphabet ;)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should have a hyphen between the project (MB) and the number so Jira links correctly.
