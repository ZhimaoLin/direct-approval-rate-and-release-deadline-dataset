DESCRIPTION

Rollback correctly when requested to mid of an unpersisted snapshot

When the rollback request intends to have a rollback to a point in
an unpersisted snapshot, we must drop all unpersisted checkpoint
items correctly.

We currently always rollback to a point which is persisted on disk.
Hence we must drop all checkpoint items, irrespective of whether
they are part of a full snapshot or partial snapshot.
