DESCRIPTION

MB-19302 Use visible logging on couchstore_open_local_document error

This change ensures that CouchKVStore::readVBState will log an
error at a default visible level in the event that
couchstore_open_local_document fails. In addition any serious error
(i.e. any not DOC_NOT_FOUND) will be logged at WARNING.
