DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Persist namespace config option

Collections will rely on the ability to add system keys to the
datastore and that requires the storing (and restoring) of the
namespace byte, which is byte 0 of the document key.

This config switch should be viewed as temporary whilst
collections is not complete or production ready.
