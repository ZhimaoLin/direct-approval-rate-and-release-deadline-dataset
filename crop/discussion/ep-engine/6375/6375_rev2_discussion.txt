DESCRIPTION

Do not schedule disk flush_all task if it is already queued.

Disk flush_all can be scheduled mutiple times within a very
short period on a given node, if a client issues it multiple times
or TAP_FLUSH is received from other nodes in the cluster.

In this case, we only need to reset the memory hashtable, and do
not need to schedule the disk flush_all if it's been already
scheduled.
