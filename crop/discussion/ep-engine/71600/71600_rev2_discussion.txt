DESCRIPTION

MB-22194: Fix data race on VBucketMemoryDeletionTask::vbucket

In VBucketMemoryDeletionTask::getDescription() the ref-counted pointer
`vbucket` can be made invalid (null) just after a check has been made
on it's correctness, if the ::run() method is executing in another
thread and it has just called vbucket.reset().

Fix to remove any possibility of concurrent access - calculate the
description once in the object constructor.
