Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Line:125, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Are we going to add all the backfill items to the checkpoint queue? If so, my concern is that it will cause checkpoint inconsistency and memory overhead issues.

Line:127, src/upr-consumer.cc -> vb->getHighSeqno() will always return zero on replica vbucket. Please look at my comment in checkpoint.cc

Line:776, src/checkpoint.cc -> If genSeqno is false, shouldn't we update "lastBySeqNo" to the value retrieved from the queued_item instance?

Line:125, src/upr-consumer.cc -> At the moment upr doesn't have any way of communicating whether a snapshot is from disk or memory (We can change this though). I think since we are moving to star replication that this we may be able to avoid having to deal with this inconsistency, but I could be wrong. Let's discuss more offline to find the best solution.

Line:127, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Fixed in checkpoint.cc

Line:776, src/checkpoint.cc -> Done

Line:125, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Not sure if I understand your comments here. If we push all backfill items into a checkpoint queue, it will cause checkpoint inconsistency and possibly memory bloating issues.
