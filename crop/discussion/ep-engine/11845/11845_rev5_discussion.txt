DESCRIPTION

Revert commit f42d609830b17ecc7c69cbf531c33ce6c9ab21d9

This changeset reverts back the mc-engine.cc changes of
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#change,10434

delete-with-meta is not yet implemented in mccouch and as such will
cause errors as was discovered with the view tests suite. Until then,
just issue deleteq for deletions.
