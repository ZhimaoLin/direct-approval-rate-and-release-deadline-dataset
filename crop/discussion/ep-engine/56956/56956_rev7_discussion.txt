DESCRIPTION

Return NOT_MY_VBUCKET from vbucket seq stats APIs for dead vbucket

We should not return vbucket seq stats if a vbucket is in a dead state.
In that case, NOT_MY_VBUCKET needs to be returned.

This is essentially a "-2" - the locking code as written doesn't work :(

Line:4454, src/ep_engine.cc -> This doesn't do what you think - you're creating a ReaderLockHolder and then immediately deleting it- i.e you have no variable to tie the lifetime of the temporary to. 

(Moreover when you do get this working, you should release the lock asap - i.e. create a new scope to acquire the lock and do the state_dead check in).

Line:4481, src/ep_engine.cc -> Same comments here.

Line:4871, src/ep_engine.cc -> And again.

Line:4454, src/ep_engine.cc -> Will fix this issue once we investigate the thread sanitizer warnings. However, I don't think we should release the lock right after checking the state in line 4455 because we should return the seq stats for a given vbucket while the state is still not in dead state.
