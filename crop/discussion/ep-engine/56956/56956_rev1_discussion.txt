DESCRIPTION

Return NOT_MY_VBUCKET for vbucket in dead state

We should not process operations if the state of the vbucket is dead.
In that case, NOT_MY_VBUCKET needs to be returned.

Line:4450, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think we should check the vbucket state by grabbing the reader-writer lock in a vbucket instance:

ReaderLockHolder(vb->getStateLock());
if (vb->getState() == vbucket_state_dead) {
        return ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET;
}

Please refer to EPStore::set()

Line:4851, src/ep_engine.cc -> Same as above comment
