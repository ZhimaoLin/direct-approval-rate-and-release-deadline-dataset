DESCRIPTION

MB-19183: Clean-up connection handlers in DCP tests

Disconnect the connection handler cleanly instead of
just calling reset.

This results in the mock_cookie_release being called
which will free the cookie.  Therefore we do not
need to explictly delete the cookie at the end of
each test.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

Does this also affect watson? If so we should fix it there, given (a) watson branch is likely to be around for a while (and we don't want to have false failures there), and (b) this is a test-only change so it's essentially zero-risk.
