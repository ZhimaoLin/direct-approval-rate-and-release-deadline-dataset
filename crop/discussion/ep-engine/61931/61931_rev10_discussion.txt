Thanks Daniel, looks good to me.

Line:1011, src/connmap.cc -> Indentation mistake.

Daniel,

Please correct me if my comment regarding a connection management is no longer true.

Line:937, src/connmap.cc -> If the existing consumer with the same name is already in disconnect state and waiting for cleanup by the connection manager task, then we should allow the creation with the same name.

However, if the disconnected consumer is always moved from 'all' list to 'dead' list, which means that 'all' list always maintains the active connections, then we don't need to worry about the case that I mentioned above.

Line:1002, src/connmap.cc -> Same comment as above

Line:937, src/connmap.cc -> Hi Chiyoung,

The problem with the existing code is that in this function we remove it from the "all" list and the "map_" map so we no longer have any link to the connection.  It has not yet been added to the dead connections - and no longer can.  (We add to the deadConnections list in the disconnect_UNLOCKED function.  It is only added to the deadConnections list if it can be found in the "map_" map.  And its not in "map_" because we overwrote the map entry.)

The very original code was to call disconnect_UNLOCKED in this newConsumer function - however this resulted in a race condition, which was addressed by removing the call to disconnect_UNLOCKED.  See MB-11583.  However this resulted in the issue we are now seeing where connections are not getting cleaned up.

I believe the cleanest solution is to not permit connections of the same name or cookie, whilst the are not cleaned-up.  The XDCR team are happy to have this constraint in place.

Line:937, src/connmap.cc -> Daniel, thanks for detailed good analysis. Now, I understand what went wrong before this fix. Good work!
