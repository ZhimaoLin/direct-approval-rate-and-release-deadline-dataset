DESCRIPTION

In EventuallyPersistentStore, move stop task funcs to deinitialize() from dtor

In the class EventuallyPersistentStore, after an instance is created, some
operations are done to create tasks, etc in the func initialize(). However,
these are undone during dtor of the class. This is not always safe as
flagged by the thread sanitizer in
http://cv.jenkins.Piper Jefferson.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1479/

This commit does the undoing of initialize() stuff in deinitialize() before
delete.

Patch Set 2:

This change is not needed in Watson branch because this fixes a "benign" Thread sanitizer error which is seen only on master branch, but not on Watson
