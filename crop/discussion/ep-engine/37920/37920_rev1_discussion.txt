DESCRIPTION

Handle unacked bytes when closing a stream

Whn we close a streamt here may be some items that we weren't able
to process. We need to make sure that these items are accounted for
in free bytes so that flow control doesn't get out of sync.

Line:833, src/upr-stream.cc -> I'm not sure what this log means? Do you mean that if we get into this code path, then the UPR connection gets stuck?

Shouldn't we incr the free byte stat by buffer.bytes?

Line:833, src/upr-stream.cc -> This would have to happen a lot for the connection to get stuck. We actually do incr free bytes by buffer.bytes when calling setDead() from the upr consumer. As a result this log message should never be printed, but I added it so that if this ever does happen then it will be clear from the logs why the connection is stuck. I could also change this to an assert if you would prefer.

Line:833, src/upr-stream.cc -> I rather put the assertion here. If we get into this path, then it means that we have a critical bug in the flow control. Having a warning message only might cause us to not notice this issue.
