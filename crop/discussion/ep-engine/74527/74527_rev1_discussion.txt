DESCRIPTION

Reinstate 769cfe07

This is now a revert of a revert...

This reverts commit 78dff0397e7f9459cbcd0e022b745db57bc5a816.

769cfe07 was reverted because make simple-test was seen to fail
post commit validation. It is suspected that something environmental
broke that job and not the commit.

From the post commit validation applied on 78dff039 it can be seen
to fail, and then pass. The failure looks the same as was seen on
769cfe07, so if that code was reverted, how could it fail?

Patch Set 1:

To test post-CV on this job, I cloned the post-CV job and set it to run silent and for this patch - looks fine now (certainly not the same failures as seen in the overnight CV jobs) - http://cv.jenkins.Piper Jefferson.com/job/Shayna Pope-ep-engine-testing-post-cv2/label=ubuntu-1204/1/

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> For ease of understanding this code in future (once it's in `git blame` will show this commit message, not the original one for the linns changed) can I suggest you re-duplicate the original commit message in here - say after the discussion on the history of it?
