Line:762, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Now with your changes, READ_ONLY flag being available and further specified error codes, I think I can refactor the following codes (next 15 lines) with better error handling logic.   I probably do so after your changes getting merged unless you prefer me to add to here. Thanks.
