DESCRIPTION

Dump core immediately on mutex error

I was looking at a bug today and lost a lot of stack trace
info because we threw an exception which was caught so high
up the stack that I wasn't able to figure out exactly what
caused it.

Patch Set 3:

I was thinking the same thing. Unless anyone has any major objections. I would like to push this through as soon as possible since this will allow QA to get me a better stack trace for the bug I'm solving.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved

I think it's fine.  This should never happen and is followed by an abort.
