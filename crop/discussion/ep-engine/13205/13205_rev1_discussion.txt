DESCRIPTION

Dump core immediately on mutex deadlock

I was looking at a bug today and lost a lot of stack trace
info because we threw an exception which was caught so high
up the stack that I wasn't able to figure out exactly what
caused it.

We should consider what errors should cause us to abort
immediately in the mutex class. Mabye for all errors?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I would probably have printed out a message to stdout first and replaced the assert with abort() (and nuked the exception code...)
