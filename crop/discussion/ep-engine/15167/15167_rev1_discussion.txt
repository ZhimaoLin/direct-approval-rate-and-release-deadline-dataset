DESCRIPTION

MB-5138 Fix: valLength() assert for invalid blob length

After warmup is partially done and ns_server allows get/set
operations a bgfetch can cause this assert while restoring
data for a given key from disk. The fix includes the code
that popualtes the value length field of a key when the first
phase of warmup loads the key into the hashtable.
