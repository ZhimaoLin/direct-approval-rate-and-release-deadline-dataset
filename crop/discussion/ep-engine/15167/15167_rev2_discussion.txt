DESCRIPTION

MB-5138 Restore the value length during the first phase warmup

After warmup is partially done and ns_server allows get/set
operations, a bgfetch can cause the value length mismatch assert
while the warmup thread restores data for a given key from disk.
This change fixes the above assertion by popualting the value
length field of a key when the first phase of warmup loads the
key into the hashtable.
