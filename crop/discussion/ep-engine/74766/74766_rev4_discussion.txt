DESCRIPTION

MB-23163: Fix log messsage in ActiveStream

The unexpected STREAM_DEAD log message has been seen in the logs
associated with the MB.

The log message was missing the vbucket that the stream is associated
with.  This has been added.

Changed to use producer->getLogger().log as opposed to the LOG macro,
as it matches other log messages in the file.  It ensures the
connection name is printed first.
