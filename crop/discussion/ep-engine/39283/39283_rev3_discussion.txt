DESCRIPTION

MB-11592: Use a queue_item in a MutationResponse instead of and Item

This will allow us to pull queued_items out of the CheckpointManager
and into and ActiveStream without adding any memory overhead. This
also simplified the cleanup of a MutationResponse because we no
longer need to seperately delete the item contained inside this
class.

Line:260, src/upr-response.h -> queued_item &getItem()

It should be okay to return the reference as long as MutationReponse instance is alive. I saw that this method is used to access the member variables of Item instance, which can cause unnecessary overhead due to atomic ref counter incr / decr.

Line:267, src/upr-producer.cc -> We still need to keep this condition with UPR_MUTATION.
