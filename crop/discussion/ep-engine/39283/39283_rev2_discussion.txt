DESCRIPTION

MB-11592: Use a queue_item in a MutationResponse instead of and Item

This will allow us to pull queued_items out of the CheckpointManager
and into and ActiveStream without adding any memory overhead. This
also simplified the cleanup of a MutationResponse because we no
longer need to seperately delete the item contained inside this
class.
