DESCRIPTION

MB-11592: Use a queue_item in a MutationResponse instead of and Item

This will allow us to pull queued_items out of the CheckpointManager
and into and ActiveStream without adding any memory overhead. This
also simplified the cleanup of a MutationResponse because we no
longer need to seperately delete the item contained inside this
class.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

Before merging this change, please make sure that it won't cause any critical memory leak by running some simple test that does CRUD operations and attaching memcached process to "leaks" command at least ( you need to disable tcmalloc for this on mac os).
