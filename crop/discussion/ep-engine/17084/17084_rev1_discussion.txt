DESCRIPTION

MB-5521: two commands have the same op code 0xaa

CMD_CREATE_CHECKPOINT and CMD_NOTIFY_VBUCKET_UPDATE have the same op
code 0xaa, which causes conflict. It was not exposed because nobody
use CMD_CREATE_CHECKPOINT from CAPI. XDCR issued create checkpoint
command from CAPI and thus exposed the bug.
