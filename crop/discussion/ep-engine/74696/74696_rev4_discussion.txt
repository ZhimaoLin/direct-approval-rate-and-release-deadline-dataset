DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [12/N]: Rename thread count parameters

rename

max_num_{readers,writers,auxio,nonio}

to

num_{reader,writer,auxio,nonio}_threads

in config and {cb,mc}epctl to better reflect that changing these
properties alters the number of threads. Backward compatability is
achieved by adding aliases to the previous names.
