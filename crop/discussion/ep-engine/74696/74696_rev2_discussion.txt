DESCRIPTION

MB-22041 [12/N]: Rename thread count parameters

rename

max_num_{readers,writers,auxio,nonio}

to

num_{reader,writer,auxio,nonio}_threads

in config and {cb,mc}epctl to better reflect that changing these
properties alters the number of threads. Backward compatability is
achieved by adding aliases to the previous names.

Line:6377, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Thinking further, I'm not keen on the duplication here - certainly in the long run - it just makes maintenance harder; but there's clearly a case for having a transition.

Can you raise two MBs:

1. An MB targeted at Spock on the DOCS component to mark the old stat names as depreciated, pointing users at the new names and mentioning they will be removed in a future version.
2. An MB targeted at Spock.Next which is to remove the aliases from the list of statistics we print. We can debate if they can still be used explicitly if you know the  exact name...
