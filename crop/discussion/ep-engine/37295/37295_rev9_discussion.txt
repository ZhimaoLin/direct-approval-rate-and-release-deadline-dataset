DESCRIPTION

MB-10941: When backfill is neccessary always do a full backfill

When sending backfill we need to send the entire thing as a single
snapshot in order to avoid potentially missing de-duplicated items
when then checkpoint ends.

I might be wrong, but still saw some potential issues with this change. Please look at my comment.

Line:344, src/upr-stream.cc -> If we still use end_seqno_ that is given by the client, then we will skip the backfill items whose seqno >= end_seqno_, which seems wrong based on the discussion we had today.

Line:344, src/upr-stream.cc -> This code will only run once the backfill has completed. All items from backfill are put into the readyQ so as long as there are items in it then we won't get into this code path.

Line:367, src/upr-stream.cc -> I haven't addressed the memory snapshots yet and was planning to do so in a separate change. I can add that one tomorrow and we can merge them together if you would prefer that.
