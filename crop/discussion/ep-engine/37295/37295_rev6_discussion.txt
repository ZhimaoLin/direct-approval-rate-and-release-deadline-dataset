DESCRIPTION

When backfill is neccessary always do a full backfill

When sending backfill we need to send the entire thing as a single
snapshot in order to avoid potentially missing de-duplicated items
when then checkpoint ends.

Line:296, src/upr-stream.cc -> Please check if vb is NULL or not.

Line:300, src/upr-stream.cc -> There might be a race in calling those two functions because some checkpoints might be freed because of removing the cursor.

Line:1174, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please check the return code from this API.

Line:437, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Please update the comments accordingly.

I just want to note that the patch seems to fix the issue I'm seeing. I'll rerun the test once it got the +2 from Chiyoung.

Line:296, src/upr-stream.cc -> I just sent out an email about these kinds of checks. I'll make this one the first one I actually add.

Line:300, src/upr-stream.cc -> I'm going to change the register cursor function to remove any old cursros with the same name.

Line:1174, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I'll add a check for this and at the moment I will put an abort() if we see an error. I think we need to add more comprehensive error handling to this function and allow whoever scheduled the backfill to make a decision on what to do about a particular error. Note that in other cases where we call this function we either log an error and proceed or call abort().

Line:437, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:1174, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> A disk IO operation can fail temporarily. Therefore, we need to check errno value from couchstore, and make a decision (retry, sending an error, ...) based on it.
