DESCRIPTION

MB-10941: When backfill is neccessary always do a full backfill

When sending backfill we need to send the entire thing as a single
snapshot in order to avoid potentially missing de-duplicated items
when then checkpoint ends.

Line:616, src/upr-stream.cc -> This logic seems confusing to me. I don't understand exactly what it does try to figure out with backfill_start, backfill_end, curChkSeqno, end_seqno_, etc.

At least, we need to refactor those statements like;

if (flag_ & UPR_ADD_STREAM_FLAG_DISKONLY) { // Disk backfill only
   ...
} else { // Disk backfill + in-memory streaming
   ...
}
