DESCRIPTION

MB-4417 Clear queues and unacked items for registered TAP clients.

If the registered TAP client is only interested in items from
closed checkpoints, we can simply clear all the queues and
unacked items when the client is reconnected, because its
replication cursor is reset to the beginning of the checkpoint to
which the cursor currently belongs.
