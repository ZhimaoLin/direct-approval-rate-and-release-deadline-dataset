DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove unnecessary queueDirty call from completeBGFetchForSingleItem

In completeBGFetchForSingleItem() we queue an item onto checkpoint if the
expirytime time of the bg fetched item does not match the expiry time of the
item in the ht. But this is redundant because whenever expiry time of an item
changes we already queue it onto checkpoint.

For records, this was originally added in http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/16110
