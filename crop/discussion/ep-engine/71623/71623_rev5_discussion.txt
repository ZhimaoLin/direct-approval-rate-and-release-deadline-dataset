DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove unnecessary queueDirty call from completeBGFetchForSingleItem

In completeBGFetchForSingleItem() we queue an item onto checkpoint if the
expirytime time of the bg fetched item does not match the expiry time of the
item in the ht. But this is redundant because whenever expiry time of an item
changes we already queue it onto checkpoint.

Verified by an existing test case test_mb5215()

For records, this was originally added in the commit 9cd0a77

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

I'm not sure the current test is sufficient - I might be wrong (and hence just need it explaining to me ;))

Line:706, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Nit: You can just use `dockey` here.

Line:712, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> ditto.

Line:734, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Should we not also verify that the given key is dirty in the hashtable / queued in the checkpoint manager?

(I'm trying to understand how we confirm that the key has been re-queued correctly - maybe we should also check the expirytime on the queued checkpoint item?)

Line:734, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> The new seqno confirms that. Should be enough i think

Strictly speaking there is no 100% test for this as that piece of code was never executed (as I understand it).

Line:734, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> shouldn't the new seqno be 5 (1 + 2 x touch commands)?

Line:734, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> No, because first 2 touch commands we just queue a BG Fetch. Item is not put onto checkpoint
