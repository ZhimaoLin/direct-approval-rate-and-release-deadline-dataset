DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove unnecessary queueDirty call from completeBGFetchForSingleItem

In completeBGFetchForSingleItem() we queue an item onto checkpoint if the
expirytime time of the bg fetched item does not match the expiry time of the
item in the ht. But this is redundant because whenever expiry time of an item
changes we already queue it onto checkpoint.

For records, this was originally added in the commit 9cd0a77

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I think we need some tests to verify the correctness of this change - could you ensure there's a unit test which checks this scenario?

Also - you can probably shuffle this before your other refactors, so we can get it in before the more invasive changes.
