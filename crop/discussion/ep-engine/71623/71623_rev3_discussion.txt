DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Remove unnecessary queueDirty call from completeBGFetchForSingleItem

In completeBGFetchForSingleItem() we queue an item onto checkpoint if the
expirytime time of the bg fetched item does not match the expiry time of the
item in the ht. But this is redundant because whenever expiry time of an item
changes we already queue it onto checkpoint.

Verified by an existing test case test_mb5215()

For records, this was originally added in the commit 9cd0a77

I would have thought that we need a synchronous test which explicitly controls the BGfetcher to create the right preconditions (i.e. ensure a BGFetch completes *after* a second request has been made).

What do you think?
