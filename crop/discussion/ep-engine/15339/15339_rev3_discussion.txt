wouldnt it be better to just have a single implementation to avoid the ifdefs?

Damien, thanks a lot for providing the fix for us. I think using more platform independent functions would be better for us to keep that simple and test it more easily. As you're dealing with many other stuffs, Jin or I will adapt this change. Thanks!

Line:811, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I prefer to use "opendir()" and "readdir()", which are available in both linux and windows mingw at least. I think we don't need to do any regular expression pattern matches here because the file path prefix would be passed to this function.

Patch Set 3: Abandoned

Not portable enough, prefer to use a linear scan over the dir vbucket files.
