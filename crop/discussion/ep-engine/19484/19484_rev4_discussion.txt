DESCRIPTION

MB-6115: fix set_with_meta and del_with_meta binary protocol

Today when XDCR decides to replicate a normal item or deleted item,
the CAPI of target node creates a packet using binary protocol and
sends it to ep_engine. The order CAPI packs the item metadata in the
extension part is (expiration time:32, flags:32, seqno:64, CAS:64),
but the current code puts the flags ahead of expiration time, thus
has caused mismatching protocol between ep_engine and ns_server.
