DESCRIPTION

MB-6115: fix set_with_meta and del_with_meta binary protocol

Today when XDCR decides to replicate a normal item or deleted item,
the CAPI of target node creates a packet using binary protocol and
sends it to ep_engine. The order CAPI packs the item metadata in the
extension part is (expiration time:32, flags:32, seqno:64, CAS:64),
but the current code puts the flags ahead of expiration time, thus
causing mismatching protocol between ep_engine and ns_server.

Patch Set 1:

In other memcached packets the flags are typically placed before the expiration time which is why I placed them as such. If Chiyoung is okay with this fix then I am okay with it, but I feel that this should be changed on the ns_server side.

Steve,

This requires a minor change in the backup tool as well. Please let me know if you have any issues.

Patch Set 1:

Mike,

I tNathalie Landryed to Junyi to see if ns-server can be adapted. But, unfortunately, it requires many changes in the ns-server side as the original XDCR code is based on that order.

As it only requires a very minor change in ep-engine, it should be fine, but we need to confirm it from Steve too.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

You need to change the commands in mc_bin_client too. Please also notify QE of the changes and make sure you change the wiki page.
