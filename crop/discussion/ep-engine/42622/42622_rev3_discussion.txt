DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary Item() constructor

Remove one (of the 5!) Item constructors - it was identical to another
apart from taking a std::string& instead of (char*, length) for the
key.

Patch Set 3:

Rationale:

As part of fixing Chiyoung's review comment on http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/41498/, I need to move the currentEpoch from a static member of Item to EvPStore, which in turn means that when Items are created they need to have a created_epoch passed into the constructor.

In looking at this I noticed that the current 5 (!) item constructors have a lot of duplication between them, which is both error-prone and hard to maintain. This series of patches attempts to improve that situation, reducing to 3 constructors (almost 2!) and one new explicit copy constructor.
