DESCRIPTION

MB-4889: Don't notify tap when shutting down

On shutdown we delete the tapconnmap and tap connections before
stopping the dispatcher threads. In this particular case the
nio-dispatcher thread was notifying tap during shutdown. This fix
causes us to check for shutdown before notifying tap.
