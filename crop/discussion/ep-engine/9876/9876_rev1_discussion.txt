DESCRIPTION

Don't create a copy of the key

From looking at a performance metric we spent more time creating
the object than doing the search for the item with the key on
the next line in the source.

From the test I ran it was responsible for ~1.2 CPU sec, and without
it I'm getting 0.2. It's not much; the total CPU time for the function
was ~30 sec, but there is no point of calling allocating memory and
copy the content just to pass the string on to the search..
