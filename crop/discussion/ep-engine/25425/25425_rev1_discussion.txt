Patch Set 1:

For initial design review (ep engine internal only):

* start with KVShard (kvshard.hh/cc) first
* see how ep_engine/ep methods for individual vb access translated into high-level shard then mapped to underlying kvstore (couchkvstore)
* ignore invocations of bgfetcher/flusher - separate code commits (integration of unified dispatcher)

Note mutation log test has been disabled & make test won't complete for now until the dispatcher integration is complete. Thanks
