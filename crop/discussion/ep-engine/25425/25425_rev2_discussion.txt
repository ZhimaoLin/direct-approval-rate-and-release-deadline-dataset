Patch Set 2: (4 inline comments)

Jin,

I posted a few comments. Also there seems to be a lot of stuff in this commit that doesn't need to be changed and makes it hard for me to see what the main changes are. Some of the things are stylistic and others are just different ways of calling a function. Can you separate those out into a separate commit?

Line:461, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Is this function necessary? Why would we need to move a CouchKVStore instance between shards?

Line:619, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Do we even need the shard id here? It doesn't seem necessary in the notifier class either.

Line:273, src/kvstore.hh -> Why does the kvstore need to know about the shard?

Line:111, src/couch-kvstore/couch-notifier.hh -> We only seem to pass in the shard number in order to add the value to a log message can we remove this?

Patch Set 2:

Hi Mike, all changes are necessary. They might be looking like a cosmetic change but most are needed because of the new abstract layer (shard) being added between vbuckets and ep. Shardid for kvstore and notifier are there for debugging synchronization issue that may occur when multiple threads concurrently send/recv mccouch notifications. 

I will see if I can break the commit into several individuals for easy review for others.

I will remember to remove the shardid once regression tests are complete. Thank you.

Jin
