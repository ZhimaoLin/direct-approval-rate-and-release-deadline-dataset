DESCRIPTION

MB-21916: Make use of StoredDocKey

Where std::string stored a key, now we use StoredDocKey
When we passed std::string& through interfaces we now
pass DocKey as much as possible, thus delaying the
heap alloc and memcpy to the places we really need
to store a key.

This patch does not store the namespace in StoredValue
This patch does not store the namespace in couchstore/fdb

Thus any keys created in say Collections namespace will
not work. This is correct as this patch does not make
any assertions about the support of non-DefaultCollection

Line:1047, src/checkpoint.cc -> note the auto here will be const StorageKey&. do we want explicit const auto?

Line:1047, src/checkpoint.cc -> I personally prefer explicit `const` (even if the underlying type is const), as it allows the reader to see that this variable will never be changed (and hence you make assumptions about anyone passed it won't change it).

Basically gives me less things to hold in my head when reading code :)
