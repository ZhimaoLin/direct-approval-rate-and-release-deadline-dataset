DESCRIPTION

MB-21916: Make use of StoredDocKey

Where std::string stored a key, now we use StoredDocKey
When we passed std::string& through interfaces we now
pass DocKey as much as possible, thus delaying the
heap alloc and memcpy to the places we really need
to store a key.

This patch does not store the namespace in StoredValue
This patch does not store the namespace in couchstore/fdb

Thus any keys created in say Collections namespace will
not work. This is correct as this patch does not make
any assertions about the support of non-DefaultCollection
