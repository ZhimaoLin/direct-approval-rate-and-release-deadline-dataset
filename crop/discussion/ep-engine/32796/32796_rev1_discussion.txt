DESCRIPTION

When doing a bucket flush only call reset on the kvstore from one shard

Since the KVStore knows about all of the vbuckets that means calling
this from each shard will flush the bucket once for each shard. Not
only is this inefficient, but I found that is can lead to corruption
of the locals docs. Also note that passing in vbuckets for each shard
would require substantial work because we would need to let the
couch notifier know about the subset of vbuckets being flushed.

Line:2375, src/ep.cc -> But, we should make sure that the underlying kvstore instance per shard should reset their states (e.g., cached vbstates or item count, etc...). Please make sure that each kvstore instance  is reset correctly.
