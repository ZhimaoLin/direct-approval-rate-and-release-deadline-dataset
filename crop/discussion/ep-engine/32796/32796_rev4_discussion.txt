DESCRIPTION

When doing a bucket flush only send reset to mccouch once

Since we have multiple shards in that each have a kvstore we should
only allow one of the shards to send a flush notification to
mccouch.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

I expect that we can get rid of the notification parameter when we remove the dependency between ep-engine flusher and erlang mccouch.

Yes, we can completely remove the couch notifier once all of the couch file dependencies are removed.
