DESCRIPTION

Pass stream_t by ref, not by copy for some DCP paths

Spotted whilst single stepping that some paths are copying the
shared pointer down the call chain, increasing the ref count for
each new copy.

In some cases we would abort, requiring an unwind of all the
increments.

So pass by ref and only take a copy when we really need to extend
the lifetime of the object.
