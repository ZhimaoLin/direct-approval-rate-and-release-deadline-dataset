DESCRIPTION

C++11 modernization: Update SingleThreadedRCPtr API to std::shared_ptr

Update the API of SingleThreadedRCPtr<> to match that of
std::shared_ptr<>, specifically mark the constructor from a bare
pointer as `explicit` so no implicit type conversion is performed.

This is in perparation for switching out our own custom implementation
to the C++11 std::shared_ptr.
