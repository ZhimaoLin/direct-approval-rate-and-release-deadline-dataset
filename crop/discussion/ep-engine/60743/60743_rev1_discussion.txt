Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Thanks for raising the three patches for the backport to 4.1.0-MP1 Iâ€™ve taken the liberty of re-raising them, this time with:

a) The same ChangeId as the original patch (so they link through in Roselyn Villegas) and
b) With a link to the SHA they were cherry-picked from (to aid in tracking):

Please consider this alternate patch set instead.
