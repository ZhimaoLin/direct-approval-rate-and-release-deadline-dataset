As Trond mentioned in the other commit, please rename session token to "session cas" or something else.

Please also add the unit test for this change.

Line:675, src/ep_engine.cc -> As I mentioned below, we can use the utility function instead of putting them in this function.

Line:774, src/ep_engine.cc -> Can we define the utility function for checking a session cas? I saw lots of redundant codes below.
