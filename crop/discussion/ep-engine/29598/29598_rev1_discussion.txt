Line:4659, src/ep_engine.cc -> Currently rebasing this change on top of one of Trond's api changes and I will post the result of that for you, but I wanted to note that all of these functions below should be defined in the upr-consumer.cc and upr-producer.cc files.

I added a few more comments. I think the first thing we need to do is rebase over the latest memcached/ep-engine changes from Trond. We will need to do that anyways since those changes will be merged soon.

Line:770, src/ep_engine.cc -> It looks like your editor made a bunch of formatting changes to code that is not actually changing. I think it would be better to leave the formatting the way it is since it makes it difficult to see what is changed in the commit.

Line:1075, src/ep_engine.cc -> These came from one of Trond's commits and we want that to be submitted separately. Can you rebase over the latest change.

Memcached change: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/29595/

Ep-engine change: http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/29612/

Line:2818, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please revert these formatting changes. We can submit them in a separate commit if we want to fix them.
