I'd prefer the commit message (the first line is all the many tools see) be useful.

It'd be better to move "Refactoring of ep-engine to support both TAP and UPR." up to the first line, you can put the bug IDs in the commit message body.

Line:58, src/tapconnection.h -> I don't think we should have a separate type for upr events. We can just add the new events that we need to send to the current tap_event_t type and rename it if necessary.

Line:363, src/tapconnection.h -> Please fix all whitespace issues.

Patch Set 2:

Line:1156, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please uncomment this so that it still returns no supported.

Line:890, src/ep_engine.h -> Is there a reasons why we need two conn maps? Why couldn't we just have one that contained both tap and upr connections and just handle things based on the connection type? For example it would be a mapping of cookie to ConnHandler.
