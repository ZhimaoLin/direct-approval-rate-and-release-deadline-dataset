Line:223, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> We don't need this new handler class for getm

Line:1206, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> Please adapt get function instead of having a separate getm function.

Line:76, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> We don't need a separate "getm" function, but can simply adapt "get" function.

Line:158, kvstore.hh -> We don't need to define "getm" function here that exactly does the same thing as "get" except for value retrieval. We can pass whether it's full load or partial load (i.e., meta data) to "get" function.
