Patch Set 9: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I like the idea, but it seems like there's a lot of cookie-cutter code there.  How hard would it be to generate these configuration things from a smaller definition file?

Patch Set 9: Fails

I can't configure this patch:

    checking for gettimeofday... yes
    checking for getopt_long... yes
    checking Intel __sync_XXX intrinsics work... yes
    checking for library containing dlopen... none required
    configure: error: Can't build ep-engine without memcached/engine.h

Patch Set 9:

I'm planning to change the stuff to use aother set of classes, so that we can add "listeners" etc for each parameter with a callback...

Patch Set 9:

I'd like to generate it with python or something.  Would that be too hard?  Maybe have a JSON or tab delimited file or something.

    params = {
        expiry_window: {
            type: "size_t",
            descr: "expiry window to not persist an object that is expired (or will be soon)"
         },
         dbname: {
             descr: "Path to on-disk storage.",
             dynamic: false
         }
     }
