Patch Set 10: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Dustin: From you suggestion..

params = {
  expiry_window: {

Would this (^^) be the key in the config? 

    type: "size_t",
    descr: "expiry window to not persist an object that is expired (or will be soon)"

We should also have the default value here...

  },
  dbname: {
descr: "Path to on-disk storage.",
dynamic: false

Does the dynamic keyword there indicate that you want to have a "setter" method generated as well?

Patch Set 10:

Yeah, you've got the basic idea.

"dynamic" would imply that, but mostly it means that we can set it via memcached protocol on a running system.  e.g. we can set sleep times, etc... but we can't set dbpath.

Patch Set 10:

This compiles for me with that previous change.  I'd still like most of this to be generated if possible, though.  :)

that's why I -1'd it and I'm working on it... it takes time to write everything into that json doc ;)
