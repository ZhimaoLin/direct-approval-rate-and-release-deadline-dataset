DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move queueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::queueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto checkpoint
after it is inserted into hash table. Both hash table and checkpoint are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

Also, added VBUpdateReturnCtx which will indicate the KVBucket on the
actions to be taken after adding/deleting/updating an item in VBucket.

Implementing this functions in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Functionality looks good- few minor points.

Line:530, src/warmup.cc -> As previous, make_unique<> is simpler.

Line:1248, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Style: you can use make_unique (like make_pair / make_shared) to simplify this:

 make_unique<NotifyNewSeqnoCB>(*this)

Line:2028, src/kv_bucket.cc -> This is a bit ugly - call the method once (removing the duplication) and conditionally assign the result:

 auto queued_seqno = vb->queueDirty(*v, &lh, genBySeqno, genCas);
 if (seqno != nullptr) {
     *seqno = queued_seqno;
 }

Line:2697, src/kv_bucket.cc -> ditto

Line:1022, src/kv_bucket.h -> Might be simpler to just use a std::function with a lambda capture for the state - although if it's working we can leave for now, and maybe clean up all the callbacks later on.
