DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move queueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::queueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto checkpoint
after it is inserted into hash table. Both hash table and checkpoint are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

Also, added VBUpdateReturnCtx which will indicate the KVBucket on the
actions to be taken after adding/deleting/updating an item in VBucket.

Implementing this functions in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:28, src/monotonic.h -> nit: clang-format wants this as 

 Monotonic(const T val = std::numeric_limits<T>::min()) : val (val) { 
 }

there are a few other minor format changes needed below as well, since this is new code we should have it formatted by clang-format.

Line:54, src/vbucket.h -> nit: name the real object type, I presume you mean Item

I think the general approach looks reasonable. Few minor / stylistic comments:

Line:3, src/monotonic.h -> 2017

Line:24, src/monotonic.h -> Maybe add a note this isn't atomic / thread-safe.

Line:28, src/monotonic.h -> Note you can also use `git clang-format` (available from homebrew) which can automatically reformat the lines you've changed.

Line:35, src/vbucket.cc -> Nit: these should be in alphabetical order.

Line:708, src/vbucket.cc -> Given this is an out param (and the function is currently void), nicer to make this the return value.

Line:1242, src/kv_bucket.cc -> I'm not sure this need to be shared - I would have thought that there's only really one owner of it. Can we use unique_ptr instead?

Line:803, src/kv_bucket.h -> Might be worth renaming this (or at least documenting somewhere) so distinguish what /this/ callback does which is different to the NewSeqno callback.

Line:731, src/vbucket.cc -> Ideally we'd clean up this locking stuff - I don't think there's that many cases where we still pass a lock in. 

Ideally we'd not pass the lock pointer in at all, and just let the caller of this function unlock the mutex.

Line:3, src/monotonic.h -> Done

Line:24, src/monotonic.h -> Done

Line:28, src/monotonic.h -> using git-clang-format from now on

Line:35, src/vbucket.cc -> Done

Line:708, src/vbucket.cc -> Ok

Line:731, src/vbucket.cc -> Actually I had left a comment on a previous patch saying that eventual idea to get rid of this lock.
Will become more clear once the ht lock is grabbed only in the VBucket class

Line:1242, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Done

Line:54, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:803, src/kv_bucket.h -> Done
