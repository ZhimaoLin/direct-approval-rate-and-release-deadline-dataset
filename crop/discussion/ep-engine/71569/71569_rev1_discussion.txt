DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move queueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::queueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto checkpoint
after it is inserted into hash table. Both hash table and checkpoint are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

Also, added VBUpdateReturnCtx which will indicate the KVBucket on the
actions to be taken after adding/deleting/updating an item in VBucket.

Implementing this functions in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

I think this approach is much cleaner!

Few minor things - see below.

Line:3211, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Probably want to delete this code once you're happy it's working.

Line:3454, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Style: might be a good use for `auto` here - save the typing the long return type each time.

Line:59, src/vbucket.h -> Style: Should have colon at start of empty line.

(Try git-clang-format (via brew) - that should pickup our .clang-format file installed in the root of the source checkout, and automatically match the style.

Line:69, src/vbucket.h -> Not sure why we need the "double struct" - can't we just have a single object without the nested VBNofityCtx inside it?

Line:3211, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Oh yeah, i missed it.. Will remove.

Line:3454, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Ok

Line:59, src/vbucket.h -> Done

Line:69, src/vbucket.h -> VBUpdateReturnCtx will soon have more than VBNotifyCtx. So added that here.. But will change that when it is needed.
Will use VBNotifyCtx for now
