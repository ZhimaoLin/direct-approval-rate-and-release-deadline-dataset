DESCRIPTION

Fix calculation of ep_io_write_bytes

Previously it contained the full length of the "blob" which
would contain the flexible metadata part. This commit "corrects"
the calculation by setting it to the number of bytes in the
document plus the number of bytes in the metadata section
stored for the document.
