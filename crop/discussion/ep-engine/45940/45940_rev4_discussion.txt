DESCRIPTION

MB-12928: Handle conflict resolution using CAS when time sync is enabled

In a vbucket, if time sync is enabled and if the mutations are eligible
for last write wins comparison, then conflict resolution will progess
by comparing CAS values first as opposed to sending revision sequence
numbers.

Line:61, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> rev_seqno

Line:89, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> I rather pass RCPtr<VBucket> &vb instead of timeSyncEnabled and then check if time_sync is enabled only if the conflict resolutions are all LWW.

Line:92, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> if (v->getConflictResMode() == last_write_wins && 
    itmConfResMode == last_write_wins) {
    if (vb->isTimeSyncEnabled()) {
        return resolve_lww(v, meta, deletion, itmConfResMode);
    }
}

// Do the rev_id based conflict resolution that is a default mode if the above or any future conditions are all not satisfied.
...

Line:102, src/conflict_resolution.cc -> Please print the actual string 'revision num' or 'LWW' depending on the enum value.

Line:46, src/conflict_resolution.h -> I still rather keep ConflictResolution as a parent class to make it more extensible. Otherwise, we may need to keep adding new parameters to 'resolve' method. 'resolve' method should receive the common parameters and then we need to figure out which sub class's resolve method should be invoked.

Line:1987, src/ep.cc -> This logic is difficult to understand. Please make it more clear by putting extra if clause if necessary.

Line:2612, src/ep.cc -> same comment as above.
