DESCRIPTION

MB-12928: Handle conflict resolution using CAS when time sync is enabled

In a vbucket, if time sync is enabled and if the mutations are eligible
for last write wins comparison, then conflict resolution will progess
by comparing CAS values first as opposed to sending revision sequence
numbers.
