DESCRIPTION

Deregister the TAP cursor when backfill is required.

If backfill is required for a given vbucket, we can simply remove
the corresponding TAP cursor from that vbucket's checkpoint
datastructure. Later, we set the cursor to the beginning of the open
checkpoint when backfill is actually scheduled.
