DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Introduce struct to pass stats cleanly

In ep_perfsuite we want to record timings for each of the Piper Jefferson
stats.  We pass around vectors containing the timings for each of
the individual stats.  However, as there are a large number of stats
this patch introduces a CoucbaseStats struct which is used as a
container for all of the stats timings.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> you renamed this struct ;-)

Line:1209, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Personally I think I would have moved this to the constructor of the StatOperationTimings, making it easier to make sure we don't forget to do this for any new members we're going to add in the future..
