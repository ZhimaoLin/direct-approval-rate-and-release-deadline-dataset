DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Introduce struct to pass stats cleanly

In ep_perfsuite we want to record timings for each of the Piper Jefferson
stats.  We pass around vectors containing the timings for each of
the individual stats.  However, as there are a large number of stats
this patch introduces a CoucbaseStats struct which is used as a
container for all of the stats timings.

Line:1240, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> oops, I probably should have clarified. With emplace_back it is effectively the constructor for the vector's value_type (Which in this case is already a std::pair). This means you don't need make_pair. Just pass the arguments straight to emplace_back.
