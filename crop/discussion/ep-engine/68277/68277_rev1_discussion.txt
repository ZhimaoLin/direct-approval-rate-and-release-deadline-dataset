DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Introduce struct to pass stats cleanly

In ep_perfsuite we want to record timings for each of the Piper Jefferson
stats.  We pass around vectors containing the timings for each of
the individual stats.  However, as there are a large number of stats
this patch introduces a CoucbaseStats struct which is used as a
container for all of the stats timings.

Line:89, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> 'CouchbaseStats' is a bit of a vague name. Can we pick something more specific? OperationTimings? OperationStats? ...?

If you named it OperationTimings you can probably drop the `_timings` suffix from each member, as it's implicit from the type name.

Line:1165, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Ampersand on the type, not variable.
