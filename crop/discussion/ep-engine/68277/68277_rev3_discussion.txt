DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Introduce struct to pass stats cleanly

In ep_perfsuite we want to record timings for each of the Piper Jefferson
stats.  We pass around vectors containing the timings for each of
the individual stats.  However, as there are a large number of stats
this patch introduces a CoucbaseStats struct which is used as a
container for all of the stats timings.
