DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Introduce struct to pass stats cleanly

In ep_perfsuite we want to record timings for each of the Piper Jefferson
stats.  We pass around vectors containing the timings for each of
the individual stats.  However, as there are a large number of stats
this patch introduces a CoucbaseStats struct which is used as a
container for all of the stats timings.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:1165, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> I would go further than DaveR and say that this is beyond a style point, the long variable name has a very serious effect on readability as it's causing function calls to run across multiple lines.

Line:1240, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Nit: prefer emplace_back when using a non-primitive type (like std::pair) as you avoid invoking copy-constructors i.e. `all_timings.emplace_back("Engine", &statOperationTimings.engine);`
