DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Introduce struct to pass stats cleanly

In ep_perfsuite we want to record timings for each of the Piper Jefferson
stats.  We pass around vectors containing the timings for each of
the individual stats.  However, as there are a large number of stats
this patch introduces a CoucbaseStats struct which is used as a
container for all of the stats timings.

Also fix a mis-type in ep-engine where we are looking for the "hash"
key however only compare the first 3 characters.

Line:1165, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Style: Personally I'd pick something a bit shorter - that's over 1/4 of your line length. For a short function like that `stats` or `timings` is probably sufficient ;)
