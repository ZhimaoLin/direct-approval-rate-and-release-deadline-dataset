Line:319, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Why do you need to compare the same variable?

Line:320, src/upr-consumer.cc -> What is this magic number "5"? Can we put a comment at least?

Line:347, configuration.json -> So, the flow control is disabled by default, and the cluster manager will enable it later?

Patch Set 5:

(3 comments)

Line:319, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Probably just a typo. I'll remove it.

Line:320, src/upr-consumer.cc -> It means send an ack after at least 20% of the buffer has been freed. I'll add a comment and make it (* .2)

Line:347, configuration.json -> It gets changed to true after the next patch.
