DESCRIPTION

checkpoint_test: set default buckets/locks before creating CheckpointTest

Set the HashTable default number of buckets and locks in main(),
before we create any CheckpointTest test fixtures. This ensures that
the first HashTable we create doesn't have the default number of locks
(193), which causes problems for ThreadSanitizer (too many locks held
at once).
