Line:360, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Probably also worth expanding to say that ctx includes the identifier of the element to compact (or similar).

Line:1462, src/ep.cc -> Is it possible to use a stronger type for db_file_id?

Line:1463, src/ep.cc -> This can be a reference (and save the copy)

Line:1538, src/ep.cc -> Can probably make this const.

Line:296, src/tasks.h -> Just use std::to_string()
