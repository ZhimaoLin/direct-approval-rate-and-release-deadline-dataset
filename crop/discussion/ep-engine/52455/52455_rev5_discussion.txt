Line:2076, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think we don't need this for loop anymore as meta_only flag is already available above. That's also the main purpose of this commit, which is to avoid checking it through the iteration.

Line:638, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same comment as the one in CouchKVStore.
