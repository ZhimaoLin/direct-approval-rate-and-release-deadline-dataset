DESCRIPTION

Simplify MultiLockHolder

Previously MultiLockHolder stored the states of its locks in order
to facilitate the ability to `unlock` outside of RAII (much like
std::unique_lock).

Given this feature isn't actually used, this moves the `unlock`
and `lock` methods to private visibility and removes the now
unnecessary logic which tracks the lock state at runtime.
