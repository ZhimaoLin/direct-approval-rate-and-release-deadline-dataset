DESCRIPTION

Add get_stats operations to ep_perfsuite

Added two new tests:
1) Measure the performance of repeated calls to get_stats.  Passing in
the NULL key, which corresponds to requesting all stats.
2) Similar test to (1) but in addition performs repeated calls to set
in a separate thread to highlight any interaction between the stats
calls and normal CRUD operations. The latency of both the get_stats
calls and set calls is recorded.

Abbreviated example output from test 1:

Baseline Stat latency (couchstore)...
                        Percentile
            Median   95th     99th   Std Dev

AllStats   273.447  382.325  497.482  58.071

(3 sec) OK

Abbreviated example output from test 2:

Stat latency with set executed in separate thread (couchstore)

                                Percentile
            Median   95th     99th   Std Dev

Sets (bg)  2.693    3.529    4.638    3.830
AllStats   257.191  337.684  456.826  42.139

(4 sec) OK
