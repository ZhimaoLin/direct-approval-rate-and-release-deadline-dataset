DESCRIPTION

Add get_stats operations to ep_perfsuite

Added two new tests:
1) Measure the performance of repeated calls to get_stats.  Passing in
the NULL key, which corresponds to requesting all stats.
2) Similar test to (1) but in addition performs repeated calls to set
in a separate thread to highlight any interaction between the stats
calls and normal CRUD operations. The latency of both the get_stats
calls and set calls is recorded.
