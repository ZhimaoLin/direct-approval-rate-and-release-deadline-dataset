Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:44, src/collections/manager.h -> Helpful to document the exception class (or base class if multiple types thrown).

Also - I think it would be cleaner to use error codes *or* exceptions; otherwise it'll be somewhat complicated for callers to use.

Line:2804, src/kv_bucket.cc -> inhibit

Line:870, src/kv_bucket.h -> We've already got a lot of "cross-inclusion" between different modules (I've been trying to reduce this in some other patches to speed up compilation). 

Would it be feasible to use the pimpl idiom here (change to unique_ptr<Manager) and hence not need to #include "collections/manager.h (and consequently other collections headers) here? The main consideration I think is how performance-sensitive is the manager - I would assume not too much given collections changed rarely?
