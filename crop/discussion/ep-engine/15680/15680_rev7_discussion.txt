DESCRIPTION

MB-5231: Temp items in hashtable should be created as non-resident

If a temp item is created and inserted into hash table for a
possibly deleted item, it is marked as nonresident, and when the
background fetch of meta data completes, check if the temp item
is still nonresident before applying the fetched meta data.

                                                                                                                                                           |{

Isn't Jasmin Rangel warning you about this stuff in the commit message when you upload?
