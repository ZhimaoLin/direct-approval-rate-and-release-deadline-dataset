Line:1382, ep.cc -> I don't think it's necessary to add a comment before v->markClean() and v->setNonResident() that says the code marks the thing as clean and non-resident, do you?

Line:1242, ep.cc -> We don't need to check the non-dirty here. Please simplify it to "v && !v->isResident()".

Line:1385, ep.cc -> We don't need to do an additional hash table lookup to set it as clean and non-resident here, but we can set it by passing "isDirty = false, resetValue = true" to hashtable::unlocked_add(...)

Line:2593, ep.cc -> Please add the constructors to item_metadata class so that we don't need to initialize them to 0 separately.

Line:242, warmup.cc -> Please add the constructors to item_metadata class so that we don't need to initialize them to 0 separately.

Line:1875, ep_engine.cc -> Please add the constructors to item_metadata class instead of initializing them individually here.

Line:205, ep_engine.h -> Please add the constructors to item_metadata class so that we don't need to initialize them to 0 separately.
