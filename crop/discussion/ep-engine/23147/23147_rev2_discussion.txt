DESCRIPTION

MB-100: Do not attempt to notify mccouch while shutdown is in progress

When engine is in shutdown mode ep_engine can skip mccouch notification
for the newly updated header location of a vbucket file after commit.
The notification is basically required for the synchronization between
ep_engine and compactor, however, prior to the engine shutdown compactor
must have already exited by ns server.
