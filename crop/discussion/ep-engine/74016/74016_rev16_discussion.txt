Patch Set 16: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:77, src/access_scanner.cc -> You shouldn't need the explicit template parameters here (the whole point of make_pair is it infers them from the arguments).

Line:207, src/access_scanner.cc -> Worth briefly documenting these.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Would be useful to include an extract of the before/after benchmark numbers in the commit message so we can see the effect this change has.
