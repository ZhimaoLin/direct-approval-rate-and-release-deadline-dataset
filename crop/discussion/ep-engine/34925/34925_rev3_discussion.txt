DESCRIPTION

MB-10641 Open a new checkpoint on replica vbucket if required.

There is a case where a given replica is promoted to the new
master when it already receives CHECKPOINT_END message, but not
CHECKPOINT_START message yet from the old master that was just
crashed. In this case, we should open a new checkpoint in the
new master.
