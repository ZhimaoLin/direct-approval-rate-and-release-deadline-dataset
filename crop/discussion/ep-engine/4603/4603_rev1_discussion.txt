DESCRIPTION

Added generic functions htonll and ntohll

These functions convert 64 bits integers from host byte order to network byte order
and vice-versa. They are going to be needed when assembling the messages for the
upcoming SYNC command (the CAS fields in the key specs are 64 bits wide).

Adding Trond... I thought we had one of these available.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Yes, you'll find them in byteorder.c and the prototype in config_static.h (and test for its availability in configure.ac). Modern 64-bit ready operating systems have had these for ages ;-)

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Ah, right.
My man page only lists:

       uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);
       uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);
       uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong);
       uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort);

Therefore I thought a 64 bits version didn't exist.
Ignore this patch then. Thanks

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Despite not being listed in my system's man page, htonll and ntohll already exist.
