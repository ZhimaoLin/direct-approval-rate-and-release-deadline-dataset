DESCRIPTION

Save the vbucket state after deleting the vbucket

If the vbucket has been deleted, along with updating the cached
vbucket state information in memory, the information on disk
also needs to be updated. After bucket shutdown, initialization
of ForestKVStore will read the most accurate state of the vbucket.
