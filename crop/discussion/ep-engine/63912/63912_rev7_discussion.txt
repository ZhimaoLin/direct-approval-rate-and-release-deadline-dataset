DESCRIPTION

MB-19567: Don't set bucket creation to false during vbucket reset

There are 2 tasks that happen during vbucket reset, a vbucket deletion
followed by setting a vbucket state that creates the vbucket files.
Vbucket deletion sets bucket creation to false. A setVbucketState
call only sets bucket creation to true only before scheduling a vbucket
persist task. During this window, a stat call for DCP takeover stats
finds that vbucket deletion is set to false and vbucket creation is
also set to false, thus resulting in an exception being thrown from
getNumPersistedDeletes from CouchKVStore.

Fix: Because a reset involves a deletion followed by a recreation of
a vbucket, vbucket deletion and creation should both be set to true
at the beginning of reset and set to false once the respective tasks
complete.
