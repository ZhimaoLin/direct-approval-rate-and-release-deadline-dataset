DESCRIPTION

MB-19567: Don't set bucket creation to false during vbucket reset

There are 2 tasks that happen during vbucket reset, a vbucket deletion
followed by setting a vbucket state that creates the vbucket files.
Vbucket deletion sets bucket creation to false. A setVbucketState
call only sets bucket creation to true only before scheduling a vbucket
persist task. During this window, a stat call for DCP takeover stats
finds that vbucket deletion is set to false and vbucket creation is
also set to false, thus resulting in an exception being thrown from
getNumPersistedDeletes from CouchKVStore.

Looks good, think a module test to prove this behavior would do good : )

+1 on adding a unit test for this.

Line:542, src/ep.h -> I think it would be better to name this based on what it does, not on who (currently) happens to call it.

Perhaps something like 'clearBucketCreatedFlagOnCompletion' (I can't think of a shorter name!) - maybe you can improve?

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Great description of the issue as encountered. Could you also describe the code changes to fix it?
