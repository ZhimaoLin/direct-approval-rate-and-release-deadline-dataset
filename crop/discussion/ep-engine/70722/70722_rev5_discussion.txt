DESCRIPTION

MB-21917: SerialisedDocKey and test code

Some parts of ep-engine store a document key as part of a larger
memory allocation, e.g. MutationLog has the key inline with other
metadata that it wishes to put to file in a single write.

SerialisedDocKey serves this purpose, it can store all data that
DocKey/StoredDocKey carries, but exists to be allocated into a
pre-allocated buffer.

StoredValue and MutationLog make use of this key object.
