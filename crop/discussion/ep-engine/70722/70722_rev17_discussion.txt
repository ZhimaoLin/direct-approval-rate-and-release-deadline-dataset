DESCRIPTION

MB-21917: SerialisedDocKey and test code

Some parts of ep-engine store a document key as part of a larger
memory allocation, e.g. MutationLog has the key inline with other
metadata that it wishes to put to file in a single write.

SerialisedDocKey serves this purpose, it can store all data that
DocKey/StoredDocKey carries, but exists to be allocated into a
pre-allocated buffer.

StoredValue and MutationLog make use of this key object.

Line:193, src/storeddockey.h -> This doesn't rely on the internal representation so this shouldn't be a member function.

Also you can probably make it so you can compare any two kinds of DocKey with something like (this would obviously belong in 'memcached/dockey.h' so maybe not worth the effort):

````
template<typename T, typename U>
bool operator==(const DocKeyInterface<T>& lhs, const DocKeyInterface<U>& rhs) {
    return lhs.size() == rhs.size() &&
               lhs.getDocNamespace() == rhs.getDocNamespace() &&
               std::memcmp(lhs.data(), rhs.data(), lhs.size()) == 0;
}
````

Line:222, src/storeddockey.h -> Probably worth creating an alias for this

Line:226, src/storeddockey.h -> I believe this is technically invoking undefined behaviour, I believe it would be better to store the pointer in a temporary of uint8_t* and placement new with that pointer instead:

    auto* temp = new uint8_t[getObjectSize(key)];
    return std::unique_ptr<SerialisedDocKey, SerialisedDocKeyDelete>(
            new(temp) SerialisedDocKey(key));

Line:193, src/storeddockey.h -> Agree this can be pushed up, but disagree about being a free function, it allows us to see the operators a class supports by looking at the class def, not looking elsewhere.
