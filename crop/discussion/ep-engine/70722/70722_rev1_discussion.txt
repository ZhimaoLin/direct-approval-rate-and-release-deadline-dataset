DESCRIPTION

MB-21917: SerialisedDocKey and test code

Some parts of ep-engine store a document key as part of a larger
memory allocation, e.g. MutationLog has the key inline with other
metadata that it wishes to put to file in a single write.

SerialisedDocKey serves this purpose, it can store all data that
DocKey/StoredDocKey carries, but exists to be allocated into a
pre-allocated buffer.

StoredValue and MutationLog make use of this key object.

Line:154, src/storeddockey.h -> Maybe highlight that these objects are essentially immutable (as you cannot modify the key length without re-allocating the object)?

Line:238, src/storeddockey.h -> Not sure I follow this comment - bytes should be the correct length by the time we try to copy in, right?

Line:238, src/storeddockey.h -> I'll reword, I just mean that the memcpy is designed to copy outside of what is defined as the class and it's normal

Line:249, src/storeddockey.h -> As I mentioned on the original serialised doc key patch you need a static assert for standard layout to ensure you don't invoke undefined behaviour with your struct hack (as you would have done if this had a virtual base class):

    #include <type_traits>
    static_assert(std::is_standard_layout<SerialisedDocKey>::value, "SeralisedDocKey must be standard layout");
