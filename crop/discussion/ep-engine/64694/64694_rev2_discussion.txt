Line:785, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This is incorrect - snpritnf() returns a signed type (int), but you're immediately assigning it to an unsigned type (keylen). As a consequence you cannot correctly check for underflow.

You should either just rely on the `>=  sizeof(kvsName)` clause (which should work as signed -1 will end up as ~0) or (preferred) be more explicit - assign the result to snprintf() to a temporary of type int, and then the check will work.
