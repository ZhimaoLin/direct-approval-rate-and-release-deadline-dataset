DESCRIPTION

MB-16827: Create bloom filters for vbuckets upon bucket creation

Set up bloom filters for vbuckets immediately as opposed to waiting
for the first compaction to run for the following scenarios:
- upon creation of the bucket
- during rebalance

During warmup, the bloom filters will not be set up as we're not
aware of the deleted items and/or non-resident items at the moment.
The first compaction following the warmup will still be responsible
for setting up the bloom filters.

Line:8407, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think you missed my point - just do:

 checkeq(get_str_stat(...), "ENABLED", "Vbucket 0's bloom filter...");

This was if you get a mismatch the error string will include the actual and expected value, and not just zero.

Line:1329, src/ep.cc -> Nit: I believe the style we are adopting is the ampersand / ptr is part of the type - i.e. to the left of the space.
