DESCRIPTION

MB-22822: Reduce allocation of Blob by 2 bytes

Before we were allocating the sizeof(Blob) + space needed to store the
data. However becuase we had a 1 byte array (data) in order to access
the stored data we were wasting 1 byte by allocating 1 byte too many.

Additionally, because the largest constituent data member is a uint32_t
the compiler would pad a Blob with 1 byte in order to make the
sizeof(Blob) 12. We can account for this by having a 2 byte array
instead and, again, take this in to account when allocating memory so we
do not waste the 2 bytes.

Line:327, src/item.h -> nit: move this static method above the members (some other static functions are above) and also comment the what the function returns

Could you add a small unit test to make sure the size is as you expect?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> remove Before.
i.e. We were ..
