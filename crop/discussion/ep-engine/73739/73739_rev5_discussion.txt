DESCRIPTION

MB-22822: Reduce allocation of Blob by 2 bytes

We were allocating the sizeof(Blob) + space needed to store the
data. However because we had a 1 byte array (data) in order to access
the stored data we were wasting 1 byte by allocating 1 byte too many.

Additionally, because the largest constituent data member is a uint32_t
the compiler would pad a Blob with 1 byte in order to make the
sizeof(Blob) 12. We can account for this by having a 2 byte array
instead and, again, take this in to account when allocating memory so we
do not waste the 2 bytes.

Line:319, src/item.h -> getAllocationSize is correct for our "standard" https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly
