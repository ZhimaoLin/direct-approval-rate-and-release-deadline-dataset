This is not a small change given our release schedule. I'm not sure if we need this change for 2.1.

Line:3401, src/ep_engine.cc -> please correct 9 to 8

Line:164, src/scheduler.h -> Scheduler is a generic one. "readers" and "writers" are specific to the IOManager. I think it will be better to put them in IOManager.
