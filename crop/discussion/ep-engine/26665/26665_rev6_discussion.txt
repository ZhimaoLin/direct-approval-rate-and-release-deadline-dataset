Patch Set 6:

Updated code based on previous comments, thank you.
This is done based on PM's request based on customer requirements. I will leave the final decision to the ep engine team and PM. 

I think we are enable this feature only thru the internal setting thus not visible to everyone. That is also why I didn't expose the new stats by referencing in stats.org.
 
Thanks!

Also, shouldn't this be on the 2.1 branch?

Line:424, configuration.json -> Please add this parameter to the engine_params.org file

Line:93, Makefile.am -> src/workload.h

Line:424, configuration.json -> My understanding is that we are not exposing this to every customers. I am not sure how visible it would become once after we add this parameter to engine_params.org. Let me know.

Line:93, Makefile.am -> Done - good catch thanks!
