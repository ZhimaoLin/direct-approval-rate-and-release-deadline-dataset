This is a good alternative solution but we still need pendingJob() calculation for good reasons I am not going to specify here. Please check my latest patch set where I adopted some your suggestion here though. Thanks!

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Thanks for working on this. Now, I remembered why I didn't rely on stats only. There was a stat underflow issue that I didn't figure out at that time. Jin just identified the culprit to the stat underflow issue.

We will push the new fixes soon. Please abandon this change.
