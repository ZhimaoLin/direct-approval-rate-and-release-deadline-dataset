Line:841, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Nit: I believe the style is to leave a space between the function name and the error message (i.e. between "getAllKeys:" and "Unable")

Line:851, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:861, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:883, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This will be wrong if count is zero - it'll return an extra key. Switch to a while() loop instead of a do .. while - or even a for() loop.
