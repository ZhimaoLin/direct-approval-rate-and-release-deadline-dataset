Line:153, tests/module_tests/collections/vbucket_manifest_test.cc -> Style: For these kind of predicate checks you can get richer output on failure using EXPECT_PRED - see https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/AdvancedGuide.md#predicate-assertions-for-better-error-messages

(No need to change these now, but worth considering for future work).
