DESCRIPTION

Add SpinLock for aggrDcpConsumerBufferSize

aggrDcpConsumerBufferSize is updated in two functions
newConsumerConn and handleDisconnect.  As there can
be multiple consumers it is possible for both
functions to be run at the same time.  Therefore
a lock is required before accessing the
aggrDcpConsumerBufferSize variable.
