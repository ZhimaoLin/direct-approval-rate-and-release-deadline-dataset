Line:1162, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'd like to NOT use the memcached log function in this function, which causes an additional overhead, but rather implement the ep-engine's own log function. Later, we should support to specify a different log level per bucket.

At this time, let's keep this implementation.

Line:1165, src/ep_engine.cc -> white space

Line:267, src/ep_engine.h -> Yes, please declare a bucket name variable in ep-engine entry class.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:267, src/ep_engine.h -> This needs to be fixed since touching the config requires a lock.
