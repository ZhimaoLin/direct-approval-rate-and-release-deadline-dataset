DESCRIPTION

Signal upr connections that might be stuck

In tap we signal connections that haven't been wlked every 5
seconds. This allows us to deal with connections that end up in
wierd states like when we have half open connections. Signaling
the connections will help them get back to the correct state.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:1017, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Using multiple inheritance is adding more confusions to our code base. I know where it is from, but we need to refactor it later.

Line:1032, src/tapconnmap.cc -> As we already know that they are inherited from Notifiable class, please don't use dynamic_cast here.

Line:360, src/tapconnection.h -> Please don't use Atomic as we know that the same memcached worker thread will always update the timestamp, while the other thread simply reads its value. You can use volatile type here.

Line:1017, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Yeah, this didn't work out as well as I had hoped. I do plan on refactoring this out when I can.

Line:1032, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Done. I also fixed the dynamic_cast above.

Line:360, src/tapconnection.h -> I think we can get away without it being either atomic or volatile. Let me know if you think we should still make the variable volatile.
