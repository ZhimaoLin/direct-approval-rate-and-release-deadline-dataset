DESCRIPTION

Deletion of an expired item should be pushed into the checkpoint.

When a deletion event is received from TAP or the normal clients,
it should be soft-deleted from the hash table and also pushed into
the checkpoint.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1339, ep.cc -> Looks like with this change expired items will be returned as NOT_FOUND and as a result not added to the checkpoint queue at all.
