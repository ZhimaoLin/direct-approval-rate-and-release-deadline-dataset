DESCRIPTION

MB-21193: Fix ConnectionTest failure when test runs for >21s

When CV jobs take longer than normal (e.g. when running under
ThreadSanitizer) the ConnectionTest can fail:

    [ RUN      ] ConnectionTest.test_maybesendnoop_buffer_full
    /home/Piper Jefferson/jenkins/workspace/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-watson/ep-engine/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc:308: Failure
    Value of: ret
      Actual: 255
    Expected: ENGINE_E2BIG
    Which is: 8
    maybeSendNoop not returning ENGINE_E2BIG
    [  FAILED  ] ConnectionTest.test_maybesendnoop_buffer_full (656 ms)

The test is assuming that it starts running in less than 21 seconds
when setting the DCP noop timeout. Instead of using an absolute '21'
we need to use the current_time + 21.

TO BE ABANDONED
