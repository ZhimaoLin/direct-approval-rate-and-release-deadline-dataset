DESCRIPTION

MB-15903: Add stats to track number of items lost in DCP rollback.

lost during a DCP rollback. Sice it is a vbucket level stat, it will
get reset when a vbucket is removed.

(6 comments)

My main concern is the conversion from int64_t -> uint64_t without any range checking.

Line:178, src/ep_engine.h -> Style: Please maintain the empty line between the public and private sections.

Line:3894, src/ep.cc -> What happens if the HighSeqno is a negative number? (Given it's represented as a int64_t)..

Line:375, docs/stats.org -> Please add active/replica/pending to the description - these are used in a couple of places (mortimer? the UI?) to generate labels for stats.

Line:401, docs/stats.org -> Ditto

Line:427, docs/stats.org -> Ditto

Line:472, docs/stats.org -> Dittto - could you clarify if this is the total items across all vb states?

Line:178, src/ep_engine.h -> Done

Line:3894, src/ep.cc -> In that case here, the HighSeqno will get casted to a high (but a valid) unit64_t value. This is used for just stats counting. Actual consequences if HighSeqno becomes negative will be more but it is out of scope of this change.

Line:375, docs/stats.org -> This is consistent with all other descriptions.

Line:3894, src/ep.cc -> Thanks for the explanation.

Line:375, docs/stats.org -> True, but I'd argue the others aren't very descriptive ;)

I guess it's ok to leave as-is for now...
