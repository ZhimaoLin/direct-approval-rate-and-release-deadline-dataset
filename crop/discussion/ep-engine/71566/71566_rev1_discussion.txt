DESCRIPTION

Make `Callback` compatible with std::function

There isn't really much purpose to `Callback` in C++11 as most of
its functionality is better handled by std::function (and also allows
the use of lambdas). Unfortunately transitioning is slightly awkward.

By adding an `operator()` overload we can now give callback objects
straight to std::function objects allowing for an incremental
switchover.
