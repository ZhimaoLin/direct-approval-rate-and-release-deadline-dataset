DESCRIPTION

Refactor ep_perfsuite to remove thread duplication

ep_perfsuite has a bunch of similar worker threads which perform
loading. They previously used essentially a union - Handler_Args -
which different workload threads used in different ways.

Refactor to use C++11's std::thread, which we can directly bind thread
arguments to without an intermediate class / struct holding the
arguments.

This means each type of thread can manage it's own arguments, reducing
unused arguments and simplifying thread execution.
