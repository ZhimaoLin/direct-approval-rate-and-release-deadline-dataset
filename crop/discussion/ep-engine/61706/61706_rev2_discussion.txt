DESCRIPTION

Refactor ep_perfsuite to remove thread duplication

ep_perfsuite has a bunch of similar worker threads which perform
loading. They previously used essentially a union - Handler_Args -
which different workload threads used in different ways.

Refactor to create a abstract base class WorkerThread which has one
virtual method run(), and make all worker threads inherit from
that. This means each type of thread can manage it's own arguments,
reducing unused arguments and simplifying thread execution.
