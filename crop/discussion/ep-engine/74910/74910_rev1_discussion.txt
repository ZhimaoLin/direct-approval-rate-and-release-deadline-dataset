DESCRIPTION

Fix defragmenter MappedMemory test by increasing the fuzz_factor

Changes introduced by 883e90ca slightly increased our memory overhead
as StoredValueFactory is now built from an abstract base class
(adding vtable storage cost).

The reviewed commit didn't fail CV, but was committed via cherry-pick,
meaning it picked up a new parent. The combination of the new parent
and the change appears to have increased overhead enough to fail the
defragmenter test.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Surprised that the 8 bytes on StoredValueFactory make this difference - don't we only have one VBucket in the defrag test?

Either way, I can believe we've finally hit the limit, so this seems a reasonable solution.
