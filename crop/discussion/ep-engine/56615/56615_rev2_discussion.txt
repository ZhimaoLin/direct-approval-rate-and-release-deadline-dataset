the stream was created.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:159, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I think it would be better to differentiate the log message at the end of this function, depending on the condition in line 147:

if (stream_created) {
    LOG(...);
} else {
    LOG(...);
}

This will help us understand the log messages when we need to debug stream creation issues.

Line:159, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Agreed. But in the case where the stream needn't be created (when start seqno >= end seqno), the endStream would log a "Stream closing, .." message, with no log regarding its creation.

I think it'd do good to see a "Stream created .. " message before "Stream closing ..".

Line:159, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Then, I'd rather rephrase the log message like "Creating the stream with ..." at the beginning of this function, and then put another log here depending on the condition of line 147.
