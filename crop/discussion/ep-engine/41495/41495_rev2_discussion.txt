Implement the engine API function run_defragmenter_task in
ep_engine. This allows unit-tests to explicitly trigger the
defragmenter.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Wouldn't it be a good idea to have means of triggering this externally - incase we wish to stop and resume the defragmenter based on intensity of workload OR 
when the number of delete/free operations reach a certain percentage threshold?

@Sunder - agreed - and in fact after discussions with Trond I have a version in progress which does use the engine API and instead uses the epctl SET_PARAM interface.
