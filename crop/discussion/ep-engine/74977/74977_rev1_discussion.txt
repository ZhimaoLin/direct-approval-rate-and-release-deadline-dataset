DESCRIPTION

MB-23067: Close file after error injection test

Previously this test would leak a file handle that, on Windows, would
prevent following tests opening or deleting the couchdb file, causign
them to fail. This patch intercepts the arguments passed to the mock
close method and calls close on the file handle after the test finishes.
