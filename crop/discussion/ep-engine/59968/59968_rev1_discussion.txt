Line:236, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Is this actually necessary? I would have thought (hoped?) that for a simple set of strings it could print it itself...

Line:236, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Looks like you should be able to do something like:

INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P(PrintToString,
                        CustomIntegerNamingTest,
                        Range(0, 5),
                        ::testing::PrintToStringParamName());

Line:236, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Doesn't work as `PrintToStringParamName()` wraps the string in quotes
