DESCRIPTION

MB-6052 Don't set seq num and CAS to zero for non-existing items

Due to the replication deduplication, the replica vbucket might
receive the deletion of an item that never exists on that replica
vbucket. To support the XDCR conflict resolution in the above
case, we need to store non-zero sequence number and CAS in the
replica vbucket.
