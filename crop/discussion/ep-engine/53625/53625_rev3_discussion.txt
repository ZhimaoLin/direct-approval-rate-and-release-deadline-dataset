DESCRIPTION

[Unittest-slowdisk] Fix test_est_vb_move

Wait for flusher to settle after checking the
estimate from taptakeover stats. This would avoid
the situtation where wait_for_flusher_to_settle
takes too long on a slow disk, and after that the
number of open checkpoint items is different because
the checkpoint was closed.
