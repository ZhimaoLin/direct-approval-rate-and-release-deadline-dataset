We also need to add some test cases to the ep_testsuite.cc file. Let me know if you need help figuring out how to write test cases.

Line:3547, src/ep_engine.cc -> This won't fit properly with the way our stats work. Each failover entry should be a separate stat. I can show you how this can be done.

Line:1768, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Why is this function commented out? Do we still need it?

Line:144, src/vbucket.h -> 100 failover log entries seems like a lot. Can we make it 25 or do you think that we will need 100 to be safe.

Line:826, src/ep.cc -> We need to pass in a variable here to specify whether or not this was a clean handoff. We chould only create a new failover entry if the vbucket is going to active state and it is not a clean handoff.

Line:3547, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'm not sure what you mean?

Anyway, if you can point me at or write an example that'd be ideal.

Line:1768, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Ah yeah, whoops. This was an initial pass at doing this a different way, should be deleted.

Line:144, src/vbucket.h -> 25 is probably okay.

Line:35, src/failover-table.h -> We need to add an addStats() function here which calls add_stat for each entry in the failover log.
