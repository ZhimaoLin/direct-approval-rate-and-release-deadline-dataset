Patch Set 6:

(8 comments)

Line:261, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Waking up a backfill task needs to happen by vbucket id, not by sequence number.

Line:264, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> This if statement is redundant.

Line:144, src/vbucket.cc -> These will be destroyed automatically. You only need to explicitly delete pointers in destructors.

Line:559, src/vbucket.cc -> can we call this addPersistenceNotification() so that it is more generic. These functions and their variable should have names that have something to do with sequence number persistence notifications.

Line:565, src/vbucket.cc -> can we call this notifySequenceNumberPersisted() so that it is more generic.

Line:568, src/vbucket.cc -> You need to go through all of these because there might be multiple.

Line:571, src/vbucket.cc -> You can use the getStatus() API in the callback to see if the notification succeeded properly. You should only notify if the persistence notification fired.

Line:91, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> You will also need the vbucket id in here.
