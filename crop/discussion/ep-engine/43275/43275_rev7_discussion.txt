Just a few minor comments

Line:250, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> There will only ever be one backfill task per vbucket. Just wakeup the task and return so that we don't go through the rest of the backfills.

Line:554, src/vbucket.cc -> Can we change these variable names to reflect persistence notification?

Line:487, src/vbucket.h -> Let's also change this comment to be more generic and mention persistence notifications.
