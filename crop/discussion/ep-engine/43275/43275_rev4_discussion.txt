Patch Set 4:

(4 comments)

Line:210, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> You can't use "this" because this connection might disappear before persistence happens. You should pass the connection_t.

Line:456, src/vbucket.h -> We should use the callback class here otherwise you need to include dependencies and it is not as generic.

Line:78, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> class BackfillCallback: public Callback<uint64_t>

Line:2936, src/ep.cc -> This should be in the vbucket class and also needs to be guarded by a lock.
