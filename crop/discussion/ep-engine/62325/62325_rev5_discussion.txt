DESCRIPTION

MB-19055: Remove printing of empty string in CouchKVStore::getMulti()

In case of an error in opening a file, an error message is logged.
But the string that is supposed to hold the name of the file is
not populated, thus resulting in an empty string getting printed.
Remove the string from printed as openDB already prints the name
of the file in case of an open failure.
