DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Collections DcpProducer

1. Enable SystemEvent Items in "Item::shouldReplicate"
2. Update DcpProducer so that it grabs the various bits of collection
   data for the transferred events and calls through the engine's dcp
   system_event callback

An update synchrounous engine test now links a MockDcpConsumer to
a MockDcpProducer and drives events from one to the other.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:195, src/dcp/producer.h -> Can we at least keep these protected, and have a Mock inherit and expose them publicly?

Line:281, src/dcp/producer.h -> Ditto

Line:475, src/dcp/response.h -> This seems potentially error-prone - if the creation increases the ref-count, then we need to ensure that the object is destructed so the ref-count is decremented.

Any reason why we can't wrap this in a unique_ptr?

Line:477, src/dcp/response.h -> Style: Slightly more explicit to use size_t (implies a byte count)?

Line:928, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: While apparently legal technically, it's a little misleading to `delete` via a const reference. Suggest dropping the const.

(2 comments)

Line:475, src/dcp/response.h -> This is modelled after MutationResponse, which does something similar, it latches onto the Item it represents via a queued_itm, need to revisit why I made the interface take a queue_item& rather than Item*

Line:477, src/dcp/response.h -> base class (DcpResponse defines the signature, can update them all?)
