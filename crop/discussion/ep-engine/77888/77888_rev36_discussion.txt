Patch Set 36: Code-Review-1

(8 comments)

Looks good. Few minor things.

Line:220, src/item.cc -> Style- extra space (git clang-format will fix this for you).

Line:46, src/dcp/producer.h -> Documentation needs updating.

Line:483, src/dcp/producer.cc -> IMHO it's a bit overkill / over-complex to split this into two try/catch blocks - I'd just have a single try block with both getItemCopy() and pruneValue...() calls in it.

Line:365, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Odd indentation.

Line:395, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> ditto

Line:431, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> ditto

Line:347, src/dcp/response.h -> For future reference - if you're doing single-line Doxygen comments you can do as:

xxx@xxx.xxx pointer to copy of the item.

Line:295, src/dcp/stream.h -> What still uses this method? I suspect it's no longer needed...
