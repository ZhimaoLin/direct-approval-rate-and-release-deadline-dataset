DESCRIPTION

MB-9404 FlushAll should be invoked across all the shards

FlushAll(i.e., database reset) was only invoked with a single
shard before. This can result in an inconsistent state and
doesn't clean up the underlying storage states.

Line:2210, src/ep.cc -> I think we might need to get all of the shard locks before doing this since this function is called only after getting the lock for shard 0. As a result I think it might be possible that flusher is writing to one of the other shards.
