DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Some fixes for Collections::VB::Manifest

1. When looking for manifest entries to delete, only consider open
 entries.

2. When deleting a collection the system event must have the revision
 of the current entry, not the revision of the incoming manifest.

Add a test which pushes a variety of changes to validate we don't
generate new delete events for already deleting collections.
