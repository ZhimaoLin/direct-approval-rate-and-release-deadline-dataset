Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:776, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> I don't think we need to check the return value anymore as it now can return some error codes such as ENOMEM OR TMPFAIL. Please remove this line.

Line:777, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> if (rv != ENGINE_SUCCESS) {
    return rv;
}
