Also, note that a commit title should be one line with max 80 chars. You can put more detailed explanation in a commit body.

Line:808, src/ep_engine.h -> Check if there is any available memory space to allocate an Item instance with a given size.

Line:812, src/ep_engine.h -> I don't think we need to do the type casting to double here as double-precision operation is not required.

Line:813, src/ep_engine.h -> It can be simplified as

return (stats.getTotalMemoryUsed() + nBytes)  <= stats.getMaxDataSize();

Line:2795, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please don't remove the existing test case, but instead add a new one for this change. The same comment for the changes below.
