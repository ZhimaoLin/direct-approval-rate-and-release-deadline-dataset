Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Line:11, tcmalloc/tcmalloc_stats.hh -> Why not put the content of the function in a .cc file? I don't think we need this inlined (and code in the header file will just increase the amount of files that needs to be recompiled if you want to add an extra stat her etc...)
