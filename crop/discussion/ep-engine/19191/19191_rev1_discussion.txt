DESCRIPTION

MB-6087: Set with cas on non-existent item now returns error

In the current implementation if a set with a cas doesn't
have a corresponding value in the hastable we schedule the
item to be persisted and return success. This change makes
it so that we return a KEY_ENOENT error and skip scheduling
persistence.
