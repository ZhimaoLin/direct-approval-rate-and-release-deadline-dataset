DESCRIPTION

CBD-485 WIP - Database compaction manager

The database compaction manager is responsible for compacting
a vbucket database periodically.

This change shows the better control and behavior in disk write
queue drain at the expense of a little more disk overhead
because both flusher and compaction manager are running through
the same dispatcher thread.
