DESCRIPTION

CBD-485 Database compaction manager is newly introduced.

The database compaction manager is responsible for compacting
a vbucket database periodically.

Both compaction manager and flusher are scheduled by the same
dispatcher thread. Every time the flusher finishes a single
transaction (10K items by default), the compaction manger is
then scheduled and compacts N number (3 vbuckets by default,
but configurable at runtime) of vbucket files if their
fragmentation ratios are above the threshold (30% by default,
but also configurable at runtime).
