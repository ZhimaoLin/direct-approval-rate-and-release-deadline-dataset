DESCRIPTION

CBD-485 Support vbucket database compaction.

each vbucket database right before persisting its dirty items,
if its fragmentation ratio is currently greater than
the threshold.

Patch Set 12:

This is mostly ready for review, but we still didn't decide whether it is merged for 2.0. Performance team is doing more large-scale tests.

Please let me know if you have better ideas.

Line:1976, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> In this case, it failed openDB with the new_rev db file, but it had removed the previous db file with rev = revnum. Won't we have a case that we would not be able to recover the old db file?

Dunno how couchstore handles this. But, I think we should make sure the new db file is OK before we drop the old one.

Line:1517, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Is it too costly to do the getFragmentatioRatio check in every saveDocs call? What about moving the check to some dispatcher job and notify flusher to do compactDatabase before saveDocs?

Line:1976, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Good point. We do check if the compaction is completed successfully above, but that doesn't mean that the open on the new file would be always successful. One thing that we can do here is that if the open on the new file failed, we can then switch to the old file and delete the new file and perform the compaction in the next time.

Line:1517, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't think it costs too much, but definitely it's doable. Let's add it as a separate commit.
