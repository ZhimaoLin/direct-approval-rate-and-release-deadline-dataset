DESCRIPTION

Create a new checkpoint if memory usage is high during backfill

If memory usage is very high on the destination node during backfill,
we should allow the destination to create a new checkpoint for a
replica vbucket. The reason is that any items from the current open
checkpoint on the replica vbucket cannot be evicted even though they
were already persisted.

After the backfill is completed, the creation of checkpoint on the
destination node will be fully controlled by the source node.
