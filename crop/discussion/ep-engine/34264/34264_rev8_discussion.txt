DESCRIPTION

MB-9986 ensure futureQueue's heap sort

Windows ep-engine unit tests enabling fix..
Microsoft Visual Studio has a debug heap checker which
requires that STL container priority_queue always satisfies
the HEAPIFY property. In GIO's implementation it is possible
that futureQueue can disobey the heap sort property temporarily
when we wake and cancel tasks.
To fix, always re-sort queue when task is woken or cancelled
