DESCRIPTION

MB-9986: GIO:Enforce futureQueue's heap sort

Add new task state TASK_SLEEPING whenever task is snooze
and wakeup when pushed into readyQueue
Microsoft Visual Studio has a debug heap checker on which requires
that the STL container priority_queue always satisfies the HEAPIFY
property. In GIO's implementation it is possible that futureQueue
can disobey the heap sort property temporarily when we wake and
cancel tasks.
