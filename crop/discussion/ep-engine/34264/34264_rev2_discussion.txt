DESCRIPTION

MB-9986: GIO:Enforce futureQueue's heap sort

Windows ep-engine unit tests enabling fix..
Add new task state TASK_SLEEPING whenever task is pushed
in futureQueue and TASK_RUNNING when pushed into readyQueue
as well as when it needs to be woken or cancelled.

Microsoft Visual Studio has a debug heap checker on which
requires that the STL container priority_queue always satisfies
the HEAPIFY property. In GIO's implementation it is possible
that futureQueue can disobey the heap sort property temporarily
when we wake and cancel tasks.
