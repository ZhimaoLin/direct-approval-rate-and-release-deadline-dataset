DESCRIPTION

MB-9986: GIO:Enforce futureQueue's heap sort

Windows ep-engine unit tests enabling fix..
Add new task state TASK_SLEEPING whenever task is pushed
in futureQueue and TASK_RUNNING when pushed into readyQueue
as well as when it needs to be woken or cancelled.
Microsoft Visual Studio has a debug heap checker which
requires that STL container priority_queue always satisfies
the HEAPIFY property. In GIO's implementation it is possible
that futureQueue can disobey the heap sort property temporarily
when we wake and cancel tasks.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Sundar, the partial rollback unit test case that we were discussing, still seems to remain stuck at wait_for_flusher_to_settle infinitely, on mac.

I noticed that test case issue about an hour ago and I don't think it's related. I've held off merging the rest of my code until I find the cause. Please feel free to merge this though.

Also, I haven't seen that test case hang yet, but I have seen it crash.

This is a different failure, here it hangs, doesn't crash.

For some reason my machine does not hit this hang in the test case.

Just a nitpick: C++ normally use camelCase for member functions
