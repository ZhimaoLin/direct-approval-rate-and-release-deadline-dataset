DESCRIPTION

MB-4990 Fix to the bug in resetting a cursor for backfill

If backfill is required for a given vbucket, we remove the
corresponding checkpoint cursor from that vbucket and then set
the cursor to the beginning of that vbucket's open checkpoint when
the backfill is actually started. In this way, we can send live
mutations to the destination by moving the cursor after backfill
is completed.

There is a bug in removing a checkpoint cursor temporarily from
the vbucket. The cursor has to be removed when we are sure that
the backfill is going to be scheduled for a given vbucket.

Patch Set 1:

branch-18 is going to be used for 1.8.2 release. branch-18 is based on the master branch, but is quite different from branch-181. That's the reason that I uploaded the same, but separate fix into 1.8 branch in addition to branch-181.
