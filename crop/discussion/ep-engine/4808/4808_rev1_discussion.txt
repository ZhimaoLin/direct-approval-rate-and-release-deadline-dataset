DESCRIPTION

Prevent more race conditions on SyncListener instances

When a SyncListener instance is destroyed, there might be other
threads trying to acquire its mutex (via SyncRegistry::notifyListeners).
In such cases, ep-engine dies with an uncaught std::runtime_error
exception thrown by the Mutex instance (mutex.hh) as a reaction to
a pthread mutex lock call failure.
