Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

This feels like logic which should live purely in ForestKVStore. ep-engine itself shouldn't care about what the underlying store does with compaction. 

We're probably going to introduce a third KVstore subclass for the ephemeral bucket (EphemeralKVStore which mostly is a no-op), and hence we shouldn't be polluting subclass-specific logic in ep-engine.
