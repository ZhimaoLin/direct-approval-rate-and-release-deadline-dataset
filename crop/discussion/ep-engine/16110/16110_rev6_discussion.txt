DESCRIPTION

MB-5215 Couchstore needs to persist TTL

Mark a resident item dirty and schedule it into checkpoint upon mutating
its expiration time (from touch/gat/gatq). If the item is non-resident,
still mark it dirty, initiate backgound fetch, and schedule it again into
checkpoint within background fetch completion. This change allows ep engine
and couchstore to persist mutated expiration time without introducing
new api, set_meta.
