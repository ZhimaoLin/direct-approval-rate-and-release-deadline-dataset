DESCRIPTION

MB-19033: Release cookie if newProducer/newConsumer fails

In the dcpOpen function we first call reserveCookie on a
connection object and then call newProducer/newConsumer
to create a new connection.

If the newProducer/newConsumer fails to create a new
connection and instead returns a nullptr we must call
releaseCookie before returning ENGINE_DISCONNECT.

A test is also added to ep_testsuite_dcp that provide a
regression test for the fix.
