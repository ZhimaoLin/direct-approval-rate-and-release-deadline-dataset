DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [14/N]: Improve debug/logging in CheckpointManager

Include information on the CheckpointCursors associated with a
CheckpointManager by adding a operator<< for CheckpointCursor. Add a
dump() method to CheckpointManager to assist in debugging their
contents (e.g. from gdb).

Also add some additional CheckpointManager/CouchKVStore logging.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:806, src/checkpoint.h -> I'm not sure I see the "value" of this? can't the caller just call 

    std::cerr << object << std::endl;

(and also be able to dump elsewhere than cerr...)

Line:806, src/checkpoint.h -> The advantage of this is I can call it from a debugger (gdb, lldb) pretty easily as long as I have the address of an object. 

I'm not sure I could convince GDB to invoke a stream operator on an object and wire it into std::cerr ;)
