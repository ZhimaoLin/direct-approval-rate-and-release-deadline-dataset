DESCRIPTION

MB-17231: conditionally delete temp items in get API

There are some conditions in which there might be a need to retain
a temporary non-existent item. For example, in the context of an
arithmetic API call, a get call in full eviction results in a
temp non-existent item that needs to be retained in order for a
subsequent ADD operation to not perform another background fetch.
