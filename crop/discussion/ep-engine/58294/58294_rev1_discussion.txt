DESCRIPTION

MB-17231: conditionally delete temp items in get API

There are some conditions in which there might be a need to retain
a temporary non-existent item. For example, in the get API call
in full eviction mode, a temp non-existent item has to be retained
in order for a subsequent ADD operation to not perform another
background fetch.
