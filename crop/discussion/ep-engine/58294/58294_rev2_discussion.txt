DESCRIPTION

MB-17231: conditionally delete temp items in get API

There are some conditions in which there might be a need to retain
a temporary non-existent item. For example, in the context of an
arithmetic API call, a get call in full eviction results in a
temp non-existent item that needs to be retained in order for a
subsequent ADD operation to not perform another background fetch.

Patch Set 2:

Given this is the second instance of a problem like this (the first being the TOUCH bug), could we adjust the test cases to run as many tests as possible with full_eviction? - i.e. something like run all the front-end command tests a second time with item_eviction_policy set to full?

Sriram,

As we discussed, we need to make a separate change in the test config to run all the unit tests with the full eviction mode as part of commit validation.

Line:268, src/ep_engine.h -> As a separate code refactoring, I think we should now consider defining enum classes and pass them to EPStore::Get instead of passing three bool variables.

Line:334, src/ep_engine.h -> (false, false) should be passed to maintain the same logic as before.
