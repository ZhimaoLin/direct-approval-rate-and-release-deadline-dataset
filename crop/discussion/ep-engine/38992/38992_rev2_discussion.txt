Patch Set 2:

Line:144, src/upr-consumer.cc -> If we have made the streams a RCPtr then it already has a lock to guarantee ref count. Do we still need to do a copy here as opposed to a reference? Esp since PassiveStream has buffers which get copied too?

Line:144, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Sorry for the noise - forgot that the RCPtr will not copy the actual value.
