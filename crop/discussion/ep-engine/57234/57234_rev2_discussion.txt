DESCRIPTION

Fix ThreadSanitiser issue found with TapProducer

The problem occurs because we're reading expiry time unlocked
but set it with the queueLock held.

It seems that the disconnect logic should really look at the 3 "elements" it cares
about in a consistent way, so the new disconnect method locks the producer and
evaluates all 3 parts.

TSAN output (shortened):
