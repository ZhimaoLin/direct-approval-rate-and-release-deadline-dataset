DESCRIPTION

MB-15653: fix more memory leaks in forest-kvstore

cachedVBStates is a vector which needs to be initialized
correctly by either insert or push_back. Without this the new
vbucket_state elements are lost and there is memory leaked.
Also fix minor memory leaks in test code.

Line:109, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> hmm, I think we need to use a more efficient data structure to maintain the vbucket states for each shard, which should be addressed in a separate commit later.
