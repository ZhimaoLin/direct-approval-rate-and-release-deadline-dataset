DESCRIPTION

MB-15653: fix more memory leaks in forest-kvstore

cachedVBStates is a vector which needs to be initialized
correctly by either insert or push_back. Without this the new
vbucket_state elements are lost and there is memory leaked.
Also fix minor memory leaks in test code.

Line:290, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Note if you made cachedVBStates be a vector of unique_ptr<> then you wouldn't need to worry about deleting an old element before replacing it.

Line:290, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Thanks Dave. However I noticed that our usage of cachedVBStates does not even require the use of vectors. I will make a separate change for this later.
