DESCRIPTION

MB-18095: Refactor dcp_stream() in ep_testsuite_dcp

Refactor the way arguments are passed to dcp_stream(..,..,)
in ep_testsuite_dcp. This is to assist in adding tests in the
future to facilitate streaming from multiple vbuckets under the
umbrella of a single producer.

Line:149, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> I thought the idea was to do away with the ctx-> For that dcp_stream() should be a public method in the class Dcp_Stream_Ctx. So you create a Dcp_Stream_Ctx object and then call the method dcp_stream() on it.

Line:149, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Yes, but to have multiple streams under the given consumer, we need separate stream and consumer objects. All the stream objects will need to be fed to the consumer class, see dependent patch.

Think DaveR suggested that too in the earlier patch.
