DESCRIPTION

MB-21320: Notify memcached to visit readyQ and get any ready items

We should notify memcached to visit readyQ and get any items that were
pushed there during stream creation. Also, we must notify the memcached
about cursor dropping so that it can visit ep-engine and stream any
pending items and do a subsequent stream state change.
