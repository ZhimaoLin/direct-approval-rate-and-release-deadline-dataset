Line:803, docs/stats.org -> Can you elaborate on what a 'blob' object is?

Line:810, docs/stats.org -> Similary, can you elaborate on what 'storedval' objects are? Are these the StoredValue objects?

Line:803, docs/stats.org -> a "blob" object is the actual value stored.. it is a reference counted object, and is shared by StoredValue and Item (and queued_item). I don't think its worth putting too much information in the stats.org file, because this number wouldn't say the average user much. It require some detailed knowledge about the internals of the system to be used for anything meaningful.

Line:810, docs/stats.org -> All of these values are actually just system-internal counters that will help "us" from understanding where the memory is allocated. They're not very useful for the end user.
