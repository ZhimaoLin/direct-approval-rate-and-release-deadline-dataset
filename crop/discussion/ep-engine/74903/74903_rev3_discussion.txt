DESCRIPTION

MB-22163: Optimize get_if for value eviction

If we're using value eviction we should be able to call
the filter method with the meta-data stored in the hashtable
without having to fetch the value off disk.

Line:2171, src/ep_engine.cc -> Style: I think it would be clearer to read if you used a switch() on the status - then it's easier to see exactly which codes are/arn't handled without extra nesting.

Line:2178, src/ep_engine.cc -> If you're not going to include the VB UUID in the item_info passed to the filter, then we should document that the VB UUID is always zero in the get_if.

(Alternatively you could just include it - it's probably pretty cheap to fetch at this point).

Line:2225, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> I believe get_if() /should/ work for Ephemeral buckets. 

If it's currently not working (and we need to fix later), please use prepare_skip_broken_under_ephemeral() instead and add a comment (see similar uses above).

Line:2171, src/ep_engine.cc -> All of them are handled, except two codes are remapped if we're in degraded mode... (for backwards compatibility)

Line:2178, src/ep_engine.cc -> I guess I could ... It just seemed weird to me that the item I fetched from the underlying storage _DIDN'T_ include that vbucket UUID and that I had to explicitly add it (it seems a bit racy to pick that one out after I got the item...) 

I'll take a look at this tomorrow

Line:2225, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> The test is using evict, and I assume that won't work for ephemeral?

Line:2178, src/ep_engine.cc -> I don't mind too much either way (we do't need it here), just want to ensure it's clear to the caller what information is available to them.

Line:2225, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> The evict part certainly won't; but it would be good to test the rest of it. 

There's a helper method - isPersistentBucket() which you can use to conditionalise parts of the ep_testsuite tests - would be nice to use that for just the evict parts.
