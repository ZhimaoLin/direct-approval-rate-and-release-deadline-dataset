DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: In warmup, incr numTotalItems only when an item is inserted into ht

During warmup, we must increment the numTotalItems count in hash table only
after an item is put onto hash table. It is not wise to set the numTotalItems
value to a number promised by the underlying storage module before all those
items are read from the storage.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Realized this is not correct. In FULL_EVICTION mode, all keys might not be loaded from the disk and hence the count of "numTotalItems" in Hash Table can go wrong.

This brings the question, whether we should refactor the stats in hash table ? Item stats should be rather part of Vbucket class ? This should be considered carefully as retaining certain hash table stats might be helpful in debugging hash table related stuff.

Will create a KV-Goodness ticket for now as this is not very critical for ephemeral buckets release

I think in the abstract, the HashTable object should only care about counts inside itself - so for example a count of how many StoredValues it contains, maybe a count of how many of those StoredValues have had their /value/ evicted (given that HashTable knows about Value Eviction.

In terms of Full-Eviction, conceptually that's something which the HashTable doesn't know anything about (as nothing is stored in it for them). As such, any stats relating to things like how many items might exist in total in the VBucket, but /not/ held by the HashTable should be in the VBucket.

I agree we can defer this for now, but yes it would be good to write up an MB explaining the issues.
