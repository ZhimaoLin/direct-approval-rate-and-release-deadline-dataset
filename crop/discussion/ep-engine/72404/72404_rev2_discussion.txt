DESCRIPTION

MB22015: Replace new with make_STRCptr in warmup

Provides the nessecary copy constructor to allow for an implicit
conversion from SingleThreadedRCPtr<Derived> to
SingleThreadedRCPtr<Base>.

Adds a make_STRCptr function to allow for the creation of
SingleThreadedRCPtrs in a way that avoids directly using 'new'.
