Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Line:1217, src/connmap.cc -> I think we should be able to just create one instance of this task (see ConnNotifier for TAP) and then just wake it if it's asleep.

TAP uses an AtomicQueue to hold the set of connections which need to be notified (pendingNotifications); I think we can do something similar here. 

I'm at a recruitment event most of today, but if I get chance I'll try making some changes along these lines...

Line:1217, src/connmap.cc -> You're right, that should significantly improve things here.
I'll push an other patch soon.
