Line:944, src/connmap.cc -> the config.getXXX() methods are a bit expensive (need to acquire a mutex and then search a std::map). Probably worth pulling this out of the loop.

Line:951, src/connmap.cc -> Shouldn't "10" be configured from config.getDcpProducerNotifierYieldLimit()?

Line:432, src/connmap.h -> Where is this class used? I couldn't see it.

Line:521, src/connmap.h -> vbucket seqno should be uint64_t

Line:312, docs/stats.org -> I couldn't find the code that returns this stat.

I'm -1 until I understand the profiling i'm seeing. seeing a thread doing 6 to 10% of its time in _ZN10DcpConnMap15notifyProducersEv

Line:944, src/connmap.cc -> Roger that, will pull out via constructor i think

Line:951, src/connmap.cc -> eep, yes.

Line:1233, src/connmap.cc -> Seeing this guy riding high in profiling, maybe the change to an atomic array is too much, hmm will update after more research

Line:432, src/connmap.h -> Ah, dead code now iirc. Will update in due course

Line:521, src/connmap.h -> Done

Line:312, docs/stats.org xxx@xxx.xxx can you answer, this came from your original patch
