Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

Line:1221, src/connmap.cc -> I think we need to hold the vbConnsLock until we have wNathalie Landryed the conns list - as otherwise the iterator could be invalidated if for example a connection was added / removed while notifying.

Line:10154, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> If we are now only checking for non-negative, then the check is essentially pointless and we should just remove it.

Line:1221, src/connmap.cc -> you're right, i'll change this so that the log is held until all the items in conns have been notified.
