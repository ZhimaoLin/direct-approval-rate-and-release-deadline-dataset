Line:1187, src/connmap.cc -> Given that we need to search this container for a specific vbid, it might be more efficient to use a std::unordered_map. What can still be iterated on (but only in forward direction) which should be sufficient for notifyProducers().

Line:1226, src/connmap.cc -> Style: I'd probably move this within the previous if (!notificaitons.empty()) check and get rid of the process bool.

Line:478, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> If you're just using check() then you won't get the values printed out - might be worth adding them to the message to aid in debugging.

Line:486, configuration.json -> Nit: Ideally this should be in alphabetical order (it looks like this file started sorted, then people added stuff in a random order). Probably worth at least moving this next to the other DCP stuff...

Line:310, docs/stats.org -> Ditto on ordering.

Note the description of this looks wrong - the actual code for this gives a bool result, not a count.
