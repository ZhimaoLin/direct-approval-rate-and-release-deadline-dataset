store/delete/(front-end) OP latencies.

Line:1188, src/connmap.cc -> Why are we still creating a new Task each time - can't we just reuse the same one like TAP does?

Line:206, src/connmap.h -> I'm not very keen on this - having a public method which returns a (non-const) set of internal state sounds like a bad idea.

Line:510, src/connmap.h -> If you change this to an AtomicQueue (like TAP) then we don't need the mutual exclusion.
