DESCRIPTION

MB-16632: QueueDirty to queue pending DCP producer notifications

Every time an item is added to the dirty queue, it will now
add a pending notification to a queue that will be read by
a NONIO Daemon task which will be responsible for notifying
all the DCP producers.

This pretty much removed the notifications' lock overhead on
store/delete/(front-end) OP latencies.

Patch Set 15: Code-Review-2

(5 comments)

Line:963, src/connmap.cc -> This isn't safe, the underlying Task::state is an atomic type, but just reading it doesn't guarantee the task isn't just about to transition from running->snooze, we read "running" then it switches to snooze and our notify is never seen.

Line:1215, src/connmap.cc -> We've regressed back to a DcpConnMap level lock :( this is bad.

Line:1266, src/connmap.cc -> Again a DcpConnMap lock is going to be contended by all vbuckets

Line:518, src/connmap.h -> This is 1 lock for all vbuckets :(

Line:521, src/connmap.h -> make this atomic so we can increment safely without a secondary lock
