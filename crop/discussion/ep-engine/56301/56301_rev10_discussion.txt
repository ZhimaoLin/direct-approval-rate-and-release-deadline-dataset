Patch Set 10: Code-Review+1

This looks good, but we need to figure out that the "best" set of patches is, both for master and for 3.x (assuming we backport). 

For 3.x we may want to choose a simpler set of patches which we can have high confidence in their correctness even if they don't give us the maximum performance boost.
