DESCRIPTION

MB-18135: Check for the existence of dead connections

Dead connections are usually cleaned-up by manageConnections.
manageconnections is invoked in the run() of ConnManager,
which is a NONIO Task.  The task has a MIN_SLEEP_TIME of 2s,
which means dead connections will only be clean-up at most
every 2s.  Therefore if we delete a bucket which calls the
shutdownAllConnections function it is possible for dead
connections remain.  This causes the function
responsible for destroying a bucket to wait indefinitely
for the dead connections to be disconnected.

The fix is to ensure that all dead connections are
cleaned-up in the shutdownAllConnections function.

A corresponding test is also introduced that checks to
see if dead connections remain after calling the
shutdownAllConnections function.

Line:112, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> You're missing the call to engine_v1->destroy() in this function (before destroy_engine()) - given that the SetUp function calls create_instance.

Line:112, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> The destroy is different for the different test cases.
In the stream test we can pass false
In the connection case we need to pass true (because we have had to setMaxNonIO to 0.
Also in the connection case.  We need to call  engine_v1->destroy() before delete connMap.  Because although the task does not run.  It gets cleaned up during the  engine_v1->destroy().  (This issues was found with valgrind).

Shall I move the create Instance outside of the Setup?

Line:112, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Ultimately the issue is the asymmetry for me - the TearDown() function should destroy exactly what was created in SetUp().

Can we not just always pass force==true? It might be better to always set MaxNonIO to 0 in the base class anyways, as that should give more deterministic test behaviour.

Line:112, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> We can do that.  And set MaxNonIO to zero in both cases.
However does address the problem of connmap needing to be deleted after engine_v1->destroy() .

One option to create a connmap in the base case.  But your stream tests would not use it - which does not feel right.
