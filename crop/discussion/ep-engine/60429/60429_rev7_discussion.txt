DESCRIPTION

MB-18135: Test for checking the existence of dead connections

Dead connections are usually cleaned-up by manageConnections.
manageconnections is invoked in the run() of ConnManager,
which is a NONIO Task.  The task has a MIN_SLEEP_TIME of 2s,
which means dead connections will only be clean-up at most
every 2s.  Therefore if we delete a bucket which calls the
shutdownAllConnections function it is possible for dead
connections remain.  This causes the function
responsible for destroying a bucket to wait indefinitely
for the dead connections to be disconnected.

The test being introduced checks to see if dead connections
remain after calling the shutdownAllConnections function.
The test is currently disabled.

A subsequent patch will provide a fix for MB-18135 whereby
the shutdownAllConnections function cleans-up dead
connections.  The test will be enabled in the subsequent
patch.
