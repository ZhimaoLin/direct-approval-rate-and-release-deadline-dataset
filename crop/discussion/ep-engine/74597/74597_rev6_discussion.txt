DESCRIPTION

OrderedStoredValue [2/4]: Create base class for StoredValueFactory

In preparation for introducing a new OrderedStoredValueFactory, create
an abstract base class for StoredValueFactory, moving the factory code
into it's own file.

Also some smaller cleanups:

* Add class documentation to StoredValue.
* Move getRequiredStorage from protected to public, this removes the
  need for friendship between StoredValue and test code.
