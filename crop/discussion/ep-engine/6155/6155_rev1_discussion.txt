DESCRIPTION

Allow more tap mutations to be queued if memory usage is not high.

This change mitigates the strict constraints on the persistence
queue size in determining if a given TAP mutation is processed or
not. This strict constraint sometimes causes too many nacks from
the destination node even if it has a capacity to process it.
