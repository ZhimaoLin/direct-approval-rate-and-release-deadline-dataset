DESCRIPTION

MB-4715 Fix to backup validation in backup_util.py

mbbackup-merge-incremental is unable to consistantly merge the
incremental backup files which are created by splitting
one checkpoint into multiple backup files. This patch changes
validate_incremental_backup_files() to return backup files in
stable sorted order by comparing checkpoints. If backup split
files of one checkpoint is given, validate_incremental_backup_files()
should return backup file list in the same order of backup file list
given as argument.
