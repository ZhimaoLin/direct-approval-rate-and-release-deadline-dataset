DESCRIPTION

MB-3700 Allow an active vbucket to receive checkpoint messages

Currently, when a given vbucket is in the active state, it will not
accept checkpoint start/end messages. This will cause a significant
migration problem with older releases which did not enforce
master/slave behavior.

This changes supports
1) A way for the "downstream" master to accept checkpoint begin/end
messages along with sets/gets and any other mutation request.
2) An additional ep_engine parameter to enable this behavior.

It's known that this will lead to inconsistent checkpoints for that
given vbucket between the master and the downstream.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

So this fix also addresses the issue that a give active vbucket won't accept checkpoint start/end message if no configuration is set.
