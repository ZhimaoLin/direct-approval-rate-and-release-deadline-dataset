DESCRIPTION

MB-9107: During Backfill don't read resident values off disk

We remove in-memroy backfilling in a previous commit and this
can cause backfilling to be slow if most of the items are in
memory. This change allows us to skip reading values off of disk
if the values already exist in memory.

I need to further understand two backfill changes including this, and would like to discuss them offline.
