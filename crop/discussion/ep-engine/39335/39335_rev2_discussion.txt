DESCRIPTION

MB-11661 Remove unreferenced closed checkpoints by item pager.

This change allows the item pager to remove unreferenced closed
checkpoints, so that it can free some memory before attempting to
eject items from the vbucket hash table. In this way, we can
avoid ejecting innocent (frequently accessed) items from hashtable.
