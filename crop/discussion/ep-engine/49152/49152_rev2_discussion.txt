Line:7527, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't think we should stop the persistence here because PersistenceCallback won't be invoked if the flusher is stopped.

Line:7528, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Rather, please stop the flusher here, and get the corresponding stats to figure out if the deletion is persisted or not, and then check the bloom filter key count below by checking the deletion persistence.
