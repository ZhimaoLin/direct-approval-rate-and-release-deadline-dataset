Hi Mike, do you suggest we run some performance tests with a build only with this change (toy build or a next build after merge)? This way we know for sure what performance gain or regression we might have caused with this merge.

Line:203, src/flusher.cc -> I remembered that there is a case where the disk write queue becomes empty, but we just received the high priority checkpoint persistence. That's why we added this additional check. Otherwise, the rebalance will get slower in that case.
