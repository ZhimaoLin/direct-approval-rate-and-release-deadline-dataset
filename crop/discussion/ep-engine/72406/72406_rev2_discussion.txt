(4 comments)

Line:511, src/warmup.cc -> You should be able to use auto here as a std::shared_ptr<NotifyFlusherCB> should automatically convert to a std::shared_ptr<Callback<uint16_t>> when it's passed as an argument.

Line:606, src/warmup.cc -> ditto

Line:609, src/warmup.cc -> ditto

Line:699, src/warmup.cc -> This can actually just be on the stack:

    LoadStorageKVPairCallback load_cb{store, true, state.getState()};
