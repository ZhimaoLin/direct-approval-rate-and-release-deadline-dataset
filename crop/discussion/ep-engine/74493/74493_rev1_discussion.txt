DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Add a class that stores ordered sequence of items in memory

This commit adds an abstract base class 'SequenceList' that provides apis
to store ordered sequence of items (StoredValues) in memory in our
multi-threaded, monotonically increasing seq model.

It also adds 'BasicLinkedList', a concrete class that implements SequenceList.
'BasicLinkedList' uses a boost intrusive doubly linked list. It is essentially
a linked list of 'StoredValues'.

Currently, only appendToList() functionality is implemented. But the goal is,
'BasicLinkedList' works in tandem with already existing 'HashTable' to achieve
O(1) writes/updates, O(1) reads and range reads. Range read is necessary for
an in-memory DCP backfill. Range reads provide point-in-time snapshots which
is essential for our incremental DCP.

And a module test is added as well.
