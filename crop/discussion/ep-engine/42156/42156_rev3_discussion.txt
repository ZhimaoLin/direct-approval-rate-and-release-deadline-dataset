DESCRIPTION

MB-12352 Remove unnesscary couchstore open/reads from backfill

Profiling showed that disk reads were happening as part of a 100% resident rebalance.
Spotted we need to scan disks using sequence numbers, it was observed
though that we open and pread from a DB file twice during backfill.

1. How many items for stat reporting
2. Scan for items using sequence number

For efficiency we can merge these together.

CacheCallback uses backfillReceived and that now counts into backfillTotal.
This has a big impact on the number of preads required in the initial backfill phase.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The main issue is that we use the backfill remaining stat in the UI so we cannot just get rid of it that easily. The other problem with this change in general is that the backfill remaining needs to be set when the backfill starts and then decremented as items are read off of disk in order to be displayed properly in the UI. If this wasn't the case then I would just delete it. So I'm still trying to think about what we can do here to get the performance improvement. Otherwise I would just remove the backfill remaining stat all together.

Isn't the UI backfill remaining though keyed off a different stat?

Yes, that that stat is aggregated from the individual (per connection) backfill remaining stat.
