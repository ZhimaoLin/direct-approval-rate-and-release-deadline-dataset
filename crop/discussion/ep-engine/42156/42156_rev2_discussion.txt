DESCRIPTION

MB-12352 Remove unnesscary couchstore open/reads from backfill

Profiling showed that disk reads were happening as part of a 100% resident rebalance.
Spotted we need to scan disks using sequence numbers, so ok for the reads, it was observed
though that we open and pread from a DB file twice.

1. How many items for stat reporting
2. Scan for for items using sequence number

For efficiency we can merge these together.

CacheCallback uses backfillReceived and that now counts into backfillTotal.
This has a big impact on the number of preads required in the initial backfill phase.
