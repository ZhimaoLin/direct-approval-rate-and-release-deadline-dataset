DESCRIPTION

Move cache and meta data sizing functions to HashTable

These functions effectively manipulate the cache and
meta data size of the hashtable. So, move these functions
to the HashTable class

The move of the hash table sizing functions to the HashTable class makes sense and is a nice improvement, but I think we end up with unnecessary complexity in making them public and having StoredValue call them - essentially we are still tightly coupling the StoredValue and HashTable classes.

I think it would be preferable if the HashTable tracked it's own statistics - i.e. make the increaseMetaDataSize() etc. methods private and have HashTable call them when it adds / remove a StoredValue from the HashTable.

That way you no longer have to pass a HashTable& into the StoredValue constructors.

This approach also has the advantage that items which are no longer in the HashTable but still exist (for example; with Ephemeral buckets you can have StoredValues which are owned by the SequenceList but not in the HashTable).

Line:36, src/stored-value.cc -> Style: This should be indented to 4 columns. `git clang-format` should do the correct formatting for you.

Line:74, src/stored-value.cc -> Same
