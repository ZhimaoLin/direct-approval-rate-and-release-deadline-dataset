DESCRIPTION

MB-11418: Do not generate access log when resident ratio is greater than 95%

When resident ratio is high, reading from access log during warmup
does not give any benefits and will only slow down warmup process.
Hence, it is good not to generate access log when resident ratio is
greater than 95%
