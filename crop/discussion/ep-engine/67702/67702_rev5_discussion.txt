DESCRIPTION

MB-20822: When loading persisted failovers, remove any erroneous entries

Due to bugs in older releases (and also possibly in future releases),
we may end up storing wrong failover table on disk. Hence during
warmup while loading failover table from disk we must prune out any
wrong entries.

Also, in the past we have seen erroneous entries with vb_uuid == 0.
So we make sure that vb_uuid is not generated as a valid value and
prune out any entry that has vb_uuid == 0

Line:57, src/failover-table.cc -> Do you not need the lock before you grab this? What if the table changes size before you acquire the lock?
