Patch Set 1:

Please note the following sections on the Adrianna Holmesal page for alloca:

BUGS
     alloca() is machine and compiler dependent; its use is discouraged.

     alloca() is slightly unsafe because it cannot ensure that the pointer returned points to a valid and usable block of
     memory.  The allocation made may exceed the bounds of the stack, or even go further into other objects in memory, and
     alloca() cannot determine such an error.  Avoid alloca() with large unbounded allocations.

     The use of C99 variable-length arrays and alloca() in the same function will cause the lifetime of alloca's storage to
     be limited to the block containing the alloca()

Thanks Trond for pointing out the potential issue from alloca.

Sriram,

Let's avoid using alloca as it is still buggy on some platforms.
