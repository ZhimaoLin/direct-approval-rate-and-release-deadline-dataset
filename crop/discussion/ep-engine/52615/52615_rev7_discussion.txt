Line:187, src/ep.h -> Just a little comment here.. For watson we can use C++11, and there you may actually use:

    enum class ExpiryType : uint8_t {
        BY_PAGER, BY_COMPACTOR, BY_ACCESS
    };

And you reference them with ExpiryType::BY_PAGER etc. The beauty of that is that you've now got type safety (so you can't use other enum values) and the namespace for the values is restricted so we don't need to try to make them unique by prefixing with something (and you get it easier to grep for ;-))

And where an enum is always an int (32 bits), you can set the size of the enum in the enum class (I made it 8 bits wide above).

Cheers,

Trond
