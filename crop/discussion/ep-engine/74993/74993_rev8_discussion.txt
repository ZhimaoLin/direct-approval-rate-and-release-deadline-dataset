DESCRIPTION

Move Bucket construction to makeBucket()

To allow test code to construct the correct KVBucket subclass based on
the configuration, move the code to select and create the bucket from
EventuallyPersistentEngine::initialize to a seperate method -
makeBucket(). This will be used in subsequent Ephemeral bucket unit
tests.

As part of this, change EventuallyPersistentEngine::kvBucket from a
raw to a unique_ptr.
