DESCRIPTION

Move Bucket construction to makeBucket()

To allow test code to construct the correct KVBucket subclass based on
the configuration, move the code to select and create the bucket from
EventuallyPersistentEngine::initialize to a seperate method -
makeBucket().

This will be used in subsequent Ephemeral bucket unit tests.

Line:77, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> Shouldn't we have these as false by default when an Ephemeral bucket is created ? Maybe not here, but part of another task

Line:926, src/ep_engine.h -> Not at all - I think it just ended up that way as I was moving code around :)
