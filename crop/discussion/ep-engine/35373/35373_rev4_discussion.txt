Line:412, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Remove this line as we don't use the map instance.

Line:61, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Please use the reference instead to reduce the ref counter tracking overhead.

passive_stream_t &stream = streams[vbucket];

I saw a bunch of places below where we can use the reference type.

Line:408, src/upr-consumer.cc -> In this place, we should not use the reference type as we don't grab the stream lock above.

Line:61, src/upr-consumer.cc -> If you want to get rid of streamMutex completely from UPRConsumer class, then we shouldn't use a reference type.

I'll add a new patch-set soon.

Line:412, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Done

Line:61, src/upr-consumer.cc -> I do want to remove some of the locks at some point, but I need to be care to make sure that certain thing happen in the correct order. I will defer this to a separate change it that's okay.

Line:408, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Right, I won't change this one.
