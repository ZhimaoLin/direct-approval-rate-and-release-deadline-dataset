DESCRIPTION

Fix to the timing issue in sending backfill completion message

There is a sporadic timing issue in determining the backfill
completion and notifying this completion to the destination. This
change fixes this issue by allowing either backfill or TAP worker
thread to determine the completion of backfill.
