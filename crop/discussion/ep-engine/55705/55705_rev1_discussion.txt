DESCRIPTION

[BP] MB-14155 Increase the default number of ht_locks by a factor of approx. 10

This change is backported from sherlock.

From the recent perf test results, we observed the lock contention on hash table
buckets when a hash table scanning task (i.e., expiry pager, item pager,
accecss scanner, etc.) is running.

As a long term solution, we may need to implement resizing the number of
hash table locks dynamically at runtime.
