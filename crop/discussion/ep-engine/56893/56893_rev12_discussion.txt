Line:689, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think we should return false to the caller if persisting a vbucket state fails, so that it can be rescheduled. Otherwise, it will cause an inconsistent vbucket state compared with the committed items of the vbucket.

Line:715, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This check should be performed against 'status' in the line 706. What happens if fdb_get_kvs_info fails in line 706? It seems to me that we end up having inconsistent stats of deleted doc counter, doc counter, and high seq number. I think we should log this failure as warning.

As a separate improvement, let's perform these stat updates as part of fdb_commit() by passing the callback function to fdb_commit(), so that they can be performed all together in an atomic way. For this, we need to provide a new forestdb commit function that allows us to pass the callback function.

Line:689, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:715, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Fair enough. A new fdb_commit call would be useful.
