DESCRIPTION

Show the list of checkpoints in incremental backup files.

This change adds an additional feature to the incremental backup
tool to show the list of checkpoints included in a given incremental
backup file.

For example, run "mbbackup-incremental -c /tmp/backup-00000.mbb" to
show the list of checkpoints in "/tmp/backup-00000.mbb" file.
