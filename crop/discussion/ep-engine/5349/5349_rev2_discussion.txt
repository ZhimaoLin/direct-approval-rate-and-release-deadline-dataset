DESCRIPTION

Show the list of checkpoints in incremental backup files.

This change adds an additional feature to the incremental backup
tool to show the list of checkpoints included in a given incremental
backup file.

For example, run "mbbackup-incremental -c /tmp/backup-00000.mbb" to
show the list of checkpoints in "/tmp/backup-00000.mbb" file.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I'd really rather this functionality not be part of mbbackup-incremental, and instead be a subcommand to mbbackup itself (even if the code lives in mbbackup-incremental).

That said, I think we need to just be practical and push this through, recognizing that we may want to change it before too long.
