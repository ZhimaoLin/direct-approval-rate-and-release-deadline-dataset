Patch Set 2:

(4 comments)

Line:2578, src/ep_engine.cc -> You don't need to convert this to a Consumer since the ConnHandler already has this function defined.

Line:1995, src/tapconnection.cc -> This is correct for the tap set vbucket command, but for the upr set vbucket state command you need to check to make sure that the opaque is valid before changing the state.

Line:1999, src/tapconnection.cc -> call logHeader() not conn_->logHeader()

Line:2005, src/tapconnection.cc -> call logHeader() not conn_->logHeader()
