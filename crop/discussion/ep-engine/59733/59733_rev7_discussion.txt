DESCRIPTION

Added two new DCP tests

test_dcp_notifier_open: Tests the opening of a DCP
notifier connection, and also ensures that the number
of connections is correct.  This test make use of two
new stats: ep_dcp_conn_count_list and
ep_dcp_conn_count_map

test_dcp_notifier_equal_to_number_of_items: Tests that
a notifier request equal to the number of operations
does not result in a STREAM_END command being received.
