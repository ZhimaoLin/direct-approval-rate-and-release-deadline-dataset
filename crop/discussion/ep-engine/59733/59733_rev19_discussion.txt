DESCRIPTION

Added two new DCP tests

test_dcp_notifier_open: Tests the opening of a DCP
notifier connection.  It is similar to the
test_dcp_consumer_open and test_dcp_producer_open
tests.

test_dcp_notifier_equal_to_number_of_items: Tests that
a notifier request equal to the number of operations
does not result in a STREAM_END command being received.
