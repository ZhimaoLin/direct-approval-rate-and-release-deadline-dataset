DESCRIPTION

Two phases of fast vbucket deletion for table per vbucket.

From the large cluster with hundreds of millions of items, the
current fast vbucket deletion frequently takes more than several
minutes. This causes some bad effects when the rebalance failed
and restarted several times and consequently caused many vbucket
deletions because ns_server generates a completely new vbucket
map for each rebalance operation. As fast vbucket deletion jobs
have higher priority than persistence tasks, this will result
in blocking persistence jobs and large persistence queue, and
slow down rebalance operations.

To resolve this issue, this change does two phases of a vbucket
deletion as follows:
1) Change a vbucket table name (e.g., kv_0) to the temporary
name indicating it is now an invalid table. Then, create a new
table for that vbucket. Once this phase is completed, new items
can be inserted into the new table.
2) Invalid tables will be cleaned up by the periodic dispatcher
job with a lower priority. Currently, we remove one invalid table
from disk every 10 minutes.

Note that changing database schemas at runtime actually does not
invalidate PreparedStatement instances that we create when we
connect to database. From the sqlite documentation,
http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/prepare.html, it is mentioned that
if the database schema changes, instead of returning
SQLITE_SCHEMA as it always used to do, sqlite3_step() will
automatically recompile the SQL statement and try to run it again.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

Great find.  I wouldn't've looked here again, or would've at least done something more complicated based on prior reading of documentation

Patch Set 2: Verified

Thanks Dustin for the fast review. I verified it through performing rebalance operations in the three to four node cluster.
