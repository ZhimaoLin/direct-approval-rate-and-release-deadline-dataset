DESCRIPTION

Add ep_bg_remaining_items stat to track remaining items in multiBgFetch

In case of multiBgFetch we have 1 bgFetch job per shard. Multiple fetches
are scheduled over those jobs. We must use a separate stat to track the
remaining items and hence differentaite from the stat used to track
single bgFetch tasks.
