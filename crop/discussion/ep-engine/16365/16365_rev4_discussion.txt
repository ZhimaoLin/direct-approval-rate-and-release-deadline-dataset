DESCRIPTION

Catch MemcachedError in parameter control scripts

Fixes cbcheckpointctl, cbtapctl, and cbflushctl

We should catch these and just print the error message instead
of dumping a stack trace. It might be a good idea later to add a
debug option that print the stack trace so we can debug issues too.
