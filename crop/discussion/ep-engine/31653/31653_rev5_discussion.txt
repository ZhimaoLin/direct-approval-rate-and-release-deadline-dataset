Line:109, src/upr-consumer.cc -> This function body is very similar to the one defined in EventuallPersistentEngine. Can we remove the duplicates by defining this common logic in ConnHandler?

Line:133, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Same as above comment.

Line:2567, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'm not sure why we put it as a separate function? It looks very similar to the one that you added to UPR consumer.

Chiyoung,

I actually have a separate change to do what you were asking for here. For this one I just wanted to move the upr api's to make it simple. If you want me to squash the other change with this one I can. The other change is below, but it is not ready for review yet since I need to test it more.

Line:133, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Same as other comment.

Line:2567, src/ep_engine.cc -> I have already started working on that and was going to submit it as a separate change. It's already in review actually, but I haven't added anyone yet since I'm still testing it. I can squash that change with this one if you want.
