DESCRIPTION

MB-10489 Don't use std::map::insert() in updating the cursor pos

Using std::map::insert() to update the cursor position will fail
if the cursor alreay exists in the checkpoint manager. Instead,
we should overwrite it with the new cursor object. This is a
regression from the changes that we made in the master branch.
