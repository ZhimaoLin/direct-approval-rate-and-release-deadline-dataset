DESCRIPTION

iMB-9179: Shard count configurable, defaults at 4

- Deprecating workload patterns, as they are no
longer required with GIO. GIO takes into account
bucket priority rather than workload-policies.
- Disk read-write concurrency - represented
by max_num_workers will be used to determine
bucket priority.
- Num of readers and number of writers set for
each bucket will be the number of shards. Thus
each shard to have one flusher and bgfetcher.
