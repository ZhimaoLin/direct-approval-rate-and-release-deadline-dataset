DESCRIPTION

MB-9179 Shard count made configurable

This change makes the number of shards configurable when a bucket
is instantiated and sets its default number to four. As part of
the global IO manager optimization, the workload policy (i.e.,
read-heavy, write-heavy, and mixed) parameter, which is used in
determining the number of shards, is no longer necessary.

As part of further enhancements, we plan to investigate
differentiating the number of shards depending on a bucket
priority.
