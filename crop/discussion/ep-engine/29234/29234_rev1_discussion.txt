DESCRIPTION

MB-9179: Fix num of shards at 4

- In context of GIO Manager.
- Getting rid workload pattern, as bucket
priority is now taken into consideration.
- Disk read-write concurrency - represented
by max_num_workers will be used to determine
bucket priority.
- Each shard to have one flusher and bgfetcher.

Patch Set 1:

Can you explain why we are doing this? When we initially did the implementation the max_num_shards was the maximum amount of read or write threads that you could have working on a bucket. If a user has four shards and 8 write threads then 4 of the threads would not be able to do anything.

Patch Set 1:

We don't want to increase the number of shards with respect to the number of global IO threads. WE plan to deprecate the feature that allows the user to specify the number of IO threads per bucket through the web console UI, but instead provides the option of bucket IO priority (high or low).

It's configurable when the bucket is instantiated, but set to four by default, which means that we will have four flushers and four bgfetchers per bucket. If four flushers per bucket is not enough to saturate the disk IO, we will find a good default number.

Eventually, we want to find the good default number of global IO threads in the GIO manager by considering the storage device type (ssd, spinning disk, ...). For example, we want to create 24 IO threads inside the GIO when the GIO is instantiated, and use those threads to process all the IO requests across all the buckets. But, we don't want to create 24 shards per bucket.

I think we may need to increase the number of shards (say eight) if a bucket priority is high.

Abhinav,

I will look at this change later, but please change the commit title, say "Make num of shards configurable and set to four by default"

- Getting rid workload pattern, as bucket
priority is now taken into consideration.

This should be a separate commit.

One more suggestion is that instead of enumerating what this changes does in detail, you may want to describe it as one or two paragraphs.
