DESCRIPTION

Perform an explicit commit after call to flushVBucket

Although a flushVBucket writes the item to the underlying store,
the item is not marked clean until an explicit commit is called.
If the underlying store is couchstore, a commit is called with
a flushVBucket but in the case of forestdb, a commit is not
always called, hence call an explicit commit.
