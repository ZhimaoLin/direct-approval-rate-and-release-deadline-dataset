DESCRIPTION

Perform an explicit commit after call to flushVBucket

Although a flushVBucket writes the item to the underlying store,
the item is not marked clean until an explicit commit is called.
If the underlying store is couchstore, a commit is called with
a flushVBucket but in the case of forestdb, a commit is not
always called, hence call an explicit commit.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> It feels to me that we should change ForestKVStore here - both should behave the same from the KVStore API point of view. 

Consider a production environment  if ep-engine did a flushVBucket (which claimed to succeed), then immediately crashed then with Couchstore you'd have the correct state on disk, whereas with forestdb you'd still see the old data.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> True, Dave. In a production environment, once the flusher goes to sleep, a commit would have been performed https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/ep-engine/blob/master/src/flusher.cc#L187. But, because we introduced the notion of a commit interval for ForestDB (Primary motivation being batching more writes for SSDs. SSDs prefer bigger and lesser writes. At least that was the guidance provided to me from the ForestDB team), we don't commit frequently to disk.

Patch Set 2:

I agree that the data loss window is higher with a bigger commit interval. If this needs to be discussed more offline, we can do so.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for clarifying the flusher behaviour - given we do perform an explicit commit in the flusher, I think this change is ok.

Could you expand the comments on flushVBucket() to say that a commit is *not* necessarily performed (and a caller should call commit() to guarantee a commit), so we have this behaviour well-documented.
