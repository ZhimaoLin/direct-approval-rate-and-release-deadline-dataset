Mike, this looks good. My comments are mostly new log suggestions or minor corrections. I'd like to promote some log messages to the warning level as they're very important in debugging any production issues.

One more thing is that we need to add more logs to doWNathalie LandryTapQueue() in ep_engine.cc. Do you plan to do it in a separate commit?

Let's discuss these further tomorrow.

Line:358, tapconnection.cc -> Let's add the WARNING log here to indicate "ack window is full"

Line:714, tapconnection.cc -> Let's add the WARNING logs here:
if (dumpQueue) {
    getLogger(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "%s TAP dump is completed.\n", logHeader)
} else if (doTakeOver) {
   getLogger(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "%s TAP takeover is completed for vbucket %d\n", ...)
}

Line:766, tapconnection.cc -> Add the WARNING log:
getLogger(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING,
"Backfill is completed for vbucket %d\n Schedule to send TAP_CLOSE_BACKFILL message to the TAP client." , ...)

Line:1047, tapconnection.cc -> getLogger(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "Set backfill phase to true for vbucket %d on TAP consumer\n", ...)

Line:1052, tapconnection.cc -> getLogger(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "Set backfill phase to false for vbucket %d on TAP consumer\n", ...)

Line:264, tapconnection.cc -> Let's promote this to WARNING.

Line:1193, tapconnection.cc -> Let's promote this to WARNING

Line:139, tapconnmap.cc -> getLogger(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "Remove TAP producer %s and its cursor from vbucket checkpoints\n",...)

Line:56, tapconnmap.cc -> Let's promote this to WARNING

Line:61, tapconnmap.cc -> Let's promote this to WARNING

Line:2303, ep_engine.cc -> Split this into two lines.

Line:2323, ep_engine.cc -> Split this into two lines

Line:2349, ep_engine.cc -> Split this into two lines.

Line:2401, ep_engine.cc -> Let's promote the log level to WARNING as backfill start/end messages are very important for replication and takeover.

Line:2422, ep_engine.cc -> Let's promote the log level to WARNING

Line:2460, ep_engine.cc -> Let's highlight the message with capital letters "Received CLOSE_TAP_STREAM opaque message"

Line:277, tapconnection.hh -> Make this function as "pure virtual function" (i.e., const char* logHeader() = 0). Initialize logString in its subclass constructor and override logHeader in its subclass as well.

Line:377, tapconnection.hh -> Make this protected so that it can be inherited to TapProducer and TapConsumer.

Line:277, tapconnection.hh -> We don't need to make this function as pure virtual function. I think we can simply initialize logString in this class constructor, and let this function return it simply
