Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Good catch. We should not delete expired items on non-active vbuckets to synchronize a seq num between active and replica vbuckets. Please feel free to merge it if all unit tests are passed at least, and also make sure that it should be merged into 3.0.1 and master branch.
