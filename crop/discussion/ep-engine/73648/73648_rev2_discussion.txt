DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Move VBucket::queueDirty() calls to softDeleteStoredValue()

in VBucket class to handle expiry related stuff separately from
processSoftDelete()

Line:2389, src/vbucket.cc -> This ends up being quite a common pattern for checking unique_locks. I had an idea for a technique that might cut down on the extra noise from doing these checks. Not suggesting it for this patch but it might be worth considering:

Just the comment fixup

Line:2519, src/vbucket.cc -> suggestion (not for this patch) but why does the track drift case also queue? Can't it just do the tracking e.g.

  if (queueItmCtx.trackCasDrift == TrackCasDrift::Yes) {
      trackCasDrift(v, isBackfill);
  }

  return queueDirty(...);
