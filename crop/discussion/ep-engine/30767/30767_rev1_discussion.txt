DESCRIPTION

MB-9585: Add support for upr stats

This change refactors the TAP stats related functions and added
UPR support. Client such as cbstats should be able to retrieve
"upr" or "upragg" stats. We'll add comprehensive stats for UPR
later on. Also modified some upr test cases that depends on stats.

Please hold this change for another day or two. I am working out some of the backfilling stuff and it may be easier to rebase this change on top my stuff than the other way around. Either way this looks okay to me. I'll review again tomorrow.

Line:3439, src/ep_engine.cc -> As I commented previously, this functions is the exactly same as the above "doTapAggStats(...)" except for which connection map is used for aggregation. Can we consolidate them by having "doConnAggStats(..., connection_type conn_type)" where conn_type is TAP or UPR?
