DESCRIPTION

Remove fragmentation from mem_used stat

After extensive tests, we decided to not consider the
allocator's fragmentation overhead (mostly from the central
cache in tcmalloc) in the engine's mem_used stat at this time.
It turns out that including fragmentation overhead caused quite
heavy (possibly unnecessary) item evictions. We will revisit
this issue later.
