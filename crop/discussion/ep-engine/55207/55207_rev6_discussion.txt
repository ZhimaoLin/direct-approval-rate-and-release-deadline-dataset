Line:480, src/kvstore.h -> Per our discussion, let's consolidate the above two APIs to have a single API to persist vbucket state.

Line:528, src/kvstore.h -> I don't think we need to have this API in KVStore level. Let's move it back to CouchKVStore's internal function.

Line:78, src/kvstore.cc -> Mini minor tiny comment:  s/KVstore/KVStore/ changing this could aid those who aren't familiar with ep-engine to find the right class.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:83, src/kvstore.cc -> Nit: Use explicit compare with nullptr; MSVC warns about implicit conversion to bool.

Line:3239, src/ep.cc -> Given this string is only used by the vucket_state constructor below, any reason not to use pass vb->failovers directly into the constructor and have it convert to JSON?

Line:753, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Might be clearer / less error-prone if you call the vbucket_state assignment operator here (i.e. copy construct) as that guarantees that all members of the class will be assigned.

Line:294, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Probably worth adding a description to this function, specifying what it does and what members of vbstate are updated.

Line:528, src/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:3239, src/ep.cc -> I believe toJSON() was returning a std:string and I wasn't able to pass it directly as a non-const reference to the vbucket_state constructor. Hence the variable.
