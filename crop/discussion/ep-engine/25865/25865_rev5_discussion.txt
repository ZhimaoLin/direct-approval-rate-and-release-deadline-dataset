DESCRIPTION

MB-100 pass COUCHSTORE_OPEN_FLAG_CREATE for couchstore open db api

Current design, and especially when multiple dispatchers are
enabled for a single bucket, does not guarantee that underlying
vbucket files have been already created when initial dirty items
are being persisted to the files.

We need to pass the creation flag when opening a underlying vbucket
file for write. This allows couchstore creates the file if it
has not been created prior to the initial data write. Otherwise,
the persistent write of the requested data could be lost for
unexpected bad state returned from couchstore.
