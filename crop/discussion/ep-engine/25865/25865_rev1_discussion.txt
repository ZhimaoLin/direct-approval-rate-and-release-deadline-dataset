DESCRIPTION

MB-100 pass COUCHSTORE_OPEN_FLAG_CREATE for couchstore open db api

Current design, and especially when multiple dispatchers are
enabled for a single bucket, does not guarantee that underlying
vbucket files have been already created when initial dirty items
are being persisted to the files.

We need to pass the creation flag when opening a underlying vbucket
file for write. This allows couchstore creates the file if it
has not been created prior to the initial data write. Otherwise,
the persistent write of the requested data could be lost for
unexpected bad state returned from couchstore.

Patch Set 1:

Jin,

I don't see why it would be the case that multiple dispatchers will make it not possible to ensure vbucket creation before the flusher loop starts. Disk snapshot tasks should always be scheduled before the flusher loop runs. We can discuss later, but I think we need more justification (at least in the commit message) for why this is the case.

Patch Set 1:

This issue is also seen in the vanilla 2.0.2, but however the issue has been masking under certain scenario. We will discuss about this further offline.
