DESCRIPTION

MB-8152 pass COUCHSTORE_OPEN_FLAG_CREATE for open db

Currently EP Engine cannot guarantee that underlying vbucket file
have been already created especially when the initial persistentence
writes are being issued to the files.

We need to pass the creation flag when opening a underlying vbucket
file for write. This allows couchstore creates the file if and only
if necessary prior to the initial data write. Otherwise, the
persistence write of the requested data could be lost for this
unexpected bad state returned from couchstore.
