DESCRIPTION

MB-100 pass COUCHSTORE_OPEN_FLAG_CREATE for couchstore open db api

Current design, and especially when multiple dispatchers are
enabled for a single bucket, does not guarantee that underlying
vbucket files have been already created when initial dirty items
are being persisted to the files.

We need to pass the creation flag when opening a underlying vbucket
file for write. This allows couchstore creates the file if it
has not been created prior to the initial data write. Otherwise,
the persistent write of the requested data could be lost for
unexpected bad state returned from couchstore.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Jin,

As I discussed with you earlier, this change will cause us to create a vbucket file without local docs and presents a scenario when we might have data written into a file, but no local docs. It also means a crash could cause the database to startup in this situation and I am not sure if that will cause other problems. I have an alternative solution that will cause the flusher to wait until the vbucket file is created before writing that I think we should discuss. I am going to give this a -1 for now and we can figure out what to do after we tNathalie Landry.
