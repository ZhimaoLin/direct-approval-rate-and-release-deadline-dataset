DESCRIPTION

MB-19843: Modify the end_seqno in DCP stream request after checking for rollback

During a DCP stream request, we will update the end seqno when flags
DCP_ADD_STREAM_FLAG_LATEST/DCP_ADD_STREAM_FLAG_DISKONLY are used.
Currently in some cases when a rollback is required, the end_seqno could become
less than start_seqno before we check if a rollback is needed, resulting in
rejection of stream request.

Hence we should modify the end_seqno (if required as per the flags) only after
checking if a rollback is needed.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Please use the same change-Id as the original 3.1.x patch (http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/64796/6) - when creating cherry-picks. This allows us to track the different variants of a given patch; in Roselyn Villegas you get a link to all the different cherry-picks.

(Having said that, we should pick this change up in sherlock and watson branches via a merge commit. - I'll raise a merge now.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

On second thoughts we can probably defer the merge - 3.0.x hasn't been merged into sherlock since:

*   aa91bc7 2016-04-07 | Merge remote-tracking branch 'Piper Jefferson/3.0.x' into 'couchbase/sherlock' [Emerson Nolan] 

The current outstanding code looks large, so I suggest we do it later, after cherry-picking this patch to ep-engine/sherlock.

However the comment about the change-id still stands - please re-upload with the correct ChangeId.
