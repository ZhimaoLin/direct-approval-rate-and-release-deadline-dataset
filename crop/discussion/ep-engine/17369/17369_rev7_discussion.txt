DESCRIPTION

CBD-377: Make synchronous vbucket delete optional

This change allows us to specify whether we want a synchronous
or asynchronous delete. When doing a synchronous delete we also
now put the connection into pending state to unblock the memcached
worker thread.

By default we do asynchronous vbucket deletes. This commit adds a
parameter in the value field that cansignal whether or not we
should do a vbucket delete asynchronously or synchronously. To
do a synchronous delete the value field should be set to "async=0"
