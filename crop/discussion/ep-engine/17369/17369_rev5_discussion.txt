DESCRIPTION

CBD-377: Make synchronous vbucket delete optional

This change allows us to specify whether we want a synchronous
or asynchronous delete. When doing a synchronous delete we also
now put the connection into pending state to unblock the memcached
worker thread.

By default we do asynchronous bucket deletes. In order to specify
a synchronous delete a packet must contain the ascii character
"1" as its value.
