DESCRIPTION

CBD-377: Make synchronous vbucket delete optional

This change allows us to specify whether we want a synchronous
or asynchronous delete. When doing a synchronous delete we also
now put the connection into pending state to unblock the memcached
worker thread.

By default we do asynchronous bucket deletes. In order to specify
a synchronous delete a packet must contain the ascii character
"1" as its value.

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:733, ep_engine.cc -> It still seems wrong. "async=1" means that we do the asynchronous vbucket deletion. It should be passed as "async=0" to indicate synchronous vbucket deletion.
