DESCRIPTION

MB-20869: test_access_scanner: Fix residency percentage check

In test_access_scanner the check that the number of non-resident items
was less than 6% of the total is incorrect - it was using integer
division (6/100) and hence the RHS of the check was always zero, which
would always succeed.

Fix the check so it calculates the percentage correctly.

(I suspect this test is intermittently failing because the
non-resident percentage is incorrect, but due to this broken check we
could not determine that. Now it's fixed it may shed some light on
future failures).
