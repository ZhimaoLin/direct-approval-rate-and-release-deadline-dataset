DESCRIPTION

MB-20869: Add 'ep_alog_running' stat to fix intermittent test_access_scanner failure

In test_access_scanner the check that the number of non-resident items
was less than 6% of the total is incorrect - it was using integer
division (6/100) and hence the RHS of the check was always zero, which
would always succeed. Fix the check so it calculates the percentage
correctly.

Additionally we did not wait for the previous AccessScanner run to
finalize - which meant that the second start of the access acanner
could fail to start (and consequently we would timeout with the
message:

    Exceeded maximum wait time of 60000000us waiting for stat
    'ep_num_access_scanner_runs' to be greater or equal than 8 -
    aborting.

To solve this, add a new 'ep_alog_running' stat which returns the
number of Acess Scanner tasks running. Query this stat to wait for the
Access Scanner to start / stop before moving to the next iteration.

Should this change be split into 2 patches?
i.e. (1) adding the stat (2) fixing the test i.e. the 6% total stuff

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> exceed the 72 character limit?

Given that (2) is literally a one-line change (and given the overhead of creating patches / passing CV / getting code review) I think it's overkill to split this.
