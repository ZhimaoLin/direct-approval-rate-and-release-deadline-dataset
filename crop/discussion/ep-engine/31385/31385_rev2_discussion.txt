DESCRIPTION

Temporarily allow for broken C++ compilers

Allow people to define DISABLE_CXX11_SUPPORT to force
use of the internal atomics instead of the ones in C++11

This workaround _WILL_ be removed as soon as everythings
is moved over to the new atomics.

Patch Set 2:

Can we restore this change? Master branch is still broken on most of our laptops because of the atomics compiler issue.
thanks
