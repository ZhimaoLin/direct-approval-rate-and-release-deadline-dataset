Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(1 inline comment)

Has this been verified on MacOS?

Also, I'm slightly opposed to this as I don't think DTrace is all that hard.  Someone as slow as I am has learned enough to profile and investigate locks.  A concerted effort to teach others might be better than giving them scripts.

I'll leave that to Dustin though.

Patch Set 1:

I've not tried them on macosx, but I suspect that they won't work out of the box (At least you need a /bin/pfksh (can be symblinked to /bin/ksh) and a working pgrep..). 

As for the scripts I'd rather just have a prewritten script to run plockstat that actually increase the buffers so that I don't have to google the syntax for that (instead it just drops out with due to buffer overflow).
