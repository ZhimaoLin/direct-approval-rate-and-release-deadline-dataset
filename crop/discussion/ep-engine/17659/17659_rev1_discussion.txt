Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:7, queueditem.cc -> This function will be invoked for every comparison, which seems unnecessary overhead. I think we can support this feature without adapting the comparison class. Probably, it would be better and simpler to adapt beginFlush() in ep.cc.

My initial suggestion seems wrong. Sorry about that. Let's discuss this more tomorrow.
