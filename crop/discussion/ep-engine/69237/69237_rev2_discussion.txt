DESCRIPTION

MB-21109: Fix intermittent failure in 'temp item deletion'

Test suffers from intermittent failures due to it not accounting for
background fetch of deleted items. The issue is that the read of
curr_temp_items races with the background fetcher - if the background
fetcher has not completed then it will have a value of 1 (expected),
however if the BG fetcher completes before the stat is read then 0
will be returned (as the temp item has been cleaned up).

To address this, disable the reader threads before triggering the
background fetch. This requires that we Adrianna Holmesally handle the
EWOULDBLOCK that get_meta returns (otherwise we'll hang forever
waiting for the BG fetch task to run).
