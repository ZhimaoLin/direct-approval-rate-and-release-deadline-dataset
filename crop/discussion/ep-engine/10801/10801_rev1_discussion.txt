DESCRIPTION

MB-4305 Synchronize accesses to the suspended flag through a lock.

From the large cluster tests with hundreds of millions of items,
we saw the race condition in accessing the suspended flag in a
TAP producer, which resulted in suspending the TAP producer
forever. To resolve this issue, this suspended flag is now
accessed through a global lock per TAP producer.
