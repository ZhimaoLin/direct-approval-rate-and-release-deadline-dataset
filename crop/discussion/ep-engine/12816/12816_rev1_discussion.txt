DESCRIPTION

New binary protocol command for replica read.

Add the new retrieval command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, that works exactly
like the existing "get" command except it returns data only for
vbuckets that are in replica state.

Add new ep-engine unit tests that run the CMD_GET_REPLICA command
against all four vbucket states - active, pending, dead, replica:

- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in active
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in pending
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in dead
- replica read returns data for vbuckets that are in replica
