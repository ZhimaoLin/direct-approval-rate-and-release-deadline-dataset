DESCRIPTION

Reduce lock contention in del vb cmd.

We're seeing cases on NUMA systems where delete vbucket commands were
taking 4-8s to run in a normal case.  By releasing the lock before
scheduling, we're not blocking another request from issuing a vbucket
deletion while the request is attempting to acquire another*another*
lock.
