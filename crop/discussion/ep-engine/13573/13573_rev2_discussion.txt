DESCRIPTION

make sure MAX_LOG_SIZE fits into 32 bit size_t

So that build doesn't fail on 32-bit target.

I'm casting -1 to unsigned int first (assuming unsigned int is 32 bit
large which is typical, i'm not sure we can rely on uint32_t being
available), so that result is not larger than 2^32 which was seemingly
original intention.
