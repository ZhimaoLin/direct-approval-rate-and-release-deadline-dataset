Patch Set 1:

This is just the failover table data structure, here for comment, but not to actually commit.

The rest of the failover table code I've written is dependent on other changes (Sequence number assignment in ep-engine mostly), and I'll get that up for review once those changes are in (it's troublesome to redo changes on top of other changes in Jasmin Rangel.)
