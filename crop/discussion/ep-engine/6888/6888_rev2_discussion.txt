DESCRIPTION

Schedule backfill task through NON-IO dispatcher.

Previously, each backfill task was scheduled by creating a separate
thread. We observed that this might cause much overhead especially
with more than one replica in the large cluster.

This change addresses the above issue by scheduling a backfill task
through NON-IO dispatcher. If a given backfill task requires
backfill from disk, it will kick off separate tasks through
Read-Only dispatcher.
