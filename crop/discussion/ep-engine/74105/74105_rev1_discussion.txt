DESCRIPTION

MB-22896: Add upgrade support to MutationLog

A recent change broke upgrades as we changed the size of each
MutationLogEntry, meaning if you ran 4.6 and did an offline upgrade
and an access log is present, we fail when processing the log.

This commit fixes this problem by:

1. Versioning the mutation log (an existing version field has been
 incremented from 1 to 2).

2. Changing the magic of MutationLogEntry, not necessary, but another
 signal that the log is a different version.

3. Introduce a sequential upgrade path, that is whenever we load log
 and it is not the current version, we upgrade the entries by
 upgrading from n to n+1. This is a technique which aims to simplify
 the upgrade steps as each step only needs to consider one input
 format, there is not special case code for n to n+3 and so on.

Note: There is only one upgrade, from 1 to 2 but the commit aims to
add structure to the code to make it easy if we add more versions.
