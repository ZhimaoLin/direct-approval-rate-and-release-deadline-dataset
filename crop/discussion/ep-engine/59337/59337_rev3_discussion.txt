Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:1787, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Just change this whole thing to something like a std::vector<char> of 8192 outside the loop. Simplifies the code, and removes the repeated malloc / free.

Line:147, tests/module_tests/atomic_ptr_test.cc -> I'm surprised this works - as you'll end up with a source file with no main() which the compiler will attempt to link. Do you get any warnings about no main function? What actually gets produced for atomic_ptr_test?
