DESCRIPTION

MB-14859: Add log in setWithMeta to debug why we are sending KEY_ENOENT

XDCR cannot handle KEY_ENOENT as return value. It seems from code that
we send that error code only when cas value sent in the request is
non zero. So adding this log only in non replication (XDCR) case.

Patch Set 2:

Since XDCR cannot handle this error case, I thought we will have it always.
But if you guys think it is too much logging, I will abandon this change.

Line:2104, src/ep.cc -> As we found the potential root cause for this issue, I don't think we should log it at this time. Let's get the fix merged and rerun the test.

Abandoned

Per discussion with Manu, we will abandon this change at this time as we merged the potential fix to the original issue. We will wait for Aruna to rerun the test with the fix.
