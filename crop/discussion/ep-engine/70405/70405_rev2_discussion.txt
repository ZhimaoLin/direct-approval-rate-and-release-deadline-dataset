DESCRIPTION

Convert SpinLock to BasicLockable, remove SpinLockHolder

This patch adjusts SpinLock to allow to implement BasicLockable
allowing it to be locked by a std::lock_guard. Also removes
SpinLockHolder and converts all uses to std::lock_guard (Just an
alias wouldn't work as SpinLockHolder passes by pointer rather
than reference).
