DESCRIPTION

Account for a deleted item in unlocked_restoreValue

When we do a background fetch to read an item from
disk, if the item were deleted from a front end
operation, we shouldn't decrement nonResidentItemCount
as it is already done as part of unlocked_softDelete,
and this could cause an underflow in the stat.
