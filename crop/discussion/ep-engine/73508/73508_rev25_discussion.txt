Line:252, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Are these essentially slices into the input parameter? Might be worth making that explicit if so (to aid in knowing how to use the function).

Line:391, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Please document the new param.

Line:403, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> ditto
