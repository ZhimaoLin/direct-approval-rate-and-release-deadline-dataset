DESCRIPTION

MB-5274 fix Windows build issue that causes memcached to fail to start

Missing "HAVE_LIBCOUCHSTORE" environment variable and LIBCOUCH_KVSTORE
objects dependency variables (LIBCOUCH_KVSTORE_OBJS/CC_SRC) caused
memcached to fail to start during the warmup. Updated the Windows
specific makefile, win32/Makefile.mingw, with these variables.
