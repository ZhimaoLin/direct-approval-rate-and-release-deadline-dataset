DESCRIPTION

MB-3489: Track total cache stats in the hash table.

This removes a global stat in favor of a hashtable-specific stat.  It
was previously impossible to properly track the amount of non-resident
data being held, so we instead reduced the stats by the total count.
Since that's not the same as how we incremented it, it was wrong.

Logically, as many stats as can be moved to be hashtable-specific
should be so stats stay updated as vbuckets are added and removed.
