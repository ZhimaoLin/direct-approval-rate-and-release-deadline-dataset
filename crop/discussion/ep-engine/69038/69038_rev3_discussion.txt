Line:2202, src/ep_engine.cc -> Should be const

Line:2203, src/ep_engine.cc -> you can just do a direct comparison (ie. bucketType == "persistent")

Line:2201, src/ep_engine.cc -> nit: this is a pretty bad comment as it's literally the name of the method you're invoking. It actually reduces readability since the code already reads as english so the redundant comment is redundant.

There might be value in adding a comment describing the broader purpose of this section of code (ie. to instantiate an instance of a particular type of KVBucket to allow user configurable bucket type between persistent and ephemeral)
