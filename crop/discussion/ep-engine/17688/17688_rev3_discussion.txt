DESCRIPTION

MB-5711 New active vbucket starts with the open checkpoint id > 1

Consider the following scenario:

1. Node A started and has the active vb 0 with the open
checkpoint 1
2 Load some items into the open checkpoint 1
3. Restart A and then A will still have the open checkpoint 1
after warmup, which is now empty.
4. Node B is newly joined and has the empty replica vb0 starting
with the open checkpoint 1
5. Replication from A to B for vb0 doesn't schedule backfill
because we thought that both node A and B have the synchronized
open checkpoint for vb0.
