DESCRIPTION

MB-100: correctly format file revision

Which otherwise causes segmentation fault on 32-bit architectures
because two words are pushed (rev is uint64_t) yet only one is
consumed (because format was %d).

Looks good. Please see my minor comment in config_static.h. I think we can make the statement more generic yet with specific version info. Thanks.

Line:46, src/config_static.h -> Can we please provide specific version info of this GNU libc that demands such macros? Thanks.

replied inline.

Please keep in mind that currently 32-bit builds are unusable without this fix

Line:46, src/config_static.h -> I can definitely find out what is earliest revision of glibc that does this. However I'm unable to see how this can be helpful for you or anybody else and thus how it is not waste of my time.

Line:46, src/config_static.h -> I didn't know it could be that difficult to figure out the version information or I rather find it is your inability to understand the point. at least remove phrases "my GNU libc" and "my box", who knows and cares your libc and box.

Line:1091, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> %llu should be enough to address this issue.

Line:45, src/config_static.h -> I don't understand what your comments mean exactly. It's too unclear to me.

Patch Set 2:

We also don't use MB-100 as a commit title anymore, which is an odd convention.

before <inttypes.h> is included."

Line:46, src/config_static.h -> We could probably just define that #define in CXXFLAGS in TLM ..  (alternatively also use io streams in the C++ code to format such strings)
