MB-100: correctly format file revision

Which otherwise causes segmentation fault on 32-bit architectures
because two words (rev is uint64_t) yet only one is consumed.

Patch Set 1:

added Trond and Siri to show them we're starting to actually use those PRIxxx macros. And I've just checked and found that MSVC still does not have those. Our builds are fine because mingw has good headers.
