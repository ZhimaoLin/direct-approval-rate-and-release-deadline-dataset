DESCRIPTION

MB-16829: Provide both options and Emd field for set/del with meta.

Currently we set/del with meta provide options to pass either force
flag (skip conflict resolution flag) or extended meta data(Emd) info but
not both. We also need to make it possible for tools like backup
to be able to force an item and also include the Emd as just an info
in the item.
Note: This change makes sure that we are also backward compatible.
