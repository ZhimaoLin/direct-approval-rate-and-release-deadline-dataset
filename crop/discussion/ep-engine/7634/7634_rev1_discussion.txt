Line:478, ep.cc -> Unused parameter.  I'll fix it up and push it.

Maybe I won't fix this up.  This one is less obvious to me.

Line:115, flusher.cc -> Hmm...  It fails here, too:

    flusher.cc: In member function 'bool Flusher::transition_state(flusher_state)':
    flusher.cc:115: error: no matching function for call to 'Flusher::fireStateChange(volatile flusher_state&, flusher_state&)'
    flusher.hh:102: note: candidates are: void Flusher::fireStateChange(const flusher_state&, const flusher_state&)
