Line:247, ep_engine.cc -> I thought it might be good to be able to push it > 100.  1,000 might be too high.  101 might also be too high.  :)

Line:247, ep_engine.cc -> Ah, i understand it :) As you know, increasing it beyond 100 will cause TAP mutations to be denied from hashtable set().

Line:247, ep_engine.cc -> I hadn't thought of that, kind of figured it'd still override.  We'll do it your way.  :)  I have it set to 0-100 in 2.0.
