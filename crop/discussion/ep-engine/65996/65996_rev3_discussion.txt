DESCRIPTION

[IK] Simplify completeBGFetchForSingleItem - item restoring

Simplify the code for checking if an item should be restored -
non-resident, non-deleted items should always be restored, and
TempInitial items (added as part of full eviction) should also be
resored).

This is a simplification of identical logic - should be no actual
behaviour change.
