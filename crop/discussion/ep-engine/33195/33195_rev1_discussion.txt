DESCRIPTION

Check the CAS match when an item is completely removed from cache

As ADD/DEL operations for the same key can be repeatedly issued
during a short period, we need to remove the item from cache iff
the CAS is matched. Otherwise, we may end up persisting incorrect
rev_seqno for that item.
