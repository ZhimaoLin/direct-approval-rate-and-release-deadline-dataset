DESCRIPTION

DCP traffic added to ep-perfsuite stats tests

A key stat used during rebalance is dcp-vbtakeover.  The execution path
for this stat differs depending on whether a DCP producer exists.

Therefore in addition to measuring the performance of the stat when sets
are executing on a separate thread a second thread performing DCP work
is also created.

This ensures that all the main code paths for the stat are measured.
