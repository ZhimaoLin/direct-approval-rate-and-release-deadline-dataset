DESCRIPTION

DCP traffic added to ep-perfsuite stats tests

A key stat used during rebalance is dcp-vbtakeover.  The execution path
for this stat differs depending on whether a DCP producer exists.

Therefore in addition to measuring the performance of the stat when sets
are executing on a separate thread a second thread performing DCP work
is also created.

This ensures that all the main code paths for the stat are measured.

Patch Set 16: Code-Review-1

I'm a bit concerned about the runtime of the perfsuite (esp under TSan):

 00:16:16.522 30/30 Test #30: ep-engine_perfsuite ...................   Passed  468.94 sec

The last CV run I did of master was almost 1.5mins shorter:

 00:13:18.811 30/30 Test #30: ep-engine_perfsuite ...................   Passed  385.62 sec

This /used/ to take a hell of a lot shorter time - I can only assume it's been creeping up for a while, but even the normal build is "too long" IMHO:

Before your change:
 00:24:00.509 30/30 Test #30: ep-engine_perfsuite ...................   Passed   34.11 sec

After (this patch):
 00:09:28.377 30/30 Test #30: ep-engine_perfsuite ...................   Passed   41.02 sec

That's nearly a 20% increase (on an already too-slow test IMHO).

Can you look at the iteration counts etc - at the very least consider dropping the iterations when run under TSAN - it's unacceptable to have individual tests taking more than 5 minutes.

Patch Set 16:

Currently the "fast" stat iterations are 1000 and slow are 100
I will change to be 100 for fast and 10 for slow.
