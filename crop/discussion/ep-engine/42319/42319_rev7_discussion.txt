DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Add initial max buffer to the BackfillManager

The backfill manager will only allow up to 20MB to be backfilled
from disk without being sent over the wire to the consumer. This
change will help to prevent growing memory usage from backfills
when a vbucket has a large dataset.

Line:104, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> See my comment below. I think we should grab a lock at the beginning of this function, and don't need to use atomic variables inside scannBuffer and buffer instances.

Line:149, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> I can see the possible racing issue here. All the fields in a buffer should be synchronized through a lock. Otherwise, we might not be able to wake up the backfill task immediately when the buffer is ready, but instead should wait for one sec unnecessarily.

Since the critical section is small, I think using a lock shouldn't cause any performance penalty.

Line:157, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Same as above comment.
