DESCRIPTION

MB-12179: Add initial max buffer to the BackfillManager

The backfill manager will only allow up to 20MB to be backfilled
from disk without being sent over the wire to the consumer. This
change will help to prevent growing memory usage from backfills
when a vbucket has a large dataset.

Line:116, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> As I mentioned in the other commit, I don't think we need to put a special logic for buffer size zero.

Line:397, configuration.json -> Does this include 20MB + key + metadata?

Line:66, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> This looks confusing with the above scanBuffer. Can you put some comments to explain what it is?

Line:59, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> I think this scan buffer is per stream, while the buffer below is per connection.

Line:116, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> This is to always allow an item in to the buffer when the buffer size is 0. It will allow the buffers to be set smaller than the max item size if necessary.

Line:397, configuration.json -> No, but this will still be okay since we always allow an item into the buffer if the buffer size is 0. I will however bump up the limit.

Line:59, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> Correct.

Line:66, src/dcp-backfill-manager.h -> Done
