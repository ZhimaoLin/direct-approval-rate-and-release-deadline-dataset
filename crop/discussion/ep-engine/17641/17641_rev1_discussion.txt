Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

Please add the TAP-related unit test for this change.

Line:1209, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This should be changed to
if (!loadCtx->keysonly && !docinfo->deleted) { ...}

Line:215, kvstore.hh -> We don't need it for this change. This function is mainly used for warmup, but we will adapt it later if we need to extract persisted deletions for this function as well.

Line:222, kvstore.hh -> I don't think we need to change this API, but instead let's add the new boolean property "hasPersistedDeletions" to StorageProperties class, and use it to determine if a given KVStore supports it or not.

Line:240, kvstore.hh -> Same comment as the first one.
