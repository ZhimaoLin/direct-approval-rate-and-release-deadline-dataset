Patch Set 2: Fails

There is a pre existing issue that causes this test case to hang intermittently. I borrow the logic from another test case which was already merged and I have verified that the other test case fails for the same reason as my testcase does. I plan on fixing that issue in another commit. In the meantime I think this code is correct.

Line:68, backfill.cc -> Where is this vbucket id logged?

Line:125, backfill.cc -> If a given storage type doesn't support "dumpDeletions" and has more than 90% resident ratio, this won't be correct. We should not schedule the backfill in this case.

Line:72, kvstore.hh -> Please add the short description for this function.

Line:261, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> What option "0" means? I think we should define and use meaningful constant names.

Line:1223, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Does it mean that dumpKeys will create items for persisted deletions? If so, that won't be correct for warmup.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:261, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> The options are flags so you can or multiple flags together. The couchstore_docinfos_options is just a uint64_t so 0 just means no flags. I will add a constant so that this is more clear.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1223, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> No. If you look at the dumpKeys function we pass the COUCHBASE_NO_DELETES option to couchstore so they will be filtered out. I put this extra argument in the if statement to protect people from making mistakes. It is not necessary if you use the change_since function properly.
