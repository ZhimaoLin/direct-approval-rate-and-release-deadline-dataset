DESCRIPTION

Partially revert 769cfe07

Note this is a heavily fixed "git revert" due to conflicts...

Remove parts of 769cfe07 (MB-14190) which are no longer needed, that is 
the commit interval code and the unnecessary extra calls to 
store->commit.

The orginal commit added the interval code to support ForestDB 
which needed to batch file commits based on some configuration value, 
whereas CouchStore commits per vbucket update (i.e. always had an 
interval of 1).

The orginal commit also then added extra store->commit calls which in 
the couchstore configuration meant calling down a few layers only to 
return once the CouchKVStore detected all items were flushed. This is
wasted cycles for our supported configuration.

Note that some of the refactoring created by 769cfe07 remains.
