DESCRIPTION

Add memory overhead caused by each checkpoint datastructure.

Each checkpoint datastructure has its own variables and especially
maintains the key index for deduplication in a checkpoint. This
overhead should be added to the memory overhead stat.

Patch Set 1:

Could you try to rewrite the first line in the commit msg to include that it adds the memory overhead to the stats ;-) (because I don't want us just to add memory overhead ;-))
