DESCRIPTION

Set the min number of non-IO shared threads to two.

As non-IO threads takes care of processing UPR messages in the
consumer side, it will be mostly better to increase the min number of
non-IO threads to be more than one thread. Note that the number of
non-IO threads can be configurable.
