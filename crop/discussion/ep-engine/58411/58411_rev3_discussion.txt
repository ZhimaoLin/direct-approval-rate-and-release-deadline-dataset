DESCRIPTION

[DCP Consumer]: Grab streamMutex when transitioning to 'dead' on DCP_STREAM_END

Passive stream should grab streamMutex lock before transitioning to dead
state upon processing the DCP_STREAM_END packet. Lock needs to be acquired
before any state transitions, as transitionState() function can be called
from multiple threads and all those can change the 'state_' member in the
stream object
