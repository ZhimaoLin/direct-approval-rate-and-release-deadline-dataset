DESCRIPTION

MB-3522 Fix to the duplicate item issue caused by expiry window.

We observed the duplicate item issue during the warmup time, which
is incurred by the bug in the disk IO optimization using item expiry
window. For example, the following sequence of operations cause the
duplicate items in database:
1) set (k1,v1) with expiry time 0 (permanent)
2) set (k1,v2) with expiry time 2 sec.
3) set (k1,v3) with expiry time 0.
4) Restart the engine.
After warmup, we have duplicate items (k1,v1) and (k1,v3).

This change fixes the above issue by deleting the old item from
database when the flusher skips the new item that will be expired
within current_time + expiry_window.
