DESCRIPTION

MB-18669: Fix for intermittently failing test 'stream_req_partial'

Test fails intermittently with an error message like one below:
ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc:559 Test failed:
(Expected `100', got `25' - Invalid number of deletes)
This commit includes fixes for following tescases:
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial;
- dcp_producer_stream_req_partial_with_time_sync.
The reason these tests fail is that the following wait condition
wait_for_stat_to_be(h, h1, "vb_0:num_checkpoints", 2, "checkpoint");
which is used to identify if 100 items have been deleted is not
appropriate, i.e. it is being satisfied much earlier and for much
smaller number of items being deleted.
As this looks to be the best known wait condition for dcp flow
(please let me know otherwise), the testcase was modified to
delete smallest number of items which triggers this wait
condition (given values of sequence range and checkpoint buffer
size (max number of items) for this testcase).
