Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style: I generally prefix subjects with the component / area they fix, this can be helpful in quickly scanning over commit logs etc and seeing what is / isn't test code - i.e. I'd personally name this:

> ep_testsuite_basic: Tighten up missing key check on lock tests

or similar.

(Note on "Style:" comments - there's a couple of review comments I use - given there may be multiple comments on a single patch (and an overall Review+/-1/2 score), it's useful to distinguish "important" comments (which trigger the -1/-2) and minor issues:

'Style': A comment on the style of some code, which IMHO could be improved. Typically has no functional effect and hence I don't mind if people choose to ignore them, but maybe something to consider for future changes).

'Nit': A minor error, formatting issue or similar. Again I wouldn't make this blocking for a patch going in, but worth fixing if you're in the area etc.
