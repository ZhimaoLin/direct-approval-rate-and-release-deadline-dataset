DESCRIPTION

MB-8828: Check memory condition before returning enomem for withmeta ops

If we run into a memory condition when we are trying to put something
into the hashtable then we return enomem even though we might actually
be able to free memory. This change makes sure we check the memory
condition before actually returning an error code.
