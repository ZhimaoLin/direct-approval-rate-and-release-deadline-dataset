DESCRIPTION

MB-15573: Remove unpredicatable code from warmup and improve DGM scenarios.

Force 1 active vbucket to the top of the shard's list of VBs to ensure that
bad DGM setups on nodes with a low number of vbuckets doesn't get trashed
by replica vbuckets.

Use C++11 features so that we generate a repeatable psudeo random sequence
and use the distribution API to weight this between active/replica buckets.

A subsequent patch can be made to introduce config values for the weights.

(1 comment)

Line:1032, src/warmup.cc -> Seeing as you know this will have two elements in it (active & replica), you could use std::array<> to make that explicit.

Patch Set 1:

an excellent suggestion, I will update with std:array, so used to just grabbing a vector.
