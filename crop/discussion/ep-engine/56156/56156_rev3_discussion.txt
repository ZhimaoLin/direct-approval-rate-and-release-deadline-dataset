DESCRIPTION

MB-12352 Remove unnesscary couchstore open/reads from backfill

CPU profiling of memcached during a rebalance showed that we opened and read
from each vbucket file twice. The source of the opens and reads were tracked
down to two places.

1. open/read - How many items for stat reporting using getNumItems
2. open/read - Scan for items using sequence number

To reduce the total number of reads (and opens) we can merge 1 into 2 by
calculating 1. as part of callbacks performed by 2.

This patch changes the unused statistic backfillRemaining to be called
backfillTotal and subtly changes how the estimate stat is calculated
as it will count as the backfill reads items, opposed to being set
from the now removed getNumItems.

Line:264, src/dcp/stream.h -> Looking at the description for this stat, I think it would be more appropriate to leave the stat name as it was before, but track it as you are with this patch. backfillTotal doesn't quite meet this stat's description.

Line:164, src/dcp/backfill.cc -> I'm not sure if it is good to change a way of estimating this stat. The main reason for exporting this stat allows us to get the estimated backlog size for backfill completion, which is occasionally useful for us.

Line:164, src/dcp/backfill.cc -> I think we can avoid an extra couchstore open / close call by having KVStore::initScanContext (line 166) return the estimated number of items in scanCtx instance. KVStore::initScanContext() opens a couchstore file to init the scan context and KVStore::scan() in line 189 below uses the same DB handle to scan a given sequence range.

Please note that "backfill_remaining" stat is intended to include the backfill backlog items that are not read from disk yet.
