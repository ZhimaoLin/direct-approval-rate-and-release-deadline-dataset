DESCRIPTION

MB-16186: Stream only keys if DCP client sets NO_VALUE flag

DCP clients can choose to get only keys (no values) by setting an
appropriate flag at the time of DCP request. When this flag is set
only item key and metadata are streamed to the client. This helps
reduce the indexing time.

Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:77, src/dcp/backfill.cc -> Given this is accessing a bunch of internal StoredValue state, it might be cleaner to create a new method on StoredValue - toValuelessItem() or similar and move all that to there.

Line:4902, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This comment seems inaccurate - surely we should *not* be expecting values?

Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:151, src/dcp/stream.cc -> could be moved to the initializer list?

Line:4902, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> "default" should send the value (otherwise we'll break backwards compatibility??)
