DESCRIPTION

MB-16186: Stream only keys if DCP client sets NO_VALUE flag

DCP clients can choose to get only keys (no values) by setting an
appropriate flag at the time of DCP request. When this flag is set
only item key and metadata are streamed to the client. This helps
reduce the indexing time.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:59, src/dcp/backfill.cc -> minor one: please move this line to the beginning of if clause below as its scope is limited in if clause.

Line:305, src/dcp/response.h -> I think it is better to put 'case KEY_VALUE' to make the code more readable and use 'default' to log an error and return logic_error exception.

Line:285, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Shouldn't we set rejectResp to resp before returning the error? Otherwise, we will lose (and leak) an item instance which should be streamed later.

Line:305, src/dcp/response.h -> Indeed - that was the whole reason I suggested using a switch statement!

You can just return immediately in the two supported cases, then throw an exception after the switch statement - logic_error or similar.

Line:2217, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Why the split declaration and assignment of err_msg? You can just declare it along with it's definition here.

Line:2248, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Most of this time calculation code looks duplicated from that at line 2223. Can you refactor into a helper function please?

Line:4905, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Careful - I think the order of prescidence will mean that you end up checking for greater than zero (as you divide by 100 before converting to a float).

Line:5600, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Why is this line moved? I can't see any users of cookie between it's old and new location.

Line:8686, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Again - a bunch of duplication. Please refactor.

Line:8692, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Might be worth adding a checklt() function similar to checked which prints the values. Otherwise this will be hard to debug if it fails.
