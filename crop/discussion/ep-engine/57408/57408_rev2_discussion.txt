DESCRIPTION

C++11 modernization: Delete SingleThreadedRCPtr

Now SingleThreadedRCPtr is simply a #define for std::shared_ptr,
remove it and replace any instances with std::shared_ptr.

Also clean up a number of classes which no longer need to inherit from
RCValue.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

Setting -2 as are are still issues with RCPtr and std::shared_ptr interacting. Ultimately they need to share the same underlying reference counts, which may be hard before std::atomic_shared_ptr arrives in C++17.
