DESCRIPTION

Perform the live replication by fetching items from the checkpoints.

In the previous TAP module, each TAP connection has its own queue for
placing all incomming mutations and replicating them to the slave
nodes.

This adapts the previous implementation by fetching incomming
mutations from the checkpoints in the unified queue for each vbucket
and transmitting them to the slaves.
