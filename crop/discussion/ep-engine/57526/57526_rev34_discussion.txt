Line:1436, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Well, we can define a new function in ForestDBKVStore to get vbucket_state instance for a given vbucket. I understand the above std::vector instance won't require a physical copy of cachedVBStates in the recent C++ std library, but think simply getting one vbucket_state instance will be still better.

However, let's merge this change as the above comment is not critical.
