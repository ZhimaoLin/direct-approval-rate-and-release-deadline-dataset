Line:588, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Nit: Personally I'd return the decoded ForestMetaData as a return argument - that way it's explicit from the caller that the whole metadata is modified/ replaced. By using a (out) reference parameter it's not clear from the caller if the existing data is totally replaced or not.

Line:588, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> The rdoc argument should be const.

Line:620, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I suggest you perform this in the new forestMetaDecode function - anyone who wants to use it will need it in the host endianness, and by moving to the function you ensure the caller doesn't forget to do it.

Line:1295, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As above.

Line:1412, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> You can move this down into the if statement at line 1454.

Line:1418, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Suggest you use the common forestMetaDecode() function to reduce duplication. 

(I know we only need two fields here and it's perhaps wasteful to decode them all, but I suspect an optimised build the compiler will optimise the unused items away.

If not, and this stuff shows up in a profile we can make an optimised function which only decodes the times later on.
