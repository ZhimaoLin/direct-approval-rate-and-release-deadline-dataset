(9 comments)

Line:37, src/kvstore.h -> Nit: Please keep in alphabetical order (so before PersistenceCallback)

Line:90, src/kvstore.h -> Please document what the key and value of this structure are.

Line:745, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Nit: this can be const.

Line:1663, src/ep.cc -> Nit: Can be made const

Line:613, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Can this / the code in ::scan() be refactored into a common metadata decode function to remove the duplication?

Line:1411, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please use the correct-sized formatter (PRId16).

Line:1420, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Use correct-sized formatter (PRId16) - this will potentially crash on Win32 at the moment, as the varargs formatter will try to read 32bits from the list of arguments, when there's only 16bits, and hence the %s pointer will be incorrectly passed.

Line:1440, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This code looks like it's only relevant if the doc isn't deleted and it has an exptime - suggest you move it into the else if(exptime) conditional to save the cost of looking up the list of persisted vbuckets, and to make the code easier to read.

Line:1449, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Similarly here - this only looks to be used in the deleted case - move it to that part of the code.
