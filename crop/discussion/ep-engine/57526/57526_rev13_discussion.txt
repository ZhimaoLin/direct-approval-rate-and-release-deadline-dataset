Line:1394, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We should also remove the magic +8, +12. I assume the first 8 bytes is something we skip in this case (one uint64_t?) in which case you can use sizeof(uint64_t). for +12 you can use sizeof(uint64_t) + sizeof(exptime).

Line:1436, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same with the 20.

I'm thinking it might be clearer if there was a struct defining the metadata, or at least some helper functions which return the appropriate fields from the metadata (if you are worried about struct packing / endianness issues).
