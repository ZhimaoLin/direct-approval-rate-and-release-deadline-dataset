Line:32, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> You need to be careful here - I believe #pragma pack is a compiler specific optimisation, and I don't know if GCC / Clang support it.

If possible (i.e. you can still break backwards combat) I would suggest arranging the struct members so they are all naturally aligned - for example shuffle `rev_seqno` to occur between `can` and `exptime`.

That will give you a struct which should read correctly on all our supported platforms, without the need for compiler-specific extensions.

Line:32, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Makes sense. I shall try addressing this using natural alignment
