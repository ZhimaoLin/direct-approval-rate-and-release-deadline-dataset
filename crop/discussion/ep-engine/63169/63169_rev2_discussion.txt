DESCRIPTION

MB-19281: [BP] Add template class RelaxedAtomic<>

Backport of the RelaxedAtomic template class from
platform/watson. Changed from C++11 std::atomic<> to our own
AtomicValue<> as 3.x doesn't have C++11 support on all platforms, and
moved to ep-engine as AtomicValue is an ep-engine specific class.

Doesn't include unit tests as they depend on GTest which isn't present
in 3.0.x.

Merge of the following platform commits:

* http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/54973 - Add template class RelaxedAtomic<>
* http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/55870 - RelaxedAtomic: Allow construction from template type
* http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/55889 - RelaxedAtomic: Remove 'explicit' definition for copy constructor
