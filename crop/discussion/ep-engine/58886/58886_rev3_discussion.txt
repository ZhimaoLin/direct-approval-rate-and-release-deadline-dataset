DESCRIPTION

MB-17502: DCP performance regression fixed.

Many patches were added to speed up DCP, however some of that
performance was lost when doing some code tidying without
re-profiling.

The roundRobin/vbReady code has a bufferLog.pauseIfFull() call on the
"hot" part of the loop, this is the main cause of the regression.

With that fixed CPU profiling and system benchmarking shows that DCP
is back to 3.1.3 levels but highlighted that:

1. DcpProducer::getNextItem was hot (5% of a DcpProducer thread).
2. DcpConsumer::processBufferedItems was hitting SpinLock hard.
   20 to 30% (of a consumer thread) at times is consumed by 
   SpinLock code. 

So to address 1. the fix is actually to remove the roundRobin/vbReady
code. It is actually no better, and in some cases a little slower than
the orginal. This code is replaced by std:: structures *but* the
Mutex protecting the std:: structures has a much smaller scope.

Note the DcpProducerReadyQueue which is used to replace the vbReady code
has been profiled and proven that using a std::map to power find() is 
faster than searching a std::list. This is important because the find()
method is part of the front-end operation threads.

To address 2. it was observed that the consumer code is constructing
a passive_stream_t frequently (everytime around the for loop). After
construction the code then tests if there is a pointer.
The copy construction uses SpinLocks and can be avoided by
testing the streams[vb] directly,  only then do we construct
a copy of the passive_stream_t. This means a node with 124 vbuckets
doesn't do 1000 copy-constructions which only result in a NULL pointer.
