DESCRIPTION

MB-17502: DCP performance regression fixed.

Many patches were added to speed up DCP, however some of that
performance was lost when doing some code tidying without
re-profiling.

The roundRobin/vbReady code has a bufferLog.pauseIfFull call on the
"hot" part of the loop, this is the main cause of the regression.

With that fixed CPU profiling and benchmarking shows that DCP is back
to 3.1.3 levels but highlighted that:

1. DcpProducer::getNextItem was hot (5% of a DcpProducer thread).
2. DcpConsumer::processBufferedItems was hitting SpinLock hard.
   20 to 30% at times was consumed by SpinLock code.

So to address 1. the fix is actually to remove the roundRobin/vbReady
code. It is actually no better and in some cases a little slower than
the orginal. This code is replaces with std:: structures *but* the
Mutex used has a much smaller scope.

Note the DcpProducerReadyQueue has been profiled and proven that having
the std::map powering find() is much faster than searching the list.
This is important because the find method is part of the front-end
operation thread.

To address 2. it was observed that the consumer code is constructing
a passive_stream_t frequently, then testing if there is a pointer.
The construction uses the SpinLock code and can be avoided just by
testing the streams[vb] directly and only then do we construct
a copy of the passive_stream_t. This avoids the SpinLock code on
every iteration of the for loop in the affected function.
