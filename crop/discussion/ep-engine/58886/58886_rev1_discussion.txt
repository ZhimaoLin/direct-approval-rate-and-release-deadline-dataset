DESCRIPTION

MB-17502: DCP performance regression fixed.

Many patches were added to speed up DCP, however some of that
performance was lost when doing some code tidying without
re-profiling.

The roundRobin/vbReady code has a bufferLog.pauseIfFull call on the
"hot" part of the loop, this is the main cause of the regression.

With that fixed CPU profiling and benchmarking shows that DCP is back
to 3.1.3 levels but highlighted that getNextItem was still hot.

So the second fix is to actually remove the roundRobin/vbReady code
and revert back to std:: structures *but* with finer-grained locking.

The DcpProducerReadyQueue has been profiled and proven that having
a std::map powering find is faster than searching the list.
This is important because the find method is part of the front-end
operation thread.
