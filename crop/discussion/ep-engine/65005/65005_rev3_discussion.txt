File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Please expand the description in the commit message - what the purpose of this change is, and how you use it.

Line:168, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> We should either remove the CSV support (if you don't need it for anything), or document it in the commit message.

Line:172, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Nit: alignment

Line:180, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Probably better to use std::put_time (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/put_time) - that doesn't require a temporary buffer of a specific size (apologies for pointing you in the wrong direction).

(Basically if possible I try not to use fixed-size arrays unless the compiler can check for me they are the correct size. Your format looks reasonable (apart from the fact you missed the trailing '\0' :) - but it may be wrong / output could change etc - what about timezone string etc?).

Line:209, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Nit: Remove the space - the template argument is generally written "attached" to the template.
