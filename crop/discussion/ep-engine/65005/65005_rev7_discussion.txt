DESCRIPTION

MB-19746: Add xml output to ep_perfsuite

- The new performance commit validation, CBNT, requires input data
  in XML format which mirrors that of the GTest XML output
- This commit adds this functionality to ep_perfsuite, providing
  the ability to output the results in textual format or xml
- It can be invoked by using the new `-f` flag, followed by either
  `xml` or `text`, if this flag is not specified then the default
  behaviour of textual output is assumed

Line:164, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> will remove this space.

Line:168, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc xxx@xxx.xxx - I cannot use `put_time` as GCC 4.9 (which our CV slaves use to build) does not support it, it seems.

This works fine for me locally but I have found https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54354#c9 which shows that this was only fixed for GCC 5, is there a better alternative here?
