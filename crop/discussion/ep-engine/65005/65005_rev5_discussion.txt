DESCRIPTION

MB-19746: Add xml output to ep_perfsuite

- The new performance commit validation, CBNT, requires input data
  in XML format which mirrors that of the GTest XML output
- This commit adds this functionality to ep_perfsuite, providing
  the ability to output the results in textual format or xml
- It can be invoked by using the new `-f` flag, followed by either
  `xml` or `text`, if this flag is not specified then the default
  behaviour of textual output is assumed
