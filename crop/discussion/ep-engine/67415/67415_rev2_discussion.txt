Line:849, src/ep.h -> This seems unnecessary - ep-engine shouldn't know anything about forestdb directly. Any reason why `getKVStoreStat` cannot be used instead?

Line:849, src/ep.h -> Yea you're right, ep-engine should remain oblivious of the underlying store.

I added this because getKVStoreStat calculates the count by adding roUnderlying and rwUnderlying's numbers, and since the block cache is a commonly shared data structure, we'd get a spurious value (essentially twice the expected count).

I could rename this to something like getRWKVStoreStat that would get the number's off of a single instance instead.

Line:3649, src/ep_engine.cc -> Again, these shouldn't have `fdb` in the name - nothing in ep-engine should care about that (there's no mention of `couchstore` in these stats`.) Rename to something like `ep_io_block_cache_hits / misses` and then simply only print them if the backend returns true (which you're doing already).

Line:849, src/ep.h -> I'd rather not have another function (with very similar / duplicated functionality) - the rename doesn't really help that ;)

I see two (other) options:

a) refactor the existing code to allow the user to select the source of the data - i.e. add an `enum class Source { RW, RO, Both}` argument to the existing method.

b) Change the way ForestKVStore exposes the stat - simply return zero from say the RO variant, and the value from the RW variant, that way you won't double-count.

Line:3649, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:849, src/ep.h -> Yes makes sense, I'll change the way this is being done : )
