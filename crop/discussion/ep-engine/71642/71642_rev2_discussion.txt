Line:688, src/ep_engine.cc -> Ok.. I counted that as the GET stats in the front-end and updated the topkeys for the item as well... should we nuke those and just keep this?

Line:1241, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:688, src/ep_engine.cc -> Well, I don't think we should change externally visible behaviour - or at least if we do it needs to be documented.

I think it's simplest to just keep it the same as it was previously - so if the memcached frontend didn't include GET_LOCKED in cmd_get before then it shouldn't after.

Line:688, src/ep_engine.cc -> Ok..

This is however for 5.0, so now would be a time for changing stuff ;-) The primary reason for it _NOT_ being included in the old frontend stats was because of compatibility with upstream memcached and they didn't want to have any locking (as it doesn't make any sense in a cache). I do see that it could be nice to have a separate "lock" counter so that the user may look at the overall locking picture.. (having a counter for accessing a locked item would also be nice).

Line:688, src/ep_engine.cc -> Fair point - if we do want to change then 5.0 is ok - but we still need to document that the front-end `cmd_get` includes locked operations - or maybe add it's own separate stat.

Having said that, I'd rather not remove the counter from ep-engine. It's kind of an "internal" counter anyways - I don't think the UI shows it - but it's useful data for us.
