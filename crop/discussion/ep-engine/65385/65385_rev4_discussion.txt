DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Make task scheduling fairer

The MB identified that we can starve tasks by scheduling
a higher priority task via wake()

This was due to to wake pushing tasks into the readyQueue
enabling frequent wakes to trigger the starvation.

The fix is to remove readyQueue.push from wake, so that we only
push to the readyQueue. The fetch side of scheduling only looks at
the futureQueue once the readyQueue is empty, thus the identified
starvation won't happen.

A unit-test demonstrates the fix using the single-threaded harness and
expects that two tasks of differing priorities get executed, rather
than the wake() starving the low-priority task.

This test drives:
 - ExecutorPool::schedule
 - ExecutorPool::reschedule
 - ExecutorPool::wake

These are all the methods which can add tasks into the scheduler
queue.

The fetch side is also covered:
 - ExecutorPool::fetchNextTask

Yeah, want to be a bit of a summary wNathalie Landry through of the scheduling system, could of course go "and here are the interesting function" with no comments, but the comments against the function, but I feel they tie together a bit nice in the summary
