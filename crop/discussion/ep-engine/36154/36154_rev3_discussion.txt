DESCRIPTION

MB-10875: fix flusher stat via checkpoint queue

In Checkpoint's queueDirty, check for checkpoint start message
to ensure that we do not decrement persistence cursor for an
existing item. We also should not consider checkpoint start/end
items in incrementing / decrementing a cursor offset.

Correct stat to totalEnqueued in queueBackfill.
