DESCRIPTION

MB-9919: Provide DB data size and file size stats

This change provides DB data size and file size per vbucket
and their aggregated values through stats call.

stats "vbucket-details vbucket_id" returns the list of a given
vbucket's stats including its DB data size and file size.
For example, "vbucket-details 0" includes the following stats
for vbucket 0:

1) vb_0:db_data_size --> DB data size for vbucket 0
2) vb_0:db_file_size --> DB file size for vbucket 0

On the other hand, stats "all" includes the aggregated DB data
size and file size:

1) ep_db_data_size --> DB data size aggreaged across
                        all vbuckets.
2) ep_db_file_size --> DB file size aggregated across
                       all vbuckets.

Sundar,

I think we should update the stats when the compaction is completed. Can you please address it on top of my patch?
