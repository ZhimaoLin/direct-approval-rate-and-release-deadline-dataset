DESCRIPTION

MB-18650: Speedup hash_table_test (particulary under TSan) by ~40x

The hash_table_test takes ~45s to run when run under ThreadSantizer
during commit-validation jobs, and sometimes (under machine load) can
hit it's 60s timeout. Looking at the test itself, there are a few
adjustments which can be made to the implementation to speed it up,
without removing any of the test functionality / scope:

* Use shorter keys (%d instead of key%d). While this may seem unlikly
  to speed the test up, hash table searching requires a memcmp of keys
  and hence this halves the amount of data which needs to be
  compared. Note that TSan intercepts all memcmp() calls, so these are
  much slower than normal when running under TSan).

* Remove unnecessary copying of std::string.

* Reduce the number of threads for the concurrent test from 16 to
  4. Note that while this does reduce the amount of concurrency, these
  tests were written before we started using Valgrind /
  ThreadSanitizer which do a very good job of detecting data races
  without necessarily "brute-forcing" by running a large number of
  threads.

* Reduce the key count for some tests - the actual number doesn't
  matter here, just there's a representable sample.

Combined, these changes reduce the wall-lock runtime down to under 1s
when run with ThreadSanitizer.
