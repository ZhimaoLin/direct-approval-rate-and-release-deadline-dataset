DESCRIPTION

MB-5092 Don't drop items from dead vbucket checkpoints.

With the new swap rebalance algorithm, there is a very small time
window between (1) the active vbucket becomes a dead state after
takeover, and (2) then reset to replica state. This change doesn't
drop items from dead vbuckets for more reliable replication with
the new rebalance algorithm.
