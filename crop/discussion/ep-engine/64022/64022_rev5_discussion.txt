DESCRIPTION

Refactor ep-engine_dcp_test to ep_unit_tests

The so-called ep-engine_dcp_test suite has evolved away from just
testing DCP, and also tests other classes at a unit-test
level. Additionally, I want to re-use some of the infrastructure which
sets up an EventuallyPersistentEngine instance in other tests
unrelated to DCP.

Therefore refactot the code so the EventuallyPersistentEngine test
code is in it's own file. Given that many of the tests which work with
the top-level objects (EventuallyPersistentEngine etc) need most of
the source files compiling, create a new "ep-engine_ep_unit_tests"
test executable which will contain all tests of this type.
