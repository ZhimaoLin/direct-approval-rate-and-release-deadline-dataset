DESCRIPTION

Add new binary protocol command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, for replica read

New command works exactly like the existing PROTOCOL_BINARY_CMD_GET
except it returns data only for vbuckets in replica state.

This uploads includes:
 * define and implement new command, CMD_GET_REPLICA
 * add ep-engine unit tests that attempt CMD_GET_REPLICA against all four
   vbucket states - active, pending, dead, and replica
