Line:1061, src/ep.cc -> If cookie is NULL, then we should not invoke epstore's compactDB function, but instead return the error immediately from ep-engine class.

Line:1061, src/ep.cc -> One more question, did you confirm that "cookie" was NULL in the gdb backtrace?

Line:1061, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:1061, src/ep.cc -> The stack trace just shows the assertion failure in decrement_session_ctr from a compactDB operation, so no I didn't confirm that cookie is NULL.
I used the same logic here, as in delVBucket case, where we return ENGINE_SUCCESS if cookie is NULL, and this is during the rebalance scenario.

Line:1061, src/ep.cc -> "cookie" was not NULL from the backtrace. I don't think this change will fix the issue.
