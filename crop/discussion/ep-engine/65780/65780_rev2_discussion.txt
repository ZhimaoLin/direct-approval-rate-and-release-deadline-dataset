DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-18453: Make task scheduling fairer"

When running in a >1 node cluster memcached CPU is running
very high. The original fix has introduced a problem which
needs further investigation (fetchTask is very very cpu hot).

This reverts commit e22c9ebeda1aac2fc8f4325cc39a93c3bcefffab.
