DESCRIPTION

MB-15946: Move DCP cursors to new open chkPt when the chkPt has only meta items

(1): When a new checkpoint is created and only queue_op_empty and
queue_op_checkpoint_start are added, we must move any DCP and persistence
cursors pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end in the previous checkpoint to this
new checkpoint. Note we cannot move the TAP cursors in the same way when they
are pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is because TAP replication
protocol expects to receive queue_op_checkpoint_end.
Hence the change also adds a flag to identify if a cursor needs
queue_op_checkpoint_end or not.

(2): Also, when items for replication are got from the checkpoint, we can move
to the new checkpoint even if we encounter queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is
needed because, we do not want to leave any replication cursors hanging onto
queue_op_checkpoint_end in the closed checkpoint when there are only meta items
in the current open checkpoint.

Both the above changes will help release the memory occupied by the closed
checkpoints.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Please also add a unit test (to checkpoint_test.cc?) which validates this optimisation.

Line:134, src/checkpoint.h -> Please document this.

Additionally, it might be clearer to name this something like 'shouldSendCheckpointEndMetaItem' ?

Line:506, src/checkpoint.h -> Please update the description of this to describe what the bool represents. You could also consider using the new Enum instead of the bool.

Line:298, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Personally I'm not a big fan of random 'false' / 'true' literals in function invocations - as a reader you have no idea what this does without opening the definition of the function.

Consider changing to an explicit enum class to CheckpointCursor - e.g. 

 enum class MustSendCheckpointEnd { FALSE, TRUE };

Line:1715, src/ep.cc -> auto for readable ++

Line:486, src/checkpoint.h -> I've found that automatic parameters are dangerous and lead to mistakes (like the infamous XDCR seqno -1 defect in 2.5) Given that there are very few callers to registerCursor and there's now 3 automatic parameter values,  can you make these 3 params required from the caller so we don't slip bugs in.

Line:506, src/checkpoint.h -> Can you typedef this now more complex std::list to ease the readibility?

Line:667, src/checkpoint.h -> As above, if registerCursor drops the automatic params, drop them here too

Line:394, src/checkpoint.cc -> auto cur_it = connCursors.begin(); easier to read

Line:1158, src/checkpoint.cc -> change to auto it =, easier to read
