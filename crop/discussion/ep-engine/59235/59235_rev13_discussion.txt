DESCRIPTION

MB-15946: Move DCP cursors to new open chkPt when the chkPt has only meta items

(1): When a new checkpoint is created and only queue_op_empty and
queue_op_checkpoint_start are added, we must move any DCP and persistence
cursors pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end in the previous checkpoint to this
new checkpoint. Note we cannot move the TAP cursors in the same way when they
are pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is because TAP replication
protocol expects to receive queue_op_checkpoint_end.
Hence the change also adds a flag to identify if a cursor needs
queue_op_checkpoint_end or not.

(2): Also, when items for replication are got from the checkpoint, we can move
to the new checkpoint even if we encounter queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is
needed because, we do not want to leave any replication cursors hanging onto
queue_op_checkpoint_end in the closed checkpoint when there are only meta items
in the current open checkpoint.

Both the above changes will help release the memory occupied by the closed
checkpoints.

Patch Set 13: Code-Review-2

(2 comments)

Line:408, CMakeLists.txt -> You don't need these - ep_testsuite runs as a loaded module into engine_testapp (which already includes the mock_server functionality itself).

Why do you think these source files are needed?

Line:27, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Why is this included? You shouldn't need it (see my previous comment)

Line:408, CMakeLists.txt -> Need to for get_mock_server_api()->cookie->notify_io_complete(cookie, ENGINE_SUCCESS);
Was getting linker error without this.

I see that stream_test module also includes this (to link the same function), so thought this is permissible.

Line:408, CMakeLists.txt -> stream_test is a standalone executable, which is why it compiles the code itself.

If you need access to stuff in the server (i.e. normally memcached, but engine_testapp in these test suites), then you should look at the harness functionality in engine_testapp.cc - see http://src.Piper Jefferson.org/source/xref/trunk/memcached/programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc#1427

A simple example would be something like release_free_memory(void) - http://src.Piper Jefferson.org/source/xref/trunk/memcached/programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc#1051
