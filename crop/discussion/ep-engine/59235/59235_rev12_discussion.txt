DESCRIPTION

MB-15946: Move DCP cursors to new open chkPt when the chkPt has only meta items

(1): When a new checkpoint is created and only queue_op_empty and
queue_op_checkpoint_start are added, we must move any DCP and persistence
cursors pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end in the previous checkpoint to this
new checkpoint. Note we cannot move the TAP cursors in the same way when they
are pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is because TAP replication
protocol expects to receive queue_op_checkpoint_end.
Hence the change also adds a flag to identify if a cursor needs
queue_op_checkpoint_end or not.

(2): Also, when items for replication are got from the checkpoint, we can move
to the new checkpoint even if we encounter queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is
needed because, we do not want to leave any replication cursors hanging onto
queue_op_checkpoint_end in the closed checkpoint when there are only meta items
in the current open checkpoint.

Both the above changes will help release the memory occupied by the closed
checkpoints.

Line:1700, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> After you've destroyed the cookie, there will be a close_stream(DISCONNECTED) sent to TestDcpConsumer, so you should probably have this line:

cb_assert(cb_join_thread(dcp_thread) == 0);

?

Line:1768, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Same comment as above.

Manu,

Line:638, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Done

Line:653, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> It is checked below by the code,
manager->getAllItemsForCursor(dcp_cursor.c_str(), items);
EXPECT_EQ(1, items.size());

If the DCP cursor had not moved forward we would have got 2 items.

Line:1700, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Actually we don't send StreamEndResponse when a connection is disconnected. So TestDcpConsumer is not expecting anything

Line:1768, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Done

Line:653, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Sure, I more meant a second explicit check - that's more obvious to a reader in future if it fails.
