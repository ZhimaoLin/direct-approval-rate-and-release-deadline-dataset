DESCRIPTION

MB-15946: Move rep cursors to new open chkPt when the chkPt has only meta items

When a new checkpoint is created and only queue_op_empty and
queue_op_checkpoint_start are added, we must move any replication cursors
pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end in the previous checkpoint to this new
checkpoint.

Also, when items for replication are got from the checkpoint, we can move to
the new checkpoint even if we encounter queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is
needed because, we do not want to leave any replication cursors hanging onto
queue_op_checkpoint_end in the closed checkpoint when there are only meta items
in the current open checkpoint.

Both the above changes will help release the memory occupied by the closed
checkpoints.
