DESCRIPTION

{WIP} Ephemeral: Do DCP backfill from ordered in-memory data structure (list)

This commits implements a class that does backfill from in-memory
ordered data strucuture (list) and informs the DCP stream of the
backfill progress.

It calls one synchronous vbucket api to read items in the sequential
order from the in-memory ordered data strucuture and calls the DCP
stream for disk snapshot, backfill items and backfill completion.
