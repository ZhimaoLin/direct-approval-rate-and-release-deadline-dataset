DESCRIPTION

Ephemeral: Do DCP backfill from ordered in-memory data structure (list)

This commits implements a class that does backfill from in-memory
ordered data strucuture (list) and informs the DCP stream of the
backfill progress.

It calls a synchronous vBucket API to read items in the sequential
order from the in-memory ordered data strucuture and calls the DCP
stream for disk snapshot, backfill items and backfill completion.

This commit runs a DCP stream level module test to check if the
backfill happens correctly.

DCP functional tests for ephemeral buckets are not enabled in this
commit because they rely on certain stats and operations related
to persistence. Plan is to decouple these persistence dependencies
and enable them in a separate commit

Line:120, src/ephemeral_vb.h -> Don't make this inline - it's unlikely to have any material affect on runtime (you're about to call a potentially expensive function which wNathalie Landrys a long linked list, making the entry-point inline is basically pointless), and you're just making compilation slower, as any caller of EphemeralVB now needs the full contents of item.h.
