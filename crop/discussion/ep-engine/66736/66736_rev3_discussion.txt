DESCRIPTION

Refactor EPStore::queueDirty into two functions

The vast majority of EPStore::queueDirty is dealing solely with
VBucket-level things - note virtually all function calls are prefixed
with 'vb->'. Move all this VBuckket-specific code to a new
VBucket::queueDirty method.

This improves the encapsulation of VBucket, with the ultimate aim of
making 'ht' be private to it.
