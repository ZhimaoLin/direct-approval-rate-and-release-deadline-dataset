DESCRIPTION

MB-15374: Cancel all tasks if force flag set during destroy

Override the blockShutdown flag for tasks if force is set
during shutdown/destroy.

Also, no need to invoke stopTaskGroup() in EpStore destructor,
as there's already a call to unregisterTaskable() which invokes
stopTaskGroup() anyway.
