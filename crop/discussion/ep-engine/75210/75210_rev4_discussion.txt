DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Change configuration.cc to use boost::variant

** Will not pass CV yet as it has new Boost dependencies - but feedback
appreciated **

Using variant simplifies some aspects of configuration.cc. It also paved
the way to templating a number of methods, reducing code repetition.
