DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Change configuration.cc to use boost::variant

** Will not pass CV yet as it has new Boost dependencies - but feedback
appreciated **

Using variant simplifies some aspects of configuration.cc. It also paved
the way to templating a number of methods, reducing code repetition.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(7 comments)

Line:37, src/configuration.cc -> Check the header order (see Coding Standard).

Line:104, src/configuration.cc -> As previous, I think these need to be in the header.

Line:108, src/configuration.cc -> Probably worth a comment explaining why you need this explicit specialisation.

Line:140, src/configuration.cc -> Similar here - move to header.

Line:149, src/kv_bucket.cc -> This seems unrelated to the variant refactor - please move to a separate patch.

Line:444, src/configuration.h -> I think you need the explicit instantiations here in the header (so the compiler knows at compile-time what instantiations are valid).

Line:453, src/configuration.h -> Same.
