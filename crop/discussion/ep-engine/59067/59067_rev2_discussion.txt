DESCRIPTION

Update CAS and rev seqno in the case of a TTL update

A TTL update is effectively a mutation on the item. Thus the item's CAS
value needs to be updated so that this mutation will win in the case of
LWW. Also increment the revision sequence number to ensure that the item
with updated TTL will have higher rev sequence number in a conflict
resolution scenario.

Can you write a unit test for this or extend the current TTL unit test?

Line:2430, src/ep.cc -> As a separate minor refactoring, I think we can define a new function like updateTTL() in StoredValue to update these at once.
