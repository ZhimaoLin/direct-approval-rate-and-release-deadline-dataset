DESCRIPTION

Update CAS and rev seqno in the case of a TTL update

A TTL update is effectively a mutation on the item. Thus the item's CAS
value needs to be updated so that this mutation will win in the case of
LWW. Also increment the revision sequence number to ensure that the item
with updated TTL will have higher rev sequence number in a conflict
resolution scenario.

Line:2436, src/ep.cc -> I think we can get rid of this check as the vbucket state is already checked in the beginning of this function while the state lock is still grabbed. For simplifying the code, I think we can move line 2439 - 2441 to line after 2429 and remove the lines from 2435 to 2443.
