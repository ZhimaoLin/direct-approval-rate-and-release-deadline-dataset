DESCRIPTION

Update CAS and rev seqno in the case of a TTL update

A TTL update is effectively a mutation on the item. Thus the item's CAS
value needs to be updated so that this mutation will win in the case of
LWW. Also increment the revision sequence number to ensure that the item
with updated TTL will have higher rev sequence number in a conflict
resolution scenario.

I think it would do good to create an MB for this, so we can track this change - if in case we were to hit some problem related to this from an earlier release in the future.
