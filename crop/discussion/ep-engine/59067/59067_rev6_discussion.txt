DESCRIPTION

MB-17616: Update CAS and rev seqno in the case of a TTL update

A TTL update is effectively a mutation on the item. Thus the item's CAS
value needs to be updated so that this mutation will win in the case of
LWW. Also increment the revision sequence number to ensure that the item
with updated TTL will have higher rev sequence number in a conflict
resolution scenario.
