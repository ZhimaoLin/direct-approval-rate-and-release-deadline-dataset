DESCRIPTION

aggregateQueueStats: Pass aggregator by reference

aggregateQueueStats() takes a ConnCounter argument to aggregate
results in. Given there must be a valid (non-NULL) object to use this
method, change from passing by pointer to by reference to simplify
code by removing the need for explicit nullptr checks.
