DESCRIPTION

Minor fix which helps Xcode generated project build.

Issue is that the add_custom_command references gencode/genconfig via
a path, yet on Xcode build all output goes into
build/ep-engine/Debug|Release/ thus gencode/genconfig fail dependency
checks.

Using just the add_excutable name of gencode/genconfig allows cmake
to use the correct path.
