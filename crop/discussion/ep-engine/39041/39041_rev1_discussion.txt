DESCRIPTION

MB-11553 Check if any cursors can move to the open checkpoint.

This change allows us to check more often if any cursors can
move to the open checkpoint because they alreay reach to the end
of the closed checkpoint.

Note that we have this optimization in 2.x, but accidently removed
it in the 3.0 branch.
