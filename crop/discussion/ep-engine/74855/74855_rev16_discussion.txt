DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Rename stream_state_t to State and move into Stream

Also:
 - make it an enum class.
 - make it a protected member of Stream.
 - provide a set of is__ functions to avoid checking state directly.
 - simplify and rename the function that produces a readable name for a
stream state.

Line:1164, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Still need to remove the int() cast here.

Line:1244, src/dcp/stream.cc -> ditto

Line:1246, src/dcp/stream.cc -> ditto

Line:1292, src/dcp/stream.cc -> ditto

Line:157, src/dcp/stream.h -> Strictly speaking this should be returning a std::string (as that's what the name suggests) - that would also make it easier to use  when you're including it in log messages (e.g. where you're currently having to create a std::string() from the result).
