DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Rename stream_state_t to State and move into Stream

Also:
 - make it an enum class.
 - make it a protected member of Stream.
 - provide a set of is__ functions to avoid checking state directly.
 - simplify and rename the function that produces a readable name for a
stream state.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Line:71, src/dcp/stream.cc -> No need for this to be a member function - it can be static.

Line:1164, src/dcp/stream.cc -> You can use the new to_string() function you created here.

Line:1452, src/dcp/stream.cc -> ditto

Line:1454, src/dcp/stream.cc -> here also

Line:2070, src/dcp/stream.cc -> again here

Line:154, src/dcp/stream.h -> Style: Given you include `Stream` in every state, it's simpler to simply drop that prefix (or maybe rename the enum to `StreamState` if you prefer) ?

Line:71, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:1164, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Don't want to use the function here as its none of the known states and therefore we will execute the following logging in the to_string function.

Stream::to_string(State): " + std::to_string(int(st)));


Note:  Have changed to use the to_string function in the other cases you have identified.
