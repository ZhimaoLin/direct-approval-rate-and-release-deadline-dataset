DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Rename stream_state_t to State and move into Stream

Also:
 - make it an enum class.
 - make it a protected member of Stream.
 - provide a set of is__ functions to avoid checking state directly.
 - simplify and rename the function that produces a readable name for a
stream state.
