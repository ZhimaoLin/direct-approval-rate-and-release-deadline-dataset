I'd appreciate it if this is reviewed and merged before any other change is checked in considering that this had resolves a number of conflicts already.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Overall looks good, but have some clarification questions.

Line:1382, src/connmap.cc -> Why this function is not needed anymore?

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you change the title like "Merge branch 'Piper Jefferson/sherlock' to couchbase/master"

Line:521, src/connmap.h -> Why this function gets removed?

Line:40, src/connmap.h -> Why do we need to include ep_engine.h?

Line:1382, src/connmap.cc -> This caused a heap-use-after-free issue caught by thread sanitizer. Note that we call the destructor of dcpConnMap after unregistering the executor pool, so the task is already gone by then.

I've addressed it in 3.0.x here:
http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/57699/

Line:40, src/connmap.h -> Because, in DcpProducerNotifier task, we invoke a function that belongs to ep-engine, see below: line 534.

Line:1382, src/connmap.cc -> OK, when we do the conflict resolutions for branch merge, I suggest to not make any changes beyond conflict resolutions because this will make it difficult for us to debug any regressions from those changes. As you already made a separate fix in 3.0.x, then let's merge it to sherlock to master separately.
