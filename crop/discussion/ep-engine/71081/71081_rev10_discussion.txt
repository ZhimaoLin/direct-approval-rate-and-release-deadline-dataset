DESCRIPTION

MB-21976: Ensure all pendingBGFetches are terminated on VBbucket delete

On a VBucket delete we need to ensure that all pendingBGFetches are
terminated and any connections waiting for a BGFetch to complete are
notified with ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET.

Although we previously deleted the pendingBGFetches in the vbucket
destructor we did not send any notifications to waiting connections.

This patch moves the deletion of pendingBGFetches into the
notifyAllPendingConnsFailed function and in addition notifies all the
connections awaiting a BGFetch with an ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET.

Line:34, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.cc -> According to the logging spec draft they propose that the vb's to be listed as vb:num. It would probably make sense to use the same format all over the place ?

Line:38, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.cc -> Would it be useful to include the vbucket id?

Line:34, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.cc -> good point - thanks, done

Line:38, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.cc -> We have done away with separately keeping the vbucket id, so unfortunately I cannot print it out.
