Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:6304, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This raises an interesting question - do we want to show all aliases in the configuration stats?

Clearly for backwards compatibility for old values (e.g. the max_workers stuff) we do, but for other cases it may be desirable to make them explicit opt-in (i..e unless you know about the alias we don't advertise it).

I think for now I'm ok with keeping this as-is, but we should think further if we start to add lots of aliases...
