Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:1798, src/ep_engine.cc -> Minor comment: Please start "if predicate" with a positive condition:

if (vb) {
   ...
} else {
   ...
}

This is just our coding convention.

Line:1799, src/ep_engine.cc -> Does the design spec mention that zero will be returned as a UUID to the caller when there are any erroneous cases in a server side?
