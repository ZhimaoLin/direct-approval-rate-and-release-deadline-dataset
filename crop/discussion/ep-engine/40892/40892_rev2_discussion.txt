DESCRIPTION

MB-12057: warmup must not block bucket creation

bucket creation is a front end thread and warmup is done by
engine background threads. So if bucket creation waits for warmup then
it is possible for a deadlock when there are few reader threads
Test Infrastructure expects vb0 created by ep-engine init or warmup
this is not necessary for production, so moving test specific
changes into test setup api
