DESCRIPTION

MB-12057: warmup must not block bucket creation

Bucket creation is a front end thread and warmup is done by
engine background threads. So if bucket creation waits for
warmup then a deadlock happens when there are few reader threads
Test Infrastructure expects vb0 created by ep-engine init
or warmup. This is not necessary for production, so moving
vb0 creation to test setup. Minor test code bug fixes.
