DESCRIPTION

Reduce the access to the hashtable from the flusher

Don't try to fetch the value from the hashtable during the
deduplication check in the begin phase for the flusher loop.
We'll do this when we're going to store the item anyway.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks good except for that one thing...

Line:1944, ep.cc -> This doesn't seem quite right.  It seems to imply that this never happens.

Overall I like it, though.  I think a little less abort would be good, though.  :)
