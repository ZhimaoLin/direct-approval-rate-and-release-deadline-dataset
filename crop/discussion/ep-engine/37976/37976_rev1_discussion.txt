DESCRIPTION

MB-11287 use less stringent memory_order for TaskQueue lock

The default memory_order for the atomic variable isLock in
TaskQueue is sequential ordering which imposes severe CPU
fence and results in high CPU usage on machines with many cores.

The acquire-release ordering should offer a balanced mix of
ordering and performance.
