DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Re-register a dropped cursor if we don't backfill

After dropping a cursor, when scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED is called but
the backfill task does not need to be scheduled, it means the cursor is
not re-registered in markDiskSnapshot.

Therefore the cursor must therefore be re-registered from within
scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED.
