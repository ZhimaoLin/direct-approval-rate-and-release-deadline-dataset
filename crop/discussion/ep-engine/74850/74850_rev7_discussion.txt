DESCRIPTION

MB-22451: Re-register a dropped cursor if we don't backfill

After dropping a cursor, when scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED is called but
the backfill task does not need to be scheduled, it means the cursor is
not re-registered in markDiskSnapshot.

Therefore the cursor must therefore be re-registered from within
scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED.

Line:1082, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Shouldn't we check this succeeded? i.e. couldn't it fail if by the time we ask to register the CheckpointManager has discarded the lastReadSeqno?
