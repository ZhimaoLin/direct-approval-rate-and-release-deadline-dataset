DESCRIPTION

MB-5164 Optimize background fetch by batching multiple gets

Batch background fetch (get) together. As background fetches
get backed-up, there is an opportunity to batch the reads from
a single vbucket into one bulk read request. This patch includes
restructuring of the background fetch into a batch of multiple
gets. It also ensure that reads are scheduled fairly by a new
task, bgfetcher, for the read-only dispatcher.
