DESCRIPTION

MB-5164 Optimize background fetch by batching multiple gets

As background fetches get backed-up, there is an opportunity to
batch the reads from a single vbucket into one bulk read request.
This patch includes restructuring of the background fetch into a
batch of multiple gets. It also ensure that reads are scheduled
fairly by a new task, bgfetcher, for the read-only dispatcher.

Patch Set 4:

Please have your initial design review first!

There are still a few issues in handling individual error case and missing callback case from couchstore. Debugging and design change in couchstore are underway.

Thanks!

Line:1356, ep.cc -> Seems that values and items must have the same size. Do you need an assert for that?

Line:1367, ep.cc -> The check for "vb" NULL should not be in this busy loop. Should be before entering the loop.

Line:1424, ep.cc -> Do you need to check for NULL here?

I didn't look at CouchKVStore changes yet, but have some comments on the rest of changes.

Line:206, vbucket.cc -> This memory overhead is already accounted in the tcmalloc hook functions that we implemented in the new memory accounting.

Line:220, vbucket.cc -> Please remove it.

Line:1340, ep.cc -> I think it's not good to have two arrays as parameters. We need to find a simpler way of passing batched items.

Line:1350, ep.cc -> I don't think we need to grab the vbsetMutex. It's not necessary. We should fix it separately in completeBGFetch() as well.

Line:1358, ep.cc -> Where is this item freed?

Line:1399, ep.cc -> This shouldn't be WARNING

Line:1422, ep.cc -> Please simply these by enum queue_operation op = (type == BG_FETCH_METADATA) ? queue_op_get_meta : queue_op_get;

Line:1435, ep.cc -> It shouldn't be WARNING level

Line:703, ep.hh -> Please describe all the parameters.

Line:116, callbacks.hh -> I don't see any changes that use "cookie" here.

Line:39, bgfetcher.cc -> Please add histogram timings for batch read

Line:42, bgfetcher.cc -> Where do we free VBucketBGFetchItems instances?

Line:61, bgfetcher.cc -> Shouldn't the predicate be corrected to if (!pendingJob()) { ...}

Line:63, bgfetcher.cc -> This will sleep for 10 sec.

Line:73, bgfetcher.cc -> Please remove "vbid <= std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max()"

Line:50, bgfetcher.hh -> Please move this function to private section

Line:284, vbucket.hh -> Please remove this variable.

Line:109, vbucket.hh -> It should not be a reference type. Please change it to const queued_item itm;
