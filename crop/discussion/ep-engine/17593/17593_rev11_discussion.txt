DESCRIPTION

MB-5164 Optimize background fetch by batching multiple gets

As background fetches get backed-up, there is an opportunity to
batch the reads from a single vbucket into one bulk read request.
This patch includes restructuring of the background fetch into a
batch of multiple gets. It also ensure that reads are scheduled
fairly by a new task, bgfetcher, for the read-only dispatcher.
