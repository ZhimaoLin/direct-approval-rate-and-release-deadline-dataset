DESCRIPTION

MB-5164 Optimize background fetch by batching multiple gets

As background fetches get backed-up, there is an opportunity to
batch the reads from a single vbucket into one bulk read request.
This patch includes restructuring of the background fetch into a
batch of multiple gets. It also ensure that reads are scheduled
fairly by a new task, bgfetcher, for the read-only dispatcher.

Looks good overall. Most of them are minor ones. One thing that I want to mention is that we may need to reduce the memory copy overhead by having unordered_map container per vbucket rather than BGFetcher. We can address it in a separate commit.

Line:170, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please remove this line.

Line:346, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't we free doc instance as well?

Line:463, ep.cc -> Where is this bg fetcher freed?

Line:1338, ep.cc -> Please align the line.

Line:1358, ep.cc -> key won't be changed. Please simplify it to const std::string &key = (*itemItr)->key;

Line:1409, ep.cc -> Please remove the white space.

Line:1414, ep.cc -> please simplify it to op = queue_op_get;

Line:1430, ep.cc -> Please define the lower priority for getMeta

Line:33, bgfetcher.cc -> Please change the iterator variable name to itm. Using "item" variable causes some naming conflicts with struct item defined in memcached.

Line:367, stats.hh -> Please rename the stat to "getMultiHisto". We don't use those couch histo stats anymore. They were used by mc-kvstore + mc-engine.

Line:205, vbucket.cc -> I still think we don't need this bool variable. We can use pendingBGFetches.empty() instead.

Line:211, vbucket.cc -> We don't need this iterator.

Line:215, vbucket.cc -> We don't need to use const_cast here.

Line:223, vbucket.cc -> We can remove the entire if clause.

Line:224, vbucket.cc -> return fetches.size() > 0;

Line:75, kvstore.hh -> Remove a white space.

Line:3386, ep_engine.cc -> We should get rid of these stats. These are only for mc-kvstore + mc-engine. Please move ep_get_multi stat to doTimingStats()

Line:237, vbucket.hh -> Please grab the lock before calling size()

Line:238, vbucket.hh -> Please grab the lock and do return !pendingBGFetches.empty();

Line:297, vbucket.hh -> We don't need to use const keyword
