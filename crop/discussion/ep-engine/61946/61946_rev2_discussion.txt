DESCRIPTION

MB-9897: Handle slow stream by dropping cursor and switching to backfill state

There can be slow DCP streams which can hold cursors on the checkpoints
causing the memory usage to shoot up. This can also result in deadlocks.

Initially cursor dropping was implemented by closing and re-opening the
slow streams. The re-opening of slow streams caused problems because
ns-server also tried to re-open the closed streams.

This approach tries to solve the problem by switching to
backfilling state from in-memory state when we see the memory usage
in checkpoints going high due to slow streams.
