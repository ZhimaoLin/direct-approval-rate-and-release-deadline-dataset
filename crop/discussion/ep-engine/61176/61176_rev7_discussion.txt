DESCRIPTION

MB-18650: Speedup test 'producer stream request (DGM)' by ~5x

test_dcp_producer_stream_req_dgm operates by storing items such that
mem_used reaches 50% of the total memory quota. However the test
currently runs with a quota of 6MB, creating Items with a null body,
resulting in ~65,000 items being created and later streamed. When
running under ThreadSantizer this test takes 25 seconds.

Given that the test doesn't actually need a particular number of items
(but just needs to ensure that it has enouch such that a desires
residency ratio can be reached), tune the max_size down to
2MB. This creates only much fewer items, and the test now completes in
under 5 seconds (under ThreadSanitizer). Note this still give at least
0.1% precision in residency ratio calculations, which should be
sufficient for this test.
