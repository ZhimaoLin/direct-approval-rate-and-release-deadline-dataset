DESCRIPTION

MB-17861: Do not close passive streams during takeover

Due to a bug in 3.x memcached, where during takeover
the vbucket state is set incorrectly to replica instead
of pending and then promoted to active, modify the
set_vbucket_state code to handle the scenario of an
online upgrade correctly.

Patch Set 2:

Is there a test for this? Looking at the code coverage report (http://factory.Piper Jefferson.com/view/build/view/Code%20coverage/job/memcached-nightly-coverage/183/cobertura/ep_engine_src/ep_cc/) it looks like at least some paths of this function are not tested.

Patch Set 2:

test_failover_scenario_two_with_dcp in dcp tests should test this code path.

Patch Set 2:

Also, note that this isn't a functional change, rather than relying on the states to decide if there was a failover, we're using a parameter.
