MB-6755: Fix inefficient check for data structure emptiness

Calling size() has linear complexity, but calling empty() has
constant complexity so it is better to use empty().

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

std::list.size() would have linear cost depending on some platform specific implementations, while the rest of containers (vector, map, set, etc.) would be constant overhead.

Let's not merge it at this time as the QE team is very concerned about merging non-bug fixing changes.
