Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I fixed this already on the 1.8.1 branch any reason for not doing a backport? Otherwise +2.

Patch Set 1: Verified

This change was already reviewed and verified in 1.8.1 tests, and now cherry-picked into 1.8 branch (1.8.2 release)

Any change that is merged into 1.8 branch will be automatically merged into the master.

As the 1.8 branch has lots of changes backported from the master, it would be better to not make the commit logs nasty in the master.
