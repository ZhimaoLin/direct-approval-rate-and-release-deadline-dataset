DESCRIPTION

Move defragmenter benchmarks to benchmarks

This moves the defragmenter benchmarks to ep_engine_benchmarks because
they can take ~18 seconds under ASAN. It also makes sense to group all
the benchmarks together.

To enable this move, this commit also puts the defragmenter test in to a
header file so that it can continued to be used by the defragmenter
tests which are not benchmarks.
