DESCRIPTION

Move defragmenter benchmarks to benchmarks

This moves the defragmenter benchmarks to ep_engine_benchmarks because
they can take ~18 seconds under ASAN. It also makes sense to group all
the benchmarks together.

To enable this move, this commit also puts the defragmenter test in to a
header file so that it can continued to be used by the defragmenter
tests which are not benchmarks.

Line:19, tests/module_tests/defragmenter_test.h -> Prefer `#pragma once`

Line:25, tests/module_tests/defragmenter_test.cc -> They should be:

 defragmenter_test.h (own header)
 other "includes"
 module <includes>
 system <includes>

clang format /should/ get this right - James merged a patch recently which fixed an issue with some.
