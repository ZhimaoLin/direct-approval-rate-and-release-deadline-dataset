DESCRIPTION

Eject/Evict hashtable items only in persistent Vbuckets

Item ejection (eviction), value only or full, is done only in
persistent vbuckets. In ephemeral vbuckets, for now there is no disk
to evict to. Hence these operations are not supported for now.

In future, we may decide to implement eviction as deletion.

By doing this, we also ensure that in Ephemeral vbuckets a non
resident item means a deleted item.
