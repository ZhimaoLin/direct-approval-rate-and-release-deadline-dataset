Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Right now the only thing left there is your getKeys command... I don't think it should be included in release versions (so only available in #ifdef DEBUG), because once it's there you can bet someone will going to start use it in production and it'll suck up stuff etc.. then people complain why it is slow etc etc..

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Ok. I expect this command to be temporary, but what do you mean by not include this in release versions? This command will need to be able to be used by ns_server in 3.0. Will that still be able to happen with this change?

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> What do you mean? do ns_server depend on the ability to get all keys? I thought it only used the "get random key" thing? (my refactor doesn't change the behavior on anything.. just the names, and that they're picked up from protocol_binary.h instead of here...)

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> ns_server uses this to implement the document viewer in the UI. The plan was to use this command until we got all of our secondary indexes finished. It is considered a private and unsupported command though. I'm fine leaving it here since it's temporary and if your code won't disable it then this patch should be okay.

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> I thought that was the entire reason why I implemented the command to get a random key?

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Not only getting a random key, but ns-server will use this command internally to support all_docs feature until the secondary index support that feature. Otherwise, the ns-server still has to access Couchstore files directly, which we really want to avoid in 3.0.

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Ah.. ok.. have we tried this on a _big_ dataset? (btw. should we merge this "as is" for now?)

Line:20, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> I think we can merge this change as it is. The ns-server team already tested this API, but I don't know if they tried it with a big dataset. I'm sure they will bring the issue if it is quite slow.
