Did you confirm that change caused the rebalance issue?

Patch Set 2:

I won't be able to confirm it 100% without a toy build since this doesn't happen with make simple-test, but this is the only change that was made to vbucket takeover recently and I'm fairly confident that the snapshot marker acking is not properly happening.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Then, can we fix the issue in the change that we merged previously? I don't think reverting this change is a good idea without 100% confidence. We need to address MB-11721 anyway.

Patch Set 2:

That's what I want to do, but I need to get more information on which value got set incorrectly in order to debug this further. The reason I pushed this revert into review was to unblock QE testing. In parallel I'm putting together a toy build for QE to test. I know the root cause of the issue, but I'm not sure exactly which value got set incorrectly to cause the issue. If you would prefer that we don't do the revert then I can abandon this and push up a fix for the problem once I find one.
