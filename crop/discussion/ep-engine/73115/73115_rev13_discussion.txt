DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Update completeDeletion to push system events

Update the completeDeletion function and the JSON generation so
that we can support the cases of completely deleting a collection
or just updating a "isDeleting" collection.

Deleting a collection creates an event in the data-stream that
will trigger the flusher to write the manifest (subsequent integration
will update the flusher).

Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Just some minor stuff - mostly suggestions to try and make it clearer for the reader.

Line:164, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> As discussed, good to expand the comments on what's going on here.

(Also, might read easier if you flip the order (so we don't have `if (NOT open)` first.)

Line:29, src/systemevent.h -> This might be a good place to document the purpose of each event (at least highlight the Hard / Soft distinction) - similar to queue_op

Line:42, src/systemevent.h -> Nit: If you remove the default case and then just make the throw be outside the switch we will get a warning if any new enum values are added.

Line:45, src/systemevent.h -> I don't /think/ we need the return here - the throw should hopefully mean the compiler knows it's never executed.
