DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Update completeDeletion to push system events

Update the completeDeletion function and the JSON generation so
that we can support the cases of completely deleting a collection
or just updating a "isDeleting" collection.

Deleting a collection creates an event in the data-stream that
will trigger the flusher to write the manifest (subsequent integration
will update the flusher).
