DESCRIPTION

MB-22123 - improve DCP rollback log message

Hoping to make the DCP rollback log message slightly more informative,
now gives a reason for the rollback.

For example,

2016-12-28T06:27:00.946484Z WARNING (default) DCP (Producer)
eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) Stream request failed because purge
seqno (20) is greater than snapshot start (0) - items may have been
deleted and purged and could be missed, rollback to 0

Other possible cases:

Stream request failed because ...
 consumer and producer have no common history, rollback to 0
 consumer and producer histories partially match, rollback to snapshot
  start (0)
 consumer and producer histories partially match, rollback to producer
  upper (15)

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

Looks good. I think it's worth adding the MB requestor (PV in this case) so they can review.
