DESCRIPTION

MB-22123 - improve DCP rollback log message

Hoping to make the DCP rollback log message slightly more informative,
now gives a reason for the rollback.

For example,

2016-12-28T06:27:00.946484Z WARNING (default) DCP (Producer)
eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) Stream request failed because purge
seqno (20) is greater than snapshot start (0) - items may have been
deleted and purged and could be missed, rollback to 0

Other possible cases:

Stream request failed because ...
 consumer and producer have no common history, rollback to 0
 consumer and producer histories partially match, rollback to snapshot
  start (0)
 consumer and producer histories partially match, rollback to producer
  upper (15)

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

This is an improvement on what we have, however no where does it explicit say "DCP client request was X and memcached has roll backed because of Z". In some cases the new log messages around imply the cause of the rolling back. Maybe it would be better to include what the DCP client request are when a roll back happens. This way we can go back to the other components/connectors and say the fault is there without having to relay on them to log the details (even though they should be).

Line:169, src/failover-table.cc -> It would be good to print the requested UUID  in this error message.

Line:183, src/failover-table.cc -> Again it would be nice to know what the client requested, so we can track down the problem on their side: i.e print snap_start_seqno

Line:191, src/failover-table.cc -> Again do we need to print here what the DCP client requested?

PV's suggestions seem reasonable. Suggest in the failing cases we also print the key values in the user's request.
