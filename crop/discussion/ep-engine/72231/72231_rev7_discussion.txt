DESCRIPTION

MB-22123 - improve DCP rollback log message

Hoping to make the DCP rollback log message slightly more informative,
now gives a reason for the rollback.

For example,

2016-12-28T06:27:00.946484Z WARNING (default) DCP (Producer)
eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) Stream request requires rollback to
seqno:0 because vBucket UUID not found in failover table, consumer and
producer have no common history. Client requested seqnos:{10,1000}
snapshot:{0,10} uuid:158138309967234

Other possible cases:

... rollback to X required because ...
 purge seqno (20) is greater than snapshot start - items may have been
deleted and purged and could be missed
 consumer ahead of producer - producer upper at 0

Line:280, src/dcp/producer.cc -> (Nitpicking): I would suggest trying to get the logging uniformed/common from left to right. This makes it easier to read the logs especially when the lines are together (think about grep'ing the log files). In this case the reason should be at the end as that is the part that could change.

Looks at my lines together compare to yours:

WARNING (default) DCP (Producer) eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) Stream request (seqnos:{10,1000} snapshot:{0,10} uuid:158138309967234) requires rollback to seqno:0 because vBucket UUID not found in failover table, consumer and producer have no common history.

It also makes it easier to write a parser.

Line:280, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I agree with the principle, but I actually disagree with the outcome - In the current implementation the lines /are/ common *up to the point where they differ*. 

For example you see the same common prefix for a rollback ("Stream request requires a rollback to seqno:") so easy to spot, but when the reason differs ("because <REASON>" that's easy to see differently.

The extra client context (start/end snap_start/end) comes later, and the reader only needs to read it if they actually care about the numbering.

To phrase in another way, with the current code the reader essentially gets the most important information first, then with more detail later on (which they scan ignore if they aren't interested:

> (vb 543) Stream request requires rollback to
seqno:0 because vBucket UUID not found in failover table, consumer and
producer have no common history.  <line noise I might not care about>

However in your example the eye explicitly /has/ to parse and skip over the extra details if you don't care about it:

> (vb 543) Stream request <line noise I might not care about> requires rollback to seqno:0 because vBucket UUID not found in failover table, consumer and
producer have no common history
