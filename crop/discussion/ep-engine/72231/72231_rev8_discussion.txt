DESCRIPTION

MB-22123 - improve DCP rollback log message

Hoping to make the DCP rollback log message slightly more informative,
now gives a reason for the rollback.

For example,

2016-12-28T06:27:00.946484Z WARNING (default) DCP (Producer)
eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) Stream request requires rollback to
seqno:0 because vBucket UUID not found in failover table, consumer and
producer have no common history. Client requested seqnos:{10,1000}
snapshot:{0,10} uuid:158138309967234

Other possible cases:

... rollback to X required because ...
 purge seqno (20) is greater than snapshot start - items may have been
deleted and purged and could be missed
 consumer ahead of producer - producer upper at 0
