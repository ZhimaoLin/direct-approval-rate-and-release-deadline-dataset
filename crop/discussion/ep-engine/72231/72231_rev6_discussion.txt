DESCRIPTION

MB-22123 - improve DCP rollback log message

Hoping to make the DCP rollback log message slightly more informative,
now gives a reason for the rollback.

For example,

2016-12-28T06:27:00.946484Z WARNING (default) DCP (Producer)
eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) client requested seqnos 10 -
4294967295, snapshot 20 - 100 with vBucket UUID 158138309967234 :
rollback to 0 required because vBucket UUID not found in failover table,
consumer and producer have no common history

Other possible cases:

... rollback to X required because ...
 purge seqno (20) is greater than snapshot start - items may have been
deleted and purged and could be missed
 consumer ahead of producer - producer upper at 0

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Minor style comment - there's a (gradual) movement to a standard format for log messages, and specifically fixed tags for certain types (vb:XXX for example).

I'd suggest tweaking this to use a similar style here as say the VBucket constructor does:

    LOG(EXTENSION_LOG_NOTICE,
        "VBucket: created vbucket:%" PRIu16 " with state:%s "
                "initialState:%s "
                "lastSeqno:%" PRIu64 " "
                "lastSnapshot:{%" PRIu64 ",%" PRIu64 "} "
                "persisted_snapshot:{%" PRIu64 ",%" PRIu64 "} "
                "max_cas:%" PRIu64,
        id, VBucket::toString(state), VBucket::toString(initialState),
        lastSeqno, lastSnapStart, lastSnapEnd,
        persisted_snapshot_start, persisted_snapshot_end,
        getMaxCas());

IMHO this is pretty clear and easy to grep for specific fields, but still pretty compact. Also it's nice to be consistent :)

I'd also make the message bit more explicit (and the failure up-front) - something like:

> WARNING ((default) DCP (Producer)
eq_dcpq:xdcr:dcp_5ce87... - (vb 543) Stream request requires rollback to seqno:XXXX because <INSERT REASON>. Client requested seqnos:{10, 1000} snapshot:{0,10} uuid:ABCDEF
