DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Refactor buffered backfill accounting.

The general aim of this commit is to be more abstract in how we
account the resources used during in backfill.

Currently the assumption is that MutationResponses will be the only
object to account for, thus on the read increment we use Item::size
and on the send decrement we access the Item::size by casting to a
MutationResponse.

With Collections, SystemEvents will be part of the backfill and should
be accounted for, but a SystemEvent in the ActiveStream's readyQueue
means we need a cleaner way of asking a DcpResponse for its size, as
opposed to more if (event == ...) {static_cast...}

1. Add a method to the abstract DcpResponse class which by default
   returns 0, so for example a SnapShotMarker can be unconditionally
   applied to the backfill accounting without changing it.

2. Implement in MutationResponse and (upstream) SystemEvent the method
   so it returns a value that better represents the resources that
   DcpResponse is holding, that is the size of the Item + any extra
   resources.

(3 comments)

Line:107, src/dcp/response.h -> If the size is semantically approximate, maybe we should encode that into the name - e.g. getEstimatedSize() ?

Line:372, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: Good candidate for an `auto` IMHO.

Line:483, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: Given the base class returns zero, you could probably just remove this from the conditional and always call getSize() to increment the stats below - maybe a little clearer?

Line:107, src/dcp/response.h -> Done

Line:483, src/dcp/stream.cc -> That would effect the backfillRemaining stat which is only subtracted for mutation/deletion/expiration, I'll try a combination.
