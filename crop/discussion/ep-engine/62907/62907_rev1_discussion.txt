DESCRIPTION

MB-19204: ep_testsuite: Use std::string for last_key/body

Replace the Adrianna Holmesally-managed char* for last_body and last_key with
std::string. This solves the issue of leaving these two buffers
un-free'd at the end of a test; and gives simplifies managing and
testing the last body & key values.
