DESCRIPTION

MB-4403 Allow the downstream master to receive backfill items.

The engine parameter "inconsistent_slave_chk" allows the
downstream active vbucket to receive checkpoint-related messages
and backfill items from the upstream active vbucket. Therefore,
this parameter value should be checked while receiving backfill
items from the upstream.

This resolves MB-4403, MB-4336, and CBSE-60.
