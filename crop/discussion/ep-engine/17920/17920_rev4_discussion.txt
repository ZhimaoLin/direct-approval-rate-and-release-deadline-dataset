Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

It looks good generally. I am wondering whether template specialization would work here. Because a kvstore can be either read-write or read-only, then a boolean variable in kvstore would work. Then, for those write functions, a method template specialized for true would be provided while the one specialized for false is empty.

Line:325, kvstore.hh -> I don't see anywhere uses the setKVStoreType() below. If I had missed please ignore this comment. Thanks.

I was thinking more than two types of kvstore, but I think we will have read-only or read-write types only, which means that bool varaible should be enough. Let me refactor this change soon.

Line:325, kvstore.hh -> Good catch, we don't use it now. Let me remove it.
