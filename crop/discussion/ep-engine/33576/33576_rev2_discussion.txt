Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:212, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Please use enum type instead of "1"

Line:96, src/upr-consumer.h -> White space

Line:102, src/upr-consumer.h -> I rather refactor this function like:

stream_status_t getStreamStatus(uint32_t opaque, uint16_t vbucket);

where stream_status_t is enum type {INVALID, BACKFILL, IN_MEMORY}
