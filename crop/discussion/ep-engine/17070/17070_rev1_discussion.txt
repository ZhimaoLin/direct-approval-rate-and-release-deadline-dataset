DESCRIPTION

MB-5514: Remove CheckpointConfig class

We should just be passing the Configuration to VBuckets since
the config is the ultimate source of knowledge. This will also
allow us to get rid of a lot of value changes listeners in
ep-engine.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please hold this change and let's discuss it more. I don't fully understand how the configuration instance updates the engine parameter at runtime.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

As mentioned earlier, I think we should keep the current implementation because the access to the configuration instance requires grabbing a lock and many different threads need to get the value of checkpoint configs. If we can use TBB for config instance, that would be great, but not available at this time.

Patch Set 1:

I agree with your comments here. It seems like my approach would be correct if the Config didn't require locking. I think this is something we should re-approach post 2.0 since I don't think it is correct to keep stats/engine-parameters in two different places.
