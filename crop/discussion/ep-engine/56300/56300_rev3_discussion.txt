(5 comments)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> As discussed I think we want an MB for this referenced in the title.

Line:473, src/dcp-producer.cc -> I think we might have a potential deadlock if we unlock lh before wlh.

Simplest solution is probably just to remove the explicit `lh.unlock()` calls (here and line 482) and let RAII do it's job.

Line:521, src/dcp-producer.cc -> So I checked  the thread safety of std::map (see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container) and things like erase() will invalidate our iteratator. Therefore we need to hold the ReaderLock while we dereference the iterator to extract the Stream* .

Line:554, src/dcp-producer.cc -> As above, we need to do the check against .end() and the dereference while holding the lock.

Line:566, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Ditto
