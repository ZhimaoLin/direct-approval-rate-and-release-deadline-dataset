Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:86, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Nit: long line.

Line:611, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Is there a data race here if we read BufferLog::Full but then before we setPaused(true) the buffer has space? i.e. we might pause and never wake up?

Line:618, src/dcp-producer.cc -> duplicate code - copy/paste error?
