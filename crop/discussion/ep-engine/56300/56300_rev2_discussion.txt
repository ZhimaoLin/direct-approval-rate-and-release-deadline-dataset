Patch Set 2:

I think this is promising - however I'd like to test the tap-style notification task first (i.e. your other patch). It might be we want the RWLock anyways to prevent stats getting blocked.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

As there's still some discussion on how to solve the itemsReady notification issue, can I suggest that we make this patch just consist of the additional of the streamsMutex RWLock - possibly merging in Jim's fix for aggregrateQueueStats from http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/56336/1 ?

I think everyone is happy about the RWLock change and hence we can get that lined up to fix that issue.

Also I think it's worth creating an MB for the contention issue given we'll probably want to back/forward port it.
