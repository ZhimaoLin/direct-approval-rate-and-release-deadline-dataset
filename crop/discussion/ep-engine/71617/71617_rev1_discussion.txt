DESCRIPTION

basic_chk_test: Speedup by yielding to set_threads

The CheckpointTest.basic_chk_test can be very slow under Valgrind
(often 250s, and sometimes times out (>1200s). This appears to be due
to a combintation of three things:

(a) Valgrind only scheduling one thread at once and
(b) Three of the "backend" threads (persistence, checkpoint remover
    and tap client) just spin in a while loop trying to do their
    respective tasks forever (greedly).
(c) All threads ultimately need to acuire the
    CheckpointManager::queueLock to make progress.

As a result, the front-end SET threads (which need to advance to
complete the workload) can become starved - they are fighting for the
queueLock.

To address this, yield in each of the background threads on each loop
iteration. This reduces the runtime of the test significantly - it now
finishes in under 1s on my local Docker container.
