Looks like a much simpler solution - thanks. 

However it's still not clear to me why we are making a number of the updates conditional on items being deleted - particulary given I couldn't see any tests checking that.

Line:496, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> This looks like a good start, but given we are manipulating deleted item counts also we should check those are correct. 

That is probably best done in a HashTable test (where you can just directly test the logic in the HashTable class to ensure the numbers are always correct).

Line:86, src/stored-value.cc -> I don't understand why updating bySeqno is conditional - deleted items can happily have a sequence number just like any other item.

Line:1507, src/vbucket.h -> Please document this. Also - I don't believe you actually need this - the Item object already has a `metadata` member, which if not specified when it was created has default values for it - see item.h:249. You should be able to use that to detect items which haven't got explicit metadata set.

Line:723, src/hash_table.cc -> I believe this is incorrect (although it's not currently well-documented) - numItems is a count of how many non-temporary items are in the hashTable - including deleted items.

As such, we should be incrementing this irrespective of if the incoming items is deleted or not, if `v` is currently a temp item.

Line:723, src/hash_table.cc -> This is confusing. I took a look at unlocked_restoreMeta and the item count is increased only if it is not deleted. Not sure which one is accurate.

Abandoned

A fix for this seems a lot more complicated given the issue isn't that severe.
