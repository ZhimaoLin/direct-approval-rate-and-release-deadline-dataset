DESCRIPTION

In Ephemeral vb, bloomfilter to always return that key does not exist

In Ephemeral buckets, there is no need of bloomfilter. Until we
remove the bloomfilter in Ephemeral buckets, we make the bloomfilter
vb function which predicts if a key exists, to return false always.

By doing this we can avoid many Ephemeral Vb code paths that result in
bgFetchs. This commit sets stage for moving bgFetch functionality from
VBucket class to EPBucket class.
