DESCRIPTION

MB-17517: Regenerate CAS for TAP/DCP mutations with invalid CAS

When receiving mutations via TAP or DCP, validate the CAS and if
invalid generate a new one.

This is instead of the simply dropping the mutation (returning an
error to the producer), as by dropping the mutation we could cause
data loss.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I see you've pushed the same change for branch-sherlock as well. If this is a change that is targeted for 4.1.1, then we should merge branches once the 4.1.1 change has been committed - meaning this change isn't necessary.

Abandoning in favour of merge of sherlock instead.
