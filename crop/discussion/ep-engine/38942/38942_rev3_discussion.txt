DESCRIPTION

MB-11488 Set the thread local to NULL before calling thread pool API

Memory allocations and de-allocations inside a global thread pool
API should not be accounted in a bucket memory quota because they
might not be executed in the same bucket context. As a todo task,
we need to keep track of the memory overhead of the global thread
pool separately.
