Line:355, checkpoint.hh -> numItems and cursor.offset are Atomic. I know calculating the difference between two atomic variables will even require the global lock to get the exact difference. But, I do want to avoid using it  as we don't need to be 100% correct in returning the number of remaining items for persistence.
