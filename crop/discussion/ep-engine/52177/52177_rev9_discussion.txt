Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:144, configuration.json -> checkpoint cursor dropping ...

Line:155, configuration.json -> 90% seems too low to execute the cursor dropping. Let's set it to 95% by default at this time.

Line:93, src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Please don't put a specific threshold number as we want to make it configurable at runtime.

Line:67, src/ep.cc -> As we want to configure them at runtime, we need to add them to setXXXParam() in ep-engine.

Line:330, src/ep.cc -> This config should be added to the change listener.
