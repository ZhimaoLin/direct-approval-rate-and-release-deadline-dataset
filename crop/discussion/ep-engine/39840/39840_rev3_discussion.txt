Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Task logs are different from task timings histograms. Task logs can give us the sequence of tasks executed. We shouldn't treat them as the same as timings histograms.

Patch Set 3:

Sure. Generally what we see is that flusher task ends up flooding the taskLog so it rolls over very quickly in most scenarios and any sequences of other tasks are lost. Hence I thought removing it is ok. please let me know if you wish to keep it and i can abandon this change.

Patch Set 3:

Then, we should come up with a better logging for this. For example, there are currently no bucket names in task logs, which makes it difficult debugging with the logs.
