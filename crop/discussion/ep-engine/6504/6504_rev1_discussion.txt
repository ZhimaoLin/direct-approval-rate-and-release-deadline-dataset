DESCRIPTION

Wait for backfill completion before replicating live mutations.

Once the backfill is kicked off, we should wait for its completion
before sending live mutations to the destination. The backfill
completion means that items from backfill are all successfully
transmitted to the destination.

This is necessary to support checkpoint consistency between the
master and slave nodes.
