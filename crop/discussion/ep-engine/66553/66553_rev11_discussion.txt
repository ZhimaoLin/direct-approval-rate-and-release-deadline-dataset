DESCRIPTION

MB-20201: Create a new handle only if needed

When we try to fetch the associated KV store handle for
a specific vbucket, we always create one if one if not
found. For some cases like delete vbucket and fetch,
we are just trying to close the existing handle and
we don't necessarily have to create a new one.

Patch Set 11:

The vbucketExists variable has been removed from this patch. The rationale being that the existence of either of the handles isn't a guarantee that the underlying forestdb kvstore exists. Technically, a delete vbucket could be issued after a warmup and the call should successfully remove the kvstore.

Line:311, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Do we need to check for null before calling this (i.e. how does fdb_kvs_close() behave if you pass it a null pointer)?

Line:311, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> It returns invalid handle. But, wouldn't be a bad idea to keep the null check.
