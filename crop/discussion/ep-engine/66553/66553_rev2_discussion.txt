DESCRIPTION

MB-20201: Create a new handle only if needed

When we try to fetch the associated KV store handle for
a specific vbucket, we always create one if one if not
found. For some cases like delete vbucket and fetch,
we are just trying to close the existing handle and
we don't necessarily have to create a new one.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:450, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Given this is only called in 6 places in total, I think having an seperate createKvsHandle function is probably better - optional bool parameters quickly get confusing.

You could then create a helper getOrCreateKvsHandle() function which calls the two individual functions for you.

Line:450, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> I am not sure as to whether I follow the comment correctly. There is a function createKvsHandle already which opens a new file handle and then a kvs handle. The create flag here will just create a new kvs handle from either the existing reader or writer handles. I understand the concern but don't fully understand the alternate proposal.
