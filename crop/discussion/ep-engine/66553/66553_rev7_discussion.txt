DESCRIPTION

MB-20201: Create a new handle only if needed

When we try to fetch the associated KV store handle for
a specific vbucket, we always create one if one if not
found. For some cases like delete vbucket and fetch,
we are just trying to close the existing handle and
we don't necessarily have to create a new one.

Line:539, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This should always be true, given that getOrCreate always creates one. Does this function want to call getKvsHandle instead?

Line:539, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Yep. I wanted to get the existing handle if it was available. That was the original intent of the fix.

Line:539, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> My point is that getOrCreateKvsHandle will *always* return a non-NULL pointer. Therefore this if will always be true and hence can be removed.
