DESCRIPTION

MB-20201: Create a new handle only if needed

When we try to fetch the associated KV store handle for
a specific vbucket, we always create one if one if not
found. For some cases like delete vbucket and fetch,
we are just trying to close the existing handle and
we don't necessarily have to create a new one.

Line:312, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same problem here - as it stands this will always be true.

Line:326, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:569, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> As written, vbucketExists can be true if only one of the kvsHandles exist - for example if the reader handle exists but not the writer.

This seems logically incorrect.

Line:1196, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:1345, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:569, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> The handles in handle maps for the reader and the writer are created on demand. So, if the flusher runs, we could have a handle for the writer but if there were no background fetches done, we need not have a handle for the reader. Hence, its not a given that both will be available at the same time.
