DESCRIPTION

MB-20201: Create a new handle only if needed

When we try to fetch the associated KV store handle for
a specific vbucket, we always create one if one if not
found. For some cases like delete vbucket and fetch,
we are just trying to close the existing handle and
we don't necessarily have to create a new one.

Line:308, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Why are you potentially creating a kvsHandle just to close it?

Line:1100, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I know this *should* be safe but we should always check the whole thing got written by using snprintf (Or just use a std::string instead..). You're also duplicating this code in a few different places (With differing implementations!) you should probably pull this into a separate function.

Please fix the creation of handles just to delete them.

Line:308, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Good spot.
