DESCRIPTION

MB-20201: Create a new handle only if needed

When we try to fetch the associated KV store handle for
a specific vbucket, we always create one if one if not
found. For some cases like delete vbucket and fetch,
we are just trying to close the existing handle and
we don't necessarily have to create a new one.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:451, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> How do these functions vary? Having different overrides which return different types I think will be confusing. Can we rename one of them?

Line:451, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> One creates a new KVStore handle by open a new file handle and then a KVStore handle. The other creates a new KVStore handle from either the reader handle or the writer handle.
