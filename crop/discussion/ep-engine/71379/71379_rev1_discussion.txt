DESCRIPTION

Convert CheckpointTest to Typed Test

To expand the Checkpoint Test so it can be run using either a
(persistent) VBucket or EphemeralVBucket object, refactor the
CheckpointTest to be parameterized by type.

Initially it is only Instantiated once with VBucket (as
previously). Once the EphemeralVBucket is introduced it can be added
to the set of instantiations.
