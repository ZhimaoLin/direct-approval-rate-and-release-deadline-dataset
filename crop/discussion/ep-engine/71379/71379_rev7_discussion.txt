DESCRIPTION

Convert CheckpointTest to Typed Test

To expand the Checkpoint Test so it can be run using either a
(persistent) VBucket or EphemeralVBucket object, refactor the
CheckpointTest to be parameterized by type.

Initially it is only Instantiated once with VBucket (as
previously). Once the EphemeralVBucket is introduced it can be added
to the set of instantiations.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

This patch is kinda difficult to review because it mixes mechanical changes (using explicit this-> + clang format) with the semantic changes (ie the stuff specifically making the tests typed).

Ideally it would be nice to split this patch in two, to move the explicit this-> stuff before all the typed test stuff.

Line:72, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> nullptr

Line:76, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> ditto

Line:233, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> nit: prefer using

Line:242, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> nullptr

Line:246, tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> nullptr

Fair point - it wasn't /too/ bad before I used clang-format on it, but looking at it again it's got pretty fat.

Let me see if it's easy to split...

I think we should just merge this as is... I'd rather have us spend time fixing stuff that's really broken...
