DESCRIPTION

clear up read-only cachedVBStates for unit tests

cachedVBStates need to be cleared up for the read-only instances
otherwise data from the previous unit test interferes with the current run

This will still not affect the read-write path where we protect
by pre-allocating the cachedVBStates

Line:564, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> It should be consistent regardless of read-only or read-write kv instance. Clearing this map is conflict with your previous change.

Line:564, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Chiyoung, this function is not called from any RW instance it is only called during warmup by an RO instance, so it does not conflict with my previous fix for MB-11794. 
I agree that it should be consistent regardless of read-only or read-write, but for that we have to modify our unit test framework a lot. Instead this fix gives us a good compromise by protecting cachedVBStates for the writers and leaving it as it is for the readers. thanks
