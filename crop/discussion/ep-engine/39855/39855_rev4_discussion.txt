DESCRIPTION

clear up read-only cachedVBStates for unit tests

cachedVBStates need to be cleared up for the read-only instances
otherwise data from the previous unit test interferes with the current run

This will still not affect the read-write path where we protect
by pre-allocating the cachedVBStates
