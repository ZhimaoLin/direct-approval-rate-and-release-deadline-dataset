DESCRIPTION

MB-7966 static allocation of multiple dispatchers per bucket

This is an alternate to the global io manager in that ep engine
statically allocate multiple dispatchers (equal to 2*numShards) and
assign them into each shard's flusher and bgfetcher. One benefit
of this implementation is that Couchbase Server would never allocate
more threads than needed for a given bucket.
