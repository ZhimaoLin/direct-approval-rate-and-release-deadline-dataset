Line:1084, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: Just inline FDB_ITR_NONE here instead of using an `options` variable - it's clearer to the reader what options are in use then.

Line:1087, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Probably worth including the actual function name calling here; or even better throw an exception so the caller has the ability to handle the failure - note that zero /could/ be a perfectly legitimate result if the store is empty.

Line:1089, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: Given totalCount is guaranteed to be zero here, just return zero - it's clearer to the reader what's being returned.

Line:230, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Is max_seq inclusive or exclusive?
