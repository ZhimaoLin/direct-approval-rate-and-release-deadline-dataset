Line:1089, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> You still have an API problem here - the caller cannot distinguish between a failure and there simply being zero items between the specified sequence numbers.

Line:1089, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> True. Since the primary usage is for stat purposes, I thought 0 would be fine in case of a failure but having said it might be more prudent to let the caller make that call as opposed to the API. I shall add a separate patch to address that.
