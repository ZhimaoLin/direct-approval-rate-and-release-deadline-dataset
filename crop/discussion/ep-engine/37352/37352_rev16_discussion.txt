DESCRIPTION

MB-11059: Support datatype during offline upgrade

- When a 3.0 server reads from a pre-3.0 couchstore
database, we need to identify the value to set the
correct datatype. Warmup will handle this.

- In the loadKVPairs and loadData phase, if the
metadata buffer's length is found to be 16B, we will
check for the JSONness of the value to set the correct
datatype for the particular item in memory.

- In a BGFetch case, if the metadata buffer length of
the item is found to be 16B, we identify the data for
key, before setting its datatype.

- Provide a second callback function to couchstore's
compaction API to edit the docinfo of the document
only if its metadata buffer is of length 16B.

Patch Set 16: Code-Review+1

It might be good to introduce file versions at some point so we can better track format changes. Right now we rely on the fact that the length of the meta field has changed. This is outside the scope of this change, but I wanted to note it incase we want to add this post-3.0.

Line:681, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> If we use calloc instead of malloc, then we don't need to call this extra memset function.

Line:1523, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please put those lines in a utility function as we do it more than one place.

Line:1525, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please do not allocate through malloc. This will cause the memory leak as we allocate the memory for ext_meta in the beginning of this function. Can we simply do "uint flex_meta[EXT_META_LEN];"?

Line:1615, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Same as above comment.

Line:656, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't we check if the body is compressed through snappy or not? There is a flag in docinfo, which indicates it.
