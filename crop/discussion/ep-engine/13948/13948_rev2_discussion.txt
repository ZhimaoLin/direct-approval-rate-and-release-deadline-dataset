Patch Set 2: Fails

(1 inline comment)

Another error :)

  tools/gencode.cc: In function ‘int main(int, char**)’:
  tools/gencode.cc:94:31: error: ‘strerror’ was not declared in this scope

Line:33, Makefile.am -> This one will be more flexible (works for /bin/sh too which is /bin/dash on Debian)

  ${TMPDIR-/tmp}
