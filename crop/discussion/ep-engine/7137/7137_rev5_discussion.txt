DESCRIPTION

Ensure client libevent is shut down when shutting down the engine.

If we teardown and deallocate a connection while the object is still
registered with libevent, an event could fire and pass our invalid
object to our method where we just kind of stomp on memory and do
really dumb stuff.

It's not *entirely* clear that this happened since I can't figure out
how to make it happen myself, but the evidence of this having occurred
is substantial and circumstantial.

Patch Set 5:

OK.  Here's a more thorough shutdown overall.  I do see what you mean about this being post-join, though.

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, approved

Yes we should get a new build with this (I just started a build on ubuntu so this will go in the next one so that I can try it).. Can you verify (that it compiles) and push it through.. (and go to bed and get some sleep and I'll continue to look into this :))

Patch Set 5: Verified

Well, probably unlike the last one, it does compile and run for me.
