DESCRIPTION

Ensure events are unregistered when shutting down the engine.

If we teardown and deallocate a connection while the object is still
registered with libevent, an event could fire and pass our invalid
object to our method where we just kind of stomp on memory and do
really dumb stuff.

It's not *entirely* clear that this happened since I can't figure out
how to make it happen myself, but the evidence of this having occurred
is substantial and circumstantial.

Line:388, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> You should only delete the event if ev_flags != 0 (that means that the event is registered)

Line:388, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> The documentation suggested it's OK to do it again, so that seemed like a good option.  I tested running it twice here and it didn't mind, so worst case is it does ~nothing when it could do less.
