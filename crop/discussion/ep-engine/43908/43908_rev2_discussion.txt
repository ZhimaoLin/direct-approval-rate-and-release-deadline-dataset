Patch Set 2: Verified-1

So this fails on GCC 4.6 due to a compiler bug (it's fixed in gcc 4.7) - even though it claims to support std::atomic.

Unfortunately gcc-4.6 is the standard compiler on Ubuntu12.04, and hence we'd have to update to a newer GCC (possible, but requires installing an updated compiler).
