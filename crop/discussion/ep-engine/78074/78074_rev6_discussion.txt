DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Make server deny creation of reserved collections

The design has always stated that _ and $ would be reserved for
system use. Make sure the server enforces this by checking the
names on incoming manifests.

1. Any _ prefixed collection will cause the Manifest construction to
 throw invalid_argument.

2. Any $ prefixed collection which is not $default will cause the
 Manifest construction to throw invalid_argument.
