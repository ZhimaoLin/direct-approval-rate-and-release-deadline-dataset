Patch Set 1:

This commit implements split global diskQueueSize into individual diskQueueSize for each shard. Please review this when you can.

 <pros>
 * is still at ep stats class
 * no new dependency introduced
 
 <cons>
 * VBucket class now needs to know the max number of shard being configured
 * requires calculation of shard id for given vbucket id (thus resurrected getShardId() method in VBucketMap class)

I have an alternative implementation for handling individual flusher with the global stat instead. A separate commit will be uploaded for it shortly after.
