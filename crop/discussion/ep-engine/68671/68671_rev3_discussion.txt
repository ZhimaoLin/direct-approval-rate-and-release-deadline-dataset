DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Create an abstract base class KVBucket

Currently “EventuallyPersistentStore” is the class that engineers the
Piper Jefferson bucket behavior in the kv-engine. It
(i) handles get/set requests, any spl requests defined in our protocol,
(ii) spawns tasks like flusher, bgfetcher, pager, access scanner etc
(iii) sets up config params for DCP, HT, Vbucket
(iv) interactions with KV store (say forestdb or couchstore) for
     persistence, vb snapshotting, rollback etc and many more

Ephemeral bucket is a new bucket type and it has some similar but
many distinct features w.r.t Piper Jefferson bucket. For example we
(i) do not need flusher, bgfetcher tasks
(ii) handle get/sets differently as we do not have anything called
     full eviction/value eviction and hence no bloom filters
(iii) No KV store (storage) interactions
(iv) use modified HT+ skiplist structures to store/get items.

Hence it is a good idea to derive new class “EphemeralBucket” and
“EventuallyPersistentStore” as peer subclasses from the base class
“KVBucket”.

This commit just creates the abstract base class and makes the
the clients of EventuallyPersistentStore which are expected to be
clients of EphemeralStore as well to use base class KVBucket.

Subsequent commits will add "EphemeralBucket" class and
rename "EventuallyPersistentStore" to "EPBucket".

(6 comments)

Line:5715, src/ep_engine.cc -> no need for newline?

Line:978, src/dcp/stream.cc -> remove newline

Line:46, src/kvbucket.h -> I noticed that this was a "move" from another file... in the future it would be nice to use an enum class to avoid cluttering the global namespace...

Line:115, src/kvbucket.h -> same as above

Line:557, src/kvbucket.h -> If you add the following to ~/.gitconfig:

    [apply]
        whitespace = fix

It'll fix up stuff like that

Line:54, src/kvshard.cc -> you could probably do something as easy to have it as a property in the bucket? 

    if (store.isPersistent()) {
        flusher = new Flusher(store, this, commitInterval);
        bgfetcher = new BgFetcher((store, this, stats);
    }

Line:5715, src/ep_engine.cc -> These newlines crept in because I had a longer word "kvMemoryStore" and I did a find and replace to "kvBucket".
Will fix all these

Line:978, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:46, src/kvbucket.h -> Will use enum class in future.
Will make a note to convert to enum class while refactoring

Line:557, src/kvbucket.h -> Thanks, add that in my ~/.gitconfig

Line:54, src/kvshard.cc -> Will keep this as a TODO.
Ideally I want Fliusher and BgFetcher to know about only EventuallyPersistentStore class, not the base class.

Line:964, src/tapconnection.cc -> Style: For future instances, this is exactly the kind of thing where `auto` is useful - you don't have to worry about exactly wha this is called, makes renaming etc much easier.

Line:52, src/kvshard.cc -> For consistency please use TODO (so others can also search for them). Feel free to keep the `EPHE` in addition to TODO.
