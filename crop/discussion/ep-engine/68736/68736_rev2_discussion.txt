DESCRIPTION

MB-21190: cbepctl support to change max_cas

The initial version of this commit blocks *all* set commands
as it required they all pass a vbucket-id even when not
required.

This update means that changing max_cas is done via

 cbepctl set_vbucket_param

That command requires the vbucket-id.

This commit changes (reverts) to not requiring the extra CLI argument.

 cbepctl set
