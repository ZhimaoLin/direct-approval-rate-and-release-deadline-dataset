DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Put soft deletes on sequential storage

Since we are append-only, distributed cache supporting incremental
replication, we need to keep deleted items for while in the
sequential storage and periodically purge them.

Further, we also allow reads/writes on metadata of deleted items
and hence it becomes necessary to keep them in the HashTable.

Therefore, we treat soft deletes as updates on StoredValues and move
them to the correct position in the sequential storage. If there is
a range read on the sequential storage, then the corresponding
StoredValue is replaced in the HashTable with its copy and marked
as stale. The copy is then logically deleted and appended to the
sequential storage.

And along with the above, this commit tweaks how mark stale is called
and also updates the unit test module of the sequential storage.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Testing needs more work.

Line:344, tests/module_tests/basic_ll_test.cc -> Be as explicit as possible here - what's the expected value of this method?

Line:356, tests/module_tests/basic_ll_test.cc -> Similar to previous comments, check everything possible about the code under test:-

* Does the item pointer to be ownedSv have all the correct properties? (is it marked as stale, have correct key, value, seqno, etc).
* Is the contents of the linked list correct (not just count of stale items, but all items)?

etc..

Basically you should be aiming to make tests as "brittle" / "sensitive" as possible  if you changed *one* character of any of the code tested in this Test, would the test fail? (ideally it should :)
