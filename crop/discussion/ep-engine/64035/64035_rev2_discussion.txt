DESCRIPTION

Speed up test_access_scanner under TSan by ~10x

test_access_scanner creates a number of items to push residency down
to under 90%. When run under ThreadSanitizer this takes a while (12s
on local server, seen 2-3x that on CV machines).

We can speed it up by creating fewer, larger items.

Before:
    real    0m12.432s

After:
    real    0m0.892s
