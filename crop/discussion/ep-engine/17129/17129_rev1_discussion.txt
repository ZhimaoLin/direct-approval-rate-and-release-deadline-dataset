DESCRIPTION

MB-5457 Set backfill memory threshold to 95% of bucket quota

More accurate memory accounting allows us to set the backfill
memory threshold to a higher value. In addition, having a
different memory threshold compared with the TAP throttle
memory threshold would help us avoid the operational deadlock.
