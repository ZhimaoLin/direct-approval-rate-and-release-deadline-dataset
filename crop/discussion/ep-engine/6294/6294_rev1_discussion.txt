Patch Set 1:

tests fail before and after change (same tests).

There's some another issue that valgrind reports, but that another issue is much harder to debug. I need to get back to ns_server :)

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I like what I see but I'd like the function to be "generic" and not tied to checkpoints only (we're already using a similar one in ep_extension.cc), and it would be nice to have only one version of such functions.. I'll change my -1 to +2 if people disagrees with me :-)

Line:499, checkpoint.hh -> I'd rather make this a generic "safe string to uid64" method... It's not tied to checkpoint id's at all..

Line:501, checkpoint.hh -> why not check if data[ndata - 1] == '\0' first to see if we need the extra allocation / memcpy? (if we're moving it to a generic function)

Thanks Alk for doing this. If you don't mind, I will take care of this commit and other valgrind issues if they are not false alarms.

Abby Duran, Asher Vang: feel free to take over this patch. I couldn't resist fixing this simpler issue, but I need to work on ns_server things. I believe this valgrind issue and another one are not false positives.
