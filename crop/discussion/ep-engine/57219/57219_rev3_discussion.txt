DESCRIPTION

Check for droppage in mapped memory conditionally

Context: test_defragmenter
- Expected mapped memory to have dropped only if the
defragmenter actually moved items.
- Also improve the logging to give more details upon
failure observed when run against valgrind.

Line:14699, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Strictly speaking this probably isn't sufficient, as the defragmenter could still be running. I think you should wait until all items have been visited (i.e. num_remaining).

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This needs updating given we now wait for the defragmenter to run.
