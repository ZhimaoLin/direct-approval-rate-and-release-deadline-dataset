DESCRIPTION

Check for droppage in mapped memory conditionally

Context: test_defragmenter
- Expected mapped memory to have dropped only if the
defragmenter actually moved items.
- Also improve the logging to give more details upon
failure observed when run against valgrind.

Line:14700, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> The defragmenter should be setup in this test to always move stuff. If it's not moving things then that's the actual issue here.

Line:14700, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think the problem here could do with slowness in execution (task doesn't complete in 10 seconds). Seems to happen on the VMs that run the nightly valgrind job. I added this to check if the defragmenter not moving stuff within that time - is indeed the reason.
