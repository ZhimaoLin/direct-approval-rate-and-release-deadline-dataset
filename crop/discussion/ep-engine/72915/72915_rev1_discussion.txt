Line:65, src/ep_types.h -> Just moving enum get_options_t from kv_bucket_iface.h to here.
Cleaning up enum get_options_t to "enum class get_options_t" will be in a future commit

Line:846, src/vbucket.h -> Maybe in a future patch, but it feels like this should probably be a member of the VBucket class given it keeps getting passed in for anything which may perform a bgfetch.

Line:1848, src/vbucket.cc -> Style: You can just do:

 return GetValue();

Line:1871, src/vbucket.cc -> Similar, can just return directly without the temporary.

Line:1875, src/vbucket.cc -> Ditto

Line:1895, src/vbucket.cc -> Ditto
