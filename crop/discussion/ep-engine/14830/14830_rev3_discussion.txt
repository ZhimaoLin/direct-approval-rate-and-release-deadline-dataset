DESCRIPTION

[MB-5073] Use CAS to avoid races during bgfetch of metadata

While the bgfetch of a non-resident/non-existent key is underway,
there might be intervening mutations to the key in memory. In such a
case we must not restore the metadata of the key. Using a CAS value
from the time when the temporary item is first created and checking
against it before restoring the metadata prevents such races.

Line:1254, ep.cc -> We shouldn't use rowid as cas here. It causes some confusions. Item instance returned from gcb.val.getValue() can contain a cas. We should store a cas in Item instance and retrieve it from there.
