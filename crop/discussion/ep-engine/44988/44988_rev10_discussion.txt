Line:1880, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> You need to read these values from the vbucket file.

Line:1965, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> You need to actually save the max cas and drift time to the vbucket file.

Line:178, configuration.json -> I don't think you need this parameter for this change. We already have a conflict_resolution_type parameter and that's the one that you should use for this change. If conflict resolution is set to llw then you should enable the hlc based cas assignment.

Line:733, src/ep.cc -> v cannot be NULL here.

Line:818, src/ep.cc -> v cannot be NULL here.

Line:885, src/ep.cc -> v cannot be NULL here.

Line:1965, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Those lines should be added here. Also, they will still introduce a race condition as you added them in your commit. This value must be updated in the flushVBucket function and not in the setVBucketState function.

Line:178, configuration.json -> I believe the conflict_resolution_type is primarily used during conflict resolution time. So, even if the mutations are lww_eligible (as in generated when time_synchronization is true), this parameter would decide whether this whether conflict is resolved using lww.
