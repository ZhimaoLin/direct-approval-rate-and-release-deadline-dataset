Line:404, mutation_log.cc -> Shouldn't this be "log->isEnabled() && log->isOpen()"?

Line:404, mutation_log.cc -> No, it's mildly confusing.  It's OK to run this if the log is open or the log is *not* enabled (in which case, it's not open and won't be).

It's not OK to run this when the log is enabled, but not open.  I could also say

    assert(!(log->isEnabled() && !log->isOpen());

I'm not sure that's significantly clearer, though.

Does it need a comment?

Patch Set 1: Verified

Cool.  I updated the unit tests to require it since they all broke when I didn't.
