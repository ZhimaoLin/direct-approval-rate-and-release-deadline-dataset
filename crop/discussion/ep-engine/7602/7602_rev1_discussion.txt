DESCRIPTION

Clear engine specific data before dispatching SyncListener object destruction

Currently, we attempt to clear engine specific data within the SyncDestruction
callback method. This, however, may introduce a race condition as a result of
which the cookie whose engine specific data is being cleared may get deleted
in a separate thread before it is accessed in the callback method. The race
condition was exposed by a few failing ep-engine unit tests.

This change set avoids the race condition by clearing the engine specific data
before destruction of the SyncListener object is dispatched.
