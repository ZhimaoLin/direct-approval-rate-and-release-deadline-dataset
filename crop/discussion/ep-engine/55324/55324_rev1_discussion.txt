DESCRIPTION

MB-16310: Use separate key index for chk_pt meta keys and application keys

Checkpoint uses meta items "dummy_key", "checkpoint_start", "checkpoint_end".
If application tries to store keys with the same names, then we get runtime
errors. This solution addresses the problem by maintaining separate
key indices for the checkpoint meta keys and application keys.

(6 comments)

Line:467, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please log the actual key.

Line:303, src/checkpoint.h -> Please add the comment for a new parameter.

Line:113, src/checkpoint.cc -> I don't think we need to check if the item pointed by the persistence cursor is meta item or not because keyIndex only manages non-meta items.

Line:173, src/checkpoint.cc -> Please avoid using assertion, but instead put some warning log (or as a separate patch, we can define and throw an exception)

Line:180, src/checkpoint.cc -> please wrap it properly.

Line:1332, src/checkpoint.cc -> Please remove the debug print.

Line:467, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Done

Line:303, src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:113, src/checkpoint.cc -> We need this to handle the below case:
pqi is a cursor and it could be point to a meta key say "checkpoint_end".
Also, "checkpoint_end" could be application key and hence already present in keyIndex. 
Now if we try to set "checkpoint_end" again, we need this check to decide if we have to PERSIST_AGAIN
