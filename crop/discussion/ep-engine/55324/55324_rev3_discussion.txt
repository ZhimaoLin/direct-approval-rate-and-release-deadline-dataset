DESCRIPTION

MB-16310: Use separate key index for chk_pt meta keys and application keys

Checkpoint uses meta items "dummy_key", "checkpoint_start", "checkpoint_end".
If application tries to store keys with the same names, then we get runtime
errors. This solution addresses the problem by maintaining separate
key indices for the checkpoint meta keys and application keys.
