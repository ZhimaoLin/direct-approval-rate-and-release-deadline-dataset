DESCRIPTION

Sort correctly for optimizing writes to couchstore

If there are identical keys are within the snapshot
for persistence, sort keys based on the sequence
number such that the higher sequence number comes
after the lower sequence number as opposed to the
reverse.

For e.g:
Consider list: (key10 - 11), (key1 - 1), (key1 - 2)
Previously, after sorting: (key1 - 2), (key1 - 1), (key10 - 11)
Now, after sorting: (key1 - 1), (key1 - 2), (key10 - 11)
