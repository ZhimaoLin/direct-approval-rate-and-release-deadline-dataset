DESCRIPTION

Multi-bucket test cases.

Utilising new changes in engine_testapp we can now write
multi-bucket test cases with ease. Allowing arbitary interleaving
of creation/destruction and any bucket operations.

This patch adds 1 basic example test demonstrating get/set against
many buckets, including how to Adrianna Holmesally setup and delete the buckets.

Additionally a useful multi-bucket performance test has been added so
that we can monitor performance of the system in n-bucket configurations.

Minor comments only.

Line:326, tests/ep_testsuite_common.cc -> Minor one:

If 'buckets' is not destroyed in a caller side upon failure, then we need to clean it up here before returning NULL.

Line:282, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Minor one. The line is too long. Please wrap it.

Line:335, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> These lines are too long. Please wrap them.
