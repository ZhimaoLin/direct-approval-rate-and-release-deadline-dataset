DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [18/N]: Remove now dead VBucket persist Tasks

Delete all tasks (apart from Flusher) which used to persist VBucket
state to disk - the Flusher Task now handles all VBucket state
persistence.

Also remove statistics which are no longer valid / relevent -
snapshotVbucketHisto / persistVBStateHisto - we no longer snapshot
separately from flushing.
