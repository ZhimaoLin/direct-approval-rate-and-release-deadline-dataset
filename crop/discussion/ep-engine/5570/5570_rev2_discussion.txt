DESCRIPTION

MB-3665 Fix to the race condition between TAP worker and IO notifier

When the named TAP connection is instantiated with the same name, there
is a race condition on the TapCheckpointState list object between the
TAP worker thread and the TAP IO notification thread. This caused the
TAP IO notification thread to consume 100% CPU by looping within the
TapCheckpointState list.
