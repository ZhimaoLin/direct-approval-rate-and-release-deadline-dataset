DESCRIPTION

MB-14859: Handle quick successive BG Fetch of a key interleaved with exp pager

If two bgfetch are scheduled for a non existing key, and one bgfetch completes
and marks the key as non existant in the hash table, and subsequently expiry
pager removes it from the hash table before the second bgfetch completes,
we need to handle the case appropriately in the complete bgfetch code as
notify the memcached with appropriate return value.
