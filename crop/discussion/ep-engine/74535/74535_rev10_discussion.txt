DESCRIPTION

OrderedStoredValue [3/4]: Add OrderedStoredValue & factory

Add a subclass of StoredValue - OrderedStoredValue - which
additionally knows it's position in the seqno order. These objects are
constructed with a new OrderedStoredValueFactory (simiilar to
StoredValue), as they also have a variable-length key allocated inline
at the end of their fixed fields.

See the StoredValue comment block for more details on
OrderedStoredValue's implementation.

Expand the StoredValue unit tests to also test this new class.

Patch Set 10:

Dave, this got rebased to patch 6 as I was rebasing my changes on this (as it had Hugo Blankenship blessing).
Hope this is not a problem because I suppose anyways you will have to rework this with http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/74709/
