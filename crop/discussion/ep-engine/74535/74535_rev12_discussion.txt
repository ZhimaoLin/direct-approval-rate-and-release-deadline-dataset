DESCRIPTION

OrderedStoredValue [3/4]: Add OrderedStoredValue & factory

Add a subclass of StoredValue - OrderedStoredValue - which
additionally knows it's position in the seqno order. These objects are
constructed with a new OrderedStoredValueFactory (simiilar to
StoredValue), as they also have a variable-length key allocated inline
at the end of their fixed fields. Note that due to *not* having a
virtual destructor (instead we use flag dispatching), we need a custom
deleter for StoredValue::UniquePtr now.

See the StoredValue comment block for more details on
OrderedStoredValue's implementation.

Expand the StoredValue unit tests to also test this new class.

Line:35, tests/module_tests/stored_value_test.cc -> There's currently no rule in our Coding Standards (one way or another) for template parameter names, and I've certainly seen (and used) uppercase for template parameters for a while now.

Having said that, a survey of contemporary codebases for multi-char template names does suggest a consensus matching CppCore (i.e. InitialUppercase).

I'll update the Coding Conventions and if that's agreed update here.

Line:237, src/storeddockey.h -> Done
