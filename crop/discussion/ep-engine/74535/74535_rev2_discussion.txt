Sure, I'll take a look today.

Same.

Not really :( The downside to not using C++'s built-in virtual dispatch and using tag-dispatch means we need to manage these kinds of things Adrianna Holmesally.

Having said all that, it's not so different from virtual dispatch - if you have a Base and Derived classes, and you have a Base ptr to a Derived object, and try to do sizeof(*base) you'll get the base class size.

Line:656, src/stored-value.h -> I'm not sure we should be returning the concrete types' pointer - idea is that factories should all produce compatible elements - see  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern
