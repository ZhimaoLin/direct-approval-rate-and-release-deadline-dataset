Patch Set 1:

Dave made some changes and added OrderedStoredValueTest.
But it maybe good to move around some code to minimize use of friend.
Also maybe run the module tests as templates for types OrderedStoredValue; StoredValue.

Also since, OrderedStoredValue and StoredValue are no longer dynamic types, iks there is way to prevent/monitor the wrong usage of sizeof() in the base class StoredValue
