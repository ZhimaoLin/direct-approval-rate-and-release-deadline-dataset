DESCRIPTION

OrderedStoredValue [3/4]: Add OrderedStoredValue & factory

Add a subclass of StoredValue - OrderedStoredValue - which
additionally knows it's position in the seqno order. These objects are
constructed with a new OrderedStoredValueFactory (simiilar to
StoredValue), as they also have a variable-length key allocated inline
at the end of their fixed fields.

See the StoredValue comment block for more details on
OrderedStoredValue's implementation.

Expand the StoredValue unit tests to also test this new class.
