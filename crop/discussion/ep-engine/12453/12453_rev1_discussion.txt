Line:1385, stored-value.hh -> I don't think we need this function separately. We can simply create a dummy item outside and pass it to unlocked_add function directly.

Line:1385, stored-value.hh -> It's unlikely in the short term but we may end up reusing this code for other things in the future. That's why I made it into a separate function and made sure there's no duplication of code.

However, let me know if you still feel strongly about not having this at all and I'll fix it.

Line:1385, stored-value.hh -> Then, change the function name to the more descriptive one like "addTempDeletedItem(...)".
