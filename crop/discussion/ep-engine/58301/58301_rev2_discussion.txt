DESCRIPTION

MB-17133: Handle race between vb state change and dcp stream operation.

When EventuallyPersistentStore::setVBucketState() is called to change a vbucket
state we go to connection map and set the streams (across all DCP producer
connections) for that vbucket to DEAD state. And then we change the vbucket
state. However these 2 operations are not atomic. A stream may be created and
set to active in between these 2 statements and hence cause undesired behavior.
