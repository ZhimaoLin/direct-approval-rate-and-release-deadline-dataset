DESCRIPTION

MB-17133: Handle race between vb state change and dcp stream request operation.

When EventuallyPersistentStore::setVBucketState() is called to change a vbucket
state we go to connection map and set the streams (across all DCP producer
connections) for that vbucket to DEAD state. And then we change the vbucket
state. Further, we night also add a new entry in failover table. However these
operations are not atomic. A stream may be created and set to active in between
the above operations and hence cause undesired behavior.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

This potentially can cause deadlock. Please don't bother reveiwing this unless thread sanitizer gives a nod.

Cyclic deadlock detected between vbstateLock, connsLock and bufMutex lock. Trying to get around this one

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I think we should revisit this once the proposed setVBState serialisation (MB-20852) has gone in, as I suspect the solution may be different / simpler.
