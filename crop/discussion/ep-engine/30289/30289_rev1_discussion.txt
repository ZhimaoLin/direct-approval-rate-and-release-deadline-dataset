Line:1399, src/ep.cc -> Seems like we don't need "cookie" parameter in this function.

Line:625, src/stored-value.cc -> The hash table depth is usually small because of resizing. It seems to me that this will mostly return the last resident item in a hash bucket. Can we simply return the first resident item in a hash bucket that is randomly selected?
