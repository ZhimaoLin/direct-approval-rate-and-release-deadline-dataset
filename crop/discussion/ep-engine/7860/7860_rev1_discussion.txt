DESCRIPTION

Set the vbucket states on the backend before setting data

Commit 4082a7bd47bc4692a2fc3707e9210f11e99bd76c added a queued item
to the write queue with the state change of a vbucket, but the write
queue is only to be used by the flusher thread (it is used without
locking). To avoid adding more locks, this patch will "cache" the
state of the vbuckets and update the state of the vbuckets if it
detects a change.

Patch Set 1: Verified

I started a cluster and rebalanced in a node on my Solaris box, and make tests work on macos x (after rebasing on top of the change that adds gethrtime to the build sources ;))
