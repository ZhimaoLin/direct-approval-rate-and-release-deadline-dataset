DESCRIPTION

MB-16875: Save only necessary info while commiting changes

While committing a batch of items for a vbucket, fall back
to the old way of doing things where only the necessary
information is persisted - rather than snapshotting the
entire vbucket state.

However the tracking of this information during the commit
operation will be slightly different to accomodate for
forestkvstore.
