DESCRIPTION

MB-5274 Need to keep original ETIMEDOUT value

On Cygwin/mingw, it is redefinied ETIMEDOUT to WSATIMEDOUT, which
is 10060. However, we still need to keep the original ETIMEDOUT
value for return vale of functions such as pthread_cond_timedwait.

Patch Set 1:

i think for history sake this should mention that it's backport.

Cannot give +2 because I disagree in minor way how exactly original commit was made. I.e. I believe win-only code needs to be minimized so that heavier unix-only testing covers more code
