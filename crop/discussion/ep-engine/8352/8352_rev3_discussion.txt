DESCRIPTION

Fix build errors with gcc 4.6.

With gcc 4.6 there were plenty of warnings (treated as errors) related to name
shadowing (mostly variables named 'item' shadowing memcached's type
'item'). Renamed those conflicting definitions trying to use the names
already present in the project.

Conflicts:
	ep_engine.cc
	ep_engine.h
