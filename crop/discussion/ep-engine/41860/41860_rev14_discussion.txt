Line:101, src/kvstore.cc -> This will need to grab a lock inside Configuration. We can avoid it easily by maintaining a separate variable in EPStore.

Line:131, src/kvstore.cc -> This will cause a memory leak with an existent item because Item instance inside GetValue is not freed.

Can we simply add a new function to EPStore to check if a given key is non-resident or not? Please also make sure that this lookup should not decrement the NRU bit value.
