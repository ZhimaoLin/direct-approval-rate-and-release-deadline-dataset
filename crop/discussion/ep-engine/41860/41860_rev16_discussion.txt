Line:561, src/ep.cc -> Please rename this to "isMetaDataResident(...)"

Line:576, src/ep.cc -> We should not separate the cases for value-only and full ejection mode. I think we can simply use the following if clause regardless the ejection mode:

if (v && !v->isTempItem()) {
    return true;
}

Line:123, src/kvstore.cc -> if (isDeleted || !store->isItemResident(...)) {
    vb->addToTempFilter(theKey);
};

Line:125, src/kvstore.cc -> As mentioned above, please consolidate this into the above if clause.
