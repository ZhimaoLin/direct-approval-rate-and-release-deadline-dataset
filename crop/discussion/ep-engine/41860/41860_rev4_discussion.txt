Patch Set 4:

(4 comments)

Line:993, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: I wouldn't bother changing these to line up, as

1) This makes a "whitespace-only" change in git which makes it slightly harder to track back when the line was *functionally* changed.

2) You'll probably end up having to re-indent this sometime in the future if any code is added there, again adding extra maintenance overhead.

Line:489, src/vbucket.cc -> Similar to a previous commit - just make this change in the original patch which added this code.

Line:3126, src/ep.cc -> Any reason to not include  this change in the previous commit which initially added this change?

Line:61, src/tasks.h -> Does this have to be a void* pointer? We're kinda defeating the point of type-safety...
