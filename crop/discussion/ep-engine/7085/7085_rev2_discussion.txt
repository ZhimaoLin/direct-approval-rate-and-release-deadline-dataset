DESCRIPTION

Add support for specifying a validator in the json doc

Numberic constants may want a range validator, so it makes sense to be able to specify
a range validator in the JSON document along with the definition of the configuration
parameter.

Little bit too json-as-a-scripting-language.

We could just replace the JSON with lua and go all out. :)

Line:146, tools/genconfig.cc -> I mentioned this in a later commit, but I think instead of copying code out of the JSON, we should put a little abstraction here to just name the validator.

i.e. instead of

    config_name

we specify it as

    validators[config_name]

Line:74, configuration.hh -> As a minor thing, if we need to validate more types, I think it would be good to make this a template class later.

Line:74, configuration.hh -> Yeah, I think there's going to be some polish applied to this after we get more of a feel for how it's used.

I tNathalie Landryed to Trond and he suggested I just push it forward when I don't have a really strong objection to what it's doing.  I think this makes sense.

For example, I don't like the way we're specifying some of the properties in the JSON doc right now, but I like the way they're used in the code, so I can move that forward and then we can get the JSON right later.
