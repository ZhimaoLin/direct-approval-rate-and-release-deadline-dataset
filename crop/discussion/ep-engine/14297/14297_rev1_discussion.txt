DESCRIPTION

[Backport] MB-4595 Schedule backfill for a fresh empty client.

There is a case that causes data loss after rebalance in
the cluster running for a very short period:

1) Start the one node cluster and load a small number of items
into the node. The node will still have the open checkpoint with
id 1 for each vbucket.
2) Shutdown the node and start it again. After warmup, the node
still has the open checkpoint 1 for each vbucket, but each
checkpoint doesn't have any items in its datastructure.
3) Add another fresh node to the cluster and rebalane in. In this
case, no backfill tasks are scheduled for vbucket takeovers
because the fresh node starts with the open checkpoint id 1 and
the original node still has the open checkpoint id 1.

Consequently, each vbucket takeover is completed without backfill
but does not send any items from the open checkpoint 1 because
it doesn't have any items. This causes data loss after rebalance.

To resolve the above issue, we always schedule the backfill for
the fresh client with empty data (i.e., checkpoint id 1).
The better and more comprehensive solution would be to restore the
open checkpoint as part of warmup, which we will provide soon.
