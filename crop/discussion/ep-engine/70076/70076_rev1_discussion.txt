Line:210, src/taskqueue.cc -> const auto?

Line:154, src/globaltask.h -> are you going to apply the bug fix patch separately?

Line:210, src/taskqueue.cc -> Could be, but given the scope of this function (4 lines), and that we never use `rv` again before returning, it's probably of negligible benefit, and I'd to rebase all the merges I have on top of this one (which doesn't seen a decent cost/benefit tradeoff).

Line:154, src/globaltask.h -> Yeah, it's a few patches down into watson, I think it'll be easier to keep merges consistent there.
