DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Use cb::const_char_buffer over const std::string ref

It will be easier/cheaper to integrate the DCP side of the collections
work if we can update a collection from a DCP message. The "easy/cheaper"
benefit being that we can just use a cb::const_char_buffer initialised to
the packet's collection name and length data, rather than being forced to
create and copy into a std::string.
