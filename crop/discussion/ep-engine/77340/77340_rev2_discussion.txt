DESCRIPTION

[Test Code]: Run basic backfill unit test for persistent bucket as well

The test code was trying to run flush vbucket for persistent buckets
while a flusher task was already running and hence resulting in a
temp fail of flusher.

This has been fixed by not running the flusher by explicit call.
Rather the test waits for the flusher to complete.
