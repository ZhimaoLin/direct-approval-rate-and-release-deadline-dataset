DESCRIPTION

Simplify common.h: add utility.h [2/3]

Create a new utility.h header file and move some of the functions /
macros which virtually everyone uses to there. utility.h has
significantly fewer dependancies, and such is much cheaper to include
than common.h

Update users of these functions / macros (DISALLOW_COPY_ON_ASSIGN, LOG
etc) to use utility.h instead of common.h

Line:63, src/atomicqueue.h -> since this file already includes atomic.h and atomic.h includes utility.h, do we still need to include utility.h here?

Line:63, src/atomicqueue.h -> There's a principle called "include what you use" - i.e. a file should include all headers it requires, assuming that no-one else will include them for you[1]

This minimises inter-dependancies and promotes the principle of least surprise - i.e. "why should my atomicqueue.h get compile errors if atomic.h changes it's headers?"

Note with include guards / #pragma once there isn't any noticeable cost in including a header twice (as we ultimately are here), the issue is more including this unnecessarily.

[1]: In C++ this should probably be refined to "include what you use, unless you can get away with forward-declaring" ;)
