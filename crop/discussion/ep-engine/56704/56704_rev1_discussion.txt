DESCRIPTION

Simplify common.h: add utility.h [2/3]

Create a new utility.h header file and move some of the functions /
macros which virtually everyone uses to there. utility.h has
significantly fewer dependancies, and such is much cheaper to include
than common.h

Update users of these functions / macros (DISALLOW_COPY_ON_ASSIGN, LOG
etc) to use utility.h instead of common.h
