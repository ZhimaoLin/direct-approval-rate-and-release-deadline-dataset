DESCRIPTION

[IK] Create strategy classes for item eviction policies

In preparation for allowing more flexibility in item eviction, create
a set of classes to encapsulate the strategy (aka policy) used for
item eviction. Note this patch only lays the groundwork for
encapsulating behaviour in the classes, initially the behaviour is
still all managed by the given consumer themselves.
