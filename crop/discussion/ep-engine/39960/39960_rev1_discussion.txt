DESCRIPTION

MB-11827: Check the checkpoint id instead of backfill state

I've noticed that in the past these values haven't always been
kept in sync and that it is much safer to just check the checkpoint
id.

I'm okay with this change, but not sure if it actually resolves the issue MB-11827

Line:1104, src/upr-stream.cc -> I'm not sure if this change fixes the issue or not. I know that having zero as a checkpoint id means that it receives a backfill stream from the upstream master. They should be synchronized together. Otherwise, there is still a place where we set the checkpoint id to zero without setting backfill_phase to true.
