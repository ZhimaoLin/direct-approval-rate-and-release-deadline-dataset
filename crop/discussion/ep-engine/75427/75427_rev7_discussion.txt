DESCRIPTION

MB-22018: Allowing varargs in cbstats commands

We used func.func_code.co_argcount (which may be considered peeking at
"internals") to check the number of arguments a function takes, to allow
us to print a nice exception rather than simply attempting to call it
with incorrect arguments and exiting from a TypeError.

Moving to using the `inspect` module, and checking if varargs are
accepted - allowing any number of arguments if so.

This may be used going forwards to delegate parsing of additional
options to a given command. This could be done currently but wouldn't be
very clean.
