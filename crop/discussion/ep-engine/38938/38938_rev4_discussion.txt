Patch Set 4:

I don't think this will fix the issue. When I looked at the core dump earlier it looked like the reason for the assertions was memory corruption. In this case I saw that the UprConsumer appeared to be an invalid pointerI'll post my findings on the bug a little bit later since in at the airport right now.

Patch Set 4:

Sure, let me know. I tested this with a toy build on the vms (that caught the issue) a few times, and issue seemed to have gone.
