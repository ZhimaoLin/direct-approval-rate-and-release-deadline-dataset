Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This isn't actually a fix, but disabling the unit test temporarily until we fix the issue (Let's figure out the root cause of this failure and make a fix). Please adapt the commit title like "Disable test_acccess_scanner unit test temporarily", and push this change to the watson branch first as we still need to run the whole unit test framework frequently in the watson branch until we release it.
