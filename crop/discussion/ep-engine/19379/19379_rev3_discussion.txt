Line:104, common.hh -> Do you need a inclusion guard for statvfs.h here? Since it is not standard lib, I am not sure whether statvfs.h is available on all platforms other than linux/unix/mac osx.

Line:104, common.hh -> I guess it is OK for now. We would have compilation error if statvfs.h was unavailable on new product platform.

Line:104, common.hh -> We have the above separate implementation for windows. But, we would have compilation errors on MacOS X 10.3 and OpenBSD 3.8 only at this time, which are the old versions of OS. We can address the compilation issue later if it becomes an issue.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:104, common.hh -> That's a good point. This header file is missing on MacOS X 10.3, OpenBSD 3.8, mingw, and MSVC 9 (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/Adrianna Holmesal/html_node/sys_002fstatvfs_002eh.html)

I think it should be okay at this time as we don't have any issues on all the platforms that we supported for product.
