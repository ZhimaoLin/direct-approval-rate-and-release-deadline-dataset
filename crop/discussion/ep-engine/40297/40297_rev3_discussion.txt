DESCRIPTION

MB-11872: Compile failure on (some?) Debian 7 systems

Building from a Debian 7 setup under SmartOS works out of the box,
but one of our builders does not work for some reason. From looking
at the preprocessed file it doesn't define linux like our other
systems do. Extend the test to work for __linux__ and __linux as
well.
