Patch Set 4:

(4 comments)

Line:475, src/ep_engine.cc -> Valid change, but I would split it into a separate patch as it's unrelated to the rest of this patch.

Line:526, src/ep_engine.cc -> I might be tempted to expand the string to print the actual valid range (assuming we aren't explicitly checking for this string elsewhere).

Line:78, configuration.json -> For consistancy I'd either prefix all these parameters with "bloomfilter_" or "bfilter_", but don't mix them.

Line:211, docs/stats.org -> This is inconsistent with the code, which calls this residency_threshold.
