DESCRIPTION

Enable backfill for registered TAP client.

The registered TAP client should be able to require backfill
if its next checkpoint is already purged from memory on the
server.

% mbadm-tap-registration -h 127.0.0.1:11210 -r slave1
  -l last_closed_checkpoint_id -b

'-b' means that the client needs to receive backfill if its
next checkpoint (last_closed_checkpoint_id + 1) does not exist
in memory on the server.
