DESCRIPTION

MB-3678 Return the last closed checkpoint Id to the flusher correctly

There was a bug in returning the last closed checkpoint Id when
the flusher gets all the items for persistence from the checkpoint.
For example, if the checkpoint manager currently has only one
checkpoint with the Id 5, the last closed checkpoint Id to be returned
to the flusher should be 4 instead 0.
