DESCRIPTION

Remember the open checkpoint id upon registering the TAP cursor.

If a given TAP client is only interested in receving items from
the closed checkpoints only, we then need to record the current
open checkpoint id when the cursor is registered, and have that
cursor wNathalie Landry down until it reaches to the beginning of that open
checkpoint.
