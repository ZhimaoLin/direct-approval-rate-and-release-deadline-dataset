Line:109, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> Under which conditions the backfill manager task is in a dead state? I'm not sure why a backfill task is scheduled when the manager is in a dead state.

Line:109, src/dcp-backfill-manager.cc -> The idea is that backfill manager is always there, but we only have a task scheduled when there are backfills that need to be run. In the code when the backfill manager detects that there are no more backfills we set the task to NULL so that we know we need to reschedule it if another backfill request comes in. I'm not exactly sure where we are not detecting the task finishing and the backfill manager not switching the task to NULL though. On the other hand we do want to reschedule this if the task is no longer active.
