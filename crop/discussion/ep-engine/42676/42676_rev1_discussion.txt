DESCRIPTION

Account for a deleted item in unlocked_restoreValue

When we do a background fetch to read an item from
disk, if the item were deleted from a front end
operation and it wasn't persisted yet, we shouldn't
decrement nonResidentItemCount as it is already done
as part of unlocked_softDelete, and this could cause
an underflow of the stat.
