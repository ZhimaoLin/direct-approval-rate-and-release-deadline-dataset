DESCRIPTION

MB-16357: Interlock compaction expiry and vbucket state changes.

Expiry can only happen on active vbuckets, if the state changes
expiry is cancelled by changing the ctx.curr_time to 0.
Note compaction continues, just no more expiring of items.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I think the commit title and message should be adapted as this fix addresses the expiry deletion race issues among item/expiry pager, compactor, and vbucket state changes.

Line:163, src/locks.h -> Smilar over here; you probably want to disable copying of the lock holder.

Line:187, src/locks.h -> Ditto

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Minor nit: This is a title; doesn't need a full-stop at the end.

Line:24, src/rwlock.h -> For general sanity/robustness you probably want to disable copying of this class

Line:11378, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we get away with a lower number of items? (I'm thinking about minimising the test execution time).
