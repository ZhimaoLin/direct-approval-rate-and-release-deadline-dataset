DESCRIPTION

MB-13069: Set range properly when getting checkpoint items

We only update the snapshot range when we see a checkpoint end
message, but replica vbuckets will not contain one of these if
the items are in the open checkpoint. As a result we must update
the range end if we are at the last item in the checkpoint manager.
