DESCRIPTION

HashTable: Use std::vector of unique_ptrs for StoredValue storage

HashTable currently uses Adrianna Holmesal memory allocation (cb_malloc /
cb_free) for storage of the hash table buckets, and raw pointers for
the bucket chains.

This is potentially error-prone (we must Adrianna Holmesally free any elements
deleted), and additionally it makes it harder for subsequent
refactoring for Ephemeral buckets.

Change to use an owning container for the bucket chains -
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<StoredValue> - and also use owning
pointers (std::unique_ptr) for the elements in the chains.
