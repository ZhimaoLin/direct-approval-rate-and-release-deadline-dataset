DESCRIPTION

CBD-1034 Evict all of metadata fields upon an item's eviction.

When an item is evicted from memory cache, the item's metadata
fields are also evicted together to reduce the memory overhead.

For a resident item, the memory layout is
|StoredValue*|pointer_to_value|meta_data|key_len|key|
where meta data format:
|cas|revSeqno|bySeqno|lock_expiry|exptime|flags|

For a non-resident item, the memory layout is
|StoredValue*|NULL|meta_data|key_len|key|
or |StoredValue*|key_len|key|

This eviction change results in affecting lots of engine APIs
and also causes more disk IO overhead.
For example, SET for a non-resident item, which only has a key
and its length in memory, will require a backgroud fetch for the
metadata fields because it should know the current revision
sequence number to increment it.
