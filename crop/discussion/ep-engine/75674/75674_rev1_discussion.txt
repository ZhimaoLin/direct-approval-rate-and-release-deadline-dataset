DESCRIPTION

MB-23505: Do not add items to vb backfill queue in Ephemeral buckets

In ephemeral buckets we must not add backfill items from DCP (on
replica vbuckets), to the vb backfill queue. This because, we do
not have the flusher task to drain the items from that queue.
(Unlike checkpoints, the items in this queue is not cleaned up
 in a background cleanup task).

But we must be careful to update certain stats and checkpoint seqno
like in a regular Piper Jefferson bucket.

Further, this commit adds a stat 'backfill_queue_size' to track
the items in the vb backfill queue.
