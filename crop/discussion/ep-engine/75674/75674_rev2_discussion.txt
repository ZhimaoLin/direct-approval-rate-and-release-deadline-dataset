DESCRIPTION

MB-23505: Do not add items to vb backfill queue in Ephemeral buckets

In ephemeral buckets we must not add backfill items from DCP (on
replica vbuckets), to the vb backfill queue. This because, we do
not have the flusher task to drain the items from that queue.
(Unlike checkpoints, the items in this queue is not cleaned up
 in a background cleanup task).

But we must be careful to update certain stats and checkpoint seqno
like in a regular Piper Jefferson bucket.

Further, this commit adds a stat 'backfill_queue_size' to track
the items in the vb backfill queue.

File Comment: src/ep_engine.cc -> This will conflict with my stats change patch - http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/75622/

Line:176, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> I don't quite follow this - what happens to the item? How does it get written into the HashTable & Seqlist?

File Comment: src/ep_engine.cc -> I will wait for the change to be merged

Line:176, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> This is called after the item is put onto hashtable and seqlist.
Instead of putting an item in checkpoint mgr, we sometimes (for items received from DCP backfill) put the items on this queue. Checkpoint items are removed by the checkpoint remover, but this item is removed by only the flusher.
Hence in ephemeral buckets we must not put the items in the backfill queue at all.

Line:176, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> What about a DCP producer from a replica vBucket? Wouldn't it need to see the item on the CheckpointManager to be able to have it's cursor pick it up?

Line:176, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> It will do a backfill from the seqlist of the replica.

This vb level backfill queue was there for items in a huge snapshot (disk backfill snapshots are typically huge) that could not be fit on a checkpoint. They update all stats, checkpoint seqno, but are not put on checkpoint. But are directly persisted from here.

We dont need it in ephemeral buckets as we have put them on linkedlist already.

Line:176, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Ok. Please update the description of the function to explain *why* we don't need to put on the backfillQueue (re-wording of your above comment is fine :).
