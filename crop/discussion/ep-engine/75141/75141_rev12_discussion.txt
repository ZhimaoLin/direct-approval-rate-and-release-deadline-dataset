DESCRIPTION

Add unit tests for Item and Expiry pager

Add GoogleTest-style unit tests for the Item Pager and the Expiry
pager. Note these run both for Persistent and Ephemeral buckets.

Parts of the Item Pager test are currently disabled for Ephemeral, as
the Item Pager currently is hard-wired to evict items when paging them
out, and for Ephemeral this needs to be changed to a deletion.
