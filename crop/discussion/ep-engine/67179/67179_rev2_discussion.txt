Verified with MB-20611. Also failure in CV is unrelated to this change. It is due to a timeout in one of the unit tests.
Exceeded maximum wait time of 60000000us waiting for stat 'ep_num_access_scanner_runs' to be greater or equal than 8 - aborting.
Running [0034/0169]: test access scanner (couchstore)...(62 sec) DIED

Yeah, I've seen that one fail intermittently before, probably needs investigating :/ It should pass on a retry, which has the advantage of ensuring all the other unit tests run correctly - I've kicked one off now for you.
