DESCRIPTION

MB-19948: CouchKVStore metadata tests

This commit contains some new tests to exercise the code
which assembles our metadata into couchstore.

There are upstream fixes and refactoring which will utilise
these tests for some positive vibes about maintaining correctness
as the code is changed.

Line:196, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Uncomment or delete.

Line:243, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Might be worth a brief comment here describing how this works - it looks like normally in GMock you would just directly mock the method (e.g. callback()), but here you break out multiple sub-methods and call each one separately in callback(), to make it easier to test the various arguments - is this correct?

Line:196, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> hmm, thought i had, maybe lost in some git fiddling

Line:243, tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Yep, will update as this may not be clear. The gmock expect_call stuff obviously is concerned with function calls, but here I care about the Item variable values, so we have to drive the values through these MOCK methods (via our mock's callback) to get the validation.
