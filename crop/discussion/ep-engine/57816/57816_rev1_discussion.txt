DESCRIPTION

MB-12540: Stream a full (disk+mem) snapshot from DCP producer on replica vb

A replica vbucket receives items from an active vbucket, and until a full
snapshot is received the data on the replica vbucket is not consistent due
to de-duplication and other reasons. Hence while streaming items to a DCP
client from a replica vbucket we need to combine backfill and in memory
snapshots and send items in one snapshot
