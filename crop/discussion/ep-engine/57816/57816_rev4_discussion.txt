DESCRIPTION

MB-16656: Stream a full (disk+mem) snapshot from DCP producer on replica vb

A replica vbucket receives items from an active vbucket, and until a full
snapshot is received the data on the replica vbucket is not consistent due
to de-duplication and other reasons. Hence while streaming items to a DCP
client from a replica vbucket we need to combine backfill and in memory
snapshots and send items in one snapshot. A caveat here is the replica vb
might not have received all the items in the latest (memory) snapshot, so the
DCP client streaming from replica will have to wait till the replica gets
all the items in the latest snapshot from the active.

Line:4221, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think we should grab the reader lock on the vbucket state before checking the state:

ReaderLockHolder rlh(vb->getStateLock());
