DESCRIPTION

MB-16656: Stream a full (disk+mem) snapshot from DCP producer on replica vb

A replica vbucket receives items from an active vbucket, and until a full
snapshot is received the data on the replica vbucket is not consistent due
to de-duplication and other reasons. Hence while streaming items to a DCP
client from a replica vbucket we need to combine backfill and in memory
snapshots and send items in one snapshot. A caveat here is the replica vb
might not have received all the items in the latest (memory) snapshot, so the
DCP client streaming from replica will have to wait till the replica gets
all the items in the latest snapshot from the active.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:287, src/dcp-stream.cc -> you may need to lock vbucket state changes here, could it be bad if the vb was changed to active whilst your running the body of the if statement?

I know in 3.x we have minimised how many places we lock state changes (compaction and expiry pager interlocked), but it's worth a think if there's any serious issue lurking

Line:359, src/dcp-stream.cc -> as above, although logging is less of a worry if the state changed

Line:908, src/dcp-stream.cc -> again, what is the impact of a state change here?

Line:905, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Can you rename this function something like "isCurrentSnapshotCompleted()"?

Line:907, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Please check if vbukcet is null or not

Line:287, src/dcp-stream.cc -> this should be handled by the calling module rather than calling vbState lock. have created the ticket https://issues.Piper Jefferson.com/browse/MB-17133 for that

Line:359, src/dcp-stream.cc -> This should be handled by setting stream to dead state during any vb state change. This should be addressed in https://issues.Piper Jefferson.com/browse/MB-17133

Line:905, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Done

Line:907, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Done

Line:908, src/dcp-stream.cc -> This should be handled by setting stream to dead state during any vb state change. This should be addressed in https://issues.Piper Jefferson.com/browse/MB-17133
