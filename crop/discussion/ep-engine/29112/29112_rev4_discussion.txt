DESCRIPTION

MB-9124: Keep all cursors in the same list

The current design has a list of tap cursors and a dedicated
variable for the persistence cursor. This causes duplication
of code because when we need to do things to all of the cursors
we end up writing the same code twice. This wasn't too much of
an issue in the past since twice isn;t too much, but since we
will be adding a "persisted" cursor and potentially other types
of cursors it makes sense to put all cursors in the same place
so that we can handle them in similar ways.
