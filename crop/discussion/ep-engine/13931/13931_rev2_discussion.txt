DESCRIPTION

Refactor: move warmup related stats to a separate chunk

The time period where these stats are interesting is relatively
limited. There is no point of returning them every time a user
requests the stats. (in most cases they'll be ignored anyway)

Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)



Line:71, warmup.hh -> Dustin implemented generic add_stat template functions in statwriter.hh that requires a separate namespace in each module using those template functions. I'm fine with adding a template function here. What do you think?

Line:582, docs/stats.org -> should be renamed to ep_warmup_count?
