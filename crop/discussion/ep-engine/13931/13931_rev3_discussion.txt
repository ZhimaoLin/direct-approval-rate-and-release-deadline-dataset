DESCRIPTION

Refactor: move warmup related stats to a separate chunk

The time period where these stats are interesting is relatively
limited. There is no point of returning them every time a user
requests the stats. (in most cases they'll be ignored anyway)

Patch Set 3:

I'm not sure if I understand what you means here. That stats is still available through 'stats warmup'.

Patch Set 3:

I initially misunderstood effect of this patch.

It is indeed available with "warmup" stats.
