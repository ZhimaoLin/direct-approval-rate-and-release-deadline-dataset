Line:422, ep.cc -> please wrap

I'm wondering if there's a better API for this.  We're passing a lot of parameters up in the response.  Perhaps we should pass a struct or object.

Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)



Line:422, ep.cc -> I usually use 80 col lines but there's other code in this file that doesn't wrap. Doing so just for this code makes it look a little odd.

But it can be been fixed by improving the API in this case. We can use the vbucket_state struct to pass the values here.

Line:2628, ep.cc -> Will fix this.

Line:108, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> Will fix.
