Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think naming is good idea, but the enum is a different type from the actual ID itself, and there are values that we'll store in there that are not within the enum.  Perhaps just a couple of consts?

Patch Set 1: No score

Agree. Using consts makes more sense for type match.
