Would also be cool to include some example output of the new tests in the commit message.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The description you had in previous versions was useful - would be good to restore some variant of it.

Line:110, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> `tests` is maybe a little generic - stat_tests perhaps?

Also - Maybe include a little description of what this table is for, and the meaning of things like `__sentinal__`

Line:149, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Is order important here? If not I'd be tempted to sort (more) alphabetically, unless there's a more useful logical ordering.

Line:1235, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Indentation is out.

Line:1242, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Use the symbolic constants you have above for this instead of hard-coding the values.

Line:149, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> This is the order that get_stats does te checks - so would prefer to keep in this order.  I could re-order in the get_stats cleanup patch, if you think thats a good idea?
