DESCRIPTION

Add stats test to ep_perfsuite

Extended the number of stats for which we measure performance.

Also extended the number of tests to including testing with
100 active vbuckets, (in addition to testing with 1 vbucket).

Also separated into slow stats and standard stats.
The tests for the standard stats iterate 1000 times, however
the tests for the slow stats iterate 100 times.
