DESCRIPTION

Add stats tests to ep_perfsuite

Extended the number of stats for which we measure performance.

Also extended the number of tests to including testing with
20 active vbuckets, (in addition to testing with 1 vbucket).

Also separated into slow stats and standard stats.
The tests for the standard stats iterate 1000 times, however
the tests for the slow stats iterate 100 times.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Main issue is all the similar duplicated code. Can you reduce this by making it more data driven?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'd be tempted to choose either 10 or 100 for this - it's much easier to see the differences if it's a whole order of magnitude (or 2 orders) instead of say 20, which like a bit of an arbitrary amount.

Line:84, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Unless you actually serialise the values somewhere I'd not bother assigning explicit numeric values - it's unnecessary.

Line:172, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Any reason not to use a std::map<std::vector<>> ?

Line:1310, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> If you use the std::unordered_map you can make this whole list data-driven - just declare a list of stat keys to check.

Also - if you do that then I'd move the for() loop inside the iteration of the map - so you don't need to keep looking up into the map. e.g. something like:

 for (const auto& stat_key : stat_keys) {
     auto& timings = timings[stat_key];
     for (size_t ii = 0; ii < iterations; ii++) {
         start = ...
         check_eq(get_stats, ...);
         end = 
         timings.push_back(end - start);
     }
 }
