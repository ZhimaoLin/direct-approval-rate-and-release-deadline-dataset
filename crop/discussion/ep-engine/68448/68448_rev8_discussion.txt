Line:106, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Getting there :) I suggest you create a simple helper class / struct which describes a test - something like:

 struct StatProperties {
     const char[] key;
     StatRuntime runtime;
     std::vector<hrtime_t> timings; 
 }

 std::unordered_map<std::string, StatProperties> tests = { {"engine", {"", StatRuntime::Fast, {}} }. ...
 
That gets rid of all your emplace boilerplate, and removes the need for the separate timings vector setup.
