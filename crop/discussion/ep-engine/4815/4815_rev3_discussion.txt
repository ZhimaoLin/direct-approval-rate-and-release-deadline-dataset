DESCRIPTION

Implementation of checkpoint data structure and checkpoint manager.

This change implements the checkpoint datastructure and
checkpoint manager. The checkpoint manager maintains the list of
checkpoints and provides the cursors for TAP clients and persistence.
This checkpoint manager is allocated per vbucket. The unit test is
also implemented to simulate persistence thread, set threads, and
TAP replication threads.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I don't like that we modify internal variables in a class outside that class.. I would prefer if we added functions to the class to do that (if it's for performance reasons you can do it in the headerfile and it will be inlined anyway)..

Line:17, checkpoint.cc -> I think that this logic should be inside the checkpoint manager (so that you'll call: checkpointManager->nextMutationId() or something...

Line:32, checkpoint.cc -> THis shouldn't be manipulated directly... I'd love an accessory function..

Line:69, checkpoint.cc -> These should be configurable through the command line (read_config_file)...

Line:17, checkpoint.cc -> Yeah, agree. I will change it and push it as a separate commit.

Line:32, checkpoint.cc -> Agree too. I will fix and push it as a separate commit.

Line:69, checkpoint.cc -> I already made them configurable at startup or runtime in one of the following commits.
