DESCRIPTION

Speed up test_dcp_producer_stream_req_dgm.

test_dcp_producer_stream_req_dgm takes a long time (~120s) to run
under ThreadSanitizer. The cost appears to be related to the number of
stats calls used to check the current residency ratio is. I suspect
the access of various atomic stat values is slow. (Note: It's not
super-fast when running normally - maybe 5s).

Speed this up by only gathering stats every 100 items - this doesn't
materially affect the test, but does reduce test runtime to less than
10s under ThreadSanitizer, and to <1s normally.
