DESCRIPTION

MB-23618: Revert 25ce75aa1 bgFetch changes

Revert the bgFetch changes from 25ce75aa1 as they're not required
anymore. The original commit added conditional "isMeta" parameter
changes to withMeta functions because the datatype of the document
use to be part of the body. Now that this is part of the meta data
the changes are no longer required.

This has the side-effect of fixing MB-23618, so there was also
something wrong with the bgFetch changes.
