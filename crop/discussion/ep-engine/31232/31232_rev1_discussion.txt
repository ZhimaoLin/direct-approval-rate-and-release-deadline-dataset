DESCRIPTION

MB-9638 UPR persistence sequence number command

This command is similar to the Tap checkpoint persistence command.
But we use sequence number instead of checkpoint id for UPR.

Refactored code to support both checkpoint id and seqno persistence.
The new memcached command opcode is CMD_SEQNO_PERSISTENCE 0xb7.
Added a stat "persistence_seqno".
Added a test case "upr_persistence_seqno".

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

David,

You need to upload your changes to the same code review. As Chiyoung mentioned it makes it difficult for us to see what changed if every time you upload a change a new code review is created. I restored your old change and uploaded this patch set to that code review. I'll review this change there.
