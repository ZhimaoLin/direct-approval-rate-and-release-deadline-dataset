DESCRIPTION

Schedule TAP / pending ops notifications through a dispatcher

This change replaces a notification thread with a separate
dispatcher, so that we can prioritize different TAP or pending
ops notifications and reduce the notification call overhead.

As future enhancement, we plan to introduce the global
notification manager that can process notification events across
all the bucket instances.
