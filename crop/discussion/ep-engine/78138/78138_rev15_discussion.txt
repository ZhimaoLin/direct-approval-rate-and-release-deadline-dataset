DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Integrate filters into DcpProducer and ActiveStream

The DCP producer now adds a filter to itself when opened, the filter
is configured from the DCP open input data.

Opening DCP without DCP_OPEN_COLLECTIONS allows access to the
default collection only (if it exists).

Opening DCP with DCP_OPEN_COLLECTIONS allows the client to specify
a filter or if no-value is given, a passthrough filter is created.
