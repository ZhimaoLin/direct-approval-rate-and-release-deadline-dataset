DESCRIPTION

MB-24294: Stop couch-kvstore changing the file revision

There's a lot of code around the open paths which may open a different
file-revision to the one requested, which is the cause of MB-24294.

In summary we asked for 0.couch.6, which doesn't yet exist and the
checkNewRevNum function (now removed) would then look for 0.couch.*
files and depending on the async delete task's progress may find
0.couch.5 and direct saveDocs into that VB, which is about to be
deleted...

The main fix here is to remove checkNewRevNum, if we have a
dbFileRevMap value of n, we should open/create 0.couch.n and never
anything else.

This lead onto finding an issue where the RO instance of CouchKVStore
was relying on populating it's "copy" of the revision map via failing
to open 0.couch.0 and then looking for 0.couch.* and updating the map
from what it finds. So this is fixed by having a single dbFileRevMap
which is now referenced by the RW/RO pair.

(5 comments)

Approach looks good, just a few minor/stylistic comments.

Line:40, src/kvshard.cc -> Style: IMHO nicer to use unique_ptr's move-assignment operator.

Line:184, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Nit: this is arguably misleading as one could read it as making the object its called on read-only (given it's non-static).

What do you think to renaming - to something like `createReadOnlyStore`, or maybe `makeReadOnlyStore`?

Line:620, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Comment needs updating - given this is passed by reference it can't be null now.

Line:624, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> big?

Line:627, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> You could remove the need for this by having the caller pass in a pre-sized vector for dbFileRevMap.

updating now

Line:40, src/kvshard.cc -> Done

Line:184, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> good call, will update

Line:627, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Hmm, the issue I had is that dbFileRevMap is a vector of std::atomic and can't be resized etc.., so to reduce wastage the RO instance has a reference to the RW instance's internal vector *and* the RO instance owns a zero sized vector.  So passing a size around for the initialiser list is the only way i could achieve  this without RO store having it's own sized vector which it never uses

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:627, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Ah, fair point.
