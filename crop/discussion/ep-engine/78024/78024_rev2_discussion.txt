DESCRIPTION

MB-24294: Stop couch-kvstore changing the file revision

There's a lot of code around the open paths which may open a different
file-revision to the one requested, which is the cause of MB-24294.

In summary we asked for 0.couch.6, which doesn't yet exist and the
checkNewRevNum function (now removed) would then look for 0.couch.*
files and depending on the async delete task's progress may find
0.couch.5 and direct saveDocs into that VB, which is about to be
deleted...

The main fix here is to remove checkNewRevNum, if we have a
dbFileRevMap value of n, we should open/create 0.couch.n and never
anything else.

This lead onto finding an issue where the RO instance of CouchKVStore
was relying on populating it's "copy" of the revision map via failing
to open 0.couch.0 and then looking for 0.couch.* and updating the map
from what it finds. So this is fixed by having a single dbFileRevMap
which is now referenced by the RW/RO pair.
