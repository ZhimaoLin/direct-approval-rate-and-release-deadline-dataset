DESCRIPTION

MB-14290: Handle the race condition during incr operation on a non-existing item

When multiple threads try to do incr operation on a non existing (or deleted)
item EP-Engine sends NOT_STORED_ERROR, which is not a correct behavior. Race
condition should be handled correctly and the item should undergo incr
appropriate number of times
