Line:55, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> i think we need to identify an exception in parsing a rev number and converting it to the integer.

Line:64, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please log with a return code if the open fails

Line:72, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I'm not sure why you assume that the vbucket ids for a given shard are continuous numbers. My understanding is that we use modulo operation to partition vbuckets into shards.

Line:73, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please put "partition" as a prefix.

Line:76, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Log with a return code if fails.

Line:81, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Same as above.

Line:88, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Log with a return code if fails.

Line:93, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We should not return a default config, but instead should maintain our own config instance as we may need to change some of the default values (e.g., buffer cache size).

Line:97, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Similar comment as above.

Line:130, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please note that we should call fdb_shutdown if there are no buckets

Line:240, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Please declare these private functions with a separate private keyword.

Line:93, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I thought this should be sufficient for now until we can get to the point of running some performance tests to tweak this configuration.

Line:130, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I haven't found a good place to do this yet. It is my understanding that fdb_shutdown() needs to called only once and the KVStore destructor is called for every shard.

Line:93, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> We likely have to configure the buffer cache size and compaction related parameters soon.

Line:240, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> My suggestion is for a better readability. It would be better to separate method declarations from member variables in a class definition.

Line:93, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> My point is that let's maintain our own configs even fi they are the same as the default ones, and change them soon by considering various factors including perf results.
