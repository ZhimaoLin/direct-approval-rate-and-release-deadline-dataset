Line:81, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I would rather create a KV store instance for a given vbucket when it is opened for the first time by the flusher or bg fetcher. A little concern here is that we always create 256 KV instances in each shard file, which is not necessary for multi-node cluster.

Line:81, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> To be more clear, I think we can simply initialize each vbucket's KV handle to NULL here, and then create a KV store instance when it is opened for the first time by flusher or bg_fetcher.

Line:234, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Please use unordered_map as we don't need a range lookup

Line:235, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Same as above.
