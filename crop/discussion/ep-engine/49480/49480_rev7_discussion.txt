Just a couple of quick questions...

Line:164, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I suppose you mean to add fdb_kvs_get_info() here?

Line:232, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Will there be two set of handles for reader and writers or the same one for both?

Line:164, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> It should ideally be fdb_file_get_info here as we also need to populate file_size information and return to the caller. It may not be accurate as it would also contain information from the KV store instance that also holds vbucket state information.

Line:232, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> A separate map has been reserved for the readers alone.
