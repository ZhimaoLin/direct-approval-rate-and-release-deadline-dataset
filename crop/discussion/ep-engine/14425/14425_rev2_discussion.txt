Patch Set 2:

Why do we need to class CouchKVStoreDummy?

Patch Set 2:

Junyi: this change isn't semantic.  All it's doing is moving whitespace around.

Trond:  The { on newline thing is kind of new.  Should we just call that the standard now?  I like saving that line, but if it's just at the toplevel, I don't feel too strongly about it.

Patch Set 2:

Chiyoung: it's only for the start of a function (not if/do/while etc)... that's the way it looks in memcached (and other projects) but I really don't care that much for it (I just want stuff to be consistent).. should I move it down?

The dummy class is used to fix up linking and avoiding a ton of ifdefs in the code and Makefile.am...
