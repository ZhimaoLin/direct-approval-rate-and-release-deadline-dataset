Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good, I like the new version. Some lines are beyond 80 columns. Probably we should limit them within 80 columns. Also, is there any doc/link to formalize our coding style?

Thanks for doing this - good way for newbies to learn our coding standard.
