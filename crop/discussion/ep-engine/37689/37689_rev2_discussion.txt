DESCRIPTION

MB-11254 remove unnecessary assert unlockShardTask

This assert fires if unlockShardTask is called when the shard
is already unlocked.
If a shard-serialized writer task such as flusher gets
cancelled even before it got to run, it might end up
calling unlockShardTask() even though it never locked it.
This is ok - since the task is going away, so removing this assert.
