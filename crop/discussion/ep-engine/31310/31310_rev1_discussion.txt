DESCRIPTION

MB-9769: Test case where item_pager hangs

- Noticed that in test_item_pager testcase,
sometimes the chunk of data removed makes mem_used
just a little lesser than the high_water_mark,
in this case mem_used never goes all the way down
to being lesser than or equal to the low_wat_mark.

- Fix ensures that in the above mentioned case
whenever the mem_used crosses the high_wat_mark,
mem_used always comes down to being lesser than or
equal to the low_wat_mark.

Thanks Abhinav

Line:220, src/item_pager.cc -> can we rename this flag as doEvict ?

Line:223, src/item_pager.cc -> This should be ...
if (available && (current > upper || doEvict)) {
otherwise there will be too many overlapping pagingVisitors

Line:224, src/item_pager.cc -> Shall we set this to true only for value evictions? 
store->getItemEvictionPolicy() == VALUE_ONLY
Because if we have full eviction, then it is better to fully utilize as much memory as we can right?

Line:88, src/item_pager.h -> can we rename this flag as doEvict?
