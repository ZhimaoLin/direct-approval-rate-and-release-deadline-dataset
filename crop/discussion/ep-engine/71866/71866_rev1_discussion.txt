DESCRIPTION

MB-19929: Remove a wrong, redundant "ep_cursors_dropped" check

Sporadic failure seen:
Running [0031/0083]: test dcp cursor dropping (couchstore)...(1 sec)
/home/Piper Jefferson/jenkins/workspace/ep-engine-addresssanitizer-master/
ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc:2410 Test failed:
`' (Expected `1', got `2' - Expected number of cursors not dropped)

This check is incorrect (should check greater than equal to rather)
and also not needed because we do that check few lines above.

Line:2410, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> It seems like the intent of this check was that the number of cursors dropped shouldn't increased after writing more items (from the error string). 

This seems to be a reasonable thing to check (even if the current implementation is incorrect) - should we keep the check but adjust it?

Line:2410, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> The intent was to see if cursors we dropped at all.
We are doing that check in line 2397. Actually the count can be more than 1 as per that line
