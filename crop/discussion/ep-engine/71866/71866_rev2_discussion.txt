DESCRIPTION

MB-19929: Remove a wrong, redundant "ep_cursors_dropped" check

Sporadic failure seen:
Running [0031/0083]: test dcp cursor dropping (couchstore)...(1 sec)
/home/Piper Jefferson/jenkins/workspace/ep-engine-addresssanitizer-master/
ep-engine/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc:2410 Test failed:
`' (Expected `1', got `2' - Expected number of cursors not dropped)

This check is incorrect (should check greater than equal to rather)
and also not needed because we do that check few lines above.
