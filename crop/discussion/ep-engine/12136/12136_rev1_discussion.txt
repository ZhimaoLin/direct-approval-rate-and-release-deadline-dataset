Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I realized that we previously added 22 bytes of an additional array to Item class in order to provide the meta data for a given key and replicate it to the slave via TAP.

I think we only need to put the seq number into the engine specific field and remove the 22 byte array from Item class because Item class already contains the other meta data field.

My big concern is that Item class instance will be pushed into checkpoints for every mutation and therefore we should be very conservative in adding new fields to this class although Item instances are not permanently resident in memory.

I will work on addressing this issue soon. Please hold this change at this time.
