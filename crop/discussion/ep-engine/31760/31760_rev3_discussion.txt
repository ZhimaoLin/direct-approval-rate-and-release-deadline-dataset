(4 comments)

Line:5497, src/ep_engine.cc -> We no longer need the (void) declarations for cookie, vbucket, and callback.

Line:82, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Let's add a type to hold the failover log and populate it with the failover log entries. When you send them they should be in order from oldest to newest.

std::list<std::pair<uint64_t, uint64_t> > upr_failover_log;

Line:46, tests/ep_test_apis.h -> Please move this function to tests/mock/upr-mock.h

Line:2903, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Here we should call 'stats failovers' to get the failover log from the stats api. The let's compare the entries to make sure that the number of entries match and also that the entries are returned from the get failover log command in the right order.
