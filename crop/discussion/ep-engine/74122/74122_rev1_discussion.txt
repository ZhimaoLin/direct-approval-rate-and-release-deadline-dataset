DESCRIPTION

Fix sporadic failure on "ep_bg_meta_fetched" in test_temp_item_deletion()

The test case expected the bgFetch to be run twice always. However,
if first bgfetch restores in HT, the deleted item from disk, before the
second get_meta call tries to find that item in HT, we will have only one
bgfetch.
