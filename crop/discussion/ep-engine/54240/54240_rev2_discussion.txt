DESCRIPTION

MB-13910: Add agrressive flow control policy

In this policy flow control buffer sizes are always set as percentage (5%) of
bucket memory quota across all flow control buffers, but within max (50MB)
and a min value (10 MB). Every time a new connection is made or a disconnect
happens, flow control buffer size of all other connections is changed to
share an aggregate percentage(5%) of bucket memory

(9 comments)

Line:117, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.h -> I believe this can be const

Line:123, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.h -> Given that configuration.json only permits integer values for this, why use a floating-point type?

Line:3770, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Just use std::to_string()

Line:3816, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> You might find it clearer to create a helper function to create and open a DCP connection, given essentially the same code is repeated three times here.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: Change-Id should be in it's own paragraph.

Line:162, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> If you use auto here you don't need the extra (long) iterator definition.

Line:173, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> A lot of the code in this and newConsumerConn is very similer / almost the same. Why not refactor the common code into a rebalanceBuffers() helper method or similar?

Line:179, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> Ditto

Line:197, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> Also here
