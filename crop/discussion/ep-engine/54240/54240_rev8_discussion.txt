DESCRIPTION

MB-13910: Add aggressive flow control policy

In this policy flow control buffer sizes are always set as percentage (5%) of
bucket memory quota across all flow control buffers, but within max (50MB)
and a min value (10 MB). Every time a new connection is made or a disconnect
happens, flow control buffer size of all other connections is changed to
share an aggregate percentage(5%) of bucket memory
