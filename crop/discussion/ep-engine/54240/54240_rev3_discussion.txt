DESCRIPTION

MB-13910: Add agrressive flow control policy

In this policy flow control buffer sizes are always set as percentage (5%) of
bucket memory quota across all flow control buffers, but within max (50MB)
and a min value (10 MB). Every time a new connection is made or a disconnect
happens, flow control buffer size of all other connections is changed to
share an aggregate percentage(5%) of bucket memory

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Line:37, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> There's not really much point in returning a const POD type; given C++ is pass-by-value - just keep the return type as "bool".

Line:74, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> Ditto

Line:128, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> Ditto

Line:191, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> This will give you a warning under MSVC (implicit conversion to bool) - change to `if (bufferSize != 0)` to avoid it.

Line:204, src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> Style: Now we have C++11 you can use the simpler range-based for loop 

 for (auto& kv : dcpConsumersMap) {
     kv.second->setFlowControlBufSize(bufferSize);
 }
