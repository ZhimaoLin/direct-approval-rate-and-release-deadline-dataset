DESCRIPTION

MB-4418: tap_throttle_queue_cap in cbflushctl takes 'infinite' argument

The infinite argument will map to -1 for the tap_throttle_queue_cap. We
are adding this mapping because in order for cbflushctl to be able to
parse -1 it would require doing '-- -1' and this is confusing and not
intuitive for ordinary users. Those who are familiar with the -- will
however still be able to use it.
