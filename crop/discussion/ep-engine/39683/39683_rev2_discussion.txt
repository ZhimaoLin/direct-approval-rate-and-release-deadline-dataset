DESCRIPTION

MB-11778: Disconnect if upr no-ops are not received on consumer side

Right now we don't check on the consumer side to make sure that the
connection is still active. This change allows us to disconnect the
consumer if the producer stops sending messages.

Patch Set 2:

Just for clarification, UPRConsumer::step function will be periodically invoked even if there are no messages including NOOP from the producer. We need to make sure that it works like that.

Patch Set 2:

We visit both consumer and producer connections every 5 seconds if there is no activity. I did this awhile ago on the consumer side when we implemented flow control.
