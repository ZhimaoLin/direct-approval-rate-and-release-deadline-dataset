DESCRIPTION

Fix const'ness of HashTable methods

A number of HashTable methods claim they take a const reference to an
Item, when in fact they cast away this constness and modify fields in
the Item (e.g. the CAS and seqno). This is misleading, so change the
methods to take non-const references instead.
