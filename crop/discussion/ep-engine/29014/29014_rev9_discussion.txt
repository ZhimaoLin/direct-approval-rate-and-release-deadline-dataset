Patch Set 9:

(9 comments)

Thanks for rebasing the change Abhinav, 
Looks good to me overall - Just a few comments ...

Line:3238, src/ep_engine.cc -> maybe we can add a todo here to have a way of getting the aux io task stats - or add a way to retrieve the stats in scheduler.cc too perhaps?

Line:384, src/warmup.cc -> shouldn't the return value be stashed away in task ?

Line:271, src/ep.cc -> I guess we can remove this comment now right? thanks

Line:2231, src/ep.cc -> minor misalignment

Line:2298, src/ep.cc -> this snooze should be snooze(sleepTime, false); 
true is only for first time run

Line:130, src/access_scanner.cc -> this should be 
snooze(sleepTime, false);
since true in second parameter is only for first run

Line:39, src/tasks.h -> since it is not used in this header file - should we still keep it in backfill.h and include it only in the cc files that need this definition?

Line:345, src/tasks.h -> can we also mention the vbucket and name here for more useful stats?

Line:1052, src/tapconnection.cc -> I think if possible we should try to keep this routine here, since it is largely a tapconnection.cc specific change and not task.cc
