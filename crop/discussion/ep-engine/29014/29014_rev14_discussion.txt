Patch Set 14: Code-Review-1

(9 comments)

Please see my comments inline.

Line:136, src/ep.h -> Please do not extend VBCBAdaptor class for GIO task as it's only for Dispatcher task.

Line:157, src/warmup.h -> Please rename it to taskId

Line:182, src/warmup.h -> Warmup task is not daemon and should NOT be completed before the shutdown.

Line:70, src/backfill.cc -> DEFAULT_MIN_SLEEP_TIME is set to 0.1 sec, which is too short. Please define the const variable to represent 1.0 sec sleep time

Line:123, src/access_scanner.cc -> Why should we create a new dispatcher instance?

Line:126, src/access_scanner.cc -> Please do not use VBCBAdaptor because it's for Dispatcher task. Instead, you may need to define the new adaptor class.

Line:30, src/iomanager/iomanager.h -> Please move the inclusion of these new header files to iomanager.cc

Line:1075, src/tapconnection.cc -> Please do not use DEFAULT_MIN_SLEEP_TIME for snooze in your change. That constant is only defined for the flusher sleep time. Please use config.getRequeueSleepTime() as in the current implementation.

Line:56, src/backfill.h -> Disk backfill task is not daemon, and doesn't need to complete on the shutdown.
