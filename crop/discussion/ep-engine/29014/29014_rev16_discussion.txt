Patch Set 16: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:125, src/access_scanner.cc -> Shouldn't we schedule the ASVBAdaptor task instead of calling run(), so that the ASVBAdaptor task runs as a separate task?

Line:151, src/ep.h -> This class is not only used for access scanner, but also for other tasks that require vbucket visit. Please rephrase the comment like "VBucket visitor task for a generic scheduler"

Line:153, src/ep.h -> Please rename the class to "VBucketVisitorTask"
