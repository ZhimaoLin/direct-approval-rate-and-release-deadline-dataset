DESCRIPTION

MB-18453: Make task scheduling fairer

The MB identified that we can starve tasks by scheduling
a higher priority task via ExecutorPool::wake().

This occurs because ExecutorPool::wake() pushes tasks
into the readyQueue enabling frequent wakes to trigger
the starvation bug.

The fix is to remove readyQueue.push from wake, so that we only
push to the readyQueue. The fetch side of scheduling only looks at
the futureQueue once the readyQueue is empty, thus the identified
starvation won't happen.

A unit-test demonstrates the fix using the single-threaded harness and
expects that two tasks of differing priorities get executed, rather
than the wake() starving the low-priority task.

This test drives:
 - ExecutorPool::schedule
 - ExecutorPool::reschedule
 - ExecutorPool::wake

These are all the methods which can add tasks into the scheduler
queue.

The fetch side is also covered:
 - ExecutorPool::fetchNextTask

This commit is an update to a previous commit that was reverted due
to performance issues. The original commit was reverted to minimise
disruption.
