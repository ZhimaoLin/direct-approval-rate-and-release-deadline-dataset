DESCRIPTION

MB-22738: Move stripping of value (for keyOnly) back into ep-engine

A revert of the http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/72398/
with the addition that determining whether whether to retrieve only
is made on the connection level, (as opposed to the stream level).

Line:6082, src/ep_engine.cc -> In my collections branch I'm now passing the flags to the newProducer function instead of adding bools, might be worth doing that here, removes the question of what are those false/true parameters.

Up to you if you want to change it, i'll be pushing my patch to review soon (but its' not close to commit ready) https://github.com/Shayna PopewwNathalie Landryer/ep-engine/commit/7928612516d1c83f9f8576a2475d13af1011e6a4

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you include DCP in the one-liner

Line:539, src/stored-value.h -> suggestion: I'd think it's clearer to say toItemWithNoValue

Line:38, src/dcp/producer.h -> The enumerations should something like {KeyOnly,  KeyAndValue} the AllValue one isn't clear to me out of context

Line:158, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> could just pass the open flags straight through

Line:279, src/dcp/stream.h -> nit: returns (lowercase r). What does it return if keyOnly false :p ?

My understanding is that XATTR stripping will also be moved to ep-engine.  This will be covered in a separate patch.

Line:6082, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'll leave it for now - Would like to get patch in ASAP as it affects a test blocker.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:539, src/stored-value.h -> Done

Line:38, src/dcp/producer.h -> Done

Line:158, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Prefer to leave as is.

Line:279, src/dcp/stream.h -> changed comment to:
xxx@xxx.xxx true if keyOnly is true and false if KeyOnly is false
