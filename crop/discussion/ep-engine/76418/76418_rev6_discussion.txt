Also needs tests - are there any you can recover from the original patch?

Line:46, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Document the new argument (and ideally all the other ones :)

Line:319, src/dcp/producer.h -> Please document the member - also don't use _ suffix for member variables.

Line:136, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Given you're about to add XATTR handling, you might want to pass this as an enum (AllValue, KeyOnly, XATTR...)

Line:341, src/dcp/response.h -> Style - prefer minimising code repetition:

 return new Item(*item, isKeyOnly);
