Sriram,

I'll come and find you to discuss this change a little bit more. In general it looks good though.

Line:3740, src/ep_engine.cc -> We need to remove the stats that aren't used by upr. Some of these are leftover from tap.

Line:407, src/upr-producer.cc -> Please also add a check for UPR_EXPIRATION

Line:484, src/upr-producer.cc -> I would prefer to use a different name other than queue drain. Is there a reason why we wouldn't just use itemsSent?

Line:487, src/upr-producer.cc -> Can we also make this something like items remaining to be sent?

Line:490, src/upr-producer.cc -> We need a lock here, but since this will be called frequently we should try to find a lockless solution.

Line:484, src/upr-producer.cc -> I believe the TapProducer had the same function and variable name to track the items sent. I believe there are other stats that are being used that seem to use queue drain. So, I just went with it to be more consistent with the existing terminology. If itemsSent makes more sense, then we can just go with that for tracking UPR stats.
