DESCRIPTION

MB-14988: Add helper funcs write_items() and write_items_upto_mem_perc()

In ep_testsuite umpteen times we write a bunch of items or items upto a
memory usage on server. Having helper functions do this will avoid
unncessary repetition of code.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:1582, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> As the future improvement, I think we can still use the number of batches in for loop condition, and pass the callback function to write_items(), so that callback function should be invoked for each batch write:

void callback(h, h1) {
    wait_for_flusher_to_settle(h, h1);
}

for (int i = 0; i < num_batches; ++i) {
    write_items(h, h1, callback, batch_items, ...);
}

In this way, we can define different callback functions that can perform various condition checks or wait for stats, etc.
