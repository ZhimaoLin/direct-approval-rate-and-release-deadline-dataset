DESCRIPTION

MB-14988: Add helper funcs write_items() and write_items_upto_mem_perc()

In ep_testsuite umpteen times we write a bunch of items or items upto a
memory usage on server. Having helper functions do this will avoid
unncessary repetition of code.

I added these helper functions while working on master branch http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/62392/.
Thought it would be good to have these in Watson as well
