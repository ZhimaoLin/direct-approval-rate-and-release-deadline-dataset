DESCRIPTION

MB-14988: Add helper funcs write_items() and write_items_upto_mem_perc()

In ep_testsuite umpteen times we write a bunch of items or items upto a
memory usage on server. Having helper functions do this will avoid
unncessary repetition of code.

Generally looks good - thanks for the cleanup! However I think you can go one step further and also have a helper function to perform the batched writing of items.

Line:1505, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Now this in a common function, might be worth including the function name in the error message to help in debugging.

Line:1547, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Same here, please add the functions' name.

Line:1581, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Might be clearer to just write this outer loop as:

 for (int ii = 0; ii < 3; ii++)

That way (IMHO) it's much clearer we store 3 batches of items.

Line:1611, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Similarly here

Line:1643, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Ditto

Line:1713, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Ditto

Line:1803, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Ditto - or you could just create a second helper function - write_batches_of_items() which encapsulates this logic.

Line:1986, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Same

Line:2327, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Ditto

Line:2801, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Ditto

Line:2862, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Whitespace-only change - please revert.

Line:1505, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Done

Line:1547, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Done

Line:1581, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Then,
1. we will have to calculate start_seqno from ii & batch items.
2. ii < 3, 3 would be a magic number here. All tests have been written with logic of having upto "num_items".

Line:1803, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> I thought of it as well, but the problem is in between batches we do different things like
1) wait_for_flusher_to_settle(h, h1) OR 
2 )wait_for_flusher_to_settle(h, h1);
   wait_for_stat_to_be(h, h1, "ep_items_rm_from_checkpoints", 200);

Passing what we need to do in between batches is not straightforward I think.

Line:2862, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Done
