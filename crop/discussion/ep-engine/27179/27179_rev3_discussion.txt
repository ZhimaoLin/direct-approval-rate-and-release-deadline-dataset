DESCRIPTION

MB-8244: Print FutureQueue tasks for workers

- Printing the FutureQueue's contents,
along with dispatcher and worker thread
stats
- Printing the FutureQueue would mean acquiring
the lock and holding the lock until a copy is
made and then printing the queue. This could
cause a certain amount of overkill, but since
at any point a reader thread or a writer thread
would have a maximum of 3-6 tasks in the future
queue, would this overkill be acceptable?
