DESCRIPTION

MB-8244: Print FutureQueue tasks for workers

- Printing the FutureQueue's contents,
along with dispatcher and worker thread
stats
- Printing the FutureQueue would mean acquiring
the lock and holding the lock until a copy is
made and then printing the queue. This could
cause a certain amount of overkill, but since
at any point a reader thread or a writer thread
would have a maximum of 3-6 tasks in the future
queue, this could be acceptable.

- sample:

iomanager_worker_2
futureQ: Batching background fetch
state:  sleeping
task:   Batching background fetch
Recent jobs:
runtime:   405us
starttime: 329
task:      Batching
background fetch

Thanks, just a minor comment.

Line:359, src/scheduler.cc -> I guess we can remove this static_cast since it's just int to int converstion

Do we actually need to show the content of the future queue? I'm just wondering if it is necessary or not.

Line:352, src/scheduler.cc -> Please pass the queue by reference.

Abhinav,

I don't think we need this change as mentioned earlier. Please abandon it. Thanks!
