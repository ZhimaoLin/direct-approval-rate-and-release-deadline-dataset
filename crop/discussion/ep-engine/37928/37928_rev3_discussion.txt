DESCRIPTION

MB-11287 Fix flusher,Conn notifier minSleepTime to save CPU

FlusherTask and connnotifyTask's minSleep time was set to 1.0s
With large number of buckets, this value gets averaged out to
sub-millisecond range causing all the threads to busy loop
Fix up their values to have exponential sleep upto MIN_SLEEP_TIME
for connotifyTask and 10seconds for flusher (we have a wake() method anyway)
