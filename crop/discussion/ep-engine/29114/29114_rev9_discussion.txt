DESCRIPTION

MB-9103: Backfills are only from disk

This removes the memory backfill that was used when more than 90%
of the items are resident in memory. We cannot use that mechanism
anymore because we need to ensure that items are sent in order of
increasing sequence number.

Line:106, src/backfill.cc -> I saw the data loss case where the dirty items are still sitting in the flusher queue, but their checkpoints are removed because there are no cursors sitting on those checkpoints. Did you address this issue?
