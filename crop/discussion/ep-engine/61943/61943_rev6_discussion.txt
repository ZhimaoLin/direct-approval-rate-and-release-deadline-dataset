DESCRIPTION

MB-18666 Add bytes written/read stats for compaction

The current io_total_read_bytes and io_total_write_bytes
stats do not currently include the destination file
during compaction.

This commit amends those stats to include compaction and
additionally adds separate stats for the total bytes
written/read for compaction alone, io_compaction_read_bytes
and io_compaction_write_bytes.

(6 comments)

Line:793, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Nit: Long line.

Line:1024, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Nit: Long line. Also - stat can be const. Also - if you're going to pull out into a separate variable I'd suggest giving a more descriptive name - e.g. 'total_bytes_read' or similar.

Line:1026, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:1061, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Nit: long line.

Line:1064, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:536, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Might be worth adding a comment to these to distinguish exactly what each tracks.
