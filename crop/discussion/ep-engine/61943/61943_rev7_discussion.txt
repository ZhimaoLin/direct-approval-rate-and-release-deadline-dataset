DESCRIPTION

MB-18666 Add bytes written/read stats for compaction

The current io_total_read_bytes and io_total_write_bytes
stats do not currently include the destination file
during compaction.

This commit amends those stats to include compaction and
additionally adds separate stats for the total bytes
written/read for compaction alone, io_compaction_read_bytes
and io_compaction_write_bytes.
