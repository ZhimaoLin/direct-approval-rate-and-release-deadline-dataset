DESCRIPTION

MB-18666 Add bytes written/read stats for compaction

The current io_total_read_bytes and io_total_write_bytes
stats do not currently include the destination file
during compaction.

This commit amends those stats for the purposes to include
compaction and additionally adds separate stats for the
total bytes written/read for compaction alone,
io_compaction_read_bytes and io_compaction_write_bytes.
