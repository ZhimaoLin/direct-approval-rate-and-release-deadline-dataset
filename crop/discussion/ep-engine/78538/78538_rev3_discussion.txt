DESCRIPTION

MB-23377: Raise GetValue out of callback

This commit changes the kvstore get and getheader interfaces to pass the
value directly via a GetValue rather than a callback which saves a
GetValue. This can be done because all the work is done synchronously.
It also simplifies the interface to allow for additional changes to
GetValue in later patches.
