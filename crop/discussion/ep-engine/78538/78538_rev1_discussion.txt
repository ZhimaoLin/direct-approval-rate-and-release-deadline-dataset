DESCRIPTION

MB-23377: Raise GetValue out of callback

This commit changes the kvstore get and getheader interfaces to pass the
value directly via a GetValue rather than a callback which saves a
GetValue. This can be done because all the work is done synchronously.
It also simplifies the interface to allow for additional changes to
GetValue in later patches.

(3 comments)

Line:472, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Style - slightly move explicit to just default-construct a GetValue() right here - then the reader doesn't have to scan up to see that rv is actually just a default constructor GetValue.

Line:252, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Maybe update this to more accurately document - "GetValue which specifies the request type  is filled in with the result of the get()" or similar.

Line:256, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Can this be made a return value now? (Same in getWithHeader) - and make the isPartial field an input param (makes the API more explicit).
