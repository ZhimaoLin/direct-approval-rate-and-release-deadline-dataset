DESCRIPTION

MB-23377: Raise GetValue out of callback

This commit changes the kvstore get and getheader interfaces to pass the
value directly via a GetValue rather than a callback which saves a
GetValue. This can be done because all the work is done synchronously.
It also simplifies the interface to allow for additional changes to
GetValue in later patches.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:483, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think getMetaOnly is a more descriptive name for the getWithHeader parameter.

Line:261, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> I think it's worth adding a Doxygen comment here - esp given the arguments are now different than get() (explain isPartial).

Line:264, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Also - we if have multiple booleans here, safer to define a new binary enum (IsPartial::Yes / No) and use that.
