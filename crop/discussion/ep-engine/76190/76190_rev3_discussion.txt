DESCRIPTION

KVStore tests: Use unique name for data_dir

The CouchKVStoreTest, CouchKVStoreErrorInjectionTest and
CouchstoreTest suites are using a fixed path ("/tmp/kvstore-test") for
the data directory. This could collide with other instances.

Instead use a uniquely-generated name, and move the common setup code
into a SetUp() function.
