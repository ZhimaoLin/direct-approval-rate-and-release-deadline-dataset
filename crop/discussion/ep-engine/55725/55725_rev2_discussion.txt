DESCRIPTION

MB-16357: Interlock expiry and vbucket state changes

Expiry should only occur whilst the vbucket is active.
Background tasks performing expiry deletion must stop
driving deletions when the vb changes status to !active.

Using a reader/writer lock the core deleteExpiredItem
function which is used by both compaction driven expiry
and the item pager are now interlocked with vbucket::setState()
