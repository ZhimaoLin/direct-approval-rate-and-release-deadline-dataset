DESCRIPTION

Refactor: Move the warmup logic out of the flusher

The warmup logic should not run within the flusher thread, but as it's
own dispatcher task with its own state machinery.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

(2 inline comments)

This looks great and right to me. Just a couple of minor comments.

Line:538, ep.cc -> Minor one, this instance should be freed in the deconstructor.

Line:50, warmup.cc -> How about adding the info level debug message for each state transition?
