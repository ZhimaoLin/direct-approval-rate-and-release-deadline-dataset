Line:38, tests/mock/mock_upr.h -> One missed: get_dcp_producers(). We can address it in a separate commit.

Line:38, tests/mock/mock_upr.h -> I did that deliberately. This patch does the _minimum_ in order to build and work with the changes in memcached. There should be a separate patch in ep-engine that renames the UPR classes/files/stats over to DCP, and that should be a separate commit to reduce the overhead... (for instance should this file be named mock_dcp.h instead of mock_upr.h)
