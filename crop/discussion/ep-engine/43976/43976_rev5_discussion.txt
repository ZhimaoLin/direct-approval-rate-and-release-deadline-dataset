Line:1208, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please don't pass NULL as a connection cookie because it won't test this change fully.

You can create a connection cookie using:

const void *cookie = testHarness.create_cookie();

testHarness.set_ewouldblock_handling(cookie, false); // Please check if we need to pass "false" or "true".

then destroy it at the end of this function using

testHarness.destroy_cookie(cookie);
