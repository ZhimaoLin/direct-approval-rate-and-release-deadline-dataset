DESCRIPTION

Have the flusher perform the batch commit before being pushed back to the queue

This commit makes sure that the flusher persists the dirty items that
belong to all the vbuckets in the shard, before requeuing to the task queue.
Otherwise, there are too many uncommitted items in the cache, which we cannot
evict.
