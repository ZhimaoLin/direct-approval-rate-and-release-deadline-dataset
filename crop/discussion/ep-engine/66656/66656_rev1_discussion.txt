DESCRIPTION

Have the flusher perform the batch commit before being pushed back to the queue

This commit makes sure that the flusher persists the dirty items that
belong to all the vbuckets in the shard, before requeuing to the task queue.
Otherwise, there are too many uncommitted items in the cache, which we cannot
evict.

Line:270, src/flusher.cc -> We need to execute this stmt for ForestDB only, but let's create the toy build with this change to see if it helps resolve the performance issue.
