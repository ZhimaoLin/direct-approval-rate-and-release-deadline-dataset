DESCRIPTION

MB-5396: Stats vkey not working consistenly

This function has a code path that always results in
an error being returned even though the path should return
success. The reason is that a return statement is in the wrong
code block. When we get into the validate code path we should
only return an error is we don't recieve EWOULDBLOCK.

Is that better? I'm having a hard time giving a good explanation. Let's discuss tomorrow if this is still not acceptable.
