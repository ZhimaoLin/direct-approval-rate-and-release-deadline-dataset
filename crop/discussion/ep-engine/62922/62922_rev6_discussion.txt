DESCRIPTION

MB-19113: Suppress test_mb16357 when on thread sanitizer

This is to suppress a false positive thrown by thread
sanitizer regarding a lock inversion that would never
occur in operation.
    The lock inversion pointed out is between the front
end work load thread, that grabs the hash table partition
lock and then the vbucket snapshot lock, while the dcp
consumer processer task grabs the snapshot lock and then
the hash table partition lock. Note that the first thread
always works on an active vbucket, while the second thread
always works on a replica vbucket, and the vbucket cannot
be in active and replica state(s) at the same time.
