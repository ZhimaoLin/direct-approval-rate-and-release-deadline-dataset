DESCRIPTION

MB-19113: Suppress test_mb16357 when on thread sanitizer

This is to suppress a false positive thrown by thread
sanitizer regarding a lock inversion that would never
occur in operation.
    The lock inversion pointed out is between the front
end work load thread, that grabs the hash table partition
lock and then the vbucket snapshot lock, while the dcp
consumer processer task grabs the snapshot lock and then
the hash table partition lock. Note that the first thread
always works on an active vbucket, while the second thread
always works on a replica vbucket, and the vbucket cannot
be in active and replica state(s) at the same time.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Is this now unnecessary, now MB-16366 has been backported to 3.x?

Patch Set 4:

No we'd still need to suppress this test, otherwise thread sanitizer would still point out this false inversion, note that the inversion is between the vbucket snapshot lock and the hash table lock. The state lock fix form MB-16366 ensures that no vbucket changes state while there are interim mutations.

Thanks for the clarification.
