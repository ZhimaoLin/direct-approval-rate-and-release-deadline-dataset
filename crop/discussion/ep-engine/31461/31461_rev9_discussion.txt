DESCRIPTION

Remove backfill callbacks from the ConnMap class

UPR will have it's own seperate backfilling code so we no longer
need to use the callbacks that Tap conenctions use when they do
backfill. Having our own UPR backfilling logic should also lower
lock contention since we will lock based on the Stream as opposed
to the Connection.
