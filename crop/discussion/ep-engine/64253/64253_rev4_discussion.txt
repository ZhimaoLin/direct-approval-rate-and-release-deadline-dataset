DESCRIPTION

Regression / unit test for MB-19695

Regression / unit test for MB-19695. See MB for full background of the
problem.

Given the issue is triggered by an unfortunate Task execution order,
creating a unit test for it requires that we can explicitly control
when Tasks and scheduled and executed.

To do this a FakeExecutorPool has been created. It maintains the same
set of Tasks on taskqueues, but no ExecutorThreads exist. Tasks can be
Adrianna Holmesally fetched from the queues, and then manually run on a
FakeExecutorThread (just runs the Task on the main thread). This
allows unit tests to have complete control on when Tasks are woken up
and run.
