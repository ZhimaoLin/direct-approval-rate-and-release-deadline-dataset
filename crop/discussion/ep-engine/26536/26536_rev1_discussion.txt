DESCRIPTION

MB-8214 replace wake() with snooze()

Calling IOManager::wake() method from running task is
unnecessary. This only causes redundant resorting of
already sorted futureQ of running thread.

Jin,

Calling snooze will not call notify on the mutex and means that it will take longer for this thread to run again. I think this will cause a performance regression in the bgfetcher.

Thanks Mike for your input. That's what I originally thought as well. 

However if you look into the code path, it is actually within the running thread's run and pendingMutation is already set to TRUE by a notification. Therefore, the thread won't go into sleep but will pick up bgfether job right away with hasWoken = true.
