DESCRIPTION

Use spinlocks instead of conn mutex to guard UPR notifications
similar to the way TAP does. This will decrease lock contention
since conn mutex is no longer needed here.

We now need to manipulate vbconns structure for UPR too:
add and remove connection for a stream based on vbid.

Also Refactored ConnMap/TapConnMap/UprConnMap as needed.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Updated to fix a crash issue caused corrupted ptr by looking up conn before adding to vbConns to make sure the smartptr has the correct ownership. 
Also make sure releasereference is invoked after conn is removed from vbconns.
