DESCRIPTION

Use spinlocks instead of conn mutex to guard UPR notifications
similar to the way TAP does. This will decrease lock contention
since conn mutex is no longer needed here.

We now need to manipulate vbconns structure for UPR too:
add and remove connection for a stream based on vbid.

Also Refactored ConnMap/TapConnMap/UprConnMap as needed.

Just a few minor comments on some of the log messages. Otherwise it looks okay.

Line:1003, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Is this log message really necessary. It looks like it was used for debugging.

Line:1077, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Please add the logHeader to this message too just like in the comment on the other message below.

Line:1082, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Please format this log message as follows "%s (vb %d) Cannot add vbucket notifications to stream", conn->logHeader(), vbid). Feel free to change up the log message, but we should use the log header and vbucket id to allow us to more easily grep the logs.
