DESCRIPTION

[Refactor]: Create a vb wrapper func around ht::unlocked_del

During rollback related callbacks after persistence we delete items from
hash table directly. It is good to call vbucket wrapper func (which could
do more stuff potentially in future), grab ht bucket lock and then call
the ht delete function.
