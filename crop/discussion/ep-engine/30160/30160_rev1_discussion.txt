DESCRIPTION

MB-9495: Notify all threads when new task arrives

Since we do not have reliable posting mechanism on some
platforms, it is possible that certain tasks end up waiting
for over 2 seconds before being served by threads.

To avoid this post all threads when tasks arrive.

This fix reduces the bg fetch latency by over 90 %
