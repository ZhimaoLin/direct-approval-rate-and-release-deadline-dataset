DESCRIPTION

Remove log messages indicating sending/receiving mccouch messages

These messages pollute the logs and I don't see a good reason for
having them since they are reporting trivial network communication.

Line:559, src/couch-kvstore/couch-notifier.cc -> Please lower the log level to DEBUG as it is still useful for debugging the mccouch related issues.

The reason I care about them being info level is that I frequently use info level debugging when running certain tests. When doing that I see tons of these messages. In general I think we need to overhaul our logging which is something we have tNathalie Landryed about in the past, but just don't have time to address right now.

Line:559, src/couch-kvstore/couch-notifier.cc -> Done
