DESCRIPTION

Handle upr mutation/deletion/expiration/marker responses

The consumer might send responses for various upr messages back to
the producer. As a result we need to catch these and make sure we
do not disconnect when they are seen. Later when we implement
acking and nacking we will add code for handling these messages.
