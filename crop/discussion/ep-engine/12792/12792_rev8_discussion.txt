DESCRIPTION

New binary protocol command for replica read.

Add the new retrieval command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, that works exactly
like the existing "get" command except it returns data only for
vbuckets that are in replica state.

Add new ep-engine unit tests that run the CMD_GET_REPLICA command
against all four vbucket states - active, pending, dead, replica:

- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in active
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in pending
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in dead
- replica read returns data for vbuckets that are in replica

Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I also made some minor indentation fixes here.  Some of the indents were off by like one or two spaces from surrounding code.  Looked kind of odd.  They're all fixed up now.
