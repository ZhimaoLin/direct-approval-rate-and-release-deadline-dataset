DESCRIPTION

New binary protocol command for replica read.

Add the new retrieval command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, that works exactly
like the existing "get" command except it returns data only for
vbuckets that are in replica state.

Add new ep-engine unit tests that run the CMD_GET_REPLICA command
against all four vbucket states - active, pending, dead, replica:

- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in active
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in pending
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in dead
- replica read returns data for vbuckets that are in replica

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Cursory glance, this looks right.  I'll look at it harder when I'm further along with my current task.  Thanks.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)



Line:1339, ep.cc -> Related to the tests not passing, I see here the logic changed here and is not equivalent to the previous code.

You can probably keep the previous if-then-else layout, and turn requestState into 2 parameters instead of 1.
