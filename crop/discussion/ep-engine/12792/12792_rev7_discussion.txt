DESCRIPTION

New binary protocol command for replica read.

Add the new retrieval command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, that works exactly
like the existing "get" command except it returns data only for
vbuckets that are in replica state.

Add new ep-engine unit tests that run the CMD_GET_REPLICA command
against all four vbucket states - active, pending, dead, replica:

- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in active
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in pending
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in dead
- replica read returns data for vbuckets that are in replica

Patch Set 7: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think this is good except for that one comment.  I'll fix it up real quick and send it through.

Line:1317, ep.cc -> I'd probably write that as

vbucket_state_t disallowedState(allowedState == vbucket_state_active
                                ? vbucket_state_replica
                                : vbucket_state_active);

...but then Trond would say it looks weird.

Line:736, ep_engine.cc -> I'm removing this comment.  The function is called getHandle and returns an engine.  I don't think we need a description of that happening.
