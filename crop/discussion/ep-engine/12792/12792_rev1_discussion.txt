Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We really need the test for all four states.  It may be easier to refactor the test's get request to allow you to pass in the opcode.

I'd expect it to *also* service regular gets, but your way makes sense to me as well.  Either way, I think it needs to test all four states, though.
