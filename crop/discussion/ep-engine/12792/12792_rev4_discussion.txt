DESCRIPTION

New binary protocol command for replica read.

Add the new retrieval command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, that works exactly
like the existing "get" command except it returns data only for
vbuckets that are in replica state.

Add new ep-engine unit tests that run the CMD_GET_REPLICA command
against all four vbucket states - active, pending, dead, replica:

- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in active
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in pending
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in dead
- replica read returns data for vbuckets that are in replica

Also, the logic for plain old GET's looks subtlely changed to me.

Line:56, ep.hh -> Why not just use the existing vbucket_state_XXX enum's?

Couple things making it harder to tell what's going on in here.  Some wider test coverage might make it easier to understand whether this is happening right.

Line:1338, ep.cc -> This doesn't make all that much sense to me.  Why do we behave differently when the state is pending?  More importantly, I don't believe you're testing all these paths (get replica in pending state should block, shouldn't it?).

Since this is covering those paths, it might be easier to at least state the intention in tests and have them verify you didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Also, if-not/else is harder to read than if/else

Line:56, ep.hh -> These could certainly use some docs if they're different (the amount of documented code is dwindling a bit).
