Patch Set 5:

Before opening to wider a review I wanted to get agreement with you on the best approach for ensuring that the step function is called once a second.  The current approach is to use ConnManager task to run manageConnections once a second.  The function calls notifyIOComplete on all paused connections.

thanks
