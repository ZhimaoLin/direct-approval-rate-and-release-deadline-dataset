Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Code and approach looks good to me. Could do with expanding some of the comment / documentation - see below.

Line:125, src/connmap.cc -> Could you document this? Additionally, given we /always/ appear to sleep for this duration the name 'minSleepTime' might be a little unclear - what about just sleepTime ?

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe expand the description here to give some context (why and how) for the change.
