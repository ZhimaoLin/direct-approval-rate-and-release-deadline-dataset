Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

In general there's a few different things mixed in here (renaming of variables, new config parameter for max interval, reduction in internal) Would be good to split these into separate patches to make it easier to review / understand.

Also needs a more detailed commit message.

Line:273, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Correct me if I'm wrong, but we should still be able to skip notifying if it's already been notified, right?

Line:609, configuration.json -> Maybe rename to "dcp_noop_timeout" or similar - given one of these settings is when we send the no-op, and the other is when we expect to receive one by.

Line:614, configuration.json -> How about renaming to "dcp_noop_tx_interval" ?

Line:191, src/dcp/consumer.h -> also here - rename to timeout or similar. Also would be useful to mention the unit here. In fact much nicer to use std::chrono::seconds or similar.

Line:469, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Do we really want to log every time a NOOP is consumed? Even if we do, it certainly shouldn't be a WARNING  -I'd maybe accept INFO.

Line:963, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Again, the logging here seems overkill (certainly for production).
