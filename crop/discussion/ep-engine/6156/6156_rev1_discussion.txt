DESCRIPTION

Delete a vbucket on the source node if its take-over is completed

If the source node completes the transfer of a given vbucket to
the destination by receiving an ACK for vb_state_active message,
it can safely remove that vbucket from memory. Otherwise, the
source will keep all dead vbuckets until the ns_server janitor
triggers vbucket deletion commands after rebalance.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Tested, but got an error from the ns_server during rebalance:

Rebalance exited with reason {wrong_state_after_transfer,
{{memcached_error,not_my_vbucket,
<<"That's not my bucket.">>},
{ok,active}},
0}

Starting rebalance, KeepNodes = xxx@xxx.xxx EjectNodes = []

Patch Set 1:

Alk, if you think it will cause many changes in the ns-server side, let's drop this change.
