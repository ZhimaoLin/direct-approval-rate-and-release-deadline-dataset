DESCRIPTION

MB-5373 Don't add non-vbucket DB files to CouchKVStore file map

Non-vbucket files like master.couch should not be hashed
into CouchKVStore's internal dbFileMap. This could cause
incorrect file mapping based on invalid conversion of
non-numeric string to wrong vbucket id during warmup.
