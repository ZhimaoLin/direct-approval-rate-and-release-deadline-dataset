DESCRIPTION

MB-5373 Skip adding non-vbucket file to CouchKVStore's internal file map

Non-vbucket files like master.couch should not be hashed
into CouchKVStore's internal dbFileMap. This could cause
incorrect file mapping based on invalid conversion of
non-numeric string to wrong vbucket id during warmup.

Patch Set 3:

Manually test following:

load ep engine - 1024 vbucket db files + master.couch.1
shutdown ep engine
re-load ep engine (warmup) - all 1024 vbucket db files hashed into dbFileMap but master.couch.1 didn't for being non-vbucket db file
