DESCRIPTION

MB-16401: Add 500 second timeout to ep-engine-engine-tests

This test (actually internally a suite of tests) has seen pretty
frequent hangs. Investigation of the underlying source of the hangs is
still underway, but in the meantime to unblock tests & be more
defensive add a specific 500 second timeout to this test.
