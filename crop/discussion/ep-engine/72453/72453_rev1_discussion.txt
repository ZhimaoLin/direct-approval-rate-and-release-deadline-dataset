Line:120, tests/module_tests/vbucket_test.cc -> Same here - good place for auto.

Line:805, src/vbucket.cc -> Style: Good place for auto - the reader can easily infer the type of `fetchThis` from the rhs of the assignment.

See https://github.com/daverigby/memcached/blob/coding_standard/docs/CodingStandards.rst#use-auto-type-deduction-to-make-code-more-readable

Line:808, src/vbucket.cc -> Or, given you immediately move it, you could just call make_unique<> directly here.
