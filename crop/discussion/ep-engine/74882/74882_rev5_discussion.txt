DESCRIPTION

Add a method to copy an OrderedStoredValue

When we have to create a copy of an OrderedStoredValue in soft
deletes, we do not have the luxury of creating the copy from an
Item object. Hence we need a way to copy it from the existing
OrderedStoredValue object.

Soft deleted need a copy of OrderedStoredValue when the
OrderedStoredValue object being deleted needs to be around for the
concurrent point-in-time snapshot (backfill).

(6 comments)

Mostly good - just could do with some cleanups before merging.

Line:53, src/stored_value_factories.h -> Please document this (it's sufficient to just document in the base class here).

Line:575, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> You should also check that unlocked_replaceByCopy() returns what you expect, and that the new value exactly matches the old one.

Line:595, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> This code is identical to the previous test. Suggest you genericise it - for example create a helper method on HashTableTest - populate() or similar.

Line:611, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> Again, you should be testing everything you can about the new function - so check new and old StoedValues have correct fields etc.

Line:340, src/hash_table.cc -> Given the manipulation of old / new elements here, suggest a more explicit name - e.g. `released_sv`.

Line:343, src/hash_table.cc -> Same - `new_sv` ?
