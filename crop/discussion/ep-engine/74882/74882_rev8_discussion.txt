DESCRIPTION

Add a method to copy an OrderedStoredValue

When we have to create a copy of an OrderedStoredValue in soft
deletes, we do not have the luxury of creating the copy from an
Item object. Hence we need a way to copy it from the existing
OrderedStoredValue object.

Soft deleted need a copy of OrderedStoredValue when the
OrderedStoredValue object being deleted needs to be around for the
concurrent point-in-time snapshot (backfill).
