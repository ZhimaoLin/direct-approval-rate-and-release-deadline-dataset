DESCRIPTION

Modify multi_bucket perf test to accept threads/buckets as parameters

The existing multi bucket perf test has 1 thread per bucket. If
we break that relationship I can run 1 bucket with many threads
and we can see how we perform when a vbucket is under contention.

Line:157, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> I know you're not the first to add stuff here, but it feels like the function is getting sufficiently big that a usage comment might be in order. 

Or perhaps just rename id to key_prefix will be sufficent for now? :)

Line:180, tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Please revert - note the "Failed to add"... string is the second parameter of check()
