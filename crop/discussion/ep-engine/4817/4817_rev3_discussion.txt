DESCRIPTION

Integration of checkpoint support into the persistence module.

The flusher gets persistence tasks by grabing all the items from
its current cursor position in the checkpoint datastructure for each
vbucket, and then performs the further optimization, and finally
places them into the outgoing queue.
