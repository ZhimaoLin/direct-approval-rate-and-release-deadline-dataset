DESCRIPTION

ep_store_test: Use the correct dbname instead of 'test'

While EventuallyPersistentStoreTest declares a test_dbname variable,
and attempts to delete any files in this directory at the start of the
run, the variable isn't added to the actual config string pased into
EPEngine, resulting in us using the default dbname ('test'), and hence
failing to delete any previous data files.

Fix by adding the dbname to the test config.
