DESCRIPTION

MB-9105 Closed the open checkpoint upon receiving snapshot request

If a given UPR client requests a snapshot, this change closes the
current open checkpoint and open a new checkpoint if necessary.
In this way, we can provide the snapshot upto a given closed
checkpoint for the UPR client.

We confirmed from all UPR producer related unit tests that they
close the open checkpoint correctly and stream items upto that
checkpoint.
