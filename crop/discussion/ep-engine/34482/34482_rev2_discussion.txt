DESCRIPTION

MB-9105 Close the open checkpoint upon receiving snapshot request

If a given UPR client requests a snapshot, this change closes the
current open checkpoint and open a new checkpoint if necessary.
In this way, we can provide the snapshot upto a given closed
checkpoint for the UPR client.

We confirmed from all UPR producer related unit tests that they
close the open checkpoint correctly and stream items upto that
checkpoint.

Patch Set 2:

Verified this change through the existing UPR producer tests. That's why I didn't add a new unit test.
