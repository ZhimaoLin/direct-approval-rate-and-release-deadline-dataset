DESCRIPTION

MB-18452: [BP] Force DcpConsumer processor task to yield

Introduce a config tunable that limits how many iterations a core loop of the
Processor task can perform. This prevents the task from sitting an running for
as long as there's data without allowing another task to run.

Backported version of b568600388b8f9ecc84055472883cdcc82ebedba that provides
less refactoring.

Regression test is part of future b5686003 patch.
