DESCRIPTION

Move more unit tests into the ep_unit_tests binary

For GTest-style tests we have created a single test binary
(ep-engine_ep_unit_tests) to link all the tests into. This has the
advantage of not having to compile different variants of our source
files for multiple different test binaries (which is partly a
limitation / 'feature' of CMake's dependancy calculation).

However not all tests are in this binary. This patch moves an
additional 3 test suites - checkpoint, defragmenter & vbucket - into
the single binary. This speeds up our build time, and also removes a
bunch of duplicated boilerplate test setup code.
