DESCRIPTION

mc-kvstore TAP handler return positive rowid values for couchDB items

mc-kvstore TAPResponse handler deals with the stream of items
from couchDB (e.g., Initial warmup, TAP backfill), and should return
positive rowid values for those items to the ep-engine. Otherwise,
items with negative rowid values won't be purged in response to
deletion requests from clients.

Obviously, we can make rowid optional at compile time, depending on
the underlying storage engine. For example, rowid is not necessary
if couchDB is used as the storage engine, and consequently memory
usage can be reduced by eight bytes per item on 64bit machines.
