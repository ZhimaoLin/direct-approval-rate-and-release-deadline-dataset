DESCRIPTION

MB-20716: Ensure DCP connections in EWOULDBLOCK are unpaused on bucket delete

When a bucket delete occurs, memcached notifies the deleted engine via
the ON_DELETE_BUCKET callback, which in turn calls
DCPConnmap::shutdownAllConnections(). This correctly shuts down all
the DCP streams associated with DCP connections, however if any of
these DCP connections are in the EWOULDBLOCK state - i.e. the frontend
is waiting for a notify_IO_complete call to "wake" them up, then the
frontend will be blocked waiting for a notify_IO_complete which will
never arrive.

This behaviour is essentially a latent bug, however prior to the fix
for MB-20549, memcached would (incorrectly) call signalIfIdle on
connections in the EWOULDBLOCK state, forcing them to wake up. With
that fix in place this longer occurs.

The solution here is to explictly unpause all producer connections
when all streams are closed.
