Line:87, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> also here - is it 5k or 2k ?

Line:96, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> These also need updating.

Line:121, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> The 2k and 5000 here don't match.

Line:130, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> I assume this should be 5000?
