DESCRIPTION

MB-22013: Add access scanner benchmark

Adds google benchmark in to ep-engine to use in the access scanner
benchmark.

Adds a memory tracker for benchmarks which is a simpler version of
MemoryTracker that also tracks the max total allocation.

Benchmarks the memory overhead of the accessScanner by filling the
vbucket with some varied number of items and then running the
accessScanner sequentially.

Example output:

$ ./ep_engine_benchmarks
Run on (8 X 2200 MHz CPU s)

Line:32, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> You shouldn't need this in the setup - any previous test should clean itself up in its TearDown. See the evp_store_single_threaded_tests

Line:83, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> Given it's a singleton it's probably not necessary to have a local pointer to it.

Line:143, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> Not sure we want to introduce this additional complexity of the `willScheduleOther` param. What are the differences between the two "Generating access log" tasks - could we not use some explicit property of them (or maybe rename one)?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:83, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> We do cast it, so I think it's probably useful to have it here. It's what we do in the evp_store_single_threaded tests
