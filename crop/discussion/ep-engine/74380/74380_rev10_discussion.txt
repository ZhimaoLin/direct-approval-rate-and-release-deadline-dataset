DESCRIPTION

MB-22013: Add access scanner benchmark

Adds google benchmark in to ep-engine to use in the access scanner
benchmark.

Adds a memory tracker for benchmarks which is a simpler version of
MemoryTracker that also tracks the max total allocation.

Benchmarks the memory overhead of the accessScanner by filling the
vbucket with some varied number of items and then letting the engine run
for 2 seconds.
