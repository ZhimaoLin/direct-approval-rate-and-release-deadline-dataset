DESCRIPTION

Reset TAP cursors upon resetting a vbucket.

When a given vbucket is reset, simply reset all of its TAP cursors
instead of removing them from its checkpoint manager. The problem
of removing them is that when the client invokes "flush_all", we
still should maintain all the TAP cursors on each vbucket.
Otherwise, replication will be broken if the client loads data after
calling "flush_all" API.

Line:687, checkpoint.cc -> Agree. As long as the function's logic is correct, let's push this change though. I will push another change soon for this.
