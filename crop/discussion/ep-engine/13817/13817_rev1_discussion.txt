DESCRIPTION

mb-4857 prevent to free object prematurely

InvalidItemDbPager is allocated in the constructor. And it will be
used right after warmup. And it is freed in the initialize(). If
dispatcher schedules the task ahead of flusher task, the original
object will be freed prematurely before it is referenced again after
warmup. We use share_ptr to keep honest of object pointer references.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

None of the manifests we've got reference branch-20 (and ep-engine doesn't have such a branch).. (branch-2.0.xml and branch-1.8.xml tries to grab the branch named "master", and the 2.0dp4 use a given hash)... I would expect this commit to go to _MASTER_. see: https://github.com/membase/manifest

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure what this means? ^^
