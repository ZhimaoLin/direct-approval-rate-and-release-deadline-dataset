Line:77, management/cbepctl -> Is the IP address / port the only root cause of the timeout issue? The timeout can be caused by other reasons (e.g., the operation takes too much time because of heavy swap).

Line:77, management/cbepctl -> Yes, the purpose of message was to alert the user to check their arguments on the command line since invalid arguments is a possibility. There isn't a way to determine if the server is slow or has timed out. What do you advise here?

Line:77, management/cbepctl -> Then, let's rephrase it like 

"Please check list of arguments (e.g., IP address, port number) passed or the connectivity to a server to be connected."
