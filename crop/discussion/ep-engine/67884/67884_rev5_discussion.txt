DESCRIPTION

MB-20869: Add new stat to fix intermittent test_access_scanner failure

In test_access_scanner the check that the number of non-resident items
was less than 6% of the total is incorrect - it was using integer
division (6/100) and hence the RHS of the check was always zero, which
would always succeed. Fix the check so it calculates the percentage
correctly.

Additionally we did not wait for the previous AccessScanner run to
finalize - which meant that the second start of the access acanner
could fail to start (and consequently we would timeout with the
message:

    Exceeded maximum wait time of 60000000us waiting for stat
    'ep_num_access_scanner_runs' to be greater or equal than 8 -
    aborting.

To solve this, add a new 'ep_alog_running' stat which returns true if
the if Access Scanner task is running. Query this stat to wait for the
Access Scanner to stop before moving to the next iteration.

Note that as the stat is set /after/ we snooze the AccessScanner,
there is no longer a race if the test attempts to wake the task before
it returns from run() - as the ExecutorPool will immediately wake it
when it returns.
