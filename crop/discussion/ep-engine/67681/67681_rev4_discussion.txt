DESCRIPTION

MB-20697: ep_testsuite: restore deleted DB dir before cleanup

In some environments (seen on Windows VM), the regression test for
MB-20697 can hang forever during cleanup due to the writer thread being
stuck in an infinite loop trying to flush to disk.

To address this, re-create the database directory before shutting down
EPStore (after the test is complete).
