DESCRIPTION

MB-23267: Add ability to hide inapplicable config options

This is expressed by declaring the requirements for a particular config
option in configuration.json e.g.,

"ephemeral_full_policy": {
    ...
    "requirements": {
        "bucket_type": "ephemeral"
    }
}

This example prevents "ephemeral_full_policy" from being listed in stats
or altered from cbepctl if "bucket_type" is not "ephemeral".

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Probably more stuff, but given it doesn't compile I stopped partway through.

Line:65, src/configuration.cc -> You're using a plural there, but the type is singular.

Line:381, src/configuration.h -> Given you never use a concrete instance of a Requirement class here, you can move this to the .cc and just add a forward declaration (this also removes the need for boost in the header).

Line:458, src/configuration.h -> Order seems odd here - keep the methods together, put the types somewhere else (traditionally at the start of the class before methods).

Line:324, tools/genconfig.cc -> Please document this function.
