DESCRIPTION

MB-23267: Add ability to hide inapplicable config options

This is expressed by declaring the requirements for a particular config
option in configuration.json e.g.,

"ephemeral_full_policy": {
    ...
    "requirements": {
        "bucket_type": "ephemeral"
    }
}

This example prevents "ephemeral_full_policy" from being listed in stats
if "bucket_type" is not "ephemeral".

Line:17, src/configuration_impl.h -> Please add a header comment describing this file.

Line:32, src/configuration_impl.h -> You should #include <vector> and <string> in this file

Line:37, src/configuration.h -> This is also not used in this file.

Line:368, src/configuration.h -> I don't believe this needs to be in here either (I don't see any references to it in this header). That would allow you to remove #include <set>
