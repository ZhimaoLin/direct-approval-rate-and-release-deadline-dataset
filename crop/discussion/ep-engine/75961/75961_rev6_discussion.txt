DESCRIPTION

MB-23267: Add ability to hide inapplicable config options

This is expressed by declaring the requirements for a particular config
option in configuration.json e.g.,

"ephemeral_full_policy": {
    ...
    "requirements": {
        "bucket_type": "ephemeral"
    }
}

This example prevents "ephemeral_full_policy" from being listed in stats
if "bucket_type" is not "ephemeral".
