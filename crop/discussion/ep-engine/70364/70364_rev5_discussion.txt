DESCRIPTION

MB-21763: Update ep-engine for Collection Aware Engine API

Make changes to accept item_key, the collection status has no affect.

Mostly our test code calls engine functions directly, so lots of
churn there.

(6 comments)

Line:231, src/ep_engine.h -> Nit: More consistent to use key.size() (as per line 240) - and probably easier if you change this to a different class later.

Line:1513, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Probably worth including the method name in here, otherwise it;ll be hard to track down.

Line:1518, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Same

Line:236, tests/ep_test_apis.h -> Do we need both of these? Wouldn't a single function taking a const_char_buffer suffice?

Line:72, tests/module_tests/evp_engine_test.cc -> Should probably change the Item creation to at line 68 to pass in vbid, so this behaves at it used to.

Line:26, src/stored-value.h -> If you're changing this, should probably directly use the main one in platform.

Line:231, src/ep_engine.h -> Done

Line:72, tests/module_tests/evp_engine_test.cc -> oops

Line:26, src/stored-value.h -> hmm, think this needs to be engine.h now, will trial the correct include...
