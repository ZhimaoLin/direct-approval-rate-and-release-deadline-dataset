DESCRIPTION

MB-21763: Update ep-engine for Collection Aware Engine API

Make changes to accept item_key, the collection status has no affect.

Mostly our test code calls engine functions directly, so lots of
churn there.

(1 comment)

Line:294, src/ep_engine.h -> Once i've rebased and refreshed the std::string removal patch, i think i'll pass DocKey right through (it has the same non-owning property of const_char_buffer).  Trying to pass DocKey in place of const_char_buffer in this patch is a bit messy as DocKey can't be created from std::string (without lots of work adding DocNamespace::Default...) but const_char_buffer can be created from std::string 

i.e.
std::string k("key");
hashtable->del(k); // void del(const_char_buffer key);
