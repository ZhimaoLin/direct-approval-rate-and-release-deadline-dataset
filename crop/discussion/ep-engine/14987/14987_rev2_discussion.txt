DESCRIPTION

Change BackFillVisitor to use dedicated dispatcher object

This might be a dedicated object,or might be the same as one of our
other dispatcher objects.

This means that backfill tasks (which can be long-running) will never
block bgFetch tasks from running, and thereby improve cluster
availability during rebalance/backfill operations.
