DESCRIPTION

MB-17653 (1/2): Add unit test for Stream::getItemsRemaining

Add a unit test for ActiveStream::getItemsRemaining() which
demonstrates the issue described in the MB. Essentially the issue is
that getItemsRemaining() doesn't consider de-dupliciton or meta items
when determining how many items remain to be sent.

Note test currently fails, hence going in 'disabled'. See next patch
for fix and enablement.

In this instance they all get de-duplicated down to one item in the checkpoint. 1000 was chosen to keep the sequence numbers obvious when debugging / developing, but yes I could probably drop it down to 10 now I know it works ;)
