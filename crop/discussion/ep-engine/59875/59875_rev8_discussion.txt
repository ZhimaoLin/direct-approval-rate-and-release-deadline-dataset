DESCRIPTION

MB-17653 (1/2): Add unit test for Stream::getItemsRemaining

Add a unit test for ActiveStream::getItemsRemaining() which
demonstrates the issue described in the MB. Essentially the issue is
that getItemsRemaining() doesn't consider de-duplication or meta items
when determining how many items remain to be sent.

Note test currently fails, hence going in 'disabled'. See next patch
for fix and enablement.
