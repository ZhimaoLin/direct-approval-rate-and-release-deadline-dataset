Line:165, src/upr-consumer.cc -> Let's change this log message to:

LOG(EXTENSION_LOG_WARNING, "%s Flush failed for vbucket %d because the opaque is invalid %d", logHeader(), vbucket, opaque);

Line:387, src/ep_engine.h -> I don't see this function in ep_engine.cc. Was this left in accidentally?

Line:2242, src/ep.cc -> This diskFlushAll atomic is used for all vbuckets so it won't work for this case. I'll go over this with Chiyoung to figure out the best way to handle this.
