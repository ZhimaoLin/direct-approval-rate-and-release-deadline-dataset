Line:905, src/tapconnection.h -> As TAP producer / UPR producer overrides this function, I don't think we need to make it as a virtual function here. We already have a default implementation from ConnHandler.

Line:2256, src/ep.cc -> This will cause the flusher to reset all vbuckets instead of a single vbucket.

We can re-instate this change if we decide to add this feature.
