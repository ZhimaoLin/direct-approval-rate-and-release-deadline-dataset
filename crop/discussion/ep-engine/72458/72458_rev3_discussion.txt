An extension to the DocKey class that adds the number of bytes
which maybe a collection, i.e. how many bytes are before the prefix.

 - len = 15
 - collection len = 4 (if separator is : then beer is the collection)

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:67, src/collections/collections_dockey.h -> I'm not sure if it's valid to access the first element if the string is empty. Could you instead just check that separator.size() > 0 ?

Line:77, src/collections/collections_dockey.h -> I *think* you can use std::search (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/search) for this:

 return std::search(key.data(), key.data() - separator.size(),
                    separator.begin(), separator.end());

Might need some extra check for the nullptr case.

Line:80, src/collections/collections_dockey.h -> Not that it probably matters given alignment, but could we get away with something shorter? (I assume the whole keylen cannot exceed ~250 bytes?)
