DESCRIPTION

MB-5179 Disable the fast warmup for MCKVStore by default.

The fast warmup hasn't been tested thoroughly by interleaving
lots of individual background fetches for GET and replication.
We also observed the bad performance behavior on both warmup
and background fetches because we simply turns on the engine right
after loading keys and their metadata. We disable the fast warmup
by default until we make some improvements on it.
