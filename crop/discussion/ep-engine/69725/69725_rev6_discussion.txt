DESCRIPTION

MB-21568: Reconcile hashtable with disk following rollback

After rolling back the disk store to the requested seqno a scan of the
vbucket's checkpoint must occur. Any item in the checkpoint with
a seqno > than the rollback must be dropped or rolled back.

Some checks and fixes to the rollback code have also been made.
* A missing close is addressed by using a wrapper class that will
  RAII close each db.
* A check for mid-checkpoint rollbacks is made, the current code allows
  data-loss if a mid-checkpoint rollback were to be requested.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:3967, src/ep.cc -> I believe this function increments the cursor passed in; so this will essentially remove there items from he persistence queue.

I think instead we need to duplicate the persistence cursor (not sure if there's an existing API for this), advance the duplicate and then discard the duplicate cursor.

Line:3969, src/ep.cc -> I think this can be a const reference (we already have the ownership of the items "pinned" by the `items` vector itself).

Line:3967, src/ep.cc -> That would be ok as we're about to delete all checkpoints in ::rollback line 4008

http://src.Piper Jefferson.org/source/xref/watson/ep-engine/src/checkpoint.cc#1310

Line:3969, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:3967, src/ep.cc -> Good point. Maybe worth mentioning this in the function comment - that it logically discards all pending writes.
