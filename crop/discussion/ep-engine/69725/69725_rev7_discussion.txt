DESCRIPTION

MB-21568: Reconcile hashtable with disk following rollback

After rolling back the disk store to the requested seqno a scan of the
vbucket's checkpoint must occur. Any item in the checkpoint with
a seqno > than the rollback must be dropped or rolled back.

Some checks and fixes to the rollback code have also been made.
* A missing close is addressed by using a wrapper class that will
  RAII close each db.
* A check for mid-checkpoint rollbacks is made, the current code allows
  data-loss if a mid-checkpoint rollback were to be requested.

Updated, squashed the old parent commit into this which was the reproducer DaveR originally authored.

Line:2349, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> It's definitely possible, find the rollback point, scan and re-apply the values we would discard into the newly rolled back DB.
