DESCRIPTION

MB-21568: Reconcile hashtable with disk following rollback

After rolling back the disk store to the requested seqno a scan of the
vbucket's checkpoint must occur. Any item in the checkpoint with
a seqno > than the rollback must be dropped or rolled back.

+ A missing close is addressed by using a wrapper class that will
  RAII close each file opened in the rollback code.
