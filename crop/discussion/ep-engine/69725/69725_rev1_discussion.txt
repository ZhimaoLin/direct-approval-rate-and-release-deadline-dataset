DESCRIPTION

MB-21568: Reconcile hashtable with disk following rollback

After rolling back the disk store to the requested seqno a scan of the
vbuckets hashtable must occur to ensure mutations in the hashtable
which were written with a seqno above the rollback seqno are fixed up.

This means some StoredValues will be set to a previous value or
deleted.

Some checks and fixes to the rollback code have also been made.
* A missing close is addressed by using a wrapper class that will
  RAII close each db.
* A check for mid-checkpoint rollbacks is made, the current code allows
  data-loss if a mid-checkpoint rollback were to be requested.
