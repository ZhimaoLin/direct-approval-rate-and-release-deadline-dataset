DESCRIPTION

Perf: Separate out diskinfo stats from diskinfo detail stats

The existing diskinfo stats calls set-up the DiskStatVisitor and the
visitBucket function is invoked every VBucket.  However the function
only does something useful if detailed diskstats are requested.

This patch creates a separate function for a diskinfo (non-detailed)
stats calls.

The patch also adds the diskinfo and diskinfo-detail stats calls
to the ep_perfsuite.  The results below show the performance of the
stats call before and then after moving into a separate function.

Before:

                                Percentile
                  Median     95th     99th  Std Dev

AllStats         275.256  413.017  497.107   53.738

After:
