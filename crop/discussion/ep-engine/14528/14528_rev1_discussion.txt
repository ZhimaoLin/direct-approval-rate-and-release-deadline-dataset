Line:20, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Shouldn't this be sizeof(the struct that goes here)?

Line:20, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> There is no struct defined for meta data in couchkvstore and libcouchstore. libcouchstore expects the pointer to byte array  for meta data. My later changeset actually defines the struct for the meta data, but didn't upload yet.

Line:20, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> OK, good to take care of it.  If a lower level wants an allocation of a certain size, it should be able to say how much, otherwise it just looks like magic.  :)
