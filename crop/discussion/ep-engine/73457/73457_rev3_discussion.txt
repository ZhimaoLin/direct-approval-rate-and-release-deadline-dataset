DESCRIPTION

Cleanup #include usage in headers

'Include what you use':

- remove unnecessary #include directives from source files, focusing
  on removing from header files (where they can cause unnecessary
  rebuilding.

- Move #includes from .h to .cc where applicable.

- Use forward declarions instead of #include'ing the whole header
  where possible.

- Remove unnecessary inlining of non-hot / non-trivial code by moving
  to .cc files.
