DESCRIPTION

MB-24055: Change ht_size to same value as ns_server (3079)

In preparation for removing the default value for ht_size from
ns_server where it currently is set (so KV-Engine owns the default),
change the value in configuration.json from 3 to 3079 - matching
ns_server's current default.

Note that this value is expected to be subsequently changed (reduced)
again as part of MB-24055 (to reduce memory overhead).
