Line:29, src/ep_engine.cc -> This is what clang-format rearranged these includes to be

Line:29, src/ep_engine.cc -> Note what clang-format tries to do is sort alphabetically in each paragraph. There's a whole bunch of includes here, but they /should/ be ordered as per https://github.com/daverigby/memcached/blob/coding_standard/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-style

Line:5909, src/ep_engine.cc -> I don't think this is necessary - cJSON_Get...() is just looking up an element within the tree of JSON objects, and so we shouldn't be taking ownership of that sub-element here (given it's already owned by the `json` variable.
