DESCRIPTION

ep_testsuite: Split basic tests into own suite

Create a new 'basic' testsuite which we will move basic get/set etc
operations into from the large ep_testsuite.

This patch only includes the infrastrucutre changes and a couple of
tests. More will be moved over in subsequent patches.

Patch Set 12: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:400, CMakeLists.txt -> Do you now want to create cmdline so can run  something like "make basictests".

I have found that useful with the DCP tests.

Line:1, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Does new file need copyright message?

Patch Set 12:

(2 comments)

Line:400, CMakeLists.txt -> When I do what I just run `ctest -R basic` - and that saves maintaining extra code in the CMake files.

(Otherwise we'd end up with ADD_CUSTOM_TARGETS for every one of the 16 or so tests we have.

Line:1, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> Good catch - will add.
