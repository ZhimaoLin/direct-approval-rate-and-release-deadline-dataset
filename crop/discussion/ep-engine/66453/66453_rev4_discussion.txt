Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Couple of minor comments, mostly looks good.

One suggestion (feel free to ignore if you disagree) - maybe we can break this into at least a small handful of merges? For one I'm worried about the risks of mis-merges given the size of it. For two if we ever have to `git bisect` across this it'll be essentially useless.

Given you've probably got `rerere` data in your local world, what about maybe splitting into say 3-4 chunks?

Line:33, src/executorthread.h -> Strictly speaking we should keep this in here, as there are instances of RelaxedAtomic in this file.

Line:93, src/fakes/fake_executorpool.h -> Can this be simplified to call cancelAll() ?

will split to aid future bisect

Line:93, src/fakes/fake_executorpool.h -> yep, will do so
