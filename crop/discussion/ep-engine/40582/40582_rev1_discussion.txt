DESCRIPTION

MB-11941: Update current vbucket snapshot when receiving tap items

We need to update the vbucket snapshot in order to support upgrades
because we initially have a tap stream and then move to a dcp stream.
Since tap doesn't support snapshots we can just set the current snapshot
to be the same as the seqno for that item.
