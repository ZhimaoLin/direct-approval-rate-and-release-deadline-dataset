DESCRIPTION

Add back the -a argument in cbstats, but hide it

The -a argument is used by cbcollectinfo so we can't just
get rid of it.

This reverts commit f71fd4b9b8555052bedce67b4d4705b20418c783.

Patch Set 1:

I'm not sure why this needs to be reverted and hidden. If we need to support "-a", then we should export it, otherwise abandon it. Does the tool or support team use this option?
