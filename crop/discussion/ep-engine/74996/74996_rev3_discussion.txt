DESCRIPTION

[Ephemeral] Disable accessScanner in config

Note that the access scanner is already not created for Ephemeral
buckets - this change just ensures that in the config it's shown as
'disabled' so as to not mislead the user.

Line:78, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> Config should be generated such that this should be false ?
Part of default config for ephemeral buckets ?
Maybe part of another task? then a ticket ("default ephemeral config is set correctly") to track that ?

Line:78, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> Problem is we don't (yet) have support to predicate the default values in the config on a other configuration parameters, and I don't really want ns_server specifying a big list of extra "default" options for Ephemeral, when they are really our own internal options.

I think for now this is fine - we can enhance the way our defaults work in configuration.json in future.
