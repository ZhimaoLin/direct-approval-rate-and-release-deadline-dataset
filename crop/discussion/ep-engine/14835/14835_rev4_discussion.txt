DESCRIPTION

MB-5066 Add an extra state in the warmup logic

We need an extra state to test if we can use the access log
or not, otherwise we might exit the warmup phase too early
(if we don't have an access log and want to warm up from full dump)

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

This looks great. I got the compilation errors due to its dependent changeset.

Btw, I think we should backport this change to 1.8 branch once we merge it into the master.
