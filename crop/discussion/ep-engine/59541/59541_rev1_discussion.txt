DESCRIPTION

MB-17766: Incorrect ordering during ActiveStream's takeover-send phase

A race between the step() and ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask
can cause mutations to be queued into the readyQ after the
setVBucketState(active) message.

Here's the scenario in chronology:
1. ActiveStream::setVBucketStateAckRecieved()
2. transitionState(takeoverSend) => schedules ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask
3. manageConnections() notifies memcached about specific conn (max idle time: 5s)
4. ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask runs, gets all Items For Cursor
5. step() -> takeoverSendPhase() -> readyQ is empty
    => nextCheckpointItem() return false, as getNumItemsForCursor returns 0
    => setVbucketState(active) added to readyQ
6. ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask continues, adds mutations acquired into readyQ
    -> Note the mutations were acquired in step 4

On the new master, the vbucket is promoted to active state and then more
mutations are received from the old master. If there were front end ops
at this time, there could be an inconsistency in highSeqno or in worst
cases crashes in checkpoint manager due to highSeqno not belonging in
the designated range.

The fix here would be to acquire streamMutex for the length of
nextCheckpointItemTask() which is run by ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask,
so that no such incorrect ordering of DCP messages takes place.
