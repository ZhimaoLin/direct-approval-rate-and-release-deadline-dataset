DESCRIPTION

MB-23714: Move VBucketPtr to std::shared_ptr

Change the VBucketPtr type definition so that we now use a std::shared_ptr

VBucket now inherits from shared_from_this, the only use-case is
EphemeralVBucket when it constructs the DCPBackfillMemory object with a shared
pointer to this. Arguably EphemeralVBucket could inherit
std::enable_shared_from_this and remove the static_cast, but feels cleaner for
future changes that may need to do similar from VBucket or EPVBucket.
