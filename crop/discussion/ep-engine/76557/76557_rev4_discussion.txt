DESCRIPTION

MB-23714: Make VBucketPtr a std::shared_ptr

Change the VBucketPtr type definition so that we now use a std::shared_ptr

VBucket now inherits from shared_from_this yet the only current use-case is
EphemeralVBucket where it constructs the DCPBackfillMemory object with a shared
pointer to this. Arguably EphemeralVBucket could inherit
std::enable_shared_from_this and remove the static_cast, but feels that the
base class inherits enable_shared_from_this.

Line:36, src/dcp/backfill_memory.h -> I think it's more correct to pass this by value (from my reading of http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-resource).
