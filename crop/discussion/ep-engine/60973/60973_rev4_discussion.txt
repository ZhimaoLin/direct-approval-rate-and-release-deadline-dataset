are time synchronized or not. This would indicate if a mutation
generated would be eligible for LWW conflict resolution

(10 comments)

Line:539, src/ep_engine.cc -> Do we need to support changing this config at runtime? If so, then we need to update each vbucket's config too. Otherwise, we don't need this stmt.

Line:6947, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can you put some brief comments to explain the first negative case? e.g., trying to get the adjusted time for a non-existent vbucket 1 ...

Line:6956, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Ditto

Line:6972, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Ditto

Line:6979, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Ditto

Line:248, src/vbucket.h -> time_sync is no longer used in this function. Please remove it.

Line:438, src/vbucket.h -> Can we rename this function to something like 'convertStringToTimeSyncConfig'

Line:3565, src/ep.cc -> Can we consolidate these two predicates (line 3563 and 3565) into one as they execute the same logic (i.e., enabling LWW)?

Line:3567, src/ep.cc -> I'm a little confused with this logic. If timeSyncConfig is ENABLED_WITH_DRAFT, then we shouldn't enable LWW? Can you put some comments?

Line:1485, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Can you put some inlined comments to explain what 1000 and 0x00 mean?

Line:539, src/ep_engine.cc -> At this point at least, we don't need to support this. But in the spock timeframe, we may need to think about dynamic updates.

Line:3567, src/ep.cc -> With the ENABLED_WITH_DRIFT option, mutations becomes eligible for LWW only when a valid drift value has been set. A valid drift value happens to be anything other than the initial drift. Because according to XDCR the initial drift value is unrealistic and until a valid value is set, drift will not be applied. I shall add some comments to clarify this.

Line:539, src/ep_engine.cc -> OK, then I wouldn't add this for Watson give the fact that the LWW requirements are not finalized.
