DESCRIPTION

MB-23936: Use Threadlocal variables to accumulate stats

Currently when we allocate/deallocate memory, we update the per bucket
variable `totalMemory`. Mutiple threads contend on this variable heavily
as mem allocation/deallocation happen very often. The primary idea of
this commit is to maintain threadlocal mem counters for each bucket and
merge it to the `totalMemory` once the local counter reaches a threshold
either based on size or no.of times the local counter has been updated.
