DESCRIPTION

MB-23936: Use Threadlocal variables to accumulate stats

Currently when we allocate/deallocate memory, we update the per bucket
variable `totalMemory`. Mutiple threads contend on this variable heavily
as mem allocation/deallocation happen often. The primary idea of
this commit is to maintain threadlocal mem counters for each bucket and
merge it to the `totalMemory` once the local counter reaches a threshold
either based on size or no.of times the local counter has been updated.
This does show a notable increase in overall performance.

Limitations:
-----------
- We create one thread local variable per bucket. Different OS'es seem
  to enforce different limits on the no.of tlv. Although we have a hard
  limit of 10 buckets, I'm noting this here for future reference.
  -> [NetBSD:256 Linux:1024 OSX:512 Windows:1088]

- Windows does not seem to provide an api for releasing the mem
  allocated for a thread-local on thread exit in a way like pthreads do.
  So there will be a small leak of about (3*long) on every bucket
  unload.

- Valgrind might say that the unit tests have leaks on the
  threadlocals. This is because, in the tests, bucket init happens on
  the main thread & when main thread exits the program it does not
  call pthread_exit, so the dtors are not called.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

Still needs the documentation (dpcs/stats.org) updating, and some quantitative numbers adding to the commit message.

Patch Set 8:

I'm adding the some perf data to the commit message. Had a discussion with Rigby today & here is why I was  hesitant to add perf numbers to a commit message. xxx@xxx.xxx Pope & others]

- The tests were done 2-3 weeks back after which the master has moved. I felt that it would be difficult  to guarantee that this change would give the same numbers over  the master at the time of merge.

- Any sort of benchmark is tied to the machine/network spec/setup  in which it is done. We being opensource I thought it would be difficult for external devs to reproduce the result to show precise numbers.
