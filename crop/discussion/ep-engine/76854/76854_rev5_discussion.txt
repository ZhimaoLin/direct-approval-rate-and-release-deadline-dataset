DESCRIPTION

MB-23936: Use Threadlocal variables to accumulate stats

Currently when we allocate/deallocate memory, we update the per bucket
variable `totalMemory`. Mutiple threads contend on this variable heavily
as mem allocation/deallocation happen often. The primary idea of
this commit is to maintain threadlocal mem counters for each bucket and
merge it to the `totalMemory` once the local counter reaches a threshold
either based on size or no.of times the local counter has been updated.
This does show a notable increase in overall performance.

Limitations:
-----------
- We create one thread local variable per bucket. Different OS'es seem
  to enforce different limits on the no.of tlv. Although we have a hard
  limit of 10 buckets, I'm noting this here for future reference.
  -> [NetBSD:256 Linux:1024 OSX:512 Windows:1088]

- Windows does not seem to provide an api for releasing the mem
  allocated for a thread-local on thread exit in a way like pthreads do.
  So there will be a small leak of about (3*long) on every bucket
  unload.

- Valgrind might say that the unit tests have leaks on the
  threadlocals. This is because, in the tests, bucket init happens on
  the main thread & when main thread exits the program it does not
  call pthread_exit, so the dtors are not called.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Line:470, configuration.json -> The max still needs increasing as discussed.

Line:481, configuration.json -> Same

Line:6664, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> whitespace

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think for this, we should see if Boost::thread_local solves this issue. If so I think we should migrate to Boost's implementation (in a follow-up patch) to address this. (The 3-word leak isn't /so/ bad, but it will potentially mask other issues if we have "known" memory leaks).

Line:6664, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Done - This is why automatic style fixes are better for us.

Line:6377, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done - Note that this is being identified only in the 5th patch while the issue was there since the 1st patch. This is why automatic style fixes are better for us.

Line:6664, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Personally I have my editor setup to strip trailing whitespace.

Line:6377, src/ep_engine.cc -> You'll find I added a comment on v2 (the first one I looked at) which you said you'd resolved ;)

As I've said before, I'm all for automated checkers. Clang-format can't do this one (IIRC), a proposal to fix it welcome :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:6377, src/ep_engine.cc -> ;) That was for different line . In any case once we get clang-format to do everything else for us, one of us can pick this one out :)
