DESCRIPTION

MB-23936: Use Threadlocal variables to accumulate stats

Currently when we allocate/deallocate memory, we update the per bucket
variable `totalMemory`. Mutiple threads contend on this variable heavily
as mem allocation/deallocation happen often. The primary idea of
this commit is to maintain threadlocal mem counters for each bucket and
merge it to the `totalMemory` once the local counter reaches a threshold
either based on size or no.of times the local counter has been updated.

Performance Improvement (30%-35%):
--------------------------------
- Tests were run on a cluster of 2 nodes spec: 40 core/2.2 Ghz/64G memory
- On a high throughput read heavy test of 256B values we noticed a
  [30%] increase in total ops (3.5M ops/s)
- On a similar write heavy test, we noticed a [35%] increase in ops (1.9M ops/s)

Limitations:
-----------
- We create one thread local variable per bucket. Different OS'es seem
  to enforce different limits on the no.of tlv. Although we have a hard
  limit of 10 buckets, I'm noting this here for future reference.
  -> [NetBSD:256 Linux:1024 OSX:512 Windows:1088]

- Because we merge local mem stats after certain thresholds are reached, there
  might be some small delays in reflecting the precise memory usage of a
  bucket. On an active system, the delay should be minimal and not noticeable.

- Windows does not seem to provide an api for releasing the mem
  allocated for a thread-local on thread exit in a way like pthreads do.
  So there will be a small leak of about (3*long) on every bucket
  unload on each thread.

- Valgrind might say that the unit tests have leaks on the
  threadlocals. This is because, in the tests, bucket init happens on
  the main thread & when main thread exits the program it does not
  call pthread_exit, so the dtors are not called.
