DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Unit test to demonstrate notifications can go missing.

The test serially interleaves ConnMap::notifyPausedConnection into the
path of ConnMap::notifyAllPausedConnections so that we show a second
notification goes missing because of the ordering of clearing
the Notifiable::notificationScheduled atomic bool.

Test is currently marked as disabled because the fix is coming
from downstream via merge commits.
