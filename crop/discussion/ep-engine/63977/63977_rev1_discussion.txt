DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Unit test to demonstrate notifications can go missing.

The test serially interleaves ConnMap::notifyPausedConnection into the
path of ConnMap::notifyAllPausedConnections so that we show a second
notification goes missing because of the ordering of clearing
the Notifiable::notificationScheduled atomic bool.

Test is currently marked as disabled because the fix is coming
from downstream via merge commits.

Fix -> http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/63934/

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:768, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Maybe cleaner to make this a static method on NotifyTest

Line:771, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Maybe worth mentioning the MB name in the title (or at least in the comment).

Line:772, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> If you use a std::unique_ptr<> for this you can remove the need for the explicit delete at the end of the test.

Line:796, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Can we also add a copy of this earlier (checking for 1 callback) - I assume after line 790?

Similary, can also add a ASSERT_EQ(0, ...) before we start notifying (just to help debug if it ever fails).
