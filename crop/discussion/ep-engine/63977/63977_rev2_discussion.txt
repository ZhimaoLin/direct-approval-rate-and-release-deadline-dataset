DESCRIPTION

MB-19503: Unit test to demonstrate notifications can go missing.

The test serially interleaves ConnMap::notifyPausedConnection into the
path of ConnMap::notifyAllPausedConnections so that we show a second
notification goes missing because of the ordering of clearing
the Notifiable::notificationScheduled atomic bool.

Test is currently marked as disabled because the fix is coming
from downstream via merge commits.

Line:752, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Nit/Style: Indent initialiser lists by 4 spaces, then the colon and a space - e.g.

 ConnMapNotifyTest(EventuallyPersistentEngine& engine)
     : connMap(new MockDcpConnMap(engine)),
       callbacks(0) {
     connMap->initialize(DCP_CONN_NOTIFIER);

(This has the advantage that the statements in the constructor body don't have the same indent as initialiser list elements so they are more obvious).
