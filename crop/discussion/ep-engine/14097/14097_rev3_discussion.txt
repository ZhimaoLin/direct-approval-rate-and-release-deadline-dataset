DESCRIPTION

Maintain bg-fetch related stats per tap checkpoint state.

A tap checkpoint state is maintained per vbucket and needs to
include bg-fetch related stats as an item eviction is going to
be allowed for non-dirty items in the open checkpoint, which
consequently might require bg fetches in order to replicate
non-resident items through the tap checkpoint cursor.
