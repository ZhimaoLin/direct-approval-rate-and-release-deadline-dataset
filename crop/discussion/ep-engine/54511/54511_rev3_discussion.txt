DESCRIPTION

MB-16084: Save the taskId in the consumer context

Saving the taskId for the processer rather than the task,
ensures that there is no circular dependency between
shared_ptrs to each other, causing the destructors to not
be run.

Also ensure that the scheduled task is still cancelled in
the destructor of the consumer.
