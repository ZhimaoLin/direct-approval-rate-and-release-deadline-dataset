DESCRIPTION

MB-19086: Do not read from backfill if the scanBuffer is full

While backfilling, we want to limit the amount of bytes read in one
run of the backfill (for one vbucket). This commit address a bug in
that logic.

To test this we need to check how many times the backfill task runs.
To do this as part of the commit, code to read histogram stats in
ep_testsuite is added.

(7 comments)

Generally looks good, just a few minor comments.

Line:26, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Nit: Please keep in alphabetical order (i.e move down after <iostream>)

Line:66, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> These can be const references, to save copies for complex datatypes.

Line:69, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> (void) is invalid in C++ for an empty function argument list, this is actually C :)

Line:73, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> ditto

Line:77, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> ditto

Line:101, tests/ep_test_apis.h -> Maybe also document this?

Line:220, tests/ep_test_apis.h -> Maybe add a brief description to this - it wasn't immediately obvious to me what a "runtime" stat was (and that it's actually one of the histogram stats).
