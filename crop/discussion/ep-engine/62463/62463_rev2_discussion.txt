DESCRIPTION

MB-19086: Do not read from backfill if the scanBuffer is full

While backfilling, we want to limit the amount of bytes read in one
run of the backfill (for one vbucket). This commit address a bug in
that logic.

Could you add a testcase please?

Patch Set 2:

With the existing framework it is not possible to add a testcase for this easily. Because, the check makes a backfill pause temporarily when the scanBuffer is full. Then in next run it immediately backfills items as scanBuffer is empty again.
There is no way to  keep the backfill in this state immediately to check this.
We can maybe add a stat for number of times scanBuffer was full, but that is not very useful stat and I think it is an overkill just to add it for this test

Patch Set 2:

To write up a test case for this - couldn't you mock how backfill runs as we do for many test cases within the module dcp_tests?

Patch Set 2:

Not really because the behavior is transient when the backfill task is run. The effect of it is not seen directly by outer modules.
It is like the backfill task is trying to read 10MB. If the scanBuffer limit is 1MB, then it reads it in 10 runs. Without this fix (ignoring scanBuffer limit), backfill task reads 10MB in 1 run.
(Numbers used are not exact, are just for explanation)

The only way I can think of testing this is to check how many times the backfill task runs. I am working on getting timings stats in ep_testsuite
