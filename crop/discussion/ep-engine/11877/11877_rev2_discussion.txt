DESCRIPTION

Added tap cursor names and checkpoint position in checkpoint stats

The checkpoint stats does not show the list of tap cursors and the
checkpoint_id position held by the position. The only indicator
related to the cursor is num_tap_cursor. Having the list of cursor
names and position helps to perform validations for backups
