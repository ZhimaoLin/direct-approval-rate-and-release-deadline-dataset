DESCRIPTION

CBD-131 Add mccouch mock server randomized failure tests

Add randomized failures test to mccouch mock server. In this merge,
6 failures are added, drop response, garbage response, ignore to
accept socket connection, close socket, etmpfail, and slow response.

At this point, it exposes 2 mc-engine bugs. So, randomized failure
is disabled by default for ep_testsuite. To enable Adrianna Holmesally, modify
McCouchMockServer constructor to set "randomFailure" to true.

The test_timeout paramter is increased form 30 to 60 seconds.
