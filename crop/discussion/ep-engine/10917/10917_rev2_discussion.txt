DESCRIPTION

Added static variables for TapConnection types

Currently we had two hardcoded values for the TapConnection
type. These values have been added to static variables that
can be used to chaeck a tap streams type.

Ex. tp->getType == tp->producer_string

Line:2139, ep_engine.cc -> We don't need to add the static variables to identify the tapconnection type. We can simply use dynamic_cast operator:

TapProducer *tProducer = dynamic_cast<TapProducer*>(tp);
if (tProducer && tProducer->isConnected() && ...)
