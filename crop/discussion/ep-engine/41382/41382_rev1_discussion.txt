    CBSE-1350:  Fix deadlock in checkpoint persistence command

    We need to release the hpChkMutex before notifying memcached in
    order to prevent a deadlock. The deadlock occurs when the flusher
    trys to notify memcached of checkpoint persistence at the same
    time a memcached worker thread is trying to add a new checkpoint
    persistence request.

    MB-10962 Don't snooze the TAP connection notifier unnecessarily.

    There is a race in pausing and resuming the TAP connection
    notifier upon receiving a new mutation. To address this issue,
    This change adds a flag that indicates if there is a pending
    notification event for any TAP connections.
