DESCRIPTION

MB-18940: Make ExecutorPool::get() thread-safe

ExecutorPool::get() has a similar problem as
MemoryTracker::getInstance() (although not as bad) - there is a
potential data-race which could result in multiple ExecutorPools being
created.

The issue is that the 'instance' pointer is not atomic - this means
that the compiler /could/ reorder the assignment and object creation
so the object is assigned /before/ it is created. Paraphrasing from a
Dr Dobbs article[1] about double-checked locking:

    Singleton* Singleton::instance() {
       if (pInstance == 0) {
           Lock lock;
           if (pInstance == 0) {
               pInstance = // Step 3
                  operator new(sizeof(Singleton)); // Step 1
               new (pInstance) Singleton; // Step 2
           }
       }
       return pInstance;
    }

    ... consider the following sequence of events:

    * Thread A enters instance, performs the first test of pInstance,
      acquires the lock, and executes the statement made up of Steps 1
      and 3. It is then suspended. At this point, pInstance is not
      null, but no Singleton object has yet been constructed in the
      memory pInstance points to.

    * Thread B enters instance, determines that pInstance is not null,
      and returns it to instance's caller. The caller then
      dereferences the pointer to access the Singleton that, oops, has
      not yet been constructed.

Fix in the same way as MemoryTracker::getInstance() - make `instance`
be an atomic variable and perform the object creation using a
temporary variable; which ensures that the ordering is correct.
