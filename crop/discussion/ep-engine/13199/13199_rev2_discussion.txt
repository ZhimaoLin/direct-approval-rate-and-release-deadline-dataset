DESCRIPTION

Replica Read bug fix - invalid response after completion

This change fixed a bug where ep_engine wasn't returning a correct
response code, PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_SUCCESS, upon the successful
completion of CMD_GET_REPLICA.

Per review recommendation I modified existing get replica test cases
so that each verifies its binary protocol response code after running
the CMD_GET_REPLICA command. Also I added a new test case that checks an
error response from running the command with invalid key id:

test_get_replica_invalid_key : expects PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET
response
