DESCRIPTION

MB-3721 Do not release a closed conn object twice.

When a new tap connection is requested with the existing name, we
first check if there is any tap connection with the old cookie and
same name. If exists, we create a dummy closed TAP connection for
the old cookie, and then bind the existing TAP conection to the
new cookie.

In this process, we should not release the old cookie as it will be
release later in either getExpiredConnections or
TapConnectionReaperCallback.

Trond, I didn't see any more crash or 100% cpu with the change when I rebalanced in or out the 4th node repeatedly. Please take a look at this change if this makes sense to you.
