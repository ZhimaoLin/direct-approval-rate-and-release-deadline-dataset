Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

(1 comment)

Line:165, src/item_pager.cc -> I think the interface should be rethought here - maybe use a strongly-typed enum to specify the task - I don't see why you need to compare to a string each time, and also what happens if a string which isn't explicitly checked for is passed in?

Perhaps you can move this logic to the base-class - or maybe pass a pointer to a histogram which you call `add()` on if it's non-null. As it is it's too fragile IMHO.

Line:165, src/item_pager.cc -> I understand your reasoning, but we control the name of the task.
This PagingVisitor class is used only by the item pager and the expiry pager. So in this case shouldn't we be fine?

Line:165, src/item_pager.cc -> My concern is it's error-prone - if you mistyped the capitalisation of the name you'd silently not record the histogram. Not to mention the inefficiency of comparing a string everything vs a simple null check. C++ is a strongly-typed language, we should use it as such.

Line:165, src/item_pager.cc -> All right then, let me add an enum to differentiate between the 2 pagers.
