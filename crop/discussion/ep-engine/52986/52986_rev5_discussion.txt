Line:171, src/item_pager.cc -> Note you can extract the constant subexpression to calculate the duration from these two clauses.

Line:171, src/item_pager.cc -> I'm not sure I understand, but is this what you mean:

hrtime_t x = gethrtime() - taskStart;
if (item_pager)
    stats. item_pager.add(x / 1000);
else if (expiry_pager)
    stats.expiry_pager.add(x / 1000);

In either case, the gethrtime() is always executed once per pager, so it shouldn't make a difference right?

Line:35, src/item_pager.cc -> In C++ you don't need the typedef for an enum; also you could also use a C++11 enum class[1]:

 enum class Pager {
     ITEM,
     EXPIRY
 };

[1]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum

Line:171, src/item_pager.cc -> It's not about performance, it's about avoiding code duplication and making it easier to read and simply any future mantenance.

Also - why stop at the subtraction :) - might was well extract the division also:

 const uint64_t elapsed_us((gethrtime() - taskStart) / 1000);
 if (owner == ITEM_PAGER) {
     stats.itemPagerHisto.add(elapsed_us);
 } else if (owner == EXPIRY_PAGER) {
     stats.expiryPagerHisto.add(elapsed_us);
 }

Line:365, src/stats.h -> Note hrtime_t is the incorrect type here - that is measured in ns; if you want to record at a microsecond value then use a different type to avoid confusion - a uint64_t should be sufficient with a comment mentioning the unit is Î¼s.

Line:171, src/item_pager.cc -> Done

Line:365, src/stats.h -> I could make that as a separate change as we would need to correct all the other histograms as well.
