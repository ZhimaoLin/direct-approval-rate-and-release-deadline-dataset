Patch Set 1: Verified

Just a few minor comments.

Line:111, warmup.hh -> Please align them correctly.

Line:371, mc-kvstore/mc-engine.cc -> I think we can remove them.

Line:502, warmup.cc -> This was used to delete items from database, whose vbucket versions are no longer valid. We can remove them in a separate commit. I guess that's what you meant in the comment :)

Line:502, warmup.cc -> As vbucket version is not used anymore, there is a separate pivotal task that clears up all the vbucket version code.

I'll fix this ASAP

Line:111, warmup.hh -> They are actually aligned correctly ;-) It's just that the name ends up being so long...
