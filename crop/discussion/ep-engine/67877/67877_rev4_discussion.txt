DESCRIPTION

MB-20852: Move persistenceCheckpoint id to VBucket

Currently the VBucketMap owns the persistence checkpoint IDs of all
VBuckets. Given these are properties of the VBuckets themselves (for
example one cannot form a vbucket_state record without one) it seems
more logical to have the VBucket class itself own this property.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:615, src/vbucket.h -> Do we need to initialize ? Was initialized to 0 in vbmap previously

Line:166, src/vbucketmap.cc -> This would overwritten some memory location of id > size.

Glad this is taken care of
