DESCRIPTION

MB-20852 [11/N]: Move persistenceCheckpoint id to VBucket

Currently the VBucketMap owns the persistence checkpoint IDs of all
VBuckets. Given these are properties of the VBuckets themselves (for
example one cannot form a vbucket_state record without one) it seems
more logical to have the VBucket class itself own this property.
