DESCRIPTION

MB-4619 Set the registered TAP custor to its checkpoint's begin()

When the registered TAP client reconnects to the server, its
checkpoint cursor should be always reset to the beginning of its
current checkpoint, so that the checkpoint_start meta message
should be first sent before streaming mutations.

Line:304, tapconnection.cc -> Why is this a ternary? registeredTapClient is already a bool.

Line:308, tapconnection.cc -> We don't really need fromBeginning since we can just use registeredTapClient instead. fromBeginning is a little bit clearer on what's happening though. Either way is okay with me, but I wanted to point it out.
