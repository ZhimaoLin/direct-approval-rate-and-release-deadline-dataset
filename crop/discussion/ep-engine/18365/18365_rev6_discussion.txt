DESCRIPTION

MB-5912 Reduce the ref counter tracking overhead in the flusher

While the flusher performs some optimizations such as sorting
dirty items by their keys, it causes lots of unnecessary
reference counter tracking overhead in queued_item reference
counted pointer variables.

To reduce the above overhead, this change stores the queued_item
reference counted pointers in a separate array, and uses their
actual pointer values in performing some write optimizations,
which doesn't incur any reference counter tracking overhead,
and finally releases the reference counted pointers at the end
of each flusher cycle.

From the tests, it shows that this change reduces the flusher's
execution time by 15 - 20%

Line:1700, ep.cc -> I am a bit confused here with memOverhead accounting. You have QueuedItem* in writing and queued_item in flusherDirtyItems, then shouldn't you account for both sizeof(queued_item) and sizeof(QueuedItem*)?

Line:1700, ep.cc -> Good finding, i forgot to add sizeof(queued_item). will fix it soon.
