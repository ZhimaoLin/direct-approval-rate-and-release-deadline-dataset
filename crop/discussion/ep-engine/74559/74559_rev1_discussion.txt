Line:5146, src/ep_engine.cc -> Magic number - please use a symbolic constant (e.g. enum class) for the different values of this.

Line:5178, src/ep_engine.cc -> Style: probably easier to follow if you declare payloadlen as the value of offset (moving the increment at line 5174 up), and then add one to payloadlen in the case where fetchDatatype is true. That removes the need for the else-case.

Line:5182, src/ep_engine.cc -> As per the email thread, I believe we should always be setting GET_META.response.datatype to RAW_BYTES (now the document datatype is in the payload above).

Line:5192, src/ep_engine.cc -> same

Line:1610, src/vbucket.cc -> Shouldn't this be always true in this point - given we tested it at line 1588 already?
