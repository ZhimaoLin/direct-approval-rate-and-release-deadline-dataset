Also need to document the new GET_META option in the docs/ folder.

Line:389, src/ep_engine.h -> Probably more useful to name this something like 'Spock` (and the initial one 'Initial' or 'Baseline' or similar). Also - describe what the Spock version adds.

Line:391, tests/ep_test_apis.h -> Please use symbolic constant.

Line:31, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Nit: Keep these sorted alphabetically.

Line:340, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> I believe the majority of this test should work with Ephemeral - you just need to check the persistent parts (e.g. bgfetch).

Line:378, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Symbolic constants.

Line:385, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Symbolic constants.

Line:395, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Symbolic constants.

Line:1321, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Symbolic constants.

Line:1334, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Symbolic constants.

Line:835, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please use the symbolic constant here.

Line:846, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> ditto
