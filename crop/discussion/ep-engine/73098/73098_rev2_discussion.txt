I only read the start of this before stopping.

I don't understand the rationale for this change - it seems to be significantly increasing the complexity of various methods - note a lot of the new calls you're making are passing many defaulted arguments.

It's also a pretty large patch. If this is a mutli-stage change which will ultimately simplify the code, then I think I need to see the whole series before it can be reviewed.

Line:966, src/vbucket.h -> I'm not sure about this 'Ctx' class - it feels like it adds unnecessary complexity, not reduces it. For example, in this case you're essentially adding an extra argument (queItemCtx) which is adding complexity to the previous processAdd (which before didn't support genCAS / genSeqno etc).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:966, src/vbucket.h -> If I do not add this VBNotifyCtx class, then I will have to send 5 (as per latest commit) params separately to functions being called downstream.
Instead, I think it helps if we have lesser params to funcs and thereby consolidate related params
