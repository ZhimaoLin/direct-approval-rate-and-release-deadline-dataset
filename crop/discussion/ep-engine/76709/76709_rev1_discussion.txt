DESCRIPTION

MB-23863: Make DCP backfill read deleted documents

recordDbDump is invoked for KVStore::scan (backfill) and was coded to skip
opening of the document if the docinfo says deleted.

This commit then removes the error case where couchstore_open_doc_with_docinfo
returns -5 (COUCHSTORE_ERROR_DOC_NOT_FOUND) as that just means the document
has no-value and we still need to continue to creating the Item.
