DESCRIPTION

MB-23863: Make DCP backfill read deleted documents

recordDbDump is invoked for KVStore::scan (backfill) and was coded to
skip opening of the document if the docinfo says deleted.

This commit then removes the error case where
couchstore_open_doc_with_docinfo returns -5
(COUCHSTORE_ERROR_DOC_NOT_FOUND) as that just means the document has
no-value and we still need to continue to creating the Item.
