DESCRIPTION

MB-11299: Allow rollbacks to a partial snapshot

If we roll back to a partial snapshot we need to make sure to get
the snapshot start and end seqnos for the partial snapshot in order
to make sure that we don't accidentally miss any items when
reconnecting.

Line:333, src/kvstore.h -> If we don't need this new API in other places, I rather replace "rollback_error_code" with a struct class "RollbackResult" to include "snapshot_start" and "snapshot_end" from the rollback.

Line:2428, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> These stmts inside if clause are exactly the same as above. Please remove them completely.

Line:2437, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> newdb should be passed instead of db handle.
