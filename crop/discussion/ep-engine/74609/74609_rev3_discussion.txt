DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Collections DcpConsumer

Add the functional paths that allow a replica VBucket's manifest to
be updated from incoming DCP messages. Note that the DCP protocol
has not been written, but the API defined here shows what data needs
to be transfered over-the-wire.

Add a unit test to use MockDcpConsumer to drive a create and delete
