DESCRIPTION

MB-16181: Collections DcpConsumer

Add the functional paths that allow a replica VBucket's manifest to
be updated from incoming DCP messages. Note that the DCP protocol
has not been written, but the API defined here shows what data needs
to be transfered over-the-wire.

Add a unit test to use MockDcpConsumer to drive a create and delete

Patch Set 21: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:459, src/dcp/response.h -> This looks incorrect - should these functions both do the same thing?

Line:471, src/dcp/response.h -> Can this get hoisted to the constructor of this class (given that event is a const reference - is the eventData available at construction time)?

Line:1877, src/dcp/stream.cc -> s/,/./

Patch Set 21:

(2 comments)

Line:459, src/dcp/response.h -> Hmm, sort of. This has been the result of adding separator changes last, but event.getKey would return the separator if event == ChangeSeparator or the collection name if event == CreateCollection/BeginDeleteCollection.

Will update

Line:471, src/dcp/response.h -> Yeah, think so, all collection's events should be sending the revision.
