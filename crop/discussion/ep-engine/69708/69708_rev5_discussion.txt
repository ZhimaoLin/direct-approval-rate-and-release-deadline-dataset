DESCRIPTION

MB-21617: Change CAS resolution to nanoseconds

This gives better compatibility with older datasets and a less
confusing experience if an old cluster did set_with_cas against
a new one.

The CAS is generated as a nanosecond value.

Drift is tracked though in microseconds to give a longer window before
we may overflow the counter. The config thresholds are also all Âµs
but converted to ns so we can correctly track drift.

A new max_cas_str is also added to assist the supportability of
LWW, so at a glance you can see what the max_cas means as a
date/time string.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

Main change (CAS micro -> nano) looks good. Couple of comments on the stats exposed / our internal APIs.

Line:58, src/hlc.h -> Worth using std::chrono::duration::microseconds in the API to make it explicit?

Line:93, src/hlc.h -> we say micro here, but you're using milli in the code below?

Line:139, src/hlc.h -> Again, would be safer to use std::chrono::microseconds for the external API.

Line:169, src/hlc.h -> Possible to include the fractional seconds in here?

Line:508, docs/stats.org -> Would be not be more consistent to keep all the external parameters (apart from the CAS itself) as microseconds?

(same comment for drift_behind_threshold).

updates incoming

Line:93, src/hlc.h -> oops, good catch, yes must be micro

Line:139, src/hlc.h -> Done

Line:169, src/hlc.h -> just more work, strftime will need to be followed by an append of the fractional part

Line:181, src/hlc.h -> as is, is what I wanted.

Line:508, docs/stats.org -> The vbucket-details threshold(s) are showing the actual raw value we are using in the exception >, < compares. The engine stats will include the threshold as per the config setting (micro value).  This should give a little more visibility and confidence in making decisions when debugging exception changes.
