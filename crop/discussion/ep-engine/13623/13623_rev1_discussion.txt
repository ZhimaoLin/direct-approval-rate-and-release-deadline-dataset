DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary deduplication checks from EPStore beginFlush()

As deduplication is actually performed in both vbucket checkpoint
and EPStore flushOneDelOrSet(), it is not necessary to check
the deduplication again in EPStore beginFlush(), which incurrs
much overhead due to std::set<std::string key>.
