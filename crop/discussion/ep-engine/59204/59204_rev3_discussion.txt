DESCRIPTION

MB-17461 Resolve static analyzer warnings for couch-kvstore

Moves size argument to second parameter for calloc and
specifies 1 for count. This semantically makes more sense
(allocate space for 1 'thing' rather than a number of bytes
for the size of one thing) and silences the clang warning.
