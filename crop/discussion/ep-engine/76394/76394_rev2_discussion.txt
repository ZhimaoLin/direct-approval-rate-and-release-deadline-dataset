DESCRIPTION

MB-23750: Fix toggling ephemeral ejection policy

If going

auto_delete -> fail_new_data -> auto_delete

the itemPager task was rescheduled, but as it had previously been
cancelled the state remained TASK_DEAD, and so ExecutorThread::run
behaves as if the task has just been cancelled and needs cleaning up.
By resetting scheduled tasks back to TASK_RUNNING if they are dead, this
can be avoided.

Please add a unit test for this.

Line:215, src/taskqueue.cc -> This /should/ be ok, but I wonder if we have any existing tasks in DEAD state which are rescheduled (and currently never run) - and by fixing this you introduce a change in behaviour elsewhere.

Might be safer to just call PagerTask::setState() on itself before it is rescheduled.
