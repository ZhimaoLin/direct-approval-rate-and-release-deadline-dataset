DESCRIPTION

MB-15363: Handling temp_non_existent_items

In FULL_EVICTION scenario, when a GET, GET_WITH_META, DELETE are
called on an item that does not exist, in the current code base,
we create a TEMP item and issue a background fetch. As the item
does not exist, the temp item is marked as a non_existent_key and
is left as is for the expiry pager to remove (which runs once an
hour). If there are many such operations over a different keyset,
memory usage will increase because of all the temp items.

To avoid this, this fix ensures a non_existent_key's temp item
is deleted, before returning ENOENT.
