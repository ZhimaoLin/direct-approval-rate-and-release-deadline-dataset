Add support for FORCE_ACCEPT_WITH_META_OPS
 - This flag must be set if the bucket is lww

(3 comments)

As discussed, would be good if we made force only valid for lww buckets.

Remaining comments are just minor issues.

Line:5709, src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Would be nice to extract this into a helper function for both set_with_meta & del_with_meta (they look very similar...)

Line:408, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> uncomment or delete.

Line:1836, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Nit: prefer nullptr
