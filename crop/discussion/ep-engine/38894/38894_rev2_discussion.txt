DESCRIPTION

MB-11576 Reserve cached Doc,DeleteCounts for safe read-only use

Dynamically allowing the cachedDocCount and cachedDeleteCount maps
to grow can be unsafe in the lock-less couch-kvstore implementation.
Pre-allocating their sizes to max number of vbucket ensures that we do
not cause a crash since the accesses should all be read-only.
