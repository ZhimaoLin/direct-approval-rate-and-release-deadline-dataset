Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:414, src/warmup.cc -> For consistency I'd suggest either having all of these initialised to the correct size in the initialiser list, or all re-assigned in the body here.

(Given we have to use the initialiser list approach to work around the MSVC bug, we've not really got the benefit of only calling getNumShards() once, so we might as well put them all in the initialiser list).

Aim for "unsurprising" code - as it stands a future reader might think "Why are some of the vectors initialised to the correct size in the initialiser list, and why are some re-assigned?"
