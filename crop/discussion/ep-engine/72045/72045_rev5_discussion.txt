Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:427, src/warmup.cc -> You can actually delete this entirely, and just declare the destructor in the header as:

  ~Warmup() = default;

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> There's still some Adrianna Holmesal memory allocation in the Warmup class (e.g. Warmup::scheduleInitialize()), so this summary is potentially misleading.

Suggest you re-phrease (something like suffix with " constructor").
