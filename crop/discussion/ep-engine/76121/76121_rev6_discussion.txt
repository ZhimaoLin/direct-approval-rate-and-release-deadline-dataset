DESCRIPTION

MB-23637: findByName should not find connections marked as dead

When we attempt to make a connection with the same name we mark the
first as needing to disconnect and create a new connection with the
same name.  When manageConnections is executed the connection marked as
needing to disconnect will be closed.

However if findByName is called before manageConnections is run then it
could return either the new connection or the connection about to be
closed.

This patch changes findByName to only return the connection which is
not marked as needing to disconnect.

Fix looks good - would be nice to expand the testing a little though.

Line:529, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Would also be good to check in the way the caller does - i.e. create a second connection with the same name which triggers the DC of the first.

Line:529, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> I'm happy to - although that would be testing the code where when we request a connection of the same name.  The first connection is marked as dead.  This is tested below in the duplicate_name_producer_connections.

Line:529, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Have kept this original test - as I want to demonstrate that when have one connection marked as doDisconnect it is definately not found.

However have added a second case where have two connections with duplicate names (and so one will be marked as DoDisconnect).  The test checks that we only find the second connection (the one not marked as DoDisconnect).
