Line:117, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I'm going to change this back so that this change shows the minimum change possible.

Line:4, src/bgfetcher.cc -> It didn't help making this lower so let's keep it at 1.

Line:86, src/bgfetcher.hh -> I don't think we should be calling wake every time a new background fetch comes in.
