Line:79, management/dbconvert.cc -> The new code seems to have lost the initial begin().

Line:93, management/dbconvert.cc -> Why not just add another dest->begin() right here?

Line:90, management/dbconvert.cc -> typo for "Elapsed time" and whitespace inconsistencies.

Also, why do we need a high resolution timer for this?

Line:120, management/dbconvert.cc -> We should usually just follow the coding style of the file.

Also, the return value of commit() might not match here?u

Line:79, management/dbconvert.cc -> It is encapsulated in enterTransaction()

Line:93, management/dbconvert.cc -> The main consideration is to add some error checking logic  around commit() function call.

Line:90, management/dbconvert.cc -> Just use the same timer API as ep-engine does. And it works across platform.

Line:120, management/dbconvert.cc -> commit() returns bool. It is the same logic as we implement in TransactionContext::commit().
