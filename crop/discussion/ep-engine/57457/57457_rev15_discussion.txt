Line:222, src/ep.cc -> Minor point (not need to be addressed in this commit): We need to check if vb is null or not as this function might be reused by other functions later.

Line:284, src/ep.cc -> You don't need to check if vb is still active or not because it is already checked in deleteExpiredItem() below. Please note that if this checking is required here, then you need to grab the reader-writer vb state lock.

Line:1622, src/ep.cc -> Please check if vb is null or not:

if (vb == nullptr) {
    continue;
}

Line:1345, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> The return type bool is wrong. Please correct it.

Line:1345, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Then, we should explicitly return true if compaction is successful, otherwise false.
