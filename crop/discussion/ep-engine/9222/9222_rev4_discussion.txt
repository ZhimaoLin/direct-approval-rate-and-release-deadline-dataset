Line:380, stats.hh -> You should probably "destroy" it in the destructor? (to ensure that the file is closed etc?

Line:284, ep_engine.cc -> WHy not just: delete stats.timingsLog; ?

Line:380, stats.hh -> Yeah, that seems like a good idea.

Line:284, ep_engine.cc -> I wanted to NULL it before deleting it so the other side won't get a stale handle.  It's still a race condition, I guess unless I use some kind of atomic pointer or shove it through the same dispatcher thread.  Need a solid and fast queue.
