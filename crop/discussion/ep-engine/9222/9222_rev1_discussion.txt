Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm using this for performance testing.  I don't think it's *exactly* right.  It should be doing sampling and perhaps be able to be turned on and off dynamically and perhaps be per-engine.  I'd like ideas for how to make this better.

Patch Set 1:

I think I should make changes on this soon to make it just add protocol support for enabling it and disabling it at least.  We would like to run some long running tests and then get performance samples after it'd been running for a while.
