DESCRIPTION

MB-21029: Don't return ep_access_scanner_task_time until it has been scheduled.

Fix a latent race condition in ep_access_scanner_task_time stat
(exposed by intermittent failure in access_scanner_settings test),
whereby we can return a value for ep_access_scanner_task_time of the
Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00) if the AccessScanner has been enabled
but not yet scheduled.

Solution is to not return a value (and instead 'NOT SCHEDULED') until
scheduling has occurred.
