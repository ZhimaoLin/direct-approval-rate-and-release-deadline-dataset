DESCRIPTION

MB-23990: Fix intermittent hangs in unit test

In some scenarios, the io complete notification reached before we start
waiting for it via the condition variable. This results in the test
hanging forever. Now we track the no.of notifications and wait
accordingly

Line:1006, tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> This still feels racy - we could read c->num_io_notifications (and it is say 0), but before we call waitfor_cookie() the notification occurs and we'll be waiting forever?
