DESCRIPTION

MB-16357: Create a variable to get correct locking scope

A mistake in 495e00acc24 means that no variable is
created for the ReaderLockHolder, the compiler either
optimises away the lock constructor/destructor or the lock
scope is wrong.

Either way we need to create a variable.

I saw the same issues in other functions (set, setwithmeta, etc.) in EPStore. Can you address them too?

Worth noting that on master (which is essentially the same code) ThreadSanitizer is reporting potential lock deadlocks. 

We don't currently run TSan on sherlock but we should probably look at the master results and fix any issues there before committing this.

Also - where does 4.1.0 currently sit - do we need to get this in for 4.1??

Patch Set 1:

Yeah, I saw some TS warnings from the master branch too, and agreed that we should investigate them before merging this fix. 4.1.0 is still in the beta phase and will be planned for release by the end of November.

Patch Set 1:

I think we should get this fixed for 4.1.0 given the fact that the original fix addressed the racing issues in deleting expired items.

This isn't the same code as master, we decided to merge a small fix into 3 and 4, master shows a TS warning on different code
