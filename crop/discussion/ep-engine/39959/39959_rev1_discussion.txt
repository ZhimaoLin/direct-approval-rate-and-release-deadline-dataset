DESCRIPTION

MB-11725: Add an assert to make sure that the disk seqno <= mem seqno

This assert will cause a crash if we try to set the disk seqno
greater than the memory seqno. It will allow use to better debug the
issue where backfilling doesn't read any items. It is also a condition
that if not handled properly can result in data loss.
