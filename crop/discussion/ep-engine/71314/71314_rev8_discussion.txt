Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:1558, src/checkpoint.cc -> I think the logic for decreasing / increasing in different ways should be pushed down to the stats and vbucket objects.

e.g. instead of 

    bool decrDirtyQueueSize(size_t decrementBy);

have something like

    bool updateQueueSize(ssize_t diff);

Or even better, push the invariant further down and create a std::atomic wrapper for a templated unsigned atomic which can't be reduced below 0.

Good interfaces should be hard to use wrong. This is an interface that's easy to fuck up by doing something like

    vbucket.diskQueueSize.fetch_sub(<some large number>);

Line:1558, src/checkpoint.cc -> I agree it would be desirable to have a cleaner interface here, along the lines of your suggestions. However at this juncture I just wanted to remove the duplication - and there's certainly a bunch of other stats which would benefit from a cleaner API in addition to this one.

I've created MB-22230 to track such an improvement.
