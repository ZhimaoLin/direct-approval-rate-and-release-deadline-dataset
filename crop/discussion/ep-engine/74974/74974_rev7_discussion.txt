DESCRIPTION

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose metadata is
resident in memory.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Code looks good. Few suggestions for some more tests.

File Comment: tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Should also add a test for item deletion - that the stat is decremented.

Look at your code coverage of the new cases you've written (see tlm/README.txt for details on how to check).

Line:80, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> You can probably give this a more descriptive name - e.g. DatatypesInitiallyZero

Line:111, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Similar here - DatatypeJSONtoXATTR ?

Line:113, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Note: the second param is already defaulted to NULL, so you can simplify and just omit it.

Line:226, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Also - consider using a value-parametered test to combine much of the code for this and the previous test. See EPStoreEvictionTest for examples.
