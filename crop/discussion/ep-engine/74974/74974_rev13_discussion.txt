DESCRIPTION

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose metadata is
resident in memory.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.

Line:608, src/hash_table.h -> Now we have moved the datatype into StoredValue, we actually /can/ track datatype counts for resident and non-resident items for Value eviction buckets.

(Full Eviction will still only be resident).

I think it's worth updating this patch to support that - it makes it much more useful in Full Eviction (which is probably the most common used mode).
