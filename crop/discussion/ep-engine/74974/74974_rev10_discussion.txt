DESCRIPTION

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose metadata is
resident in memory.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.

Line:6524, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> These aren't alphabetical (within the larger list).
