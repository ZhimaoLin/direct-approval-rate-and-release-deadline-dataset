DESCRIPTION

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose values are
resident in memory. This limitation is because, at present, the
datatypes are stored with the values.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.

(10 comments)

Line:2987, src/ep_engine.cc -> You can just use datatypeCounts.size() - that means you're not repeating the definition of the array size (and less work if we ever change the size of that array).

Line:3602, src/ep_engine.cc -> Ditto

Line:3603, src/ep_engine.cc -> Should probably also have a stat for replica vBuckets.

Line:609, src/hash_table.h -> strange whitespace wrapping here. If you need more than one line, put the comment before the member variable.

Line:110, src/hash_table.cc -> Prefer std::array::fill().

Line:300, src/hash_table.cc -> Shouldn't this be a decrement?

Line:384, src/hash_table.cc -> Shouldn't this be a decrement?

Line:459, src/hash_table.cc -> Shouldn't this be a decrement?

Line:658, src/hash_table.cc -> Look at Trond's recent patch (possibly in-flight) to move datatype into StoredValue itself - that will change where you need to look for the datatype.

Line:138, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> These tests need to be more thorough - I don't see anything checking for the counters being correctly decremented when a datatype changes, or when items are evicted.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:170, src/ep_engine.h -> I think Dan was referring to making the method const, not the argument (marking an argument which is passed by value as const is generally of little value).
