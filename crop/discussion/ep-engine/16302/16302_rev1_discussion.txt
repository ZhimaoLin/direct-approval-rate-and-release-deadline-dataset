DESCRIPTION

MB-5356 Fix resource leak in mccouch mock server

Mock server instance never released McConnections that it created
for socket connections. This would cause memory leak and socket
resource leak. With randomized mock server failures, more
McConnection would be created, and the leak would eventually
cause tests to fail.
