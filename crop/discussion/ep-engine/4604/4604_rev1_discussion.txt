Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hey, glad you got a commit in, but a couple of things:

1. Trying to use this style of initialization more to be consistent.
2. Don't need to put your name in the commit message again. :)

In general, commits are first-class things, so we care a lot about the change and message.  Not always perfect, but you can get a feel from the git logs.
