Line:114, src/bloomfilter.cc -> Maybe I can add the namespace to the seed? which is param 3, the loop count.

MURMURHASH_3(key.data(), key.size(), i + key.getDocNamespace(), &result);

Line:114, src/bloomfilter.cc -> I think you want to be slightly more clever than that to avoid intermediate collisions, something like:

DefaultCollection: 0..noOfHashes
Collections: noOfHashes..2*noOfHashes
System: 2*noOfHashes..3*noOfHashes

Which I think works out to:

i + (noOfHashes * key.getDocNamespace())

Line:114, src/bloomfilter.cc -> I've thought about yours a little more and I'm now definitely sure it wouldn't work because the same key in different namespaces would all 'maybe exist' from a single one of them being added to the bloom filter (making the entire effort of adding the namespace to the filter pointless)

Line:114, src/bloomfilter.cc -> Actually never mind, got the condition backwards, yours would work but you'd be effectively removing 2 iterations from the bloom filter

Line:114, src/bloomfilter.cc -> the first, "scaling" of i is what i'm going for as I don't want a collision if i can help it and was what i was working whilst adding some (very few...) much needed unit tests for this simple yet important class
