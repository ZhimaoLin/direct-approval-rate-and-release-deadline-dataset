DESCRIPTION

MB-21143: Don't store conflict resolution mode per document

conflict resolution mode.

LWW is now enabled globally so this meta data is wasted.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

Nice, less code == good :)

Couple of minor documentation-type comments.

Line:86, src/ext_meta_parser.cc -> Maybe expand the comment - mentioning when we removed it / started ignoring.

Line:61, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I'd be tempted to keep this (maybe renamed to UNUSED_V2_...) to make more explicit the textual warning that we can't simply re-use 19 in future.

Line:695, src/item.h -> Nice - you've just made space for up to an 8 bit NRU :)

Line:61, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> done, although it becomes "unused variable" so have also made benign change to prevent that warning
