DESCRIPTION

MB-13787: Parse extended meta data for meta commands only if len > 0

If extras length were specified as 26B but meta len is entered
as zero, then we return EINVAL. To avoid this check the meta
len before parsing extended meta data for the following commands:
- set_with_meta
- delete_with_meta
