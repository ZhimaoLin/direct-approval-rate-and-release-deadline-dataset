DESCRIPTION

MB-15166: Takeover throttling front end load when necessary

If a takeover stream is taking too, in the "takeover-send"
phase because its checkpoint queues are heavily backed up
due to a very high front end, then it will now throttle
the front end by telling the client to back-off.

This would cause tmpOOMS on the front end during rebalance
but would reduce the risk of remaining stuck in rebalance
in the midst of a very high front end.
