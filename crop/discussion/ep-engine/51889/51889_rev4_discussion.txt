DESCRIPTION

MB-15166: Takeover to throttle front end load if necessary

If a takeover stream is taking too long in the "takeover-send"
phase because of its checkpoint queues being heavily backed up
due to a very high front end, then it will now throttle the
front end by telling the client to back-off.

This could cause tmpOOMs during rebalance in certain scenarios
but would reduce the risk of rebalance remaining stuck in the
midst of very high front end ops (mutations).

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:508, configuration.json -> We should return 'ENGINE_TMP_FAIL' instead.

Line:693, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Shouldn't 'newState' be checked instead?

Line:751, src/ep.cc -> Please don't log as a warning. It will flood the log file.

Line:753, src/ep.cc -> this logic should be applied to other mutation APIs such as add, delete, setWithMeta, deleteWithMeta, etc.

Line:693, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Its the same thing right, state_ is initialized to newState right above anyway, and if state_ were equal to newState at the start of this function we would have never reached here anyway.
