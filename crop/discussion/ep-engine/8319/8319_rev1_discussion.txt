Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

%u is not the the same as %zu.  If windows doesn't have a print format for size_t, we should do the same thing we do everywhere else in the code for size_t

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

This is going to fail on a system with 64 bit size_t. The idea with the z character is that it internally works as %u if you'r size_t is 32 bit, and like%lu if your size_t is 64 bit. If you're going to change this you should fix it like I do in the other place, where I use a stringstream to format it with <<.
