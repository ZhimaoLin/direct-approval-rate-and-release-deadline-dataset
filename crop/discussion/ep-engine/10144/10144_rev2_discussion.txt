Line:169, observe_registry.cc -> I'm somewhat suspicious of stats that go downwards, as they tend to go below zero due to bugs and slip into GIGANTOR territory.

One alternative is to have two separate "upwards only" counters.  One for add's, and one for remove's.

Although I don't like the subtraction here, would you also need to maintain the right amounts in the object destructors (due to timeouts or conn closings)?
