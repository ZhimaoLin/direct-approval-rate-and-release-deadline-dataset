DESCRIPTION

ActiveStream: Missing streamMutex locks

We are not acquiring the streamMutex lock in the
ActiveStream constructor method.  The mutex is
required because it makes potentially makes a call
to endStream, which in turn can call pushToReadyQ.

We are also not aqcuiring lock in the function
incrBackfillRemaining, which is called from
DCPBackfill::create.

We are also not acquiring lock in the function
getReadyQueueMemory.  Given that it is just a read
instead of acquiring the streamMutex lock, the
readyQueueMemory variable can be made an atomic.
