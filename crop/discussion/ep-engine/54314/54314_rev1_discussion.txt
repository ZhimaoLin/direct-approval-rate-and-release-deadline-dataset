DESCRIPTION

ActiveStream: Missing streamMutex lock

We are not acquiring the streamMutex lock in the
ActiveStream constructor method.  The mutex is
required because it makes potentially makes a call
to endStream (which in turn can call pushToReadyQ).

The streamMutex lock is also required in the
getReadyQueueMemory function as its accesses the
readyQueueMemory variable.
