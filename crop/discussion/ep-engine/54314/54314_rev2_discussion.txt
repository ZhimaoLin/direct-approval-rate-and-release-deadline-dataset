DESCRIPTION

ActiveStream: Missing streamMutex lock

We are not acquiring the streamMutex lock in the
ActiveStream constructor method.  The mutex is
required because it makes potentially makes a call
to endStream (which in turn can call pushToReadyQ).

The streamMutex lock is also required in the
getReadyQueueMemory function as its accesses the
readyQueueMemory variable.

cb_assert have been added to those functions that
have the streamMutex lock.  This is to aid debugging
and understanding of the code.  In the future
it expected that the locking will be made more fine
grain.
