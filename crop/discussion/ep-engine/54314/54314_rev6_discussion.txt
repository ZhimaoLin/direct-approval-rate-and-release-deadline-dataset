DESCRIPTION

ActiveStream: Missing streamMutex locks

We are not acquiring the streamMutex lock in the
ActiveStream constructor method.  The mutex is
required because it makes potentially makes a call
to endStream (which in turn can call pushToReadyQ).

Also we are not aqcuiring lock in the function
incrBackfillRemaining, which is called from
DCPBackfill::create.

Also See comments from patchset 4.

Line:89, src/dcp/stream.cc -> I did investigate changing readyQueueMemory to an atomic.  But would make the pushToReadyQ and popfromReadyQ more expensive.  Particularly the popFromReadyQueue which does 
if ((readyQueueMemory - respSize) <= readyQueueMemory) {
                    readyQueueMemory -= respSize;
                    readyQueueMemory -= respSize;
}

And getReadyQueueMemory is only called from addStats so should not be as frequently called.  Also we for the majority of all the ActiveStream functions we hold the streamMutex - so should make little difference in terms of contention.

Patch Set 6:

I though cb_assert ran only in non-release versions.  Given they are run in production I have removed the cb_assert on whether streamMutex is locked for performance reasons.

Line:89, src/dcp/stream.cc -> A mutex is pretty much always more expensive than an atomic - or even a couple of atomics. Furthermore you only need relaxed memory consistancy for atomics which are used as counters (see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order) which on x86_64 is the same cost as a normal load/store.

Line:89, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Yes I did implement as relaxed, but did not realise the cost is the same as normal load/store.  Will make the change to use atomic.
