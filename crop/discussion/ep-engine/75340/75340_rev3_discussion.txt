DESCRIPTION

MB-23204: Change default string paramter to use ""

Previously we tried to use an initializer list to initialise a default
std::string parameter. This doesn't work with MSVC 2013 and causes a
segfault when trying to create the string. Using "" has the same
semantics so we now use that instead.
