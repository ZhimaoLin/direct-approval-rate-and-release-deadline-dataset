Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:2400, src/vbucket.cc -> I think this should work by updating the Item object which is passed into processSoftDelete - by directly modifying the SV we potentially mess up the various temp / resident / deleted counts in HashTable - see for example what unlocked_updateStoredValue() does when it updates the deleted count:

     if (v.isDeleted() && !itm.isDeleted()) {
        --numDeletedItems;
    }

i.e. it relies on having the correct "previous" state of the StoredValue.

(I think in general that any StoredValues found via unlocked_find() or similar need t be considered immutable outside the HashTable class).

Line:1036, tests/module_tests/evp_store_with_meta.cc -> Probably also worth checking the item and deleted count of the VBucket / HaashTable here - I suspect it might not be correct with the current implication (see previous comment).
