Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This doesn't solve this lock contention and blocking issue with compaction, vb deletion, and vb snapshot. I will take over MB-11799 and 11731 and work on them today.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

I agree with you Chiyoung, just to let you know that I was able to verify that this change improves flusher performance during compactions locally. Also unit test and make simple-tests pass.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

I don't want to merge this change without fixing the issue completely. We need to make a change that fixes the root cause of the issue.
