DESCRIPTION

MB-23067: Remove %n from printf

We use %n to count the number of characters printed by printf. This is a
secuirty hole and hence is disabled by default by MSVC. This patch
simply uses the length of the string passed rather than using %d. This
is to avoid doing some MSVC specific defs and because we try to avoid %n
in general.
