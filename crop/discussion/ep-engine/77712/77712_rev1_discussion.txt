DESCRIPTION

Doxygen: Include all source files in documentation

The Doxygen configuration explicilty listed specific subdirectories of
src/ to index. These were (a) outdated and (b) unnecessarily specific
- anything under src/ we want to index.

Update the Doxyfile to recusrively index all of src/
