DESCRIPTION

MB-5694: add key status for not found

This is needed because a key might not be on a replica when we
do an observe call. Instead of returning an error we simply
return a key status of not found for a particular key.

Line:3478, ep_engine.cc -> kvstats struct is filling only in case valid value was fetched, otherwise it will remain untouched. does C++ compiler guarantees that kvstats will be zeroed? it would be nice to memset(&kbstats, 0, sizeof(kvstats)) otherwise to force cas be zero (just in case, because the client should interpet cas value only in successful case)
