DESCRIPTION

New binary protocol command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, for replica read

Add new binary protocol command that works exactly like the exisiting
PROTOCOL_BINARY_CMD_GET except it returns data only for vbuckets that
are in replica state.

This upload include:
 * definition and implementation of new command id, command handler
 * new ep-engine unit tests that attempts the CMD_GET_REPLICA cmd
 against all four states of vbuckets - active, pending, replica, dead
