DESCRIPTION

MB-11325: Fix race condition in updating persisted seqno

We cannot rely on setting the last persisted seqno by checking
where the cursor/backfill queue is after doing persistence. The
reason is that we might switch from backfill phase to checkpoint
phase in the middle of a commit which will cause the last persisted
seqno to be set to higher than what it actually is. This can cause
backfills to be scheduled pre-maturely as a result and cause us not
to read enough items off of disk.

The only place we can really trust to get the persistence seqno is
from the actual file. So when we do persistence for a particular
vbucket we should cache the last persisted seqno. This will allow us
to get this value without having to do a disk read.
