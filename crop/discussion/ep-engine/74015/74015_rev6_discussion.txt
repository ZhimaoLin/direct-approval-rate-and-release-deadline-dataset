DESCRIPTION

MB-22013: Add access scanner benchmark

Adds google benchmark in to ep-engine and abstracts some helpful classes
from evp_store_test in to mocks as they are used by the access scanner
benchmark.

Benchmarks the access scanner by performing sets both when no other
tasks are running and when the access scanner is running constantly.

(6 comments)

File Comment: tests/mock/mock_SynchronousEPEngine.cc -> add the copyright banner and clang-format

File Comment: tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> clang-format this new file

Line:1, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> You'll need the standard copyright banner here

Line:40, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> The test might be doing a bit of wasted heap allocations with the key objects, maybe not a problem but we can clean it up.

If you change make_item so it takes a string ref

  make_item(uint16_t vbid, const std::string& key, ..) {
    Item item({key, DocNamespace::DefaultCollection}, /*flags*/0...

That will remove the construction of a StoredDocKey

Line:50, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> set these to nullptr

File Comment: tests/mock/mock_SynchronousEPEngine.h -> add the copyright banner and clang-format

also lower case for the filename to be consistent with our code-base
