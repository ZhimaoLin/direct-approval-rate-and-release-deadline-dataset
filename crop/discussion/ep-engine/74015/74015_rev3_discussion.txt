DESCRIPTION

MB-22013: Add access scanner benchmark

Adds google benchmark in to ep-engine and abstracts some helpful classes
from evp_store_test in to mocks as they are used by the access scanner
benchmark.

Benchmarks the access scanner by performing sets both when no other
tasks are running and when the access scanner is running constantly.
