DESCRIPTION

MB-13137: Clear persistedNotifications before deleting vbucket

There seems to be race between the fetching of the
persistedNofitications lock and deleting the vbucket object.

To avoid this get this lock and clear the list that it guards,
in the destructor of the vbucket class.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

The problem in this case is that the vbucket is NULL so this change won't resolve the issue.
