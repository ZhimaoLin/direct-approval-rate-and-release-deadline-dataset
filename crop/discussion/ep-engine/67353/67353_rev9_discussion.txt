DESCRIPTION

MB-19578: Fail warmup only when explicitly configured

- Instead of unconditionally failing warmup in case of a OOM failure,
  fail it only when it is configured to do so. Note that ns_server
  explicitly sets this value to false.
- Remove an unnecessary check in the bucket initialization path to
  check for warmup failures as soon as warmup is started. The warmup
  process is asynchronous and thus checking for failures right away
  is futile.
