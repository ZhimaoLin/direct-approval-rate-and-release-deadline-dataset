DESCRIPTION

MB-5171 do not decrement numNonResident during initial warmup

Decrementing numNonResident during the warmup caused the total resident
ratio and cbstats' num_non_resident attributes to become negative. Each
initial insert of items during the warmup should never decrement the
numNonResident.

Looks good. Just a minor comment in ep_testsuit.cc

Line:4004, ep_testsuite.cc -> A minor comment. How about we create a function like wait_for_warm_up_settle() in ep_testsuit.cc since it is used by multiple tests and in future people do not need to write similar code again.
