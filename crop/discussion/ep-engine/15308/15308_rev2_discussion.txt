DESCRIPTION

MB-5171 do not decrement numNonResident during initial warmup

Decrementing numNonResident during the warmup caused the total resident
ratio and cbstats' num_non_resident attributes to become negative. Each
initial insert of items during the warmup should never decrement the
numNonResident.
