Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I'd prefer you didn't make this change (unless you really need it) - the initial Instant Karma patches (see http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/62303/) move this in a different direction - creating an object which represents the eviction policy instead of an enum. 

This change will create a bunch of conflicts and make it even harder to rebase / update that patch series when we get back to it.
