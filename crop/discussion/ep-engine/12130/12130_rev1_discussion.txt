Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't understand how this is reducing the item size. From the looks of the commit it appears you just reordered things in the constructor.

Patch Set 1:

If you look at Item class's changes, this change actually reordered its member variables by putting them by the descending order of their memory sizes, and initializes them in the same order in the constructors.
