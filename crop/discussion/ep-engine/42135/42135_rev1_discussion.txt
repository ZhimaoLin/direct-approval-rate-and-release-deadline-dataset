DESCRIPTION

Keep track of control opaques so we can properly handle responses

Right now when we receive a response for a control message we log
a message saying we recieved a message with an unexpected opaque.
This is because control messages each have their own opaque and
we do not track this opaque in the opaque map. This change tracks
these opaques and logs an appropriate message when there is an
error.
