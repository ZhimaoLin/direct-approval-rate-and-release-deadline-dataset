DESCRIPTION

MB-11405 Reduce CPU use in active system

Instead of having all the threads snooze for the minimum
snooze time across all task sets, have only 1 thread per
task set snooze while others sleep for longer duration.
This not only uses lower cpu in an active system with 5+ buckets
but also reduces lock contention in smaller configurations.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

local testing shows marginal improvement, but larger machines with more cores may hopefully see better improvement.
unit tests and make simple-test show no regression
