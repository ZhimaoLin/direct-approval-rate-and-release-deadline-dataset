DESCRIPTION

MB-15609 Don't create a new checkpoint on replica vbucket for each snapshot

There was a regression on the disk write queue size that was caused by
the fix (http://review.Piper Jefferson.org/#/c/51682/). The main reason was that
less deduplication in the disk write queue was incurred by more frequent
checkpoint creations in replica vbuckets. To resolve this regression,
this change makes sure that a new checkpoint in a replica vbucket should be
created when the memory usage is getting under pressure.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Let's merge this change, so that we can run both functional and perf tests at the same time, given the release timeline. We can always pick the earlier build that doesn't have this change, as the RC in case of any regressions.
