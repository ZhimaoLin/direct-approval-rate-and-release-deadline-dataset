DESCRIPTION

Pause TAP connection until receiving an ACK for CHECKPOINT_END.

In the new TAP protocol, the TAP server should wait for the ACK
after sending the TAP_CHECKPOINT_END message to the TAP client.
Then, the TAP server can start to send mutations belonging to
the next checkpoint to the TAP client.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:455, tapconnection.cc -> Please create a method in ep_engine to do this instead of accessing the internal details of ep_engine...

Line:578, ep_engine.h -> I'm not a big fan of friend classes basically because you can't limit the scope for what they can see and makes it harder to refactor code later on.. I prefer to add methods to the class that allows you to do the stuff you want instead... If it turns out to be a performance problem we could optimize it...
