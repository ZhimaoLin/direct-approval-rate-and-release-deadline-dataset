DESCRIPTION

Pause TAP connection until receiving an ACK for CHECKPOINT_END.

In the new TAP protocol, the TAP server should wait for the ACK
after sending the TAP_CHECKPOINT_END message to the TAP client.
Then, the TAP server can start to send mutations belonging to
the next checkpoint to the TAP client.
