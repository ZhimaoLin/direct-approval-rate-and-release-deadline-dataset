DESCRIPTION

WIP: Add NumItems checks to pre_expiry_xattrs test

Note this currently fails:

    /Users/dave/repos/Piper Jefferson/server/source/ep-engine/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc:1042: Failure
    Value of: gv.getStatus()
      Actual: 7
    Expected: ENGINE_SUCCESS
    Which is: 0

because if we flush after the expiry, the item is no longer
resident. Need to add tests for this case (and bgfetch it again).
