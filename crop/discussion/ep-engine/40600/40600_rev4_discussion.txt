DESCRIPTION

MB-11943: replace map with vector for cachedVBStates

std::map can incur thread-unsafe rb balance operations which
may invalidate concurrent iterators causing asserts or crashes
Pre-allocated vectors are thread-safe as long as the size is not
altered

Line:582, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This wouldn't cause memory leak? We need to make sure that cachedVBState should be NULL before assigning the pointer.
