DESCRIPTION

Log major key events to be able to quickly recover HT state.

This change introduces a new on-disk binary format for logging major
key events only.  These events are limited to the creation and
destruction of keys only -- modification of keys is out of scope, as
is storing values.

* Flow

The logging hooks in to the persistence flow and does the following:

After writing any new key or deleting any existing key from disk, a
new log entry is buffered.

The buffer is written when a block is full or on a flush event
(configurable, usually after a commit1 or commit2 event).

Before sending a commit to the underlying store, a commit1 event is
logged.

After the underlying store completes its commit, a commit2 is logged.

* Configuration

There are four new engine parameters that come with this feature:

** klog_path

Where the events should be logged.  An empty string (default) disables
logging.

** klog_block_size

The buffer/block size for log entries.  The number should line up with
the underlying filesystem block size.  Multiples may increase
throughput.

** klog_flush

Configures when the buffer should be force-flushed.  There are four
possible values:

   off: never force a flush
   commit1: force a flush after commit1 only
   commit2: force a flush after commit2 only
   full: force a flush after both commit1 and commit2

** klog_sync

Configures when the file should be fsynced.  There are four
possible values:

   off: never fsync
   commit1: fsync after commit1 only
   commit2: fsync after commit2 only
   full: fsync after both commit1 and commit2
