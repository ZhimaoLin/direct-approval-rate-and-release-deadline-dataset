DESCRIPTION

[PROTOTYPE] Delta-DCP (ep-engine)

Prototype of Delta-DCP.

Components:

* ep-engine changes (this patch)
* memcached changes (Change-Id: I29211c7435434ec1729d907c3266bef8a1a68153)
* ns_server changes ()

Overview:

1. Upon a set / update in the frontend of an existing item, track the
   previous (ancestor) Blob and seqno, associating it with the
   queued_item in the checkpoints.

2. When adding an item to a checkpoing which has an old version of
   that key, ensure the old version's ancestor is moved to the new value.

3. At the point of retrieving items from a checkpoint for DCP to send
   out, if an ancestor is available then create a DCP_DELTA_MUTATION
   message instead of the normal DCP_MUTATION message.

4. The producer will encode a DELTA_MUTATION message (by memcached,
   see sibling patch) by calcuating the binary difference between the
   ancestor and the new value, using open-vcdiff[1]. Assuming this is
   fewer bytes than the new value, send the diff over the wire, along
   with the seqno of the ancestor (previous) value.

5. On the consumer, a DELTA_MUTATION is decoded by validating that the
   ancestor seqno matches the seqno held locally, and then by applying
   the binary diff in the payload to the current value the consumer
   has.

Working:

* Successfully detects set operations which the previous (ancestor)
  value is known, and encodes them on the wire as DCP_DELTA_MUTATION
  packets.
* Successfully decodes at the consumer and reconstructs
  the new value from the old value and delta in the payload.
* Works for any type of SET operation - tested with vanilla SET and
  SUBDOC_SET.

Issues:

* At high op/s rates (~20,000) there's an issue where the ancestor
  seqno in the DCP_DELTA_MUTATION packet doesn't match what the
  consumer has in it's hashtable:
