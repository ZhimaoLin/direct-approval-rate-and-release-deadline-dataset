DESCRIPTION

scheduleBackfill() should skip vbuckets that are being backfilled

If a given vbucket is being backfilled from the upstream server,
it should be skipped in scheduleBackfill(). Backfill for that
vbucket will be scheduled separately once the backfill from the
upstream server is completed.
