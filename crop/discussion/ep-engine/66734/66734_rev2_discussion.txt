DESCRIPTION

Remove hooksApi global; reduce coupling with MemoryTracker

MemoryTracker is somewhat tightly coupled with ep_engine.cc as it uses
the getHooksApi() function to obtain the memory allocator
hooks.

Firstly this makes it hard to test - compile one file and you have to
include the other, and it's also difficult to provide a different
hooks api - either for injecting a mock one for testing, or simply to
use the 'normal' hooks API but without pulling in ep-engine.

Secondly, there is unnecessary indirection in NewHook / DeleteHook -
which are called on every new/delete so performance is relevent
there. By giving the MemoryTracker it's own copy of the alloc_hooks
(instead of calling getHooksApi() on every call) we can reduce the
amount of work in NewHook / DeleteHook by approx. 50% (measured in
terms of x64 instructions).
