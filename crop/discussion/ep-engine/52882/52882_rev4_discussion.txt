DESCRIPTION

MB-15523: Respect alog_task_time during initialization/reset

With this change access scanner will start at alog_task_time (GMT)
from configuration during initialization. If alog_sleep_time were
set to 'x' throuch cbepctl, access scanner will get kicked off at
'x' minutes from now. If alog_task_time were set to 'y', access
scanner will get kicked off at 'y' (GMT), and will repeat after an
interval 'x'.

Line:41, src/access_scanner.h -> Please avoid putting the function body in a header fie if the function isn't simple enough (e.g., one or a couple of simple statements).

In addition, I don't understand exactly what the issue is currently and what this change tries to fix. I would like to hold this change at this time.

Line:41, src/access_scanner.h -> I will move the constructor to the .cc file.

We don't use alogTaskTime to set the task time for access scanner anywhere in today's code. This change ensures that the initial alogTaskTime (which is set to 2AM GMT) actually works. Also whenever alogTaskTime is changed through cbepctl, this change will ensure that alogTaskTime is actually updated.

Line:41, src/access_scanner.h -> I still don't understand what you meant. Please add the unit test to verify that the alog task time doesn't work as expected, but verify your fix resolve the issue.
