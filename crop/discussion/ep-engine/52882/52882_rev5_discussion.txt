from configuration during initialization. If alog_sleep_time were
set to 'x' throuch cbepctl, access scanner will get kicked off at

scanner will get kicked off at 'y' (GMT), and will repeat after an
interval 'x'.

Line:149, src/access_scanner.cc -> Style: Given there's quite a large set of items in the initialiser list, I generally prefer putting one on each line to aid in readability.

Line:158, src/access_scanner.cc -> Don't use time - instead use the interfaces in server_api.h:

 serverApi->core->abstime()

and 
 serverApi->core->realtime()

These have the advantage they are mockable when running in engine_testapp, and hence you can write a unit test which "time travels" forward to validate your code - see testHarness.time_travel().

Line:171, src/access_scanner.cc -> Given that the range [0..23] is validated by configuration.json, it's probably worth reporting an error if the if() statement fails - or even just remove the if statement and apply a modulus 24 to the startTime for maximum robustness.
