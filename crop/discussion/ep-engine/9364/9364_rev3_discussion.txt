DESCRIPTION

Always send TAP_VBUCKET_SET commands for takeover reconnections.

If cluster rebalance stopped due to internal errors or user
actions, the ns-server sets a pending vbucket in the destination
node to a dead vbucket. The ns-server janitor periodically (every
10 sec) collects the list of dead vbuckets from the cluster and
then sends vbucket deletion commands to the nodes having dead
vbuckets. Consequently, if cluster rebalance resumes, the
destination node might receive items from the source node, which
belong to the dead vbucket that has been already deleted. This
causes the source node to close the TAP connection constantly.

To prevent this racing issue, when the source node receives a
vbucket takeover reconnection from eBucketMigrator, it should
always send TAP_VBUCKET_SET "pending" command to the destination
node so that it can instantiate the pending vbucket if not exist.

Trond, as you pointed out, we should clear vbucket state change messages that were requeued by rollback operation.
