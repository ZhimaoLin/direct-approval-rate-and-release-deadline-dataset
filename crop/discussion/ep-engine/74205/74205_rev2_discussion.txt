DESCRIPTION

Add BucketType to KVBucket class to identify if it is EP or Ephemeral

Modules invoking bucket functionality or the bucket module itself need
to be able to easily identify the type of the Bucket easily.

This commit adds a new enum class BucketType for this purpose.

Line:24, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> why not override getBucketType() in this class like:

    BucketType getBucketType() const override {
        return BucketType::Ephemeral;
    }

Line:756, src/kv_bucket.h -> Why do we override it in this class and not just in the actual implementations?

Line:871, src/kv_bucket.h -> This should be const as it can't change (iff we want to override it here)
