DESCRIPTION

Add BucketType to KVBucket class to identify if it is EP or Ephemeral

Modules invoking bucket functionality or the bucket module itself need
to be able to easily identify the type of the Bucket easily.

This commit adds a new enum class BucketType for this purpose.

Patch Set 3:

Will, saw about typeid.
If typeid is used then we will have to do a comparison like typeid(EPBucket) == getBucketType(ptr). That did not seem as elegant as BucketType::Persistent == getBucketType(ptr).
Also googling suggested (not very conclusively though) that RTTI may not be that efficient as dynamic casting.
So thought will keep it this way. If you can convince me that RTTI is better than this then do not mind using that.

**
typeid(EPBucket) == ptr->getBucketType() vs BucketType::Persistent == ptr->getBucketType()
