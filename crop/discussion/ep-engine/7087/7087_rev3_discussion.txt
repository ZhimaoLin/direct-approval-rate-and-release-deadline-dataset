I think we can get this just a bit cleaner.

Line:118, configuration.json -> I think this is a bit too much c++ code in the JSON.  How about something more like this:

    "validator": "range": {"min": 1, "max": 10000000}

...then we write it out a bit more abstractly.  Perhaps validators are set up like this:

    new SizeRangeValidator().min(1).max(10000000)
