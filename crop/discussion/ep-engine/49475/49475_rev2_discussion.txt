DESCRIPTION

MB-14374: Properly find the latest rollback point

If we have received a full snapshot on disk then we want to use the
snapshot end sequence number, but if we are in the middle of a
snapshot then we want to use the snapshot start sequence number. We
can figure out what to use by checking the last sequence number
persisted.
