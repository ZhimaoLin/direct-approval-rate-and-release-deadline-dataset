Line:2157, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> For future reference, we are trying to not include customer sensitive data (e.g. keys) in log messages. I know the existing log messages in this file don't adhere to this (and that's why I'm not down voting this - we might as well fix them all at once).
