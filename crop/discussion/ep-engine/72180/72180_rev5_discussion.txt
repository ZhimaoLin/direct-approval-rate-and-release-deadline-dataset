DESCRIPTION

MB-19955: Set connectionManagerInterval to one second

Unfortuately due an error with the following merge
Ib6f810c42ed6a4a7f473d1f157e890b0593387cb the connection manager
interval was set from one to two.

The result is that even though the noop interval setting remained at
one when there is no DCP traffic we snooze for the connection manager
interval before sending a noop.  This caused noops to be sent every two
seconds as opposed to every second.

This patch changes the connection manager interval back to one second.
In addition it checks when setting the noop interval that it is a
multiple of the connection manager interval.  If not an ENGINE_ENOTSUP
error is returned.

A corresponding test has also been added.

Line:613, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I think %z is a Linux / OS X extension. Safer to just cast the internal to uint32_t or similar and use PRIu32.

Line:613, src/dcp/producer.cc -> It would be nice to just get a typesafe string formatting library at some point (e.g. fmt which is nearly as fast as printf https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)

Line:613, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Strictly speaking we should probably use PRIu64 and uint64_t, given that size_t is less than uint32_t on most of our platforms, but given that this is just for a log message (and I'm not sure people will have connection_manager_intervals which are greater than 2^32. 

(apologies for leading you astray, I was thinking getConnectionManagerInterval was a uint32_t) :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:613, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Changed to PRIu64 and casting to uint64_t for the getConnectionManagerInterval.
