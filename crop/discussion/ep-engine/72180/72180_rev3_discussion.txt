DESCRIPTION

MB-19955: Set connectionManagerInterval to 1 second

Unfortuately due an error with the following merge
Ib6f810c42ed6a4a7f473d1f157e890b0593387cb the connection manager
interval was set from 1 to 2.

The result is that even though the noop interval setting remained at 1
then there is no DCP traffic we snooze for the connection manager
interval before sending a noop.  This caused noops to be sent every 2
seconds as opposed to every second.

This patch change the connection manager interval back to 1 second.
In addition it check when setting the noop interval that it is a
multiple of the connection manager interval.  If not an ENGINE_ENOTSUP
error is returned.

A corresponding test has also been added.
