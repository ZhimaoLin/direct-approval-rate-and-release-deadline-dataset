Line:61, src/dcp/stream.cc -> More consistent to name this to_string() as that's what we name elsewhere.

Line:143, src/dcp/stream.h -> Style: We use Uppercase names for enum classes (see https://github.com/Piper Jefferson/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)

Line:61, src/dcp/stream.cc -> The problem with naming to_string is that it ls like we are converting the Stream name to string, where as its the snapshot type.

I have reverted back to snapshotTypeToString - unless there is a better name?

Line:143, src/dcp/stream.h -> Sorry - did a naive copy.  Fixed.

Line:61, src/dcp/stream.cc -> enum classes can have methods on them - hence the `classes`. Just move this method to be on SnapshotType.
