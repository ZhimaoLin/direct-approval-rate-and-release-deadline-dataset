DESCRIPTION

Reporting accurate vbtakeover stats for active streams

If a DCP active stream's cursor was dropped by checkpoint
remover's cursor dropper, then until the reconnection
is made by the consumer, dcp-vbtakeover stats should
report the best available information rather than stating
"stream not found".
