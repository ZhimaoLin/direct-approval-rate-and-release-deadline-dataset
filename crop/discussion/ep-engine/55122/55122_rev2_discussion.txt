DESCRIPTION

Reporting accurate vbtakeover stats for active streams

If a DCP active stream's cursor was dropped by checkpoint
remover's cursor dropper, then until the reconnection
is made by the consumer, dcp-vbtakeover stats should
report the best available information rather than stating
"stream not found".

Line:625, src/dcp/producer.cc -> 1) Why do you ned a bool return ?
2) If add_stat is done inside the function then maybe adding "stats" to function name would be good for readability. Otherwise return the required parameter and then add the stat in the calling function

Line:4685, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> stringstream not needed. Using std::string stats_takeover("dcp-vbtakeover 0 " + name); should be ok

Line:625, src/dcp/producer.cc -> See above where I'm using the boolean return status.

As for the name, I could change it to something more meaningful.

Line:4685, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Done
