DESCRIPTION

Rename 'flush' (delete all items) to 'deleteAll'

Internally ep-engine refers to two very different things as 'flush':

1) The act of writing outstanding modifications to disk (FlusherTask,
   flushVBucket etc).
2) The act of deleting all items in a bucket.

This can be confusing / misleading. Given that (1) has a lot more code
associated with it and is probably the more common usage, rename
things relating to (2) to 'delete all'.
