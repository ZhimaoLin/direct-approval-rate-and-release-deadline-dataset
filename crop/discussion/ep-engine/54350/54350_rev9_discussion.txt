DESCRIPTION

clear_UNLOCKED function is always LOCKED

The lock refers to the streamMutex.  Therefore when
calling clear_UNLOCKED it is expected that
streamMutex is not held.  However it is held in all
cases the function is invoked and therefore the
function is renamed to clear_LOCKED.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I agree it's not massively clear, but this is the convention throughout all of ep-engine - _UNLOCKED suffixed functions mean that they /themselves/ do not acquire any locks...

Abandoned

UNLOCKED means the function does not attempt to acquire any locks.
Consequently I'm abandoning the change.
