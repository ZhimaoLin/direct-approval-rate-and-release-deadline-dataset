DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-19567: Don't set bucket creation to false during vbucket reset"

This reverts commit 1cc0b30b7b04ee0c390fc4b3c4bae5b62fd6d900.

While the commit does address one possible edge-case where a vBucket
file is not immediately recreated after resetVBucket(), it is
incomplete (the bug still occurs), and having this partial fix only
complicates the code.

Reverting the fix and solving the issue in a different way in
follow-up.
