DESCRIPTION

JCBC-744: xxx@xxx.xxx annotated fields in the document body.

Motivation
----------
Without this change, every property annotated xxx@xxx.xxx will be
included in the JSON content, which just duplicates information
and should be ignored.

Modifications
-------------
Skip properties for the content which have xxx@xxx.xxx annotation.

Result
------
ID fields are not duplicated in the content.
