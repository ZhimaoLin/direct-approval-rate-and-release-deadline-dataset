DESCRIPTION

JCBC-894: Support older servers without controllers and index

Motivation:

Older versions of Couchbase without a controllers or replicaIndex entry
can cause a NullPointerException in getBuckets.

Modifications:
----------------
Controller and replicaIndex are evaluated defensively in case they are
not found in the configuration to avoid NullPointerException.
