DESCRIPTION

JCBC-894: Support older servers without controllers and index

Motivation:
-------------
Older versions of Couchbase without a controllers or replicaIndex entry
can cause a NullPointerException in getBuckets.

Modifications:
----------------
Controller and replicaIndex are evaluated defensively in case they are
not found in the configuration to avoid NullPointerException.

integration test BucketManagerTest breaks with this change

Line:138, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> this should be getBoolean, the corresponding JSON field isn't a string and so this generates a ClassCastException
