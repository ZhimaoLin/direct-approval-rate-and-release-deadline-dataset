DESCRIPTION

JCBC-894: Support older servers without controllers and index

Motivation:
-------------
Older versions of Couchbase without a controllers or replicaIndex entry
can cause a NullPointerException in getBuckets.

Modifications:
----------------
Controller and replicaIndex are evaluated defensively in case they are
not found in the configuration to avoid NullPointerException.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

sorry to get all nitpicky, but there is a line with a trailing whitespace and the following line is indented with tabs instead of spaces.
After that, it'll be all good (ran the integration test again and it now works correctly)
