Patch Set 2:

I'll follow up on that, because it should be possible for someone external to couchbase to create a Jira ticket without problem.

My goal in creating the ticket myself was that it wouldn't slow things down, while sticking to the standard we have in our commit history ;)

I couldn't find you in the autocompletion list of names when trying to put you as reporter of the change though, so it may be something needs validation first...
