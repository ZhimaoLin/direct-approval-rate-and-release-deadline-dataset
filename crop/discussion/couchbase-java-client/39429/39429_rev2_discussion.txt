DESCRIPTION

JCBC-488: Make sure headers are overriden, not appended on readd.

Motivation
----------
If a view operation needs to be retried, the current code adds headers
instead of overwriting them, which leads to broken http requests. As a
result, the server responds with 400 and is unable to process the query.

Modifications
-------------
Changing the code from addHeader to setHeaders overrides the headers
instead of appending them.

Result
------
Valid HTTP requests, even if it needs to be retried.
