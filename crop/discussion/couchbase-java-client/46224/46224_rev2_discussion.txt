DESCRIPTION

JCBC-698: Increase disconnect timeout and make Bucket#close() use it.

Motivation
----------
After closer inspection, the disconnect timeout set to 5 seconds looked too
short. It  has been increased to 25 seconds. Also, the bucket close method
was using the management timeout, but of course should also use the
disconnect timeout.
