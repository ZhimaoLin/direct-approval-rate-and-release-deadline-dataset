Line:21, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> while you are here, maybe expand this start?

Line:44, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> is InetAddress still used?

Line:473, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/query/core/N1qlQueryExecutor.java -> why not NetworkAddress?

Line:21, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> yep

Line:473, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/query/core/N1qlQueryExecutor.java -> the query request still expects it, we need more core changes .. but I want to tackle it in smaller changes not all by one
