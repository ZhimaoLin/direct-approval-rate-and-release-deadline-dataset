DESCRIPTION

JCBC-725: expose n1ql metrics as a specific object

Motivation
----------
The info() part of the query response describes the metrics in N1QL.
Those are quite well defined and could be represented by a specific
class instead of the raw generic JsonObject.

Modifications
-------------
Introduced QueryMetrics, constructed from a metrics JsonObject.
All query results (sync and async) now return this instead of a more
generic JsonObject.

Additionally, improved the documentation of AsyncQueryResult and
QueryResult and marked some classes/interfaces as Experimental.

Added a unit test case for QueryMetrics.

Results
-------
Extracting meaningful information from the info() part is now easier.
One can still access the underlying raw data by calling asJsonObject().
