Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I'm -2 on this until I have a good idea of what the *right* thing is to do here.  If we up the dependencies, then we force users to that or newer since we're testing only with this. 

If we stick with older ones, then we can (reasonably) depend on forward compatibility.

It'd be good to get this one worked out soon

Patch Set 1:

I think we should abandon this and re-think it as part of our 1.2 efforts!
