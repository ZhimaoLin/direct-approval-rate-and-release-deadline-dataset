DESCRIPTION

JCBC-962: Refactor SearchParams into SearchQuery

Motivation
----------
Most SDKs don't have the concept of a N1qlParams separate object for
storing query-level parameters, so it has been decided that the FTS
API would not include such an object either, but rather allow setting
of the global request parameters through a "builder" fluent API on the
SearchQuery root object.

Modifications
-------------
Removed SearchParams. All methods now are in SearchQuery.
SearchQuery is in charge of exporting the whole JSON through query()
method.
It does so by preparing a JsonObject, injecting parameters into it and
letting the AbstractFtsQuery inject its payload into another "query"
JsonObject.

Tests have been modified to take that refactor into account.

Result
------
Setting of FTS top level parameters is simpler, just using SearchQuery,
and marshalling to JSON is simpler as well, by just calling export().
