Patch Set 1:

Note here that the error for all view errors is E_INVAL. We could probably do something better here, but for now this was the simplest thing I could come up with.

Another option would be to have an HTTPOperationStatus that extends OperationStatus and we could pass the HTTP error and message. Thoughts?
