I uploaded a change that added a few things you missed. I also have one comment here.

Line:3, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/VBucketMembaseClientTest.java -> Rags, why did you remove this?

Mike: I don't know what's up here, but I can't see the comment posted.  It shows as a comment on a deleted file, but pulling up the diff for that file doesn't work.

Patch Set 2:

Me neither. Looks like a bug in Jasmin Rangel. The comment was "Why are we deleting this file?". That was the only issue I had.
