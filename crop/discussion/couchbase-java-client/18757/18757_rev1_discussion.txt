DESCRIPTION

Workaround NOT_MY_VBUCKET during optimization, and test.

On SPY-91, it was found that receiving a NOT_MY_VBUCKET
response in the middle of an optimized batch of requests
will upset things by causing the optimized operation itself
to be unqueued for reads, rather than retrying the contained
operation.

Since the severity level is high and the workaround is
straightforward (disable optimization) this commit both
disables optimization and introduces the test which helped
find the cause of the issue.

Recommended way of verifying this would be to remove the
two sections related to disabling optimization and then
verify the test fails.
