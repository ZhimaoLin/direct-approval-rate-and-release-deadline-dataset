DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1028 Add XATTR support

Motivation
----------
Allow extened attribute access in subdocument api

Changes
-------
Builder for sub-document options. Moved createParents, added extended
attribute flag in the options builder. Deprecated the overloads with
createParents and added overloads with builder. Verified using
SubdocumentExtendedAttributesTest, on a separate class from Subdocument tests
as they are enabled on different server versions

Results
-------
Extended attributes can be accessed by setting attributeAccess in
options.
