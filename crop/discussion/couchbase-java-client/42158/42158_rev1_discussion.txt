DESCRIPTION

JCBC-587: Never quote start/endKeyDocId in the ViewQuery

Motivation
----------
start/endKeyDocIDs are never JSON and therefore are not allowed to be quoted,
breaking the queries when used from the SDK.

Modifications
-------------
Quotes have been removed to correctly send it over HTTP to the view engine.

Result
------
Both fields can now be properly utilized in a view query.
