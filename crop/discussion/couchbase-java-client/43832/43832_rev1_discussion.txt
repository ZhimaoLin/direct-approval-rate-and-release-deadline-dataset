DESCRIPTION

JCBC-640: Improve Null handling in JsonValues

Motivation
----------
There is currently a NULL constant in JsonValue but it cannot be added
in a JsonObject or JsonArray. Furthermore, when one wants to add a null
value to a JsonObject, one has to perform an explicit cast in order to
do it (though the target type doesn't matter).

We aim at providing more ways to handle nulls int JsonObject and Array
and to make those options either more explicit or natural (principle of
least astonishement).

Modifications
-------------
Added putNull method in JsonObject and addNull method in JsonArray.

Furthermore, put(String, Object) and add(Object) respectively recognize
JsonValue.NULL and treat it as a simple null value.

JsonValue.NULL can also be contained in a Map or List passed to the
factory methods of respectively JsonObject and JsonArray and will also
be treated as a simple null value in this case.

Added relevant unit tests.
Added an integration test in JsonDocumentTest to check that null values
are correclty persisted and loaded back.

Result
------
Various ways for the user to include a null value in his JsonObjects or
JsonArrays.
New tests related to nulls pass.
