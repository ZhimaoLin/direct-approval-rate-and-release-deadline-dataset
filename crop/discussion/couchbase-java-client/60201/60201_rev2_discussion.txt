DESCRIPTION

wip subdoc v2

all operations except multi lookup throw on most errors

PATH_NOT_FOUND is treated specially:
single get doesn't throw but content null
single exists doesn't throw but content false
multi get's content is null for PATH_NOT_FOUND, while multi exists is false (but in both case, DocumentFragment.exists returns false since it detects the error)
