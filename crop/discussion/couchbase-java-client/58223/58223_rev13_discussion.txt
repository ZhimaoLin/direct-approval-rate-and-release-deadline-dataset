DESCRIPTION

JCBC-849: Subdocument client API

Motivation:
-----------
Subdocument API allows to mutate and read specific fragments of JSON
inside an existing document without having to transfer the whole
document over the wire.

Modifications:
--------------
Added the DocumentFragment class, both serving as an input parameter
for mutation and a return parameter. Additionally to what would be
available in a top-level Document, it also bears a path (pointing to a
specific value inside the JSON).

Added Bucket level API for Subdoc:
 - simple operations (getIn, existIn, insertIn, replaceIn, upsertIn,
   removeIn)
 - array operations (extendIn, arrayInsertIn, addUniqueIn)
 - arithmetic operation (counterIn)
 - multiple lookups (lookupIn)
 - multiple mutations (mutateIn)

Multi operations have their own return types.

Added associated exceptions as subclasses of SubDocumentException.

A dedicated interface for transcoding in subdoc (SubdocumentTranscoder)
has been added. A default implementation based on Jackson shares code
with JsonTranscoder, so this code was mutualized into TranscoderUtils.

This cannot be customized for now but could be in the future.

Result:
-------
The subdoc API can be used for efficient modification of JSON documents.
Integration tests validate the behavior of the API on cluster >= 4.5.0.
