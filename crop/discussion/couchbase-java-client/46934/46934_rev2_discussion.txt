DESCRIPTION

JCBC-711: Prepare statements to be Serializable

Motivation
----------
In order to use N1QL capabilities in Spark, Query implementations must
be Serializable. This in turns necessitate the underlying statements to
be Serializable...

Modifications
-------------
Introduced an intermediary interface to explicitly distinguish between
the (non-serializable) DSL and other statements. Used this interface in
AbstractQuery to ensure all its fields are Serializable.

Each statement used in various Query implementations is now of the
SerializableStatement kind. When passing in a DSL, it is converted to a
Serializable alternative using RawStatement.

Result
------
Statements stored in Query implementations are now Serializable, paving
the way to fully Serializable queries.
