DESCRIPTION

JCBC-804: Support RYOW with MutationTokens

Motivation
----------
Couchbase Server "watson" provides mechanisms for optimized
RYOW where the client passes in mutation tokens retrieved at
mutation operations.

This changeset is aimed to complete the API so that the
tokens can be passed in at n1ql query time and are used
when making the n1ql request.

Modifications
-------------
The changeset adds AT_PLUS as a consistency parameter to the
ScanConsistency enum and also implements the appropriate
method in the N1qlParams section.

Note that only if AT_PLUS is used the passed in tokens are
considered. If no tokens are provided and AT_PLUS is used
an exception is thrown to indicate this misuse.

Result
------
Optimized RYOW is now possible with n1ql and watson by
making use of the mutation tokens.

thanks for the early review - I wait until we have a build where it works so I can really verify and then I'll merge it in.
