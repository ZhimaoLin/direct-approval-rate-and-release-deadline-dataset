DESCRIPTION

JCBC-804: Support RYOW with MutationTokens

Motivation
----------
Couchbase Server "watson" provides mechanisms for optimized
RYOW where the client passes in mutation tokens retrieved at
mutation operations.

This changeset is aimed to complete the API so that the
tokens can be passed in at n1ql query time and are used
when making the n1ql request.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the consistentWith(Bucket, MutatedDocument...) overload
that allows the user to pass in mutation tokens, which will be
passed down to the query engine.

Note that in subsequent changesets, more overloads with advanced
functionality will be provided.

Result
------
Optimized RYOW is now possible with n1ql and watson by
making use of the mutation tokens.
