DESCRIPTION

JCBC-744: Extend repository API to CRUD ops.

Motivation
----------
Previously only simple get and upsert were implemented, this
changeset adds full CRUD capabilities.

Modifications
-------------
Both the sync and async repository API has been extended and
proxies through to the underlying bucket API. Tests have been
added to assert basic CRUD type functionality through the object
mapping API.

Result
------
More methods available on the repository, but still not fully
on par with the bucket level APIs.
