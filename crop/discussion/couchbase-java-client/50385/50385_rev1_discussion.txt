DESCRIPTION

JCBC-764: fix index creation DSL

Motivation
----------
The N1QL was incorrect, which led to the Index creation DSL being
incorrect:
 - where clause should be before using clause, not after
 - with clause should not use backticks

Modifications
-------------
Removed backticks from WithIndexOptionElement.

Modified path for CREATE INDEX so that WHERE comes before USING.

Results
-------
The full DSL for secondary index creation is now correct.
