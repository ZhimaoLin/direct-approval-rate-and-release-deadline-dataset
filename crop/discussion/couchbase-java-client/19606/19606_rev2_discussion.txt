DESCRIPTION

JCBC-96: Remove the queue mechanism in ViewConnection

This change removes the queueing mechanism that hold operations
before being given to an individual ViewNode. The operations are
now passed directly to a ViewNode and if there are too many
operations then they are held as pending requests until the
ViewNode is ready to process them. On node shutdown the pending
ops are requeued through a callback function that redistributes
them equally to the rest of the ViewNodes.

Generally this looks pretty good, but I have some minor concerns.  Further digging shows I either don't understand part of the code or there are longer standing issues.  :)

Line:205, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> Where does newServers come from?  It doesn't seem to be coming in this reconfiguration?

Line:207, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> This might be legacy, but are we using the couchApiBase from the config here?

Line:147, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> info level logging?  Probably error or at least warning is appropriate.

Line:226, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> This comment isn't really accurate, is it?

Line:105, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> here we use warn when canceling, but this makes more sense in interrupted (an unexpected case).

Line:121, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> and here we use errror.

Patch Set 2:

Okay, I'll address these, but none of these comments are about changes I made. They are from code that was already there.
