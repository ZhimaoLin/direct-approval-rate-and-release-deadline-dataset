DESCRIPTION

JCBC-987: Add observe support for subdoc mutateIn

(Todo):
  - javadocs
  - integration tests

Motivation
----------
Since a subdoc mutation is very similar to a regular kv-based
mutation it is important to also optionally check for the given
durability requirements. The support is all there, it just needs
to be exposed properly on both the blocking and non-blocking APIs.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds more variants to the execute() method on the
MutateInBuilder (both sync and async) which, after a successful
subdoc mutation, performs the durability requirement polling.

It behaves exactly like the fulldocument counterpart.

Result
------
It is now possible to specify durability requirements for subdoc
mutations.
