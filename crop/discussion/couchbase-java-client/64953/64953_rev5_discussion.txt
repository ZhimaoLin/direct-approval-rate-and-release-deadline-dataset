 - squid:S1854 - Dead stores should be removed.
 - squid:ClassVariableVisibilityCheck - Class variable fields should
   not have public accessibility.
 - squid:CommentedOutCodeLine - Sections of code should not be
   "commented out".
 - squid:S1481 - Unused local variables should be removed.
 - squid:S2786 - Nested "enum"s should not be declared static.

Modifications
-------------
The fixes proposed by Sonar that made sense have been applied,
improving code quality.
