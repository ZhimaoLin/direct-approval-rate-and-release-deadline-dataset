Line:287, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseCluster.java -> rather that blindly delete this, I'd prefer to use `trans` instead of `transcoders` in the call below.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The ticket doesn't match the content of this change, and first line is wayyy too long

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please flesh out, refer to Sonar and squid rules there rather than in title...

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Pleas hard wrap at 72 characters (and try to limit to 52 for the first line "title" of the commit message).

Once again, you don't give a Code-Review score to your own change. What you do is ensure the unit and integration tests pass and notify that you've done so (and they do pass) by giving a "Verified" score: use the Reply... button, check +1 on the "Verified" row.

Line:287, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseCluster.java -> actually after verification, the transcoder field is only in CouchbaseAsyncBucket and passing it to the async method is sufficient
