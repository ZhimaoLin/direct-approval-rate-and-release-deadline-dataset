Line:39, ivy/libraries.properties -> This seems like too many dependencies for spring integration. Do we really need all of them? The memcached spring integration only requires one dependency.

Line:69, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> The memcached integration with spring doesn't require us to generate a file. Is it possible to write a test without doing this?

Line:138, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> The file you created must be deleted.

Line:30, ivy/ivysettings.xml -> Most of the spring stuff looks like it can be found in the default m2 repo. Why do we need this? Also, milestone is wrong here.
