Patch Set 2: Do not submit

(6 inline comments)

It'd be good to see some kind of sample in here too.  The current test doesn't quite look correct with that cfb, right?  A sample would make things simpler.

Line:41, ivy/libraries.properties -> are these M2 versions releases?  I don't know myself so they could be,but I just don't know.

Line:149, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> Why is there a cast here?

Line:162, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> what's the difference between this one and the one above?

Line:170, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> why are these here if the bean is doing the work?

Line:172, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> Shouldn't this use value, from above?

Line:32, ivy/ivysettings.xml -> milestone?  not release?
