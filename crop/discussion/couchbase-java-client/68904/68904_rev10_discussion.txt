DESCRIPTION

JCBC-900 Datastructures support

Motivation
----------
Provide higher level data structure support over Subdoc APIs. This aims
for a rich developer experience by ready-to-use data structures like
list, map, queue and set for creating and populating couchbase
documents.

Results
-------
Added CouchbaseList, CouchbaseMap, CouchbaseQueue and CouchbaseSet data
structures. Synchronous and asynchronous apis are added to bucket level
interface where each operation needs underlying backing document id.
There is also a direct data structure api to continue working on a single
document which mimicks a collection except that it is asynchronous.
