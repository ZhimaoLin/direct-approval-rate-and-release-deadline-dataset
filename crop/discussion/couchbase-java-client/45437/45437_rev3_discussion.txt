DESCRIPTION

JCBC-683: allow raw statements in Query

Motivation
----------
Some statements like "CREATE PRIMARY INDEX" are not supported by the DSL
and we should offer users a way of doing them.

Modifications
-------------
Added overloads to simple/parametrized factory methods in Query for such
statements.

Added test of a simple raw statement to N1QL.

Results
-------
Users can issue non-DSL statements like "CREATE PRIMARY INDEX".
