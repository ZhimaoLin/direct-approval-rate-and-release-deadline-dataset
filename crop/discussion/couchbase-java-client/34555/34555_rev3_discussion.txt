DESCRIPTION

WIP: Fixing issues with rebalance & cccp in general

BucketConfigurationProvider:

- Make sure that configs marked as outdated are not propagated up the
  stack but instead an outdated signal is raised, eventually leading
  to a fresh new correct configuration.

- When carrier config is used, register a connection observer that
  gets notified once the connection is closed and shuts it down, also
  signalling an outdated configuration, leading to a fresh new correct
  configuration.

- Simplifying the HTTP reconfiguration to only subscribe in one place.

CouchbaseConnection:

- Do not queue a node for reconnect if it is not part of the cluster
  anymore.
