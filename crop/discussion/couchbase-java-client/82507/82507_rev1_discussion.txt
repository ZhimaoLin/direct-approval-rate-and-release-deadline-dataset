DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1111: Handle LOCKED in conversions.

Motivation
----------
As port for XERROR and Couchbase Server 5.0, we need to properly
handle the LOCKED response code coming from core-io.

Modifications
-------------
First a new battery of tests has been added to avoid regressions
and cover all the previous use cases. Then the bucket and subdoc
helper converters are modified to map the LOCKED status to their
backwards compatible counterparts.

Result
------
Properly handling the new LOCKED status code in combination with
XERROR and 5.0
