DESCRIPTION

JCBC-947: Close testcontext bucket before deleting it

Motivation
----------
Not closing an adhoc Bucket before deleting it at the end of a test run
can lead to authentication errors logs, especially starting with 4.5.

Modifications
-------------
CouchbaseTestContext's destroyBucketAndDisconnect method now also
closes the bucket before triggering its deletion (if adhoc).

Result
------
Less false positive errors in test logs.
