Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We don't have to change the assertions, but it would be good if we do.  I'm mainly concerned about that one exception.  I'll check on that though in a bit.

Otherwise, I think we're good here!

Thanks!

Line:31, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/ViewException.java -> Hm, doesn't OperationException extends IOException which makes it checked?

I will file a bug to change all of the assertions and try to get around to it later.

Line:31, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/ViewException.java -> It is checked, but I'm not sure why you think this is incorrect. Checked exceptions are used for errors that outside of the programs control. If we wanted to throw an unchecked exception then the correct place to throw that would be before we sent the query.
