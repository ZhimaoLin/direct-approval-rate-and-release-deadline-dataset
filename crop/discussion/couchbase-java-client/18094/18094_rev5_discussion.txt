Sorry, there's one more issue here in the test changes, otherwise it's good!

Line:289, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> In this case, you should just do a fail("message") since you're catching the exception and have determined it's a failure case.  assertTrue(true) is a bit of a noop.  :)
