DESCRIPTION

JCBC-895: Prevent overflow on MAX_VALUE retry

Motivation:
-----------
Retry attempt being set to Integer.MAX_VALUE actually causes an
overflow because the internal retry mechanism adds 1 to the given
attempt limit.

Modifications:
--------------
RetryBuilder and RetryWithDelayHandler both cap the maxAttempt parameter
to Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1 and document this limitation of their input.

DefaultAsyncBucketMananger was setting such a maxAttempt so it has been
modified as well to directly provide a correct value.

Unit tests added to check that the input value of maxAttempts is
decremented by one if it is MAX_VALUE.

Result:
-------
No more "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Count can not be negative"
error when the maxAttempts is set to MAX_VALUE.
