Line:183, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryTest.java -> I guess this assertion does align with the wrong implementation of the code, because it needs to run in a different thread, be killed then and then checked on the  iterations and wait time.

Line:400, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> not sure what you did here, but this waitTime definitely overrides the one in the class definition.

What's the purpose of it?

Line:425, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> that's the wrong way to use it. use the methods on doingResubscribe to modify its sate safely!

Line:427, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> You're breaking the logic here. It should always resubscribe, not only when the maxWaitTime is reached.. the max time is just the upper threshold where it should not increment the wait time further.

It is supposed to loop forever until it finds something.
