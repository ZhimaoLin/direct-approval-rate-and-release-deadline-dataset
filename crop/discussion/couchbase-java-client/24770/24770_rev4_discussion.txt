Patch Set 4: Verified

Hi Michael,

I have changed the subscribe logic in the Mock class and the Connection factory just catches the Connection Exception and sets the value of doResubscribe as true when its false.
I have verified it. It works fine. 

Let me know if this meets the requirement.

Thanks !
Deepti
