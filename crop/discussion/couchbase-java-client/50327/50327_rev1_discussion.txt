DESCRIPTION

JCBC-756: DSL for all N1QL functions

WIP: Needs Date, JSON, Meta, Number, Object, Pattern-Matching, String,
Type categories. Needs test coverage for Case and Collection.

Motivation
----------
N1QL comes with a large set of functions in different categories, that
should be implemented in corresponding helper classes in the form of
Expression-returning functions.

Modifications
-------------
Added helper classes with all functions (providing high-value overloads
when relevant), in the following categories:
 - Aggregate
 - Array
 - Comparison
 - Conditional

Each is covered by unit tests.

Results
-------
Users can now call N1QL from within the DSL.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2 Verified+1

only partially covering the whole of functions, but what is implemented is also tested, I'd advise reviewing (without CR-scoring) this before next patchset ;)
