DESCRIPTION

JCBC-756: DSL for all N1QL functions

WIP: Needs Type categories.
Needs test coverage for Case and Collection.

Motivation
----------
N1QL comes with a large set of functions in different categories, that
should be implemented in corresponding helper classes in the form of
Expression-returning functions.

Modifications
-------------
Added helper classes with all functions (providing high-value overloads
when relevant), in the following categories:
 - Aggregate
 - Array
 - Comparison
 - Conditional
 - Date
 - JSON
 - Meta
 - Number
 - Object
 - Pattern Matching
 - String

Each is covered by unit tests.

Results
-------
Users can now call N1QL from within the DSL.
