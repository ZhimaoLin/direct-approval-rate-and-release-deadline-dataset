DESCRIPTION

Revert Subdoc (JCBC-849, JCBC-909)

This reverts commits 3fc6a62fd89c15dcc9f392593cf56020fb1ddc3a
and 5268f792f933a8d4fce37168705d4d0967b1f265 (toString on lookupSpec).

Motivation:
-----------
The subdoc protocol and common SDK API is still being evaluated and
could see breaking changes between here and Watson DP. Exposing an API
that is likely to be incompatible with any public server version does
not make sense so subdoc is on hold until both client API design and
protocol implementation are stabilized.
