DESCRIPTION

Suggestion: Correction for includeDocs = flase option

Motivation
----------
'includeDocs = false' option should have NULL for each documents.

Modifications
-------------
don't call bucket.get() for explicit NULL document.

Result
------
intentional includeDocs=false can get only view query result,
which is much more faster result than original
since do not waiste redundant network resources for getting each document.
