DESCRIPTION

JCBC-978: Fix Index DSL "WITH nodes" option

Motivation:
-----------
When creating a N1QL index, the WITH nodes option should be passed to
the service as a JSON array of node names. However, the index DSL is
not exporting an array.

Modifications:
--------------
Added "withXXX" methods that support passing in multiple node names, and
made all nodes-related processing produce a JSON array.

Results:
--------
Indexes can be created on specific node(s) using the Index DSL.
