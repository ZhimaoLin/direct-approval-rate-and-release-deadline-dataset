just some nits, this is good. One ask though:

- can you please double check this also works for views, fts and analytics? I saw you did some changes for the n1ql raw query, but we also should do this for n1ql non-raw, views fts and analytics.

Line:74, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/Blocking.java -> should we guard it with if(!isUnsubscribed) ?

Line:91, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/OnSubscribeDeferAndWatch.java -> unrelated?
