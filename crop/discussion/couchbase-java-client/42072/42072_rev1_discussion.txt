DESCRIPTION

JCBC-579: Custom equals() methods for DesignDocument and DefaultView

Motivation
----------
Comparisons are often needed during unit tests or if someone wants to
publish views in an automated manner upfront. Without those custom equals
its very cumbersome to verify equality on all possible fields.

Modifications
-------------
Custom equals methods added based on the properties of the objects, allowing
for a simple DesignDocument.equals(DesignDocument).

Result
------
Equality checks on all possible fields are now very easy.
