DESCRIPTION

JCBC-926: Index management of named primary indexes

Motivation:
-----------
Since the Index DSL allows creation and drop of custom named primary
indexes, the Index Management API can also offer to deal with this.

Modifications:
--------------
BucketManager and async version now have 2 additional methods which take
an index name for a primary index: createNamedPrimaryIndex and its drop
counterpart dropNamedPrimaryIndex. This allows for creation of several
primary indexes.

Results:
--------
Named primary indexes can be dealt with in the Index Management API.
