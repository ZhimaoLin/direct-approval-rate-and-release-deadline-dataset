DESCRIPTION

JCBC-580: Custom equals for Documents and JsonArray/JsonObject.

Motivation
----------
Documents and the underlying content types should be able to be
compared easily. This satisfies use cases where a document is
loaded and compared with a different one. Adding custom
equals methods prevents the developer from doing deep
assertions themselves.

Modifications
-------------
Custom equals and hashcodes are applied which take the nested
data into account.

Result
------
It is easy to compare documents and their underlying contents.
