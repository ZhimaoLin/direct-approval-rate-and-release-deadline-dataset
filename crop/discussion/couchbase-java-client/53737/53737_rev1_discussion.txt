DESCRIPTION

JCBC-818: Disable Prepared Statements for DP2

Motivation
----------
The implementation has changed twice already and the server side
communication protocol is still heavily in flux.

This changeset disables prepared statements until we can bring it
back in a solid and supported fashion for 2.2.0 GA.
