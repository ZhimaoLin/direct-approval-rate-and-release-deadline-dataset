DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1020 Collections like interface for datastructures

Motivation
----------
Create a separate class for the data structures and provide a
collections like interface

Changes
-------
Created separate classes for the data structures. They implement methods
which have similar naming convention to collections, however they do not
extend from the standard collections interface due to method signature
conflicts. The implementations are just wrappers around the existing
bucket level data structure methods. Verified correctness with
datastructure tests.

Results
-------
CouchbaseList, CouchbaseMap, CouchbaseQueue, CouchbaseSet classes added.
