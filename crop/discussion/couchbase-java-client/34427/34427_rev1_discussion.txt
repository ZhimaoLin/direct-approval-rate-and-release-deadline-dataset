DESCRIPTION

JCBC-427: Re-Attach monitor after rebootstrap.

If a http streaming connection is outdated and a new one needs to
be established, make sure that the provider is re-registered as
a listener on the new one. Otherwise, it can happen that new configurations
get loaded, but never propagated to the upper layers.
