DESCRIPTION

CCCP: Update Config from NMVB-Responses.

This changeset build on the SPY foundation to pass on NMVB-Responses and
passes it on, after some initial wildcard conversion, directly to the
ConfigurationProvider.

The config then gets parsed and stored as any other configuration coming
from a streaming response. A test case is added to veriy that behaviour.

Patch Set 1:

This change is not really invasive, in combination with the spy change it just handles arriving NMVB response bodies to update the current config.

The bootstrap process is handled in a separate commit.

Generally pretty good, but I have a couple of comments.

Line:325, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> Arguably this should have a unit test.

Line:335, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> I'm a little worried about where this exception will end up.  I've not pulled it into the IDE to chase the callstack, but I'd expect if this happens we'd request the config again.  Do we?

Line:76, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CCCPAwarenessTest.java -> nice, though techincally this could become valid someday.

Line:485, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/ConfigurationProviderHTTP.java -> Would be good to add a debug logging message after this with the message.  That'll save someone some time someday.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> There is a JCBC for this.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is phrased a bit funny for me.  Not a big deal, but hard to read.
