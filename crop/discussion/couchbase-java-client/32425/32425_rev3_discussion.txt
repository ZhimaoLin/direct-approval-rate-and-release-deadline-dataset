DESCRIPTION

JCBC-337: Update Config from NMVB-Responses.

This changeset takes an incoming "Not My VBucket" response from the server,
does some conversion logic and then passes it on to the ConfigurationProvider.

The config then gets parsed and stored as any other configuration coming
from a streaming response. A test case is added to veriy that behaviour.
