DESCRIPTION

CCCP: Update Config from NMVB-Responses.

This changeset build on the SPY foundation to pass on NMVB-Responses and
passes it on, after some initial wildcard conversion, directly to the
ConfigurationProvider.

The config then gets parsed and stored as any other configuration coming
from a streaming response. A test case is added to veriy that behaviour.
