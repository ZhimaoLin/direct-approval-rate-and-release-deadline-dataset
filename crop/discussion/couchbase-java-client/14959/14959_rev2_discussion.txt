DESCRIPTION

JCBC-20: ViewConnection blocks when no ops pending

When getting the next op in the queue we were using the poll()
function which immediately returns null if the queue is empty. This
immediate return causes the IO thread to spin and consumes a lot of
cpu. What we really want is to block when getting an item from the
queue until one is available. In order to do this we should be using
the take() function.
