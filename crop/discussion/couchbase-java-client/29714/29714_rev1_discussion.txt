DESCRIPTION

JCBC-371: Removing redundant reference of bucket/vBucket.

This changeset removes the redundant this.bucket reference in
the BucketMonitor, reducing memory a bit. Also, the observe
notifiers are now called directly and the needed bucket
config is referenced from the parent ConfigurationProvider.
