DESCRIPTION

JCBC-971: Support Vararg for Subdoc LookupIn

Motivation
----------
Instead of chaining gets together like .get("foo").get("bar") it
should be possible to also shortcut to .get("foo", "bar") while
still supporing the other style.

Modifications
-------------
The exists and get argument on the LookupInBuilder (incl. Async)
now support the String as a vararg.

Result
------
More flexible ways to specify the fields to lookup or check for
existence.

Line:156, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/subdoc/AsyncLookupInBuilder.java -> previous version didn't allow null as an argument, does LookupSpec constructor check that?
