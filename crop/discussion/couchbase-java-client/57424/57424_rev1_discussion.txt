DESCRIPTION

JCBC-886: Add few N1QL prepared integration tests

Motivation
----------
These adhoc tests have been frequently made without an automated test
and it makes sense to add them to the harness:
 - test preparation and execution of a "SELECT sum(...)" statement
 - test preparation and execution of a statement with both placeholders

Modifications
-------------
Added three tests to N1qlQueryTest integration testcase. The "sum" one
only works with CB server 4.1.0 onwards and is thus ignored in lower
versions.

Result
------
More test cases for N1QL and prepared statements (adhoc false).
