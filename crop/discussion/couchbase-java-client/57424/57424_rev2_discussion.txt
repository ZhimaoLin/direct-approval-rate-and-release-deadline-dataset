DESCRIPTION

JCBC-886: Add few N1QL prepared integration tests

Motivation
----------
These adhoc tests have been frequently made without an automated test
and it makes sense to add them to the harness:
 - test preparation and execution of a "SELECT sum(...)" statement
 - test preparation and execution of a statement with both placeholders

Modifications
-------------
Added three tests to N1qlQueryTest integration testcase. The "sum" one
only works with CB server 4.1.0 onwards and is thus ignored in lower
versions.

Result
------
More test cases for N1QL and prepared statements (adhoc false).

Patch Set 2:

only test 1 (prepared sum) is not working on 4.0 so it is ignored below this version of the server

Line:221, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/N1qlQueryTest.java -> keep bucket()

Line:235, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/N1qlQueryTest.java -> rewrite on top of bucket() please so that we dont depend on any specific bucket loaded and are self contained throughout :) (same with the test below)
