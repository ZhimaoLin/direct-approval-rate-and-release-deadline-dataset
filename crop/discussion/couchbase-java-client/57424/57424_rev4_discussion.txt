DESCRIPTION

JCBC-886: Add few N1QL prepared integration tests

Motivation
----------
These adhoc tests have been frequently made without an automated test
and it makes sense to add them to the harness:
 - test preparation and execution of a "SELECT sum(...)" statement
 - test preparation and execution of a statement with both placeholders

Modifications
-------------
Added three tests to N1qlQueryTest integration testcase. The "sum" one
only works with CB server 4.1.0 onwards and is thus ignored in lower
versions.

Also uncommented the DML tests, making them pass with a REQUEST_PLUS
consistency.

Improved the CouchbaseTestContext: destroy only works on adhoc buckets
and there's now a method to ensure there's a N1QL primary index.

Result
------
More test cases for N1QL, DML and prepared statements (adhoc false).
