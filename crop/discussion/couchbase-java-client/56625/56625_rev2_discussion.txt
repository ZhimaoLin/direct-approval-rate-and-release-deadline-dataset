DESCRIPTION

JCBC-873: Point out that mutating cluster ops are async

Motivation
----------
The previous javadocs did not make it clear that even if  the server
responds with a success and the observable/call is completed, the
operation on the server itself is asynchronous and might not be
finished yet.

Modifications
-------------
Enhance javadoc to point out the fact.

Result
------
More clarity in the javadoc on server side behaviour for cluster
management operations.
