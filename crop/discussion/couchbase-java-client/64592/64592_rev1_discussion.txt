Line:282, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/query/N1qlParams.java -> shouldn't the enableMetrics parameter be part of equals and hashcode? (I'm not entirely sure about that)

Line:312, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/query/N1qlParams.java -> maybe add "metricsDisabled" entry if metrics are disabled?
