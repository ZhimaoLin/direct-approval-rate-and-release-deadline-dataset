DESCRIPTION

JCBC-851: Cluster Level Querying

Motivation:
-----------
Breaking from the historical model of data manipulation at the bucket
level, N1QL allows to perform JOINS over multiple buckets.

Even though it *is* technically possible to perform such a query from
a Bucket (by making sure that all relevant credentials other than the
ones for the root bucket are provided in the N1qlQuery), it is a bit
counterintuitive.

Cluster-level querying aims at providing a more intuitive way of doing
such bucket-spanning queries.

Note that the configuration and resource management of the SDK makes it
so that performing a N1QL query still has the prerequisite that a
bucket is currently opened in the Cluster.

Modifications:
--------------
Mirrored the query API from Bucket/AsyncBucket to Cluster/AsyncCluster.

The sync version delegates to the AsyncCluster, while the async version
attempts to find an open AsyncBucket and delegate the execution of the
query to it.
The query is enriched with the credentials taken from the currently
configured Authenticator.

The function that allows to go from an AsyncN1qlQueryResult to a sync
one has been extracted in N1qlQueryExecutor. It is reused by the query
implementation in CouchbaseCluster.

Results:
--------
N1QL queries spanning multiple buckets (including password protected
ones) can be more intuitively performed from the Cluster/AsyncCluster.

This functionality and its specific error condition (no open bucket)
are tested in an integration test.

Oh sorry I thought the AsyncCluster delegates to AsyncBucket here https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-java-client/blob/5addb24c52e8db1f0daecbcdec654c66acfd310b/src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java#L844 and a user-defined timeout will be lost.

@subhashni ah I see. User timeout for the operation (client side) shouldn't be lost because AsyncBucket returns an Observable, which we return too. The timeout would be chained in *after* that Observable, so everything is good from this perspective.

Line:556, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncCluster.java -> what happens if the authenticator is null? maybe fail explicitly, even if edge case

Line:559, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncCluster.java -> what happens if the creds are empty? should we fail back to the user?

Line:188, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Cluster.java -> no observable here, also there are more exceptions that can happen, right? like timeouts? also backpressue and request cancelled

Line:194, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Cluster.java -> let's mark all the cluster level APIs uncomitted for now, we can stableize it in the next minor

Line:199, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Cluster.java -> it would also be good to add a note for users saying that this API is only meant if multiple buckets are used, otherwise they are recommended to go to the bucket-level API (maybe copy/paste on all docblocks sync/async)

Line:202, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Cluster.java -> no observable here, also there are more exceptions that can happen, right? like timeouts?

Line:556, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncCluster.java -> actually this should never happen, as the Authenticator is set in ctor and authenticate(null) is ignored... but i'll still put an explicit IllegalStateException

Line:559, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncCluster.java -> I'll add a throw of an IllegalStateException with explicit message in that case and the IllegalArgumentException catch below

Line:188, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Cluster.java -> Done

Line:194, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Cluster.java -> Done
