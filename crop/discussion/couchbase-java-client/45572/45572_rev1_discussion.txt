DESCRIPTION

JCBC-689: Throw exception when cluster manager passwd is wrong.

Motivation
----------
When a illegal password is used on the cluster manager, a proper
exception needs to be thrown that clearly shows what's going on.

Modifications
-------------
The code now checks the return status and throws a InvalidPasswordException
when it gets an unauthorized response from the server. If it is a different
error, a regular couchbase exception is thrown.

Result
------
Users will detect more quickly when they've entered a wrong password.
