DESCRIPTION

JCBC-369: Fix observePoll delete logic.

This changeset refactors the observePoll method, making it faster
and also correcting the delete logic which is not correct for
certain scenarios (now it is correct with respect to the non-delete
methods).

Also, it optimizes the observe() method to only add those nodes
to the bcast list that are actually needed to fulfill the
constraint.

Line:2282, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Why do we need to make this a private function? Wouldn't it be better to just modify the original one?

Can you also mention what the delete scenario was that didn't work?

Hm its not so much that it didn't work but if you look at line 2498 and 2502 its weird because on delete persistence could be increased twice (if its not the master) which I think could mask when asking for more nodes that its actually properly deleted (since we could be one delete forward on the counter).
What do you think on that part of the code?

Line:2282, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I added the private method with an extended signature to not change the public API in a bugfix release. (see the additional toReplica method to optimize broadcasting)

Line:2478, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I'd really rather these not include refactoring too.  It makes it very hard to review.
