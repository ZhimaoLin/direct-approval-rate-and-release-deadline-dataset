Going to verify in a moment.

Line:157, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/TapClient.java -> these finals don't help much since it just prevents mutation within this method.  they're not used here, other than to call out to another method.

They don't hurt anything, but it makes me look to see what you're protecting from, which seems to be nothing.  I think it's better stylistically to only use final params to a method when needed.
