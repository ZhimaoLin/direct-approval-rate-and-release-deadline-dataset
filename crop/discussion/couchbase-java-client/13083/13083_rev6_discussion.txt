Patch Set 6: Fails

I'm getting TAP failures after these couple of changes, have been trying to understand the nature of the failure.  First it fails with the no-such bucket test, but with a timeout of 0.00 seconds.  Doesn't make much sense.  

To try to move forward, I commented that out, but now I have failures in both dump and backfill.

Will make sense of it soon.

Patch Set 6: Verified

Well, I find it's fine against DP2, but fails against DP4.  Haven't tried DP3.
