DESCRIPTION

Fix unit tests with > 3.0.0 compat

Motivation & Modifications
--------------------------
Spatial views have changed and currently it is not planned to support
the new format going forward on the 1.4 branch. It needs to be
conditionally disabled.

Also, the test config did incorrectly parse out the version of the nodes,
this has been corrected by backporting the Version regex from 2.1.
