DESCRIPTION

Add ivy publishing for maven artifacts to local dir.

The intent with this change is that a quick ant task may be
run in order to fill up a local directory with maven artifacts.
These can then be indexed and synched to the real maven
repository.

The techniques in here were adapted from

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

this needs the publications section added to ivy.xml so it will publish javadoc and sources.  It's most of the way there though
