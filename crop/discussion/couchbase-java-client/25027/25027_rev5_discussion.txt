Line:1007, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> What about the two braces at the same column?

Line:1042, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> In c#, this is how they do things.  I kinda like it, but also kinda like test classes to be pretty descriptive about what failed.
