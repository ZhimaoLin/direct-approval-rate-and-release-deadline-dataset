DESCRIPTION

JCBC-XYZ: Fix BooleanQuery mustNot, should queries

Motivation
----------
The BooleanQuery mustNot and should queries generate json that is not
compatible with Bleve resulting in error response.

Modifications
-------------
Replace ConjuntionQuery with DisjunctionQuery and change queryJson
key from mustNot to must_not.

Result
------
Bleve response for mustNot and should clause no longer sends errors
like "unknown query type" and "mustNot and should clause must be a
disjunction"

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

as explained on the forums, this class has been superseded by the ongoing implementation that is currently in the fts package. Said package and the search package will soon be merged, so the problematic implementation of the BooleanQuery will soon disappear ;)
