DESCRIPTION

JCBC-757: Support Builder for Update and Delete.

Motivation
----------
Like with SELECT, it is important to provide a nice builder API ("DSL") for
the recently stableized N1QL mutation commands.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the builder API for UPDATE and DELETE variants, including
both with value and from a select clause. Unit tests have been added to
verify the resulting N1QL query.

Result
------
It is now possible to easily run update or delete statements using the nice
builder API.
