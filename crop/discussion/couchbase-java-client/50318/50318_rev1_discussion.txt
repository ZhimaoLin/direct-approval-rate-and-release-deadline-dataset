DESCRIPTION

JCBC-762: DSL for index dropping and building

Motivation
----------
After having built DSL for index creation, we can add the two other
index management operations: building a deferred index and dropping an
index.

Modifications
-------------
Added full DSL for index dropping and index deferred building. Starting
point is again in Index static methods.

UsingPath has been renamed to UsingWithPath since in CREATE it combines
the two. A true UsingPath (without other operators) has instead been
introduced for DROP and BUILD.

Drop is implemented using DropPath and UsingPath, build is implemented
using BuildIndexPath, IndexNamesPath (to specify the list of index
names to build) and UsingPath. Corresponding elements (that all escape
names) have been introduced.

Added relevant tests to IndexDslTest.

Results
-------
Indexes can now be dropped via the DSL rather than raw simple queries.
Indexes that are created with the "defer" option can now be built using
the DSL as well.
