DESCRIPTION

JCBC-677: remove queryRaw from API

Motivation
----------
Offering a way to bypass the DSL and checked API by providing a full raw
N1QL request will probably lead to abuse.

Modifications
-------------
Encourage going through the API and DSL, which reflect what is really
supported in N1QL, by removing the queryRaw methods from the API.

Only leave it on CouchbaseAsyncBucket as a package-protected method in
order to allow tests and internal usage only.

Result
------
Less right for user to circumvent the client and craft bad N1QL queries.
