DESCRIPTION

JCBC-844: Clarify javadocs of upsert.

Motivation
----------
It has been brought to attention that the javadoc for upsert is
misleading and does not clarify that upsert is not actually performing
a replace operation and does not take the CAS into account.

Modifications
-------------
The javadocs now use overwrite instead of replace in the wording,
as well as contain a paragraph which states that CAS is not respected
and the corresponding replace method needs to be used instead.

Result
------
More clarity for the upsert javadocs.
