DESCRIPTION

JCBC-865: Fix multiple WHEN in CASE

Motivation:
-----------
The correct syntax for CASE is not to separate multiple WHEN with any
separator, while currently a comma is used.

Modifications:
--------------
Removed the comma separator when multiple WHEN are added to a CASE.

Result:
-------
The multiple WHEN CASE now produces correct n1ql statement.
