DESCRIPTION

Reconnect to configuration stream if disconnected. JCBC-19

With this change, a Bucket which is marked as disconnected will be
later reconnected when noticed by a calling thread.

The logic for this is a little convoluted at the moment, but tests
to be correct.  In the future, this whole section should be refactored
to be a better NodeLocator or something similar.  See JCBC-28.
