DESCRIPTION

Reconnect to configuration stream if disconnected. JCBC-19

With this change, a Bucket which is marked as disconnected will be
later reconnected when noticed by a calling thread.

The logic for this is a little convoluted at the moment, but tests
to be correct.  In the future, this whole section should be refactored
to be a better NodeLocator or something similar.  See JCBC-28.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

(3 inline comments)

I have minor nits and I agree that the logic is somewhat covoluted. However, I am approving based on test results -- recommend fixing the comments, but, should not affect approval

Line:184, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> Minor nit about Checkstyle (possible white space).

Line:94, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/ConfigurationProviderHTTP.java -> Should'nt the throws IOException be removed here as well for completeness sake?

Line:98, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/Bucket.java -> Seems a bit confusing here. A better way might be to have an updateState or something and that will be true initially and set to false in certain cases?

Perhaps there is a reason I am missing?

Line:94, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/ConfigurationProviderHTTP.java -> yep, I had it that way, but lost it there.

Line:98, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/Bucket.java -> Just that most of Bucket is immutable, it's set to false by default, then just checked later with the isNotUpdating() method.
