Hi Deepti,

I think your tests are good, but unfortunately test the wrong thing. The main reason of the changeset was to make sure the resubscriber backoffs and increases the timeframes between the checks. You could handle this by mocking the configuration provider and passing it to the Factory. You could then give it invalid nodes and makes sure the backoff increases (maybe storing the call times in the mocked factory and then asserting on top of them!).
