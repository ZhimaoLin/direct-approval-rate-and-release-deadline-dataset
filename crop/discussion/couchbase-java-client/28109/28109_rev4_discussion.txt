Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

(2 comments)

Line:93, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNodeTest.java -> Also, one of these situations where it'd be nice to set this the same way.

Line:50, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/internal/HttpFutureTest.java -> again, might be nice to create it the same way in the tests as we do in the code.

By the way, are these threads named on the code side?  It's a bit of a pet peeve of mine to not have threads named.
