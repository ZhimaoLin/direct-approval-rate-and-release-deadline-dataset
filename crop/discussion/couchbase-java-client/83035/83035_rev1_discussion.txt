Line:403, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/SubdocumentExtendedAttributesTest.java -> add a test which tests the illegal arg on setting true to both insert and create

Line:434, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/subdoc/AsyncMutateInBuilder.java -> maybe add here in both cases insert and create an illegal argument exception that only one can be set, makes it easier to fail fast.

Line:403, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/SubdocumentExtendedAttributesTest.java -> sure

Line:434, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/subdoc/AsyncMutateInBuilder.java -> yes makes sense to fail fast in client, than from core
