DESCRIPTION

JCBC-830: Handle EXISTS response on append/prepend.

Motivation
----------
When an append/prepend operation is called with the cas
value set and the requests value does not match with the
server one, it will return with an EEXISTS (same as on
a replace operation, for example).

Modifications
-------------
The proper mapping from EXISTS to a CASMismatchException
has been coded, as well as adding integration tests to
avoid regressions in the future.

Result
------
EXISTS on append/prepend are now properly converted into
the right exception type.
