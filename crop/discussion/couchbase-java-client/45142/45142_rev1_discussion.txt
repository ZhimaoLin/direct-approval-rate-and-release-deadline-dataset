DESCRIPTION

JCBC-676: factory methods for all Query

Motivation
----------
For consistency with the rest of the API and centralization of Query
creation, use factory methods on Query rather than public constructors.

Modifications
-------------
All xxxQuery constructors made packaged protected, instanciation moved
to Query (now an abstract class).
