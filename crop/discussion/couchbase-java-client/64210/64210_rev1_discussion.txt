DESCRIPTION

JCBC-960: Expression method to wrap in parenthesis

Motivation
----------
Often, N1QL statements will need to explicitly define evaluation order
by using parenthesis. There is currently no method to do that and one
as to fallback to string concatenation inside of an x() call.

Modifications
-------------
Added the `par()` method that infixes an Expression inside parenthesis.

Result
------
Better looking wrapping of Expression in parenthesis.
