DESCRIPTION

JCBC-774 join should accept Expressions in N1QL DSL

Motivation
----------
Unlike most other cases (like from()), the operations on the LetPath
don't accept Expressions, only Strings. This is counterintuitive when
one wants to escape a namespace in a JOIN for example.

Modifications
-------------
Added Expression overloads in the LetPath (joins, nests, unnests).
Added corresponding tests.

Results
-------
Users of the DSL can now do a JOIN on an Expression, allowing them to
escape the namespace for example.
