DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1055: Add support for ephemeral bucket management.

Motivation
----------
This changeset adds support for ephemeral bucket management, since
adding and removing ephemeral buckets is needed once Couchbase
Server 5.0 ships.

Modifications
-------------
Both the encoding and decoding part of BucketSettings has been adapted
so that the new EPHEMERAL bucket type is respected.

Note that there are still advanced options missing on the builder for
all kinds of bucket types, but those can/will be added in subsequent
changesets.

Tests added for 5.0+.

Result
------
Support for ephemeral bucket management.
