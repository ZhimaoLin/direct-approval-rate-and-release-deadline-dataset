DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1125: Add support for the basic healthCheck API.

Motivation
----------
Building on the changes from core-io, the java-client needs to
expose a simple health check API to quickly gather important
information about the underlying endpoints/sockets.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset uses the new requests and responses to query
core-io for the services state and then exposes it via the
healthCheck() method on Cluster/AsyncCluster appropriately.

Result
------
The healthCheck() API is available and marked as experimental.
