DESCRIPTION

JCBC-602: Handle CAS mismatches on remove

Motivation
----------
When a CAS value is passed down together with a remove request,
the server performs a CAS check. Previously, the response was
not properly respected and the user had no idea if the check
succeeded or not.

Modifications
-------------
To be in line with the other methods, a CASMismatchException
is issued in case of such a state.

Result
------
The user can catch and handle such errors/exceptions now properly
and in line with similar methods.
