DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1045: Pre-check connection string to avoid IOOB exception

Motivation
----------
A community member reported an IndexOutOfBounds when working with
the cluster manager. Looking at the code it looks like the connection
string did not contain a single host.

Modifications
-------------
The code now checks if there is at least a hostname loadable from
the parsed connection string and if not fails with a helpful
message instead of IOOB.

Result
------
Better error diagnostics when the connection string is not correct.
