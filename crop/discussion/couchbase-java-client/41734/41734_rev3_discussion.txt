DESCRIPTION

JCBC-567: Remember initial bootstrap method

Motivation
----------

In some situations like recovering connection after network outage, the
client might stop using Carrier Publication protocol to receive cluster
configuration.

Modifications
-------------

BucketConfigurationProvider.isBinary property refactored from simple
boolean to type with three values to clearly describe the bootstrap
protol or state that the bootstrap process have not decided on any of
them.

Result
------

When someone signals that configuration has been
outdated (BucketConfigurationProvider.signalOutdated), the last method
will be tried first, and then (if it was CCCP) the library will try to
bootstrap from HTTP

minor things with copyright and we really need some comments on the enum types...

Line:391, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> This could be done with one of those things that has strings associated with enums.  It's fine as is though so we don't change the log messages.

Line:650, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> This line wrapped, it got a bit long...

Line:2, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BootstrapProviderType.java -> 2014

Line:26, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BootstrapProviderType.java -> I'd prefer some more comments in here describing what "NONE" is.
