just a nit on the commit msg, otherwise looks good. Adding a test might be good, but unit test might be tricky (we'd need to add a nother constructor I think which would allow us to pass in a core handle as well). Otherwise an integration test might work too at the moment, connect to a bucket and pass a custom transcoder (might be copy-and-rename of a built in one for a test case) and see if both read and write work.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> please follow the motivation, modifications, result commit msg for bugfixes :)
