Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(4 inline comments)

This needs to be split up into commits that say what they do.

Line:1110, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> please, no random whitespace changes

Line:966, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> why checking for 0, more below...

Line:1006, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Why are we checking for cas of 0?  I know the server doesn't use it, but a cas of 0 is valid as far as I know.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Definitely needs a better commit message.  Fixes how?  Just say what it does.

You should also file an issue, close it in this case.

Line:1002, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> assign it here, but don't use it...

Line:1005, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> reassign it here...

Line:1006, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> if it's FOUND_PERSISTED or FOUND_NOT_PERSISTED
and..
it's value is not 0
and..
the return value doesn't equal what we checked for with it

return MODIFIED


What if we're called with cas 0?

Line:1004, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> really hard to read.  the variable name is the same as the Enum class you're comparing it to.
