DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1001: Fix oversight on non-committed N1QL API

Motivation
----------
Some of the N1QL Result and Row interfaces and implementations
are currently marked as experimental although they shouldn't since
they are officially supported and stable.

Modifications
-------------
Rework the stability annotations on the various n1ql row and result
files as well as related n1ql classes to indicate the correct
stability.

Result
------
The stabilized N1QL APIs are marked like they should be.
