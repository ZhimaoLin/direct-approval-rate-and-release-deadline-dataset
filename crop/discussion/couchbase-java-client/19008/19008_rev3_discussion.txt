DESCRIPTION

JCBC-88: Fix resubscr by not waiting long and asynch subscribing.

It was found during autofailover testing that the client
did not recover well.  The problem was that we completed the
resubscription on one of the callers threads.  The subscription
can take upward of 700ms, but if the caller adjusts their timeout
for operations to be lower, we don't complete the resubscription.

This change does a couple of things:
1) doesn't allow the connection for any individual HTTP request
   (non-streaming) to take longer than 500ms to establish for
   purposes of faster failover
2) changes resubscription to occur in a thread temporarily
   spawned by the CouchbaseConnectionFactory, so it can complete
   even if the caller's request times out.

This has been tested to show autofailover working correctly.

Patch Set 3:

FYI, this breaks tests, looking into it now.  It's a simple problem I'm pretty sure, so I'd appreciate review on the rest of it regardless.
