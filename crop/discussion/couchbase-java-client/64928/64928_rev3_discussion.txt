DESCRIPTION

JCBC-975: Replace occurrences of StringBuffer with StringBuilder

Motivation
----------
As caught by the Sonar tool, several classes (most of them in the FTS
search package) were using StringBuffer rather than StringBuilder in
their toString() methods.

See Sonar rule squid:S1149 ("Synchronized classes Vector, Hashtable,
Stack and StringBuffer should not be used).

Modifications
-------------
FTS related classes that use StringBuffer now use StringBuilder.

Result
------
StringBuilder isn't used anymore.
