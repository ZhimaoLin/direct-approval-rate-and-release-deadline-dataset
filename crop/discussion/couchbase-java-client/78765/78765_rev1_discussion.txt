DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1079: Avoid implict reverse DNS lookups.

Motivation
----------
During bootstrap when assembling the seed nodes, we don't need
to use the hostname but can use the host address directly, which
will avoid reverse DNS lookups.

Modifications
-------------
Codepaths have been modified to use the address instead of the
hostname. Note that down in core-io the NetworkAddress has been
introduced but we don't need to force it into these codepaths
just yet.

Result
------
No implicit reverse DNS lookups.
