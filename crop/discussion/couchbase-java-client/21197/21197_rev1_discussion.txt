DESCRIPTION

JCBC-70: Fix Authentication to non-default bucket when connecting new node

The Authentication is initiated based on the nodes in
the Node locator. We update the nodes in the node locator
first before we initiate a reconnect as opposed to the
other way around.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

I see why this was abandoned.  It's in the 1.0 branch and will merge-commit into this branch.  Correct to abandon.
