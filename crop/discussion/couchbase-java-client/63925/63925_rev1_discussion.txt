DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-335: Allow customization of RingBuffer waiting strategy.

Motivation
----------
I have observed that the default strategy (BlockingWaitStrategy) is slowing down The Java client at high throughput rates.
Other alternatives are available which can be use to tune the Java client performance.

Modifications
-------------
Overrided waitStrategy in DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment builder.
Other modifications: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/63867/

Result
------
Ability to customize the waiting strategy for requests/repsonses on ring buffer.
