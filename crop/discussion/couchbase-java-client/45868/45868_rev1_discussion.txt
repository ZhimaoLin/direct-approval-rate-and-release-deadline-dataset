DESCRIPTION

JCBC-692: fix lock on creating DefaultQueryResult

Motivation
----------
Users reported that all they get when trying to do a n1ql query is a
timeout. This comes from a race condition/deadlock that happens when
instantiating the DefaultQueryResult (blocking on each component of the
AsyncQueryResult).

Modifications
-------------
Only ever block once, in CouchbaseBucket, instead of multiple times in
the DefaultQueryResult constructor, by using a zip.

Constructor now only deals with collections or scalar types, not with
Observables.

Results
-------
Acquiring a query result synchronously should now work as expected.
