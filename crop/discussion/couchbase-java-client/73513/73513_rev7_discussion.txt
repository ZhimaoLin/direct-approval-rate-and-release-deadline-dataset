DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1030: Add support for Couchbase Analytics

Motivation
----------
This changeset adds initial support for Couchbase Analytics. It
is mainly a copy of the N1QL codebase, removing all of the yet
unsupported features as well as renaming those parts that make
sense.

Modifications
-------------
Classes have been copied and renamed, the bucket API has been
expanded accordingly.

Yet unsupported:
	- Paremeterized Queries
	- Prepared Queries
	- Cluster Level Querying
	- If enabled, needs to work on all nodes
	- setting server side timeout

Result
------
Experimental / Uncommitted support for Analytics.
