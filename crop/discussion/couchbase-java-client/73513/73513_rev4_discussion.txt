is mainly a copy of the N1QL codebase, removing all of the yet
unsupported features as well as renaming those parts that make
sense.

Modifications
-------------
Classes have been copied and renamed, the bucket API has been
expanded accordingly.

Result
------
Experimental / Uncommitted support for Analytics.
