DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1035 Fix flaky N1QL cluster level query integration tests

Motivation
----------
N1QL cluster level query tests were quite flaky because the buckets shared the
same cluster object which uses one of the open buckets in bucket cache to
execute the query. As the bucket cache is a concurrent hash map, there are
no order guarantees.

Changes
-------
Dont share cluster between the buckets. Also used request_plus scan
consistency as the read pretty soon after write.

Results
-------
Tests consistently pass
