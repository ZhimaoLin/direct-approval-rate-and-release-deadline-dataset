DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1004: Clarify expiry setting on subdoc mutate.

Motivation & Modifications
--------------------------
The javadoc needs to be clarified in order to avoid confusion what
happens to the doc expiry when mutation a fragment. Since behind
the scenes a full doc replace is performed (on the server), the
behaviour mirrors full KV operations.
