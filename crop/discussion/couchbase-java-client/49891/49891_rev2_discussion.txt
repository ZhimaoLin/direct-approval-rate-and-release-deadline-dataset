DESCRIPTION

JCBC-744: Enforce xxx@xxx.xxx type.

Motivation
----------
Since the document ID needs to be a string, the code should check
that early as part of the entity mapping.

Modifications
-------------
A type check has been added on the type and now reports an exception
when the String assertion does not hold.

Result
------
Well defined boundary on what is supported for xxx@xxx.xxx types.
