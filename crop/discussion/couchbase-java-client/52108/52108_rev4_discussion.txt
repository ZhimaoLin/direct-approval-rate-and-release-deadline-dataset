DESCRIPTION

WIP / JCBC-782: Make the async API cold.

Motivation
----------
JVMCBC-169 implements all the actual features in the core to wrap the
hot subjects with proper defer calls and additional leak avoidance
mechanisms.

The java-client needs to adapt to the newly created request factory
in order to use the new API the right way.

Modifications
-------------
All core.send calls are now using the right RequestFactory. Tests
have been modified in order to mock the factory, not the actual
requests (but still matchon them).

Result
------
The java API plays nicely with the latest changes to the core,
avoiding lots of subtle issues with non released buffers
on edge cases and early unsubscriptions.
