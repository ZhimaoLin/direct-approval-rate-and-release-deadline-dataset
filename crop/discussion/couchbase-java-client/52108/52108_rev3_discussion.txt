DESCRIPTION

JCBC-782: Make the async API cold.

Motivation
----------
JVMCBC-169 implements all the actual features in the core to wrap the
hot subjects with proper defer calls and additional leak avoidance
mechanisms.

The java-client needs to adapt to the newly created request factory
in order to use the new API the right way.

Modifications
-------------
All core.send calls are now using the right RequestFactory. Tests
have been modified in order to mock the factory, not the actual
requests (but still matchon them).

Result
------
The java API plays nicely with the latest changes to the core,
avoiding lots of subtle issues with non released buffers
on edge cases and early unsubscriptions.

Line:489, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> would there be a drawback or improvement in doing the encoding in the body of the insert method, effectively doing the encoding step once for every resubscription? (but of course it would mean testing that doesn't come with too-eager-GC issues and so forth)
