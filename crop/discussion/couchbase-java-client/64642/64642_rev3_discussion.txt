DESCRIPTION

JCBC-965: Add option for generic N1QLParams.

Motivation
----------
There are a bunch of undocumented and experimental params
that can be used with the N1QL query engine. It doesn't make
sense to expose them as stable API but it should be possible
to supply them if needed.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds a raw API where generic params (but they
still need to be valid json, so the code checks) can be stored
and they are passed down at query time.

Result
------
It is possible to supply generic, raw N1QL params if needed.
