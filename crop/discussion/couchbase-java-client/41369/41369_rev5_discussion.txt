DESCRIPTION

[WIP] JCBC-544: Allow to select strategy for delivering server errors

When OnError.STOP specified (default), the library will stop processing
view results when encounter error in the stream. The error will be
propagated in onError() callback of the Observable

When OnError.CONTINUE specified, it will continue decoding response, and
return errors in ViewResult along with partial rows
