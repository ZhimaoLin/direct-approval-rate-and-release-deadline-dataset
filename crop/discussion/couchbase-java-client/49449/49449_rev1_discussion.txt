DESCRIPTION

JCBC-732: Extend Expression class.

Motivation
----------
As part of the DSL overhaul for 4.0, the Expression class needs to
be extended.

Modifications
-------------
The Expression class has been overhauled, tests added and lots of overloads
have been put in place so that most of the time, x() can be avoided.

Result
------
More tests and less clutter when working with expressions.
