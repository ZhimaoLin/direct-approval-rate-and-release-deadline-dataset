Line:82, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> Please see comments from the other patch sets.

Line:100, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> These variables are unnecessary since we can just call the ConnectionFactory to get these values.

Line:233, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I don't like this function. I think it would be better to have boolean isDevMode()
