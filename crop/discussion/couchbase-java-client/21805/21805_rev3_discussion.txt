We should define a utility class that gets and parses values from the properties file so we can have something like this in the CouchbaseConnectionFactory class:

Long obsPollTimeout = PropertyUtils.getSystemProperty("obsPollMax", 10);

Line:82, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> Moving the static block here will break the client since the system properties would only be set if you used this class first. I think they can be moved to the CouchbaseConnectionFactory though. Also, this issue proves that we need some better test cases to make sure that this works properly.

Line:134, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> If parseLong fails I think we should catch the exception and throw an IllegalArgumentException and report tot he user exactly what property was wrong.

Line:82, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> Rags, I have verified that this doesn't work with this in this class. Please move it.
