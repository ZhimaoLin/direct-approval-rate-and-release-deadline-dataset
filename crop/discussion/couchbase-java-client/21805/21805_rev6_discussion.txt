Patch Set 6:

The default properties are used with the CouchbaseClient and the CouchbaseConnectionFactory whereas the properties can be set via the CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilder. So, moving the code to CouchbaseConnectionFactory is not required.

I realize that a PropUtils class might be slightly better, but, the code is functional.

I think those were the comments that I did not incorporate from Mike W's review.
