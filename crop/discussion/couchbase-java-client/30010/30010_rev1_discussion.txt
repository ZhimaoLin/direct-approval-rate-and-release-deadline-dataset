DESCRIPTION

JCBC-375: Correctly reorder resubscriber to prevent race condition.

This changeset makes sure that the old reconfigurable is taken out
of the old provider before it gets shut down to avoid a situation
where it is null, leading to failures on subsequent reconnect
attempts.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Code change looks good to me.  I'm assuming if the creation of the new resubscriber throws, we want the old one around.

Deepti: do you think you can easily reproduce this issue and thus verify this fix?  I guess we'll be doing a full test soon enough, just wondering how likely we are to hit it in your testing.  Is it every time, one time in 10, etc.?
