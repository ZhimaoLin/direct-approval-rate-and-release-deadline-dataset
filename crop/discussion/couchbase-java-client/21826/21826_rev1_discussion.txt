DESCRIPTION

Adding timeout to prevent locking on unresponsive multiget.

This changeset propagates the given timeout down to the multiget
operation which is used when accessing a view with includeDocs
set to true. During a failover or rebalance operation, it may be
the case that the accessed not is not responding in a timely
fashion. In this case, timeout the bulkGet so that the future
can timeout.
