DESCRIPTION

JCBC-439: Fix AuthDescriptor overriding.

Motivation
----------
The AuthDescriptor, even when set through the builder, is ignored on factory
construction. This means that no manual descriptor can be passed in, always
leading to SASL auth list.

Modifications
-------------
The appropriate methods in the builder have been implemented and tests added
to verify the functionality.

Result
------
A custom descriptor can now be passed in and be used to override default auth
settings.
