DESCRIPTION

Bundle httpcore jars directly into branched client.

Motivation
----------
To run inside Hadoop, the client cannot depend on Apache httpcore
version 4.3.  Current CDH5 based on Hadoop 2.3 seems to rely on
httpcore-4.2 and we've already moved on to 4.3.

Modifications
-------------
Use jarjar (since this is an ant based project) to embed the
httpcore depedencies into our own package.

Result
------
Dependencies bundled in branched client can now run inside
a Hadoop MapReduce job.
