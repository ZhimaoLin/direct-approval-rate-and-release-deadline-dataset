DESCRIPTION

JCBC-490: Error log unexpected/unparsable JSON body content.

Motivation
----------
Stack traces with invalid server responses have been reported where
the root cause is unclear. The stack trace does not show the actual
response however so its hard to decipher.

Modifications
-------------
Since normally such a case shouldn't happen, the actual body including
the HTTP header are logged at WARN level to raise proper attention and
make it easier to find the actual cause.

Result
------
Unparsable server results that lead to exceptions are now easier to
decipher and to track down eventually.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> You actually log at the ERROR level, which I think is correct.  Just the commit message is wrong.  Up to you if you want to fix it.  It's easy to do through Jasmin Rangel's UI.
