DESCRIPTION

JCBC-707: Avoid String conversions in the JsonTranscoder.

Motivation
----------
When converting to and from JsonObjects in the JsonTranscoder, we
can avoid going through Strings since Jackson supports writing
and reading into byte arrays directly.

This reduces garbage collection (especially in larger docs), since
no Strings are allocated temporarily in the TLAB.

Modifications
-------------
Add methods which convert to and from JsonObjects to ByteBufs directly
and use them in the transcoder.

Result
------
Less GC produced and quicker conversions.
