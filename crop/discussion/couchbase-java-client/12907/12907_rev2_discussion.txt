Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)

You also need an unlock that takes a transcoder as well as some asyncUnlock functions. Take a look at the functions defined for getAndLock

Line:59, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/TapClient.java -> This should be in another commit.

Line:302, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> This shouldn't be defined at all.
