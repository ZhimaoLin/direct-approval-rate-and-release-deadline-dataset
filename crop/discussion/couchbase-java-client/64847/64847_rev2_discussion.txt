DESCRIPTION

JCBC-973: Fix detection of disabled flush on bucket.

Motivation
----------
A changed introduce in order to fix JVMCBC-199 regressed the
functionality to detect a bucket where flush is disabled but
nonetheless executed.

Modifications
-------------
The code now checks on the broader != success instead of a
specific error code. Note that success for http includes all
kinds of 2XX error codes, as a result even if the server responds
with 201 or 202 it works.

Result
------
FlushDisabledException raised again if flush disabled.
