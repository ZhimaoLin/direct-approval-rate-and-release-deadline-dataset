DESCRIPTION

JCBC-461: Limit the netty worker count for streaming conns.

Motivation
----------
Under normal circumstances, netty should create worker threads on the fly
and since the client only uses one channel for the bucket streaming connection,
there should every only one be used.

Under failure conditions, it could be the case that many more threads
are created falsly.

Modifications
-------------
The worker count is prevented to one thread only, since only one channel needs
ever to be accessed.

Result
------
Providing a hard upper limit for worker threads prevents thread exhaustion.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

What happens if that thread is stuck on some IO?  I know it shouldn't happen that way, but this could actually end up with a different kind of bug than threads leaking.

I trust you here though, so I'll +2.  Just want you to think about that.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> "falsely"

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> "The worker count is held to one thread only"

Prevented sounds wrong in this context.
