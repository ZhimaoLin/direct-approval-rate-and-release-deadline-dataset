DESCRIPTION

JCBC-744: Extend repository API to CRUD ops and refactor.

Motivation
----------
Previously only simple get and upsert were implemented, this
changeset adds full CRUD capabilities.

Also, to make it possible to use cas values and other metdata
without interfering with business logic, the EntityDocument
should be introduced.

Modifications
-------------
Both the sync and async repository API has been extended and
proxies through to the underlying bucket API. Tests have been
added to assert basic CRUD type functionality through the object
mapping API.

EntityDocument has been introduced and both sync and async
API have been adapted.

Result
------
More methods available on the repository, but still not fully
on par with the bucket level APIs.
