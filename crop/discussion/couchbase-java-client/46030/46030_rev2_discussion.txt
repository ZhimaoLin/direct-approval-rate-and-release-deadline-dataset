DESCRIPTION

JCBC-696: Expose the list of nodes directly on the BucketInfo.

Motivation
----------
Based on user feedback it was identified that direct access to the list
of nodes in the cluster/bucket makes it easier to consume it for
further processing at the user level.

Modifications
-------------
Iterate over the raw response, filter out the hostnames (without port)
and expose it directly as a getter. A test has been modified to make
sure it works as expected.

Result
------
Easier access to the list of nodes in that cluster.
