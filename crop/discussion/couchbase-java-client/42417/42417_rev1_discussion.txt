DESCRIPTION

JCBC-583: Release buffers in transcoders + tests

Motivation
----------
After some leaks were reported by Netty, it was determined that in the
various transcoders, ByteBuf were inconsistently released. Most of them
take the ByteBuf and convert it in another format (eg JSON) and don't
access the buffer after that, which is a good candidate point for the
release of the buffer.

Additionally, even when the transcoder released the buffer on success
it was not released before throwing a TranscodingException.

We would gain from a standard "automatic" way of releasing the buffer
in both success or error in decoding. But transcoders that produce an
output which still holds the buffer (eg BinaryTranscoder) should not
release it.

Modifications
-------------
The AbstractTranscoder now releases the buffer in case of both success
and error, provided the corresponding "shouldAutoreleaseOnXXX" methods
return true (which is the default).

BinaryTranscoder has shouldAutoreleaseOnDecode return false, whereas it
has shouldAutoreleaseOnError return true, allowing BinaryDocument to
keep hold of the ByteBuf down the line.

Corresponding tests have been put in place. They test both success and
error in decode operation. BinaryTest checks that the success case
doesn't release the buffer.

On JsonTranscoder, a specific static method converts ByteBuf to Json.
This method doesn't release the buffer, and has been documented and
tested to reflect that this is on purpose.

Result
------
By default, any implementation of AbstractTranscoder will release its
content buffer after decode operation, either successful or in error.

BinaryTranscoder doesn't release buffers on decode success but does on
decode error.

All transcoder tests pass, and check the coherence of the buffer refCnt
reference count after decode operation for the type of transcoder.

Note that something should be done to inform the user that it is his
responsibility to manually release the buffer of a BinaryDocument.

looks good, just some nitpicks

Line:94, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/JsonDoubleTranscoderTest.java -> json double?

since the flags are wrong anyways

Line:82, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/JsonTranscoder.java -> space xxx@xxx.xxx and title?

Line:101, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/JsonStringTranscoderTest.java -> same

Line:100, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/AbstractTranscoder.java -> first letter uppercase?

Line:108, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/JsonBooleanTranscoderTest.java -> probably want to use a json boolean?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I guess we need a new JCBC for this

Line:103, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/JsonLongTranscoderTest.java -> json long?
