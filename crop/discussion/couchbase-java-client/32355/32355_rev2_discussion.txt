See inline comments.

This test doesn't test the right code.

Line:52, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> please use the xxx@xxx.xxx annotation instead of calling initClient() from the test.

Line:72, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> Technically this test only checks that the sasl mechanisms are loaded correctly, not that the right one is used. this needs to be a separate test though.

Line:75, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> This is not the right way to do it. This is a unit test, so you need to test the behaviour of the AuthThread.. here, you are testing a method that is not even used in the AuthThread.. please make it package-private and test like this as bespoken over skype.

Line:76, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> this is error prone.. you should extract the versions to ints and then do matching on it (like < 2.2 and > 2.2, because that's where the change was introduced).
