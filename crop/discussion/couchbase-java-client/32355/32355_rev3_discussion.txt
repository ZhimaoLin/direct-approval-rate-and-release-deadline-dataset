Line:82, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> lots of tabs in this file, please check the formatting!

Line:117, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> Don't create a string out of it, assert on the returned list directly. this is less error prone and more future proof.

Line:148, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> where does this come from? it's not in the original AuthThreadMonitor and also not in this changeset.

I'd rather make the AuthThread listSaslMechs package private as said.. adding public fields is not the way to go

Line:151, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> also, if you change the package private, assert on the list directly.
