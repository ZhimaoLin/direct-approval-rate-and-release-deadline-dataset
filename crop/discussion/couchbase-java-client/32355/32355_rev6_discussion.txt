we're getting close

Line:123, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> please make it a list and test that cram-md5 comes first too. This is important because we choose it on the order it comes served from the server.

Line:162, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> also use assertEquals here

Line:165, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthTest.java -> same here :)
