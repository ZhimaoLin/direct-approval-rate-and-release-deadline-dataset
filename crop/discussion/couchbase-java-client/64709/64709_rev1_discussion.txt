DESCRIPTION

JCBC-961: Make isOrderRetained public

Motivation:
-----------
Sometimes it can be useful to be able to programmatically rework the
parameters of a query, notably includeDocs target class (eg. in Spring
Data). But since the isOrderRetained() tuning is not accessible, there's
no way to ensure that it is maintained when resetting the target class.

Modifications:
--------------
ViewQuery.isOrderRetained() is now public.

Results:
--------
Order retained parameter can be kept when modifying the target class of
includeDocs in a ViewQuery.
