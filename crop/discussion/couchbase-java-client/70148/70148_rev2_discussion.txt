DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1024: Add "sort" option to FTS query.

Motivation
----------
Couchbase Server 4.6 introduces the possibility to
apply a custom sorting order (not only on the score in
descending order), the Java SDK needs to expose this
option as well.

Modifications
-------------
A "sort" option is provided which allows the user to specify
an array of sort fields, including the special ones like
"_score" and "_id" as well as using a "-" prefix for descending
order.

Result
------
FTS compatibility for Server 4.6 which allows the user to specify
a custom sort order.
