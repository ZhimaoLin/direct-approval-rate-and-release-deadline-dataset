DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1067 Expose configPollInterval from CouchbaseEnvironment builder

Motivation
----------
Past release added the tuneable in Core Environment, add this info as override
on Couchbase Environment builder so it correctly returns the current
CouchbaseEnvironment builder instead of the super class CoreEnvironment builder.

Changes
-------
Added an override on CouchbaseEnvironment builder.
