DESCRIPTION

JCBC-724: Dump specific environment parameters

Motivation
----------
Environment's toString is used to dump parameter values, but for now
the DefaultCoreEnvironment's implementation is used, which doesn't dump
java-client specific parameters.

Modifications
-------------
The core implementation has been changed to expose a protected method
that dumps all parameters into a StringBuilder. This is overridden in
java client to also dump DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment-specific params.

Results
-------
DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment toString now contains parameters specific to
both the core and the java-client.
