DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1076: Add support for "Enhanced Error Messages"

Motivation
----------
In combination with the corresponding core-io changes, this
changeset adds support for "enhanced error messages", which
allows the server to send more detailed information on
errors if available.

Modifications
-------------
The CouchbaseAsyncBucket code is modified to convert error
messages into "enhanced" ones and store it inside the message
of the exception if the enhanced msg is not null.

Result
------
Support for enhanced error messages.

Line:2075, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> Shouldn't this be trace level?

Line:2075, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> I was going back and forth on this and my line of thought was that debug might make it easier to spot problems at a customer deployment while still not spamming them in info mode. trace is quite expensive to turn on - and even at debug level we'd only see this is there are actually errors?
