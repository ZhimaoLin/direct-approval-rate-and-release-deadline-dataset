Line:378, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> cluster info? :)

Line:435, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> is there some potential escaping needed?

Line:283, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/ClusterManager.java -> hmmm... is there a way for us to poll for completion somehow? otherwise the user would have to in all of those cases...

I dont remember right now if this is covered in the RFC

Line:35, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/User.java -> can we make these final and add a constructor which populates all of them?

Line:77, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/User.java -> can this be an enum of Internal, LDAP ?

Line:38, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/UserSettings.java -> the constructor should be made private in this patter n(ala private UserSettings {})

Line:255, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/ClusterManagerTest.java -> these tests need a check if the server supports it, right? wrt to backwards compat running the test suite

Line:32, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/UserRole.java -> private?

Line:34, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/UserRole.java -> private?

Line:435, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> Yes you are right. I missed bucket names allow %. Good catch!

Line:283, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/ClusterManager.java -> It is covered by RFC to just add a note. Polling is a bit complicated as discussed.

Line:35, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/User.java -> yes

Line:38, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/UserSettings.java -> Yea, will add that

Line:255, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/ClusterManagerTest.java -> yes will add the check

Line:32, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/UserRole.java -> yes
