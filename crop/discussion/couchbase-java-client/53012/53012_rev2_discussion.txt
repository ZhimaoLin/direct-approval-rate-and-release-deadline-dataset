DESCRIPTION

JCBC-805: Implement getFromReplica with Iterator

Motivation
----------
On the blocking API, at the moment on the List<D> API is available,
which is not flexible enough in the error case. In addition, a
similar Iterator<D> API needs to be exposed where the user can
pull out documents as they arrive (and optionally stop iterating
if they have what they need).

Modifications
-------------
The Iterator blocking API has been added to the Bucket interface
and implemented accordingly. Simple integration tests have been
added with precautions since they only work if the setup is
correct and matching the assertions.

Result
------
More flexible replica read API during node failures.
