Patch Set 1:

discussed with mark in gitter, the arrayAppendAll prefix seems like a good solution

we could add support for both varargs and collections in this case

choice would be between the following three signature sets:

either (consistent with simple arrayAppend, but varargs is constrained to have different param order)

arrayAppendAll(String path, Collection<T> values, boolean createParents);
arrayAppendAll(String path, boolean createParents, T... values);

or (consistent with other signatures, varargs forfeits the ability to set createParents)

arrayAppendAll(String path, Collection<T> values, boolean createParents);
arrayAppendAll(String path, T... values); //defaults to createParents = false

or (consistency between the too "xxxAll" method but not with the rest of the specs)

arrayAppendAll(String path, boolean createParent, Collection<T> values);
arrayAppendAll(String path, boolean createParents, T... values);
