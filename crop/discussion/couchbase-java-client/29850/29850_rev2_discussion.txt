DESCRIPTION

Refactor ConfigFactory and optimize VBucket memory heap size.

works internally. In addition, VBucket objects are moved from int
to short and only allocate as much memory as needed.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Line:60, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/DefaultConfigFactory.java -> I'm sure this popped out of some IDE, but I actually find "sb" to be a more meaningful variable name than "builder".  I know it's supposed to be longer though.
