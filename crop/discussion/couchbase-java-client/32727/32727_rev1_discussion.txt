DESCRIPTION

JCBC-403: Harden reconfigures on view-based workloads.

This changeset makes sure that even on view-based workloads, lost
streaming connections are detected properly, leading to faster
working states again. In particular, it contains:

 - Signaling an outdated config also on failing http requests
 - Signaling an outdated config on bulkget workloads (by identifying
   inactive nodes)
 - Making sure the proper resubscriber is called with the bucket
   config when the monitor is disconnected.
