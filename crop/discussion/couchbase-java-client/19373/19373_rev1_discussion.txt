Matt,

One comment and also this code doesn't appear to be able to be compiled. I will upload a new patch-set in a moment.

Line:122, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> This case doen't make sense to me. Why do we not do basic authentication for the default bucket. What if I specify an authless bucket named "mybucket"?

Line:122, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> That's the way we do it for everything on 8091 and 11210.  No auth is considered by the server to be equivalent to "default".  I'm following the same convention here.
