Patch Set 3: Fails

Still fails, but unrelated.  Has checkstyle fixes and test fixes.

Given time needed, please review basics while I find the problem.

Patch Set 3: Verified

It works, the problem was that the view wasn't published.  We need better null handling from the query() method.  Not related to this though

Patch Set 3:

Sorry, I'd addressed it but hadn't hit the review button so it was still in "draft".
