DESCRIPTION

JCBC-287: Make sure node is in bucket node list.

When the SDK is attached against a 1.8 cluster, it can be the
case that when the streaming node is failovered by hand (and not
because of a power plug), the REST API is still available. It will
show the bucket information and accept streaming connections, but
does not participate actively.

In effect, this leads to delayed config discovery and timeouts. To
remedy this situation, the ConfigurationProvider now not only checks
if a configuration for the bucket is available, but also if the
current node is present in the list. If it is not, the next entry
will be tried (so it will be skipped).
