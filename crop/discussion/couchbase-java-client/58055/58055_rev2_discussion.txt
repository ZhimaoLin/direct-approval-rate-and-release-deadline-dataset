DESCRIPTION

JCBC-757: Support Builder for Insert and Upsert.

Motivation
----------
Like with SELECT, it is important to provide a nice builder API ("DSL") for
the recently stableize N1QL mutation commands.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the builder API for INSERT and UPSERT variants, including
both with value and from a select clause. Unit tests have been added to
verify the resulting N1QL query.

Result
------
It is now possible to easily run insert or upsert statements using the nice
builder API.
