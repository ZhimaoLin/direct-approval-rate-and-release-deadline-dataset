DESCRIPTION

Fix failing N1QL units tests by changing response parse status

Motivation
----------
Retry for failed N1ql prepared query now expects that the http response
status is a failure due to the fix for JCBC-1029

Changes
-------
Previously the stubbed response had success status as true indicating the
status code as success eventhough the query was not successful. Modified
it as false.

Results
-------
N1ql prepared unit tests pass
