DESCRIPTION

JCBC-782: Make Other Async APIs cold.

Motivation
----------
Since all the calls against the core layer are considered hot,
this brings along some limitations which are not obvious. The
main issues we ran into in the field are:

    - Retry logic can't work because the retried subject
      is the same as the failed one.
    - Fallback code is eagerly evaluated, leading to
      inconsistent and surprising results

By wrapping the hot observables into a defer method, they
work like cold observables.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset moves the rest of the async API to cold.

Result
------
All other methods on the async API are now cold.
