DESCRIPTION

JCBC-678: support more parameters for N1QL query

Motivation
----------
It makes sense that some request parameters from N1QL specification be
tuned by the user. Offer an API to do that for relevant parameters.

Modifications
-------------
Added QueryParams, following the Parameter Object pattern, to allow to
set various relevant query parameters for N1QL. Added consistency enum.

Added unit tests to check the produced JSON query and the coherence of
the API.

Added method on JsonObject to remove an entry from the JSON, by key.

Result
------
Users now can further tune their N1QL queries with relevant parameters.
