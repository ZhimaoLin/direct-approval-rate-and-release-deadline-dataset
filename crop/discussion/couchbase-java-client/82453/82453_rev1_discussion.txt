DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1115: Enforce Xattr first ordering on subdoc builders.

Motivation
----------
When using the subdoc xattr API, a server side constraint is that
the xattr-based commands always need to come before the non-xattr
ones.

This should be enforced on the client side to give rapid feedback
and not wait for cryptic errors at runtime.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset introduces a new subdoc exception and modifies both
the lookup and the mutation builder to enforce the constraint
at execute() time.

Result
------
The server-side requirement is enforced at the client side, leading
to rapid feedback.
