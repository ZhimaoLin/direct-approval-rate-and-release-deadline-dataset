DESCRIPTION

Added excludes for jms, jmxri, jmxtools.

I don't know that these excludes are perfect, but they solved the
problem.  Some of the resolvers retain the .pom files for these
without having the actual jar files.  They're brought in by log4j.

I did try an exclude from the log4j level first, and a transitive
exclude, to no avail.

I'm curious what issue this is solving. Findbugs isn't actually pulled in (at least it shouldn't be) by any part of this project right now. I'd like to discuss this with you tomorrow so I can get better context.

it's not about findbugs.  this depends on spymemcached, which in turn depends on log4j, which in turn depends on jmx.  need to exclude jmx.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

well, now I'm not sure this is the right thing to do.  there are two levels here.

I fixed this in the project. I just noticed though in maven we still have to exclude these dependencies. They appear to be coming from log4j. I'll try to find a workaround for this, but I don't think the this is the correct change. Unless you want to discuss further please abandon this.

Not the right fix.  I think we need to address the dependencies at a higher level.
