DESCRIPTION

JCBC-431: Config poller for tainted carrier configurations.

This changeset adds a config poller for tainted carrier configurations.
It spawns once it finds a tainted config and stops once its not tainted
anymore.

What a tainted configuration exactly defines, is implemented in each
configuration implementation. The Provider just checks for the field
and acts accordingly.

Todo:
	- More testing
	- Find out what other characteristics identify a tainted connection.
	  currently, only the forward map is used as an identifier (memcache
	  buckets are never tainted)

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Adding Mark and Jeff for review.  For context, the reason Michael added this is that he found a corner case in testing where we may not get a config update when a node being removed is completely removed.  This is because we wouldn't get more NMV replies.

The solution we came to and Michael implemented was to make sure we polled for updated config as long as we know the configuration we have is transitional.  I called this a "tainted" configuration, which Michael picked up on.  There could be future situations where a config is considered tainted, so we just kept things simple by having a way to start the poller while tainted.

Michael: generally looks good to me.  Nice work.
