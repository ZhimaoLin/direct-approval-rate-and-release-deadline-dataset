DESCRIPTION

JCBC-431: Config poller for tainted carrier configurations.

This changeset adds a config poller for tainted carrier configurations.
It spawns once it finds a tainted config and stops once its not tainted
anymore.

What a tainted configuration exactly defines, is implemented in each
configuration implementation. The Provider just checks for the field
and acts accordingly.

Todo:
	- More testing
	- Find out what other characteristics identify a tainted connection.
	  currently, only the forward map is used as an identifier (memcache
	  buckets are never tainted)

I'm +0 on this with a couple questions inline.

Line:223, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> What does this change do for us?  It seems unrelated to the changeset.

Line:298, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I'm not 100% sure we want to reload the config every time the connection is lost.  I guess it's cheap.  It just feels like perhaps we need another metric.  Maybe reloading config when we can't re-establish a connection?

I guess this is good for now-- just being cautious of spamming activities.
