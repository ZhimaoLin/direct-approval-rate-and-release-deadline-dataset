DESCRIPTION

JCBC-431: Config poller for tainted carrier configurations.

This changeset adds a config poller for tainted carrier configurations.
It spawns once it finds a tainted config and stops once its not tainted
anymore.

What a tainted configuration exactly defines, is implemented in each
configuration implementation. The Provider just checks for the field
and acts accordingly.

Todo:
	- More testing
	- Find out what other characteristics identify a tainted connection.
	  currently, only the forward map is used as an identifier (memcache
	  buckets are never tainted)
