DESCRIPTION

JCBC-431: Config poller for tainted carrier configurations.

This changeset adds a config poller for tainted carrier configurations.
It spawns once it finds a tainted config and stops once its not tainted
anymore.

What a tainted configuration exactly defines, is implemented in each
configuration implementation. The Provider just checks for the field
and acts accordingly.

Todo:
	- More testing
	- Find out what other characteristics identify a tainted connection.
	  currently, only the forward map is used as an identifier (memcache
	  buckets are never tainted)

Reading through the code, it looks like a "tainted" config is determined by the vbucketforward element of a config? If that's not correct, what exactly indicates a "tainted" config? (BTW, i have "Tainted Love" in my head now :()

Missed that...ok, so what does a forward map look like? DO we have any static JSON examples?

Added a few comments.

Line:73, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/CouchbaseConfig.java -> Was "this" intended to be the commit? (yes, a bad pun)

Line:77, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/CouchbaseConfig.java -> See comment above

Line:79, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/CouchbaseConfig.java -> Following convention, you should be referencing this via "this".

Line:252, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> Should this be writing to log instead of stdout?

Line:608, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> I can't see enough in Jasmin Rangel, but i am guess this is synchronized or something equiv?

Patch Set 4:

I'll look at this a bit later. But.. is there any DOCUMENTATION about what this 'forward map' is supposed to do? Also there is still the edge case where we jump straight from a "Untainted" config to one where the node is completely removed?

I haven't looked at the code yet, so I might gather some more knowledge afterwards :)
