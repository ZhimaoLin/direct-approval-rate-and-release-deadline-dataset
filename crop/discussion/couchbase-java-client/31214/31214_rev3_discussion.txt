DESCRIPTION

JCBC-361: Add real async observe capabilities.

This changeset makes the blocking-in-disguise methods really async,
allowing to run them in parallel as needed. Observe calls are fired
off in the callback pool, returning a new future that overlays
the results of the original one (same behavior as before).

The code is a little more ugly than needed, but it takes care to
inherit the exact same behavor and messages than before.

Note that async observe for cas is introduced in another commit
because it is a slightly larger patchset.
