DESCRIPTION

JCBC-829: Internalize Prepared Statements Execution

Motivation
----------
The final step of the prepared statement rework includes using
the LRU cache and conditionally either executing the cached
prepared payload or running the prepare code first.

Modifications
-------------
The code and tests have been modified to remove all external
visibility of "prepared objects", and also now the cache wipe
method is exposed on the bucket API.

Result
------
Automatic and internal execution of prepared statements, but
without retry logic on errors (which will come in a later
commit).
