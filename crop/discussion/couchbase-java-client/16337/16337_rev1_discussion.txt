Can you also explain in the commit message why we can't just use MemcachedConnection here.

Line:2, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> Update copyright without any changes to the file.

Line:35, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> Needs either no comment or a better comment here.

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseMemcachedConnection.java -> Needs a better comment here.

will fix these shortly

Line:2, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> will fix

Line:35, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> Agreed.  :)

The reason I typed that is that it seems like a very wrong choice for default hash algorithm.  I was going to fix that in a different commit.  I left the comment there to bug myself.

Line:178, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> No, because it'll always be reconfigurable.  mconn is declared as a MemcachedConnection though, which is not reconfigurable.  Here I'm just separating the type so there's never an exception case.  I just need to do the right kind of cast.  

This does point to a bigger issue, but this addresses it for now.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please explain more, per Mike.

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseMemcachedConnection.java -> Agreed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:178, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Can we check the instance here and have the else throw an exception? Reconfiguring shouldn't happen often so the extra check won't hurt performance.
