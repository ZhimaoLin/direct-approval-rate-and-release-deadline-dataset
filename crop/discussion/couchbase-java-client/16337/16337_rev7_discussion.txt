DESCRIPTION

Use the correct Connection type for the config.  JCBC-53

In the refactoring of the client into two packages, we lost
the functionality that would handle reconfiguration from
MemcachedConnections.  This change introduces a
CouchbaseMemcachedConnection which extends the MemcachedConnection
and implements reconfiguration.  By doing so, we properly handle
add and remove node events from the cluster.
