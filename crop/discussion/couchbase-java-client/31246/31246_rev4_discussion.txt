DESCRIPTION

JCBC-390: Refactor ClusterManager

The ClusterManager needs to be refactored because the HttpCore dependency
has been upgraded. While the old code would still work, getting rid of
the deprecated pieces makes sense to keep the code consistent with the
view logic.

Your comments should be addressed but:
