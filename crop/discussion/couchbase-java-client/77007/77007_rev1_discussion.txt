Line:1, src/integration/resources/com.couchbase.client.java.integration.properties -> TestProperties again maybe?

Line:362, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/CouchbaseTestContext.java -> I wonder if we should share the helper class since adding a util class in core would mean we have to add the lib as a depenency.. it could work with "optional" but I'm not totally sure
