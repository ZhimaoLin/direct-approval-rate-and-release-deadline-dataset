DESCRIPTION

JCBC-752: add DSL support for collections (ANY, ARRAY, ...)

Motivation
----------
N1QL language has support for several collections predicates (or
comprehensions): ANY, EVERY, ARRAY and FIRST.

Modifications
-------------
Added new class Collections that allows to build (with its own mini DSL)
the four comprehensions: ANY, EVERY, ARRAY and FIRST.

Added unit tests to verify this mini DSL.
Updated SelectDslSmokeTests where the new DSL could be used instead of a
plain x(...) expression.

Results
-------
Users are now able to use Collections in their expressions (eg. in a
SELECT clause or WHERE clause), as demonstrated in the smoke tests.
