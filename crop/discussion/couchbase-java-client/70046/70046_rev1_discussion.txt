DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1023 Ignore FTS tests if search service not found

Motivation
----------
Since FTS is an individual service, we may not be
enabling it always while running integration tests.

Changes
-------
Add ignoreIfSearchServiceNotFound to test context, which tries a search
query and does not continue with the tests if a
ServiceNotAvailableException is returned.

Results
-------
Fts tests will be ignored if search service is not found
