DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1023 Ignore FTS tests if search service not found

Motivation
----------
Since FTS is an individual service, we may not be
enabling it always while running integration tests.

Changes
-------
Add ignoreIfSearchServiceNotFound to test context, which tries a search
query and does not continue with the tests if a
ServiceNotAvailableException is returned.

Results
-------
Fts tests will be ignored if search service is not found

Line:85, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/SearchQueryTest.java -> hmmm in correlation to my other comment, I wonder why the previous line did not catch that? It should do the same thing, right?

Line:90, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/SearchQueryTest.java -> I'm good with this, but did you run into a situation where the ctx is null?

Line:447, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/CouchbaseTestContext.java -> I don't think this is needed, check out the ignoreIfMissing method on the context here and provide it the CouchbaseFeature.FTS_BETA enum?

Patch Set 2:

oh wait, please disregard my latest comment but I think there might be a more generic way to do this.

Okay I'm good with this, but I wonder if we should make this more general on the cluster manager like a "featureEnabled" method or so where you pass in the feature enum and then it checks in core - then the users can also benefit from that. Wdyt?
