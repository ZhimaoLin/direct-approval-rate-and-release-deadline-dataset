DESCRIPTION

JCBC-833: Prefix all Query-related classes with N1ql

Motivation:
-----------
In order to maintain naming consistency and avoid confusion, classes
like Query and related (eg. QueryResult, QueryRow) should be prefixed
with N1ql, aligning it with view-related classes like ViewQuery.

Modifications:
--------------
Renamed Query, QueryResult, QueryRow, their async counterparts, concrete
implementations and related tests by prefixing "Query" with "N1ql".

QueryMetrics and QueryParams have been respectively renamed to
N1qlMetrics and N1qlParams.

QueryExecutor has been renamed to N1qlQueryExecutor. Order of fields and
method declaration has been shuffled around a bit for clarity.

Results:
--------
Less possible confusion when dealing with the various modes of querying
couchbase (view, spatial view, N1QL).
