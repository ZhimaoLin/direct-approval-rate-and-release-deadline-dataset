DESCRIPTION

JCBC-597: Refactor View mapping into distinct class.

Motivation
----------
This changeset refactors the view result mapping logic into a
separate class, making it easier to grasp and also preparing it
for future enhancements (like transparent retries).

Modifications
-------------
The view query handling is moved into a separate class and extensive
integration tests have been added.

Along the way, a small bug with document() calls on reduced rows has been
fixed as well as better toString() printing on rows.

Result
------
Better readability and testability in the view mapping process.
