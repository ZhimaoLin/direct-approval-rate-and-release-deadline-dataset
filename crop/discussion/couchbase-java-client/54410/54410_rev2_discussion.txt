DESCRIPTION

JCBC-829: Change API for new prepared statements handling

Motivation
----------
The agreed spec includes transparently handling the prepared statement,
so a new adhoc query option needs to be introduced, as well as the
prepare() methods removed from the public API.

Modifications
-------------
The prepare() API is removed from the async and sync API, and the new
query option is added to the query params.

Result
------
Cleanup for upcoming prepared statement changes.
