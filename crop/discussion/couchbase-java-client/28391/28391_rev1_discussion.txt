DESCRIPTION

JCBC-347: Adjust observe intervals for better performance.

By decreasing the observe poll interval, better throughput on
intense replicateTo settings can be achieved. This can also be
modified through the Builder, but setting it to a lower value
should provide a better experience by default.

Also, the max poll cycles have been increased so together now
the max waiting time is 5 seconds.
