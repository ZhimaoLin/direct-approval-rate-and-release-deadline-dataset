Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Line:154, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> I think, but I'm open to debate on this, I'm not a fan of constructors which throw exceptions based on IO from a file.  Should it be an enum or maybe even a properties file argument with an init()?  not sure.

It seems the success/failure of a ctor should be based only on the arguments supplied to it to complete actual construction, not side effects like loading from a file.

Maybe an empty ctor with a separate method to initFromFile()?

Line:154, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> I agrew with you on the ctor, but other than that I just wanted to keep it consistent with that we have right now.

Currently, the ctor will throw exceptions based on network IO too, so it fails during initialization anyway.

If we break out that to a special init function just for the constructor I fear its weird (if you call the ctor with no args you need to call init, otherwise you do not) and if we also split it out for the old ctor we need to go to a 2.0 because it will break the backwards compat api.

What do you think?

Line:154, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> You're right, I forgot this was doing that already.

I had thought this class was cleaner for some reason.
