DESCRIPTION

JCBC-350: Avoide race condition in observe replica.

This changeset uses the locator only and avoids a possible
race condition where the config contains stale data that does
not correlate with the locator information.

This can lead to a possible IndexOutOfBounds exception down the
call stack.
