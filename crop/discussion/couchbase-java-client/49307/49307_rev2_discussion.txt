DESCRIPTION

Reuse default bucket and hostname.

Motivation
----------
Both the CouchbaseBucket and CouchbaseAsyncBucket previously
defined the default bucket and hostname.

Modifications
-------------
The code changes now expose it public on the async cluster (so it
is also reusable by other parties) and reuse it on the sync cluster
component.

Result
------
Less duplication, more reuse.
