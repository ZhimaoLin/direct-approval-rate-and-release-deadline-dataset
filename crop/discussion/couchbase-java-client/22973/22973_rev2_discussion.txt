DESCRIPTION

JCBC-154: Merge remote-tracking branch 'Jasmin Rangel/release11c'

* Jasmin Rangel/release11c:
  JCBC-130: Add a timeout for unresponsive http connection fetches.
  Correcting view tests with wrong exception handling.
  [Backport] Cancel view requests when the operation is cancelled.
  JCBC-100: [Backport] Add better error handling on view fetches.

Conflicts:
	src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java
	src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java

Also, had to add a minor change to ViewNodeTest.java to add a view
since the NoDocsOperationImpl had changed.

Patch Set 2:

Michael: please look at the change to ViewNodeTest in particular.  The test passes, but it wasn't quite clear what the view needed there was.
