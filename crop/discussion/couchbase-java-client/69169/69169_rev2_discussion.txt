DESCRIPTION

JCBC-900 Add List datastructure support

Motivation
----------
Provide higher level data structure support over Subdoc APIs. This aims
for a rich developer experience by ready-to-use data structures like
list, map, queue and set for creating and populating couchbase
documents.

Changes
-------
Added AsyncCouchbaseList interface which uses subdocument array push last
to push into the end of List, subdocument array push first to shift List
head, subdocument array insert to set List index, subdocument path remove to
remove items and uses full document get to calculate size. Provided bucket
level sync and async api wrapping the AsyncCouchbaseList interface. Used
MutationOptionBuilder interface to provide mutation operation contraints.
Added list dataStructure tests to verify the correctness.

Results
-------
CouchbaseList data structure experimental apis on CouchbaseBucket and
CouchbaseAsyncBucket.
