DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1037: Fail FTS Query with IndexDoesNotExistException

Motivation
----------
Right now if an index does not exist we don't fail with the right
error message for FTS.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset makes the response explicitly check if the index
does not exist and if so raises an IndexDoesNotExistException
as part of the error chain with a FTS response.

By the way, this also fixes the longer standing issue that the
FTS queries should be skipped if the index is not found, leading
to failing tests.

Result
------
Proper awareness if an FTS index doesn't exist, and also fixing
failing tests and instead ignoring them.
