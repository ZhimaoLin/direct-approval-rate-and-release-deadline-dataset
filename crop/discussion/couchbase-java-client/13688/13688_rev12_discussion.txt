Patch Set 12: No score

(2 inline comments)

Going to +0 for now. I will take this for a quick spin.

Line:107, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> Should be able to use BuildInfo class.

Line:228, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> That class should be an observer and register to observe then.  I'm guessing it can't because it extends something that extends spyobject.  This is okay for now, but that needs cleanup.

Line:107, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> I'm okay with that, but the way Rags was doing it is not correct. I also think it should go into another commit since it was hardcoded previously.

Patch Set 12: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

There are minor issues running tests, but that's owing to an open bug with Couchbase Server 2.0 and flush on my read.
