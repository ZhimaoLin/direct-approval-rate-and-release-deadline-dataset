Patch Set 11: (1 inline comment)

I fixed the commit message and removed duplicate code that was actually just wrong where I had it the second time. Looking at the way the code was I am pretty sure that this wouldn't pass any rebalance test because the memcached connections wouldn't reconnect to the new servers. This is a big change so please make sure that this goes through testing before it is committed. If there are issues please let me know and I will look at them.

Also, I did not test this code. I don't have a development environment set up at the moment and I need to get some other things done. If the unit tests fail let me know and I will set up a new dev environment.

Line:106, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> I fixed the user agent here for the next release. We should have this automated, but I think it should be done in another commit since it was hardcoded before.
