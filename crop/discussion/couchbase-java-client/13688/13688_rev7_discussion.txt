Patch Set 7: (5 inline comments)

Getting closer, but we have some javadoc fixes still needed at a minimum.

Still -2 mainly for the commit message though.  The commit message shouldn't include things that happened during fixing the commit.

Line:111, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> Still incorrect user agent.

Line:113, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> This doesn't seem like it'd pass checkstyle.

Line:378, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Do you think we should be addressing some of this in the class documentation rather than repeating it next to each method?  It feels a bit repetitive.

Line:405, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> although in this case it's the result of a map function, it's not always.  It may be better to just end at "returns the result".

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> These don't belong in the commit message.  They went away between commits.
