Patch Set 8: (2 inline comments)

A couple of minor things here, but still -2 until we get the user agent right.  I may try to fix it up right now.

Line:110, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> I don't think this does quite what we want either.  We'd like "Couchbase Java Client " + BuldInfo.VERSION I do believe.

Line:108, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> Same comment.

Patch Set 8: Do not submit

There is some code duplication in here. I'll fix it, but -2 so that no one can push.
