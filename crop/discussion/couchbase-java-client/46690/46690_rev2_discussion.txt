DESCRIPTION

JCBC-707: Make sure to account for array offsets.

Motivation
----------
When the array is backing more than one ByteBuf the code needs to
make sure to only grab the slice which is actually belonging to
the specific ByteBuf.

Modifications
-------------
Calculate the offset + index range for the byte[] slice before
sending it over to jackson.

Result
------
More resilient extraction logic.
