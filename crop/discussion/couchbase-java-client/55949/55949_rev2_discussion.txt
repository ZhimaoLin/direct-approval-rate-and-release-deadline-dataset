DESCRIPTION

JCBC-855: Cache JsonBooleanTranscoder true/false values.

Motivation
----------
Since only true and false can be passed in, there is a very small
finite number of possible buffers to be created.

Modifcations
------------
true and false representations and pre-allocated and then reused
every time they are needed.

Result
------
No need to create these two representations every time.
