DESCRIPTION

JCBC-855: Cache JsonBooleanTranscoder true/false values.

Motivation
----------
Since only true and false can be passed in, there is a very small
finite number of possible buffers to be created.

Modifcations
------------
true and false representations and pre-allocated and then reused
every time they are needed.

Result
------
No need to create these two representations every time.

Patch Set 1:

since the byte arrays are the only two (short) values we'll ever deal with, we can even cache the ByteBuf, wrapping it in a Unpooled.unreleasableBuffer(...) so that it is ignoring retain() and release() (and can be reused across the board)
