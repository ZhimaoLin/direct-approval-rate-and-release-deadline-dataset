DESCRIPTION

JCBC-781: Allow DCP to be enabled from the builder.

Motivation
----------
DCP was always enable-able from the system property, and it should
be through the builder too. DCP is still experimental.

Modifications
-------------
Remove the hardcoded exception when enabled so it can be set
through the builder.

Result
------
Users can now explicitly enable experimental DCP support through
the builder.
