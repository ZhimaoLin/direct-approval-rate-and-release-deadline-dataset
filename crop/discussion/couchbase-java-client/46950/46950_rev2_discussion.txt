DESCRIPTION

JCBC-712: Cache info() call on the view response.

Motivation
----------
Since the underlying core change now does not allow more than one
subscription, the info() call needs to be cached since it can
be accessed twice if the response is != 200.

Modifications
-------------
Cache the info() observable buffer and pass it on, leading to only
one upstream subscription.

Result
------
No double subscription exceptions.
