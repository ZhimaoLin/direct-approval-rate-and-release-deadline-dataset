Patch Set 1:

This is a WIP for a move to Maven.

Looks like everything is working basically, but some things need to be figured out:

- the maven-release-plugin wants to dictate the versions (as known), so I don' think its a good idea to use it with Jasmin Rangel.
- assemblies can be used instead, need to prepare them
- integrate maven central
- javadoc with dependencies still dont work (as in the past, but it is supposed to do)

otherwise it looks pretty good and streamlined already
