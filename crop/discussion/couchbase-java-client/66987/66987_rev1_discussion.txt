DESCRIPTION

JCBC-998: Util class for raw json N1QL/FTS

Motivation
----------
Both FTS and N1QL request messages exist that allow to get the raw JSON
response out of the service (either in String or ByteBuf form).

In order to make execution of these messages easier (especially those
based on ByteBuf), an utility class outside of the Bucket API makes
sense (as it would otherwise have to be a fully committed API, shared
between SDKs).

Modifications
-------------
Added RawQueryExecutor and its async counterpart AsyncRawQueryExecutor
as such utility classes.

Each allow to get a response in JsonObject or String form, as well as
implementing a custom deserialization easily.

Result
------
N1QL and FTS queries can be executed with a JSON response using the new
utility classes. The N1QL methods are integration tested.
