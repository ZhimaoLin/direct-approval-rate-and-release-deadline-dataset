DESCRIPTION

JCBC-680: adapt (Async)QueryResult to new response

Motivation
----------
In the core, the response for N1QL has been enriched : multiple errors
and delayed final status on the request. Java client must be adapted to
reflect these changes.

Modifications
-------------
Reworked AsyncQueryResult and QueryResult to better reflect the data in
core response.
CouchbaseAsyncBucket now correctly build the whole data (and should also
correclty release underlying buffers).

Result
------
Core and Client response on Query are closer.
