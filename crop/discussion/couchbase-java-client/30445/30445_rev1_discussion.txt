DESCRIPTION

WIP: CCCP

This changeset implements config-over-binary and updates optionally
through CCCP. If no config could be loaded, the HTTP provider is
booted behind the scenes and proxied through.

TODO:
	- handle NMVB responses to update config
	- force fetching of NMVB config if it appears to be stale
	- testing
	- even more testing
	- documentation
