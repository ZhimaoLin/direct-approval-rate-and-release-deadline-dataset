DESCRIPTION

JCBC-931: Rework subdoc error/rename array methods

Motivation:
-----------
Third iteration of the Subdocument RFC introduces changes in how
errors should be handled, particularly changing a few errors and
associated server returned codes for counter.

It also clarifies that, even for a single spec, mutation builder
execution should always throw a MultiMutationException in case of
a subdocument-level error.

Finally, it renames pushFront/pushBack/addUnique to arrayPrepend,
arrayAppend and arrayAddUnique respectively.

Modifications:
--------------
AsyncMutateInBuilder has been modified to reflect the changes
above.
the MutateInBuilder as well as the tests have been adapted.

Results:
--------
Better coherence of the implementation with the SDK RFC's third
iteration.
