Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)



Line:760, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Shouldn't we throw a non-checked exception here?  

Also, shouldn't we have a log message?  If this were in someone's logs, I would like to see a message.   It wouldn't be immediately apparent to me.
