DESCRIPTION

JCBC-777: fix index watching max attempts

Motivation:
-----------
Previous commit had a mistake with too low a max_attempts, and we
actually want to let only the timeout break the polling.

Modifications:
--------------
Max attempt has been increased to Integer.MAX_VALUE, letting the timeout
as the only probable cause for the polling to stop (that and all indexes
going online).
