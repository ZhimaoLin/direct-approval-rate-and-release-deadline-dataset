DESCRIPTION

Make sure test case depends on existing bucket.

Motivation
----------
The ConnectionTest did not depend on the general "ClusterDependentTest"
which made it subject to a potential non-existing bucket, leading to
false-positive assertion errors.

Modifications
-------------
Making it extend ClusterDependentTest.

Result
------
No more failing tests because the bucket doesn't exist by accident.
