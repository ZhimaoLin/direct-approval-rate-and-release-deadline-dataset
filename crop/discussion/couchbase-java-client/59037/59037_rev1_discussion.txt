DESCRIPTION

JCBC-859: Store N1QL raw byte[] and deserialize lazily

Motivation:
-----------
Some users don't want a N1QL row value as a JsonObject but would rather
prefer to deserialize it themselves (perhaps directly to a domain object
of theirs).

Modifications:
--------------
N1qlQueryRow and AsyncN1qlQueryRow now both take the raw byte[] at
construction, as well as an ObjectMapper.

value() will lazily invoke the objectMapper on the raw byte[] to convert
it to a JsonObject, so that never calling value() nor toString() but
byteValue() instead will never perform JSON deserialization, allowing
users to do that themselves (and probably saving them a few ms).

Result:
-------
Custom deserialization of a N1QL row value can be done without paying
the cost of JsonObject deserialization.
