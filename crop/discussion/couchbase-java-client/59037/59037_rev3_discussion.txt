DESCRIPTION

JCBC-869: Store N1QL raw bytes, deserialize lazily

Motivation:
-----------
Some users don't want a N1QL row value as a JsonObject but would rather
prefer to deserialize it themselves (perhaps directly to a domain object
of theirs).

Modifications:
--------------
N1qlQueryRow and AsyncN1qlQueryRow now both take the raw byte[] at
construction.

value() will lazily invoke the objectMapper from JacksonTransformers
on the raw byte[] to convert it to a JsonObject, so that never calling
value() nor toString() but byteValue() instead will never perform JSON
deserialization, allowing users to do that themselves (and probably
saving them a few ms).

Result:
-------
Custom deserialization of a N1QL row value can be done without paying
the overhead of JsonObject deserialization + toString.
