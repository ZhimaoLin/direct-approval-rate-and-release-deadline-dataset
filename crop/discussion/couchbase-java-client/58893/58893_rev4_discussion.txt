DESCRIPTION

JCBC-906: Index Management experimental API second iteration

Motivation:
-----------
After the first experimental API implementation in JCBC-777, an SDK RFC
was created and a few elements received feedback, hence this second
iteration.

Modifications:
--------------
New specific exceptions have been added for case where index creation is
attempted on already existing index, and where drop of an index that
doesn't exist is attempted.

The watchIndex method has been removed in favor of just using the
more generic watchIndexes with a single parameter.
