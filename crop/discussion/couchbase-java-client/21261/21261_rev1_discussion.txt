Patch Set 1:

This is also a WIP, but I think only the appropriate view tests need to be fleshed out a little bit!

I'll be updating it soon.

Patch Set 1: (6 inline comments)

This looks really good. In general we prefer to have smaller commits that address specific issues as opposed to a larger commit. It should be easy to split up though. Let me know if you need any help.

Line:47, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Query.java -> Why is this removed? If it is necessary then please remove it in a seperate commit.

Line:49, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Query.java -> Please add all of the documentation updates as a separate commit.

Line:207, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Query.java -> Is there a reason why we need to add this function? In other words, is there something we can't do with the ComplexKey that requires we define the string ourselves? If not I think this function could introduce errors and potentially inefficient view queries due to not sorting. (Also, I'm not sure how much sorting does or doen't help performance.)

Line:313, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Query.java -> Can you explain why this if statement is necessary?

Line:35, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/QueryTest.java -> Please add these new test cases as a separate commit.

Line:459, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> Please add a test for ComplexKey that actually queries the server.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I'm going to reopen new separate changesets and close this one so we don't get confused since the new ones will be incremental.
