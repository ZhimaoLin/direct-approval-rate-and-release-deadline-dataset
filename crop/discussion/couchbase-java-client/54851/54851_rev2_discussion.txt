DESCRIPTION

JCBC-829: Evict from cache before retry and add tests

When a prepared payload is scheduled for retry, first evict it from
the cache (so that even if re-prepare fails, we'll have a chance to
try again next time the same statement is issued).

Added tests on the extraction of the plan, content of the execute
prepared query (server name, along with "encoded_plan" for
the compressed plan...).
