DESCRIPTION

JCBC-928: Allow custom primary name in Index DSL

Motivation:
-----------
In N1QL, additional primary indexes can be constructed by giving them a
name. Dropping such indexes is done via the same syntax as dropping a
secondary index: "DROP INDEX namespace.name".

Modifications:
--------------
The Index DSL has been augmented to allow creating and dropping of such
custom-named indexes. For dropping, a new method name was necessary due
to colliding signatures, so "dropCustomPrimaryIndex" was chosen.

Result:
-------
Custom primary indexes can now be dealt with with the Index DSL.
