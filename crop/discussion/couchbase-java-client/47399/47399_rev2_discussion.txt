DESCRIPTION

JCBC-719: Rework bucket flush internals.

Motivation
----------
The current flush approach did work, but it was not good for a number of
reasons.

	- It used a blocking poll in an asynchronous call - this should
	  not be done of course.
	- It only did poll for one specific document, but instead we
	  need to poll for documents in all partitions to make sure
	  flush is completely done.

Modifications
-------------
The flushing mechanism is now separated into its own helper class and tests
have been added to make sure its working properly.

Result
------
More correct and functional flush polling against all vbuckets instead of
one.
