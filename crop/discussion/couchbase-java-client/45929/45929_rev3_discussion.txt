DESCRIPTION

JCBC-628: Add JsonValue factory method fromJson()

Motivation
----------
Add another way of creating JsonObject/JsonArray, from JSON Strings.

Modifications
-------------
Added fromJson() static method on both JsonObject and JsonArray, named
like that to avoid confusion with "from" method called with a String.

Added unit tests to check behavior.

Results
-------
Users can now easily create a JsonArray/JsonObject from a JSON String
(provided they know the kind of JSON value the String contains).
