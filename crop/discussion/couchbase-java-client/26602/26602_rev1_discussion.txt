Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(2 inline comments)



Line:343, build.xml -> As mentioned in the other commit, this takes away the old target, which was serving it's purpose just fine, and replaces it with a very different behavior.

If we want to drive this from ant, then it should be a new target, not changing the current target which is still needed for publishing to the maven repository.

Line:44, build.xml -> As mentioned in the other commit, lots of whitespace changes here.  Can you undo the whitespace changes since it's not related to the change being submitted?
