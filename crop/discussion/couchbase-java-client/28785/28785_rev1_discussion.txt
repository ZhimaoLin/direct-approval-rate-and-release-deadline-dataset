DESCRIPTION

JCBC-138: Replace nodeList on reconfiguration to reflect changes.

This changeset makes sure that, after a reconfiguration, the new
node list is passed on to the configuration handler so that it is
aware of the new topology.

This changeset now makes it possible that also when only one node
is passed in during construction, all of the other nodes will be
picked up proactively.

See inline comments.  Maybe this can be +2'd with simple replies to the questions though.

Line:448, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> Do you really want this in a .info() level?  I'm not sure if it should print out all of that detail at that level.  I forget if we have a .config() level.

I'm okay with whatever you decide, but philosophically I feel like you need to turn the logging level up when you want details like this.  Having some info is good, but logging datastructures raw is something to do at a lower level.  Maybe a .info() saying it's changed, and then another log level after it at .config() or debug()  that the change is from blah to blah.

Again, I'm good with whatever.

Line:453, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> we should be whining to the log here, right?  bucketServers.size() was not greater than 0.

Line:463, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> not a big deal, but with this we're getting close to having something to define as an object and override .equals() for readability.

One additional comment.  Note that to make it unibrow compliant, the node lists will have to be randomly used.

Line:463, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> Not really necessary given that this code will likely be replaced soon.  It was just a general commentary on comparators.
