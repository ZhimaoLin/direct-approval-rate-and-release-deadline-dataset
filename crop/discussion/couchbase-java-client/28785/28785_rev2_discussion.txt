DESCRIPTION

JCBC-138: Replace nodeList on reconfiguration to reflect changes.

This changeset makes sure that, after a reconfiguration, the new
node list is passed on to the configuration handler so that it is
aware of the new topology.

This changeset now makes it possible that also when only one node
is passed in during construction, all of the other nodes will be
picked up proactively.

I'm +0 on this, but had a few possibly relevant comments

Line:457, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> I'd probably add a .debug() after that which prints out the thing that couldn't be parsed.  Will save time if it ever comes up in the field.

Line:464, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> won't this always randomize it?

Line:477, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> ah, it won't, but that's confusing.

Line:491, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> this doesn't take the randomization into account.

I might consider restructuring this such that the list is just the list, and we mark them as visited or not when iterating.  getNext() would pluck one off, either random or ordered, and mark it as used.  getting a new config would put give me a new list.

Line:498, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> ah, I see, you're linear searching for each one.
