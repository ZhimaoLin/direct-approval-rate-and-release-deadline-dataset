DESCRIPTION

Harden "bucket state"-dependent test cases.

This changeset makes sure that various test cases which depend
on bucket state (that is mostly warmup happening) are more
resilient to false-negatives. This is mostly achieved through
larger allowed timeouts, which allows slower disks also to
catch up between the unit tests.

It increases the timeout for the http cluster
operations in the test from 2.5 seconds (operationTimeout) to
the more realistic HttpTimeout (75 seconds).
