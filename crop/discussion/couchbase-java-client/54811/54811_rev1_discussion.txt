DESCRIPTION

JCBC-834: Fix spatial query using default query timeout

Motivation:
-----------
Spatial queries should use the default VIEW timeout instead of the query
timeout.

Modifications:
--------------
Made CouchbaseBucket.query(SpatialViewQuery) use the view timeout from
the environment. Also documented where the default timeouts come from on
view/spatial/n1ql query method javadocs.

Results:
--------
The spatial queries now use the view timeout by default, as advertised.
