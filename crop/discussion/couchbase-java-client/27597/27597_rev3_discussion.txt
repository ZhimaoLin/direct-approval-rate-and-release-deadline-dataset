DESCRIPTION

CouchbaseProperties should use the SPY LoggerFactory.

Before this change, these log messages were not properly
logged with respect to the configured logging endpoint.

Also, the informative log message has been degraded to
DEBUG, because it is not used that often and it generates
confusion.
