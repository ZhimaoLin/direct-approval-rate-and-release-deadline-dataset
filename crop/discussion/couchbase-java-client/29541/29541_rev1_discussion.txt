DESCRIPTION

Moving CouchbaseClient docblocks to the IF and xxx@xxx.xxx

Since the CouchbaseClient grows out of bounds with the recent
additions, moving the docblocks makes it shorter. Also, this is
where they belong to anyway. Actual refactoring of the code
will follow in separate commits.

I'm trusting the IDE for the most part here.  If you need a very thorough review, let me know.
