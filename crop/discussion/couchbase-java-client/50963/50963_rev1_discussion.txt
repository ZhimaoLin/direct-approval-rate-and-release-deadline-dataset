DESCRIPTION

JCBC-769: fix javadoc for RetryBuilder

Motivation
----------
The class javadoc for RetryBuilder is incorrect, starting point should
be static methods anyOf, allBut and any.

Modifications
-------------
Fixed the class javadoc.

Also mentioned the behavior when errors keep
occurring past the maxAttempts allowed number of retries (a specific
CannotRetryException is raised), both in class javadoc and on max and
once methods javadoc.

Result
------
Javadoc for RetryBuilder is more accurate.
