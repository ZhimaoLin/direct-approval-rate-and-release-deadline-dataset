Patch Set 7: (6 inline comments)

I've not taken this for a spin under spring yet, but will do in a bit.  There do remain some issues, however.

Line:25, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCacheException.java -> Javadoc?  It looks like there's just enough here to pass checkstyle?

Line:51, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> This is definitely not the right behavior.  If I start the same app on multiple servers, this will have the side effect of clearing the cache each time a server is restarted?

That'd be horrible on application performance.

Line:81, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> this TapClient object just hangs out forever?  might be okay for now as a workaround, but doesn't seem right at all.  Can clear() be called multiple times?  my guess is no.

Line:133, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> This is not right.  Obviously, if they have this object already, there is no reason to call a method to get a reference to it.  Looking at some of the other implementations, this should probably be the wrapped CouchbaseClient object.

Line:145, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> seems not quite right to fill up the logs with the value, does it?  I'd expect to do some debug level logging for this.

Line:47, src/test/manual/com/couchbase/client/test/CouchbaseCacheTest.java -> I think you mean, add an argument based on how the test is written.

Shouldn't the test class be under the test be unde the same namespace as the corresponding class? (springframework)

This will not generate a pom file with the correct dependencies.

Line:70, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringCacheTest.java -> Please infer a type.

Line:21, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> Please change the package name from springframework to just spring as this is the naming strategy in spymemcached.

Line:30, ivy/ivysettings.xml -> This files should have no changes.
