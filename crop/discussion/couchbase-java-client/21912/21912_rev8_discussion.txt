Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:50, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringCacheTest.java -> This comment is not necessary.

Line:74, ivy.xml -> We don't seem to need this dependency.

Line:82, ivy.xml -> Or any of the dependencies below.

Line:63, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringBaseTest.java -> This test looks like it can only be run with the help of the ant script. If I try to run it through my ide for example then I get null pointer exception. This test should be fixed so that the testcase can be run anywhere since I shouldn't have to run all of the test if I only need to check changes to the spring stuff.

Patch Set 8:

We should also create a test project that pulls in Couchbase Client and uses the spring features in order to make sure that everything actually works properly since I don't feel like we have enough tests to make sure that this will work with spring.
