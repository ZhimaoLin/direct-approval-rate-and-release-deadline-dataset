Line:47, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringCacheTest.java -> An IP address isn't really a URI, right?

Line:107, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/spring/SpringCacheTest.java -> No test of "clear" here, right?

Line:50, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> what happens if these are thrown from here?

Line:53, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> This looks to be a SPOF, right?  I'm relatively certain other cache providers can't be doing that.

Line:79, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> Interesting workaround, but there's a lot here that can fail, right?  

Given that flush is working in 2.0 (as discussed on the mailing list), shouldn't this be connected to flush?  Of course, the challenge is the flush can run for a long, long time.

Line:54, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> Don't use a connection factory builder unless you want to set some custom values. Use CouchbaseConnectionFactory.

Line:59, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> I don't think we should cleat the cache in the constructor. This will be very bad since each instantiation will delete all data in Couchbase.

Line:79, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> I think flush would run for a shorter amount of time then what has been done here. Streaming all keys and then deleting them individually will potentially take a long time.

Line:106, src/main/java/com/couchbase/springframework/CouchbaseCache.java -> I don't think it makes sense to just log errors.
