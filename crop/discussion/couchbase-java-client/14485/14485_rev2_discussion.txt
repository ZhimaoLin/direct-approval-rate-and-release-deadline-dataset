Patch Set 2: Do not submit

(6 inline comments)

-2 for commit message.

I still think this is doable with a unit test of known keys and hashes.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> While it's great that this has an issue, it should *never* be a case tracking (i.e. CBSE) issue.

You need to file a JCBC issue (should be done after the bug is verified), and then make sure the summary line references it.  The summary line *must* also say what the patch set does.  Something like:

Use the correct default hashing algorithm. JCBC-999

Line:42, src/test/manual/com/couchbase/client/test/CouchbaseMoxiTest.java -> whitespace!

Line:56, src/test/manual/com/couchbase/client/test/CouchbaseMoxiTest.java -> crank this up to 10000 or higher. 100 may find it, but we may as well go further if we can.

Line:82, src/test/manual/com/couchbase/client/test/CouchbaseMoxiTest.java -> there's a bug here.  c.set() is an asynchronous call, while cbc.get() is a blocking call.  Better to change this to c.set().get() so it blocks (though the test will run slightly slower)

Line:87, src/test/manual/com/couchbase/client/test/CouchbaseMoxiTest.java -> no point in deleting, is there?

Line:89, src/test/manual/com/couchbase/client/test/CouchbaseMoxiTest.java -> same bug.
