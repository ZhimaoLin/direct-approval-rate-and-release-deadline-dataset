DESCRIPTION

JCBC-330: Exposing expiration on more CAS methods.

This changeset exposes the - already implemented - expiration
setting on CAS methods to more signatures. This makes it easier
to avoid a subsequent touch() on the sync methods and enables
it at all on the persistTo/replicateTo variants.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

It would be good if we can add some tests related to this.
But giving you +2 otherwise.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Agree with Deepti, we need tests.  I think we all know what the tests should do, but I've had them surprise me before.

Also, this extends interface.  Should be part of 1.2?  We need to get better about this.  Is there a compelling need for a 1.1.9 fix for this?

Patch Set 1:

Sounds good, I'm going to add some tests here.

There were some people asking for it, but I don
't think there is a compelling reason to get it right now into 1.1.9. 

Let's hold this off for 1.2.
