DESCRIPTION

JCBC-330: Exposing expiration on more CAS methods.

This changeset exposes the - already implemented - expiration
setting on CAS methods to more signatures. This makes it easier
to avoid a subsequent touch() on the sync methods and enables
it at all on the persistTo/replicateTo variants.

Patch Set 2:

I added tests to the corresponding overlays in SPY. Note that these here are just method signatures that pass stuff on, funneling down into the asyncCAS method that is tested in SPY.
