DESCRIPTION

JCBC-330: Exposing expiration on more CAS methods.

This changeset exposes the - already implemented - expiration
setting on CAS methods to more signatures. This makes it easier
to avoid a subsequent touch() on the sync methods and enables
it at all on the persistTo/replicateTo variants.
