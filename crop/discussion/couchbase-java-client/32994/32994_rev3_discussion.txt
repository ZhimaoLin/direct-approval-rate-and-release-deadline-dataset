DESCRIPTION

JCBC-407: Add BootstrapNodeUtil class to help with DNS SRV bootstrap.

A BootstrapNodeUtil class is provided, which takes a DNS SRV endpoint and
transforms it into a list of bootstrappable URIs. For example

	String path = "_seeds._tcp.couchbase.com";
	new CouchbaseClient(BootstrapNodeUtil.locateFromDNS(path),...);

I love the change and how you adopted the idea!

However, I think we may need to think about the failure case here a bit and we may want to socialize how the weighting is being handled.

Line:97, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/BootstrapNodeUtil.java -> As you suggest it be used, this would throw a RuntimeException in the ctor.  Sadly, DNS lookup is IO.  Network IO at that and thus it's even less reliable, so it may even make sense to have it a checked exception.  I know that's unfortunate, but it'd get the user to have to handle it outside the ctor to the CouchbaseClient.

Line:97, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/BootstrapNodeUtil.java -> Not sure I can follow. It's a static helper method that will blow up even before it is passed into the CouchbaseClient object, so it wont reach its c'tor?
