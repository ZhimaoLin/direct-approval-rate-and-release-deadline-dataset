DESCRIPTION

JCBC-407: Add BootstrapNodeUtil class to help with DNS SRV bootstrap.

A BootstrapNodeUtil class is provided, which takes a DNS SRV endpoint and
transforms it into a list of bootstrappable URIs. For example

   String path = "_seeds._tcp.couchbase.com";
   try {
      List<URI> seedNodes = BootstrapNodeUtil.locateFromDNS(path);
      new CouchbaseClient(seedNodes,...);
   } catch(IOException ex) {
      // Could not load the records from DNS...
   }
