DESCRIPTION

JCBC-407: Add BootstrapNodeUtil class to help with DNS SRV bootstrap.

A BootstrapNodeUtil class is provided, which takes a DNS SRV endpoint and
transforms it into a list of bootstrappable URIs. For example

	String path = "_seeds._tcp.couchbase.com";
	new CouchbaseClient(BootstrapNodeUtil.locateFromDNS(path),...);
