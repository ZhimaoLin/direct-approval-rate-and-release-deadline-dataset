DESCRIPTION

JCBC-876: Add integration tests for DML

Motivation
----------
Since 4.0 ships DML as experimental and 4.1 will ship it as GA, it
makes sense for the java client to have appropriate tests in place.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset starts with this effort and adds integration tests
for INSERT, UPSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. One test for DELETE has
been ignored for now until MB-16732 is resolved.

Note that MERGE tests have not been added yet. More tests will
certainly be added as the development of the fluent API for those
kinds of statements progresses.

Result
------
First batch of integration tests for N1QL DML.
