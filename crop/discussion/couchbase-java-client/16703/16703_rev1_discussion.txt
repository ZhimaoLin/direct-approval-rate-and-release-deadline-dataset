I see you had the same question/concern on the VBucketNodeLocator.  I think I'd rather we not make that change right now.

The whole nodelocator and configuration needs refactoring, but the other changes look welcome.

Line:102, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> I'm not sure I'd want this final.  What if I extend it for testing or later we have a slightly modified VBucketNodeLocator?

Was this merely IDE recommendation?
