DESCRIPTION

CCCP-WIP: Combined configuration Provider

This changeset provides a combined http and binary configuration provider. It is
designed to handle bootstrap and monitoring completely autonomously, further
decoupling it from the rest of the codebase.

It is still heavily evolving as I add pieces...

Identified TODOs:
 - make sure fallbacks work properly
 - implement transparent http monitoring
 - implement transparent binary config fetching
 - implement respecting the new "signalOutdated" method properly, depending on the
   monitor used.
 - testing and all.

Also note that I made the call to change the (internal) api of the configuration
provider.. its a mess right now and this will clean it up. Also, the plan is to
not rely on the reconfiguration dance anymore with the "resubscriber".. to much
coupling and error prone, we'll see how things evolve.
