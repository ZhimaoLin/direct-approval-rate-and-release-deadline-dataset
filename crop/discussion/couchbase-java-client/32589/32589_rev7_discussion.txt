DESCRIPTION

CCCP-WIP: Combined configuration Provider

This changeset provides a combined http and binary configuration provider. It is
designed to handle bootstrap and monitoring completely autonomously, further
decoupling it from the rest of the codebase.

Identified TODOs:
	- Implement Binary Config loading on demand (when outdated)
	- Implement SignalOutdated()
	- Change the other code to now work with the new interface

	- Testing, Testing, more Testing

Also note that I made the call to change the (internal) api of the configuration
provider.. its a mess right now and this will clean it up. Also, the plan is to
not rely on the reconfiguration dance anymore with the "resubscriber".. to much
coupling and error prone, we'll see how things evolve.
