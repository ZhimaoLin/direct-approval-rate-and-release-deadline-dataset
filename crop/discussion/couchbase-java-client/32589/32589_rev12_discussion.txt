DESCRIPTION

JCBC-337: Implement a Combined Configuration Provider (Binary + HTTP)

designed to handle bootstrap and monitoring completely autonomously, further
decoupling it from the rest of the codebase.

Just a couple of minor things in there.

Line:141, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryTest.java -> oops, commented out code.  -2 for this

Line:80, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CbTestConfig.java -> hm.  I'm not sure if doing this is the right thing to do.  Why not just bounce off of a failure there?

Line:108, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> it's minor, but you could use the string "could bootstrap through carrier publication"

Line:322, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> is there a concurrency issue here?  I don't know if we want many things clearing and adding to the list, but I don't know the callers.

Line:380, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> code smell.  Catching all exceptions here?

Line:86, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProviderTest.java -> this line shouldn't be committed.  now I know your internal network!

Line:80, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CbTestConfig.java -> because we have some conditional test cases that work if cccp is not available.. the method is used in setup parts of unit tests.

Line:108, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> totally

Line:322, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> you are right, the list needs to be thread safe. also, I probably need to make it more intelligent because there could be a small timeframe where there is no seedNode in the list, which is unfortunate.

Line:380, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProvider.java -> my intent here is that I really dont want to fail in any case, and if we do we just re-run the bootstrap. I wanted to keep the config backbone alive, while always falling back to re-bootstrap if things go horribly wrong.

Line:86, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/provider/BucketConfigurationProviderTest.java -> yes you do. NOW YOU CAN HACK ME!
