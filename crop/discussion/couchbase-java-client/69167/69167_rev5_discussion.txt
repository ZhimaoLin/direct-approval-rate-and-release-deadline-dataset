DESCRIPTION

JCBC-900 Add datastructure support

Motivation
----------
Provide higher level data structure support over Subdoc APIs. This aims
for a rich developer experience by ready-to-use data structures like
list, map, queue and set for creating and populating couchbase
documents.

Changes
-------
Provided bucket level sync and async api for datastructures using subdoc
operations. Added MutationOptionBuilder interface to
build mutation operation contraints. Added DataStructure tests to verify
the correctness.

Results
-------
Experimental data structure apis on CouchbaseBucket and
CouchbaseAsyncBucket.
