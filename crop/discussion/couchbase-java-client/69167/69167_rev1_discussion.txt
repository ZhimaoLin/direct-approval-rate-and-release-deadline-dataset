DESCRIPTION

JCBC-900 Add Map datastructure support

Motivation
----------
Provide higher level data structure support over Subdoc APIs. This aims
for a rich developer experience by ready-to-use data structures like
list, map, queue and set for creating and populating couchbase
documents.

Changes
-------
Added AsyncCouchbaseMap interface which uses subdocument dict upsert api
to add dictionay items to document, subdocument path remove to remove
items and uses full document get to calculate size. Provided bucket
level sync and async api wrapping the AsyncCouchbaseMap interface. Added
MutationOptionBuilder interface to build mutation operation contraints. Added
DataStructure tests to verify the correctness.

Results
-------
CouchbaseMap data structure experimental apis on CouchbaseBucket and
CouchbaseAsyncBucket.
