DESCRIPTION

Added mocked unit tests that experiment with back-pressure

First a classical bulk get pattern scenario is demonstrated, where
BackpressureException is thrown because the ringbuffer is filled (as
simulated by the mock reacting to queue reaching MAX_CAPACITY).

Secondly, a new pattern is demonstrated where natural flow control in
RxJava is used to avoid that BackpressureException, by using the flatMap
maxConcurrent variant.
