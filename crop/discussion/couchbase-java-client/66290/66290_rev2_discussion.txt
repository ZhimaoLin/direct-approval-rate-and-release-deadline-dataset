DESCRIPTION

JCBC-992: DNS SRV workaround when IPv6 nameserver

Motivation:
-----------
The Boostrap class, used to bootstrap the SDK from a DNS SRV record,
relies on the default host machine DNS resolution.
In the case where the DNS server list configured in the host machine
include IPv6 entries, the whole initialization breaks and there's no
way of using a different resolution process.

Modifications:
--------------
An additional overload for Bootstrap is added that accepts a nameserver
IP (should be an IPv4), to use with the "dns://" prefix for direct name
resolution instead of attempting to compile a list of name servers from
the OS.

The Bootstrap test has been amended to use this feature and rely on
Google's public DNS ("8.8.8.8").

Results:
--------
Boostrap test pass even on a machine where IPv6 name servers are
configured.
Such configurations can be worked around by providing an explicit
name server address, if needed.
