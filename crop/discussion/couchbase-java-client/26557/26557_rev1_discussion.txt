Patch Set 1:

This breaks backwards compatibility, so we can only do this for 1.2 or later!

Patch Set 1:

The create bucket functionality remains as is. Only in addition to it,the user can also edit buckets using the client.Why do you think it breaks the backward compatibility ?

Patch Set 1:

because you added the "dont do it when it already exists" check to the create method!

Patch Set 1:

Yes, but I am sure we are not creating the bucket twice anywhere currently. The test using which I found this bug was not any of the junit tests.

Patch Set 1:

I'm actually in favor of this.  I think it's a bug to allow trying to create a bucket that already exists, and we'll have better error handling if we fix the bug. 

It is a behavior change though as Michael points out.

I'll leave the decision up to Michael.  There is probably a good argument for including this in 1.1.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Hey, 

I already wanted to put it through, but I ran the tests.. the last one failed for me with a 500 error! Why is the last one using the BucketTool when it tests the ClusterManager?

The other ones are all passing.. maybe you should just get rid of it? Otherwise its fine!

Hi Michael,

I applied this change on top of the latest master and I am able to run the last test without failure. There seems to be a rare reason for a 500 error. Can you please re-confirm ?

Thanks !
