Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Normally I'm not a fan of changing logging strings in micro versions, but I let the one change in here slide.

BTW, the reason I'm not normally a fan is because they are a form of interface.  Imagine tools that grep logs for a particular thing to do alerting.  This is why I've left "Disconnected unexpected" for so many years.
