DESCRIPTION

JCBC-???: implement rest of N1QL tutorial and adapt DSL (WIP)

Motivation
----------
/// WORK IN PROGRESS

Modifications
-------------
Added remaining steps from tutorial to smoke tests.

Added functions helpers for Date, Number, String.
Added sum and distinct functions in AggregateFunctions.

GroupByPath can now directly use identifiers in String form.

Modified KeyPath so that distinction between a String constant key vs an
identifier key is more explicit.

Marked various DSL classes xxx@xxx.xxx

Results
-------
Except for tutorial steps where DML is used, all steps are covered by
the SelectDslSmokeTest.
