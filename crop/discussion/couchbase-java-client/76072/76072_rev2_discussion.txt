DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1061 Add query profile info to N1qlQuery result

Motivation
----------
If query profile info is requested using a raw param, the query response
contains profile information and it is parsed if using yasjl parser. Expose
this information on N1qlQueryResult.

Changes
-------
Add profileInfo JsonObject to N1qlQueryResult and the corresponding observable to
AsyncN1qlQueryResult. Map the bytebuf emitted by QueryResponse to jsonObject
by parsing it using objectMapper. Default is an empty object. Added changes to
existing tests to include profileInfo.

Results
-------
Query profile info should be available in N1qlResult and AsyncN1qlResult
if requested.
