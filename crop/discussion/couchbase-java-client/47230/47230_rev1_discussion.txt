DESCRIPTION

JCBC-717: expose N1QL signature

Motivation
----------
N1QL signature is relevant to some users reviewing N1QL. It is exposed
in the core since JVMCBC-153 and should be exposed as well in client.

Modifications
-------------
Added signature as an Observable<JsonObject> in AsyncQueryResult and as
a JsonObject in QueryResult.
Added an integration test for the signature.

This change depends on JVMCBC-153 in core.

Results
-------
Users can retrieve the signature section of the N1QL response as a
JsonObject.
