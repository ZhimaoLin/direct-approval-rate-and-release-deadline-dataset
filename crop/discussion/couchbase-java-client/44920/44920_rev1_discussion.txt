DESCRIPTION

JCBC-671: Ignore bad responses after retry handling.

Motivation
----------
When the view retry handler kicks in, it retries the view operation, but
the retryWhen handler emits all the "bad" responses as well. The code
afterwards instead only expects one good result to be emitted.

Modifications
-------------
The code now only returns the last() result, which is the good one, after
retrying succeeded. In addition, the code properly frees the info bytebufs,
since they are not accessed anymore when retried.

Result
------
Correct retry handling so that ever only one result is emitted.
