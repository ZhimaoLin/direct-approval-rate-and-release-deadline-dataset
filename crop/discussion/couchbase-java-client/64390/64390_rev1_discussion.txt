DESCRIPTION

JCBC-963: Facet name is kept in SearchQuery

Motivation:
-----------
In RFC10 (couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs#17), some SDKs can directly map the
object representation to JSON. In the previous design of facets, having
the name attribute as part of the SearchFacet made that problematic.
It has been decided that the name of a facet should only be set on the
SearchQuery in which the facet is added (which would also allow reuse of
facets across queries, with different names).

Modifications:
--------------
SearchFacet has no name attribute anymore, moved into the SearchQuery.
