DESCRIPTION

JCBC-757: Support Builder for Merg.

Motivation
----------
Like with SELECT, it is important to provide a nice builder API ("DSL") for
the recently stableized N1QL mutation commands.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the builder API for the MERGE variant. Unit tests have been added to
verify the resulting N1QL query.

Result
------
It is now possible to easily run merge statements using the nice
builder API.
