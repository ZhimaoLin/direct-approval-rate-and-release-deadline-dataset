DESCRIPTION

When adding ops we now use enqueueOperation()

addOp() was removed from MemcachedClient and into memcachedConnection
and then renamed to enqueueOperation. This change makes it so we
now use the new function.

Patch Set 1: Fails

This too is looking for isMembase().  The dependency order here on the commits is slightly wrong.  I think these can probably be reordered.
