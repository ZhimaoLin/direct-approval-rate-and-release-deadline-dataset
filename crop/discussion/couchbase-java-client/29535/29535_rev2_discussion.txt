Mostly because of the order change.  I would -2 this but I don't want to be the holdup on getting it through later and I won't always be online.

Michael/Mike: I might be okay with the order change without a JCBC, but the commit message oneliner doesn't go with it.

Line:458, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> I think this is correct, but it's more than removing redundant code in this case.  This moves the shutdown() after the subscribe().

Line:1108, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> I always consider these handy while debugging.  Not so much redundant.

Abandoned

Abandoning this to do it fresh on the recent changes.. to much work to refactor, its easier to do it new.
