DESCRIPTION

Depend on spymemcached 2.8.1-SNAPSHOT.

I've pushed a tag to the first commit on spymemcached after
the last release, verified that it's building/installing
with the snapshot tag.  Then based this on it.  We need
to release them in order, obviously.

Seems like the best flexibility for now with how things are
changing.
