DESCRIPTION

JCBC-136: Add support for spatial view queries.

This changeset adds support for spatial view queries and implements
appropriate test cases to prove their usage and behavior. This is a
possible API break because the ViewRow interface has changed a bit
and one now has to cast the documents inside the iteration when
he wants to access the Key or the Value (since geo views have
bbox and geometry values instead).

Patch Set 2:

I removed the private comments based on your suggestions.

@Volker: I think for now we skip pagination for spatial queries because at a first look this would also mean we need to rewrite pagination quite a bit. I know there is an outstanding issue regarding pagination, so we may incorporate it a little bit later. Since its experimental, I don't see a problem with it currently.

@Matt, Mike:
I have a few doubts on the ViewRow interface change. My change now leaves the user typecasting the result when he wants to use the key/value stuff since I had to remove it (because spatials dont have them). 

One approach would be to completely separate it (for example return a SpatialViewResponse) or so, which would then return a SpatialViewRow. We still would have to decide how and where we split the ViewRow interface and how to subclass it.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

@Michael: For me it looks like the pagination would just be the same. What would be the difference? We can also follow up on IRC on that topic.

Patch Set 2:

After discussion on IRC with volker we'd agree that we'll do pagination later on.

After this is acceptable and merged in, I'll open a separate ticket to track this - shouldnt be too hard though.
