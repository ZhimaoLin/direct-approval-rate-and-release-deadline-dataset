DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1086 Add getUser api to cluster manager

Motivation
----------
The recent RFC changes are to add getUser and endpoint change for
getUsers.

Changes
-------
Both ClusterManager and AsyncClusterManager support getUser with a
username. getUser and getUsers use the same GetUsersRequest by passing
empty string or username.

Results
-------
getUser api is added. Verification tests pass.
