DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1043: Add toString for N1QL Rows and Sync Result

Motivation
----------
If SELECT RAW was used to print out a row, the code
would fail since it would not be parsable into a
JsonObject.

Modifications
-------------
The code has been fixed to just turn it into a string
and dump it that way, enabling all kinds of output
instead of just a JsonObject.

This change also adds a toString to the sync N1qlResult
since it makes sense to add it for utility purposes.

Result
------
Propery printing for Rows with Select RAW as well as
sync results.
