DESCRIPTION

JCBC-554: Provide retry/backoff utility wrapper

WORK IN PROGRESS

Motivation
----------
Exponential retry and backoff is an useful pattern and it makes sense
to provide an utility class to the SDK users to do that.

Modifications
-------------
Added a Retry utility class that allows to describe a retry pattern via
RetryWithDelayHandler and wrap an Observable in order to apply this
retry pattern.

Added CannotRetryException to denote when a retry attempt failed.

TODO: unit tests.

Result
------
Users can more easily apply a retry pattern to their Observables.
