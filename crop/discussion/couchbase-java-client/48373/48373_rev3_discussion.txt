DESCRIPTION

JCBC-554: Provide retry/backoff utility wrapper

Motivation
----------
Exponential retry and backoff is an useful pattern and it makes sense
to provide an utility class to the SDK users to do that.

Modifications
-------------
Added a Retry utility class that allows to describe a retry pattern by
wrapping the source.
An alternative is to directly use Observable.retryWhen with the new
RetryWhenFunction.

Both approaches take a RetryWithDelayHandler, a class that allows to
describe the retry pattern (max attempts, retry delay and how it grows,
exceptions that can be retried or on the contrary cancel retry cycle).

Added CannotRetryException to denote when a retry attempt failed. It
should always have the Exception that triggered the latest retry as its
cause.

Added various unit tests to check the retry behavior.

Result
------
Users can more easily apply a retry pattern to their Observables, either
by calling a wrapping function or passing a RetryWhenFunction to their
Observable's retryWhen operation.
