DESCRIPTION

JCBC-388: Rewrite View Connection Management

This changeset rewrites the connection management of the view layer
by utilizing newer mechanisms in apache httpcore nio.

	- Reduces the amount of threads used to a minimum
	- Fixes severe connection issues under failover conditions
	- Massively reduces the amount of code needed
	- Streamlines the reconfiguration process in ViewConnection
	- Makes the worker threads and connection size configurable
	- Handles connection lease on rebalance out
	- Adds better testing for the provided functionality
	- Writes the HTTP_HOST automatically to avoid costly DNS
	  lookups, fixing JCBC-151.
