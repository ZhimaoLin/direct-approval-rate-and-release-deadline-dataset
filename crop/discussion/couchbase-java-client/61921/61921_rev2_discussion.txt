DESCRIPTION

JCBC-939: Add retrieveIn subdoc convenience method

Motivation:
-----------
As described in the RFC, a convenience method can be added to the bucket
level API to initialize a LookupInBuilder with several get specs and
execute it in one go.

Modifications:
--------------
Added retrieveIn subdoc convenience method at the bucket level, both
with a vararg-based and a collection-based signatures.
Added tests for these new methods.

Results:
--------
Several subdoc gets can be easily performed in a single call by using
retrieveIn. The convenience method is tested in integration tests.
