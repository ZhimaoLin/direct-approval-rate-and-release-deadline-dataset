DESCRIPTION

JCBC-939: Add retrieveIn subdoc convenience method

Motivation:
-----------
As described in the RFC, a convenience method can be added to the bucket
level API to initialize a LookupInBuilder with several get specs and
execute it in one go.

Modifications:
--------------
Added retrieveIn subdoc convenience method at the bucket level, both
with a vararg-based and a List-based signatures.

The List based signature is chosen over a Collection or Iterable because
the iteration order is inherently important, as it will drive the order
of the specs and as such the order of the results. This becomes quite
important when using DocumentFragment.content(int index) methods.

Added tests for these new methods.

Results:
--------
Several subdoc gets can be easily performed in a single call by using
retrieveIn. The convenience method is tested in integration tests.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

(5 comments)

the change looks good to me (few comments on execute), but I'm still torn if we should have this in initially. It's adding more API and we don't know if people will use it, since its just a small convenience wrapper and it adds another verb to the Bucket API.

Line:2043, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AsyncBucket.java -> "are looked up", we shouldn't directly address users in comments I think.

Line:2058, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AsyncBucket.java -> same notes as above :)

Line:4438, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Bucket.java -> same comments as in AsyncBucket
