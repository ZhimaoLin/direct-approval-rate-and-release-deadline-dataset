DESCRIPTION

JCBC-672: Use timer instead of interval on view retry.

Motivation
----------
On a view retry, the handler should only initate the retry once, instead
of over and over again on the interval.

Modifications
-------------
Use the timer instead of interval on the Observable to re-initiate the
retry logic.

Result
------
Correct behaviour on view retry.
