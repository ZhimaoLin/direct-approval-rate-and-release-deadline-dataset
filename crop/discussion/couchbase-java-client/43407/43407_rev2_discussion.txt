DESCRIPTION

JCBC-583: Fix leaks out of the netty ByteBuf pool when decoding.

Motivation
----------
Some paths of the decoding process did not properly release the ByteBufs back to the
pool which lead to increased unnecessary GC.

Modifications
-------------
When the ByteBuf is not needed anymore, it is proactively released.

Result
------
No leak reports when working with view rows and N1Ql components.
