DESCRIPTION

JCBC-984: Don't broadcast query plan to non-query nodes.

Motivation
----------
When a query plan needs to be broadcasted to all the nodes
it is important that in an MDS setup those broadcasts are
not sent to non-query nodes since their requests will never
be able to complete (retried forever and time out eventually).

Modifications
-------------
The code has been adapted to filter() out any nodes that do
not have the QUERY service enabled.

Result
------
Query plan is only broadcasted to query nodes.
