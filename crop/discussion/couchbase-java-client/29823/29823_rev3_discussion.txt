JCBC-373: The replica get future to complete is not thread safe.

This leads to false positives while the future could be completed
but never is because of visibility issues.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

(2 comments)

Line:59, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/internal/ReplicaGetFuture.java -> It's sorta scary for stuff like this to be public.  You may want to consider adding a javadoc block stating don't touch this.

Line:87, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/internal/ReplicaGetFuture.java -> good point in using the isDone().
