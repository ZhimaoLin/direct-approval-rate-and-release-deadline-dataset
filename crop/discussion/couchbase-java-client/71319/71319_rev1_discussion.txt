Line:189, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/bucket/DefaultAsyncBucketManager.java -> this block needs to go before the return block since right now it will not release() the content buffer

Line:302, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/bucket/DefaultAsyncBucketManager.java -> same as above I think

Line:20, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/error/DesignDocumentDoesNotExistException.java -> at least a headline would be great :)

Line:24, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/error/DesignDocumentDoesNotExistException.java -> should extend the DesignDocumentException so its in line with the DesignDocumentAlreadyExistsException

Line:26, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/error/DesignDocumentDoesNotExistException.java -> wrong tabs/spaces it seems
