Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

I'm only giving this a -1 because I am not familiar with the code, but it seems you're testing the connection to the actual cluster -- (judging by the expected error messages). We need a test where the bucket is successfully connected to (i.e. key value operations function OK) but where the view node being reached raises a connection refused (in one way or another)

Patch Set 5:

I completely buy your point Mark. But, to simulate that scenario, we have to write mock code which fails to connect to the View Node. Otherwise we cannot get the node failure every time we test. Can you please suggest here ?

with 1.3 coming up and completely revamped ViewConnection, can you please abandon this? We'll see what we need on the new ones there.

Abandoned

Changes in the view layer have been done in cbc.
We don't need these tests now.
