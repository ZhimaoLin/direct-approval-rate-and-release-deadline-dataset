DESCRIPTION

JCBC-652: Support DesignDocument Options

Motivation
----------
The view engine currently supports 2 options which can be overridden
on a per desing-document basis: updateMinChanges and
replicaUpdateMinChanges. They need to be exposed on the DesignDocument
API so they can be set.

Modifications
-------------
The DesignDocument has been extended to optionally support setting
those two options and will send them as part of the HTTP request
if needed.

Result
------
The options can now be configured by the user when a design document
is created or modified.
