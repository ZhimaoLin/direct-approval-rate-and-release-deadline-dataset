DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1072: Add covenient authenticate overload.

Motivation
----------
Most of the time when user-based authentication is used one just
needs to supply a username and a password. Right now this is only
possible by doing:

 cluster.authenticate(new PasswordAuthenticator("user", "pw"));

This adds some friction to the user experience since the user
first needs to figure out what an authenticator is, which instance
one should be using and so forth.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds a simple overload which should suffice most
of the time and will allow the user just to authenticate with
a username and a password string like this:

 cluster.authenticate("user", "pw");

The old overload is still available for advanced use cases of
course.

Result
------
Much easier way to authenticate against a cluster with user
credentials.
