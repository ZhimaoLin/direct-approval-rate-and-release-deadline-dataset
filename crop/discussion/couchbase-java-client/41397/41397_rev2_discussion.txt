Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:52, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseCluster.java -> These fields cannot be final anymore because we are pushing them to our 'connect' initializer

Line:85, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseCluster.java -> I'm not sure I get correctly what you meant when you said constructor in the ticket.

Did you mean that constructing of the object should be separate from actually connecting it to the Couchbase Server?

If so, it means, that the connect() method below should become part of an API. Also current constructor goes with package visibility and users cannot use it directly. And we already have static create() with empty arguments list, which means "connect to localhost"
