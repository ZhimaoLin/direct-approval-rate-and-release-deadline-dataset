DESCRIPTION

JCBC-703: Optimize PersistTo.NONE && ReplicateTo.NONE

Motivation
----------
Currently when someone uses the mutation overloaded methods
with persistence constraints, even when both are set to NONE
the caller incurs some overhead since we call into Observe
at least one time (with flatMap). This can reduce performance
even when those calls are not needed.

Modifications
-------------
Short circuit incoming requests to just use the regular
mutation method and never call into the Observe loops.

Result
------
Better performance, especially in the case where someone uses
the overridden methods and then through some external flag/variable
sets it to NONE.
