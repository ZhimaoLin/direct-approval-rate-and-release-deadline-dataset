Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'll pull it into the IDE to check, but I do not believe we should be passing servers here.  I think it was left in from an earlier attempt at making the change.

Line:129, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> Why is servers here?  I think it needs to be removed, we're not using it but we're adding it to this public method.

Line:187, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> remove this comment, since it just tells us what the next line is.

Line:189, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> I think this error message needs to be a bit better.  Suggested:

"Critical reconfiguration error.  Client unexpectedly has received a configuration and has failed to create a node connection.  Node without connection is \"%s\"."

This error message gives the user much more about what's happening and what to tell us.
