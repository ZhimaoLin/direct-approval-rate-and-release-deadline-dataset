DESCRIPTION

JCBC-413: Fix race condition in ClusterManager.

Motivation
----------
When the ClusterManager response returns with a successful response, it could be that the code waiting
on the result is notified before the corresponding results are stored.

Modifications
-------------
The latch is now counted down after the results have been gathered, avoidin the race condition.

Result
------
The code afterwards waiting on the latch is now only counted down before the results have been gathered.
