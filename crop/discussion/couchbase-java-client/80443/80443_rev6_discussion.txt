DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1110: Add Experimental TransparentReplicaGetHelper

Motivation
----------
Users sometimes need assistance with transparently failing
over to a replica get when the primary get fails. This little
helper class provides utility methods to help with exactly that.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset introduces a helper class which first performs
a regular kv get and if that one fails it fails over to a
replica get and grabs the first result it gets back. This is
the most common situation users are using both commands together.

Result
------
Transparent get followed potentially by replica get is a common
use case and now covered by a simple helper class.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1

I found the method name slightly confusing. "Get first primary? How may primaries are there?"
