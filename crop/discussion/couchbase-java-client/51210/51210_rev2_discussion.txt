DESCRIPTION

JCBC-772: query(Statement) needs to check for a QueryPlan

Motivation
----------
the query(Statement) is intended as a shortcut, but also needs
to take into account that a QueryPlan might be passed in.

Modifications
-------------
The method now checks if the input statement is a query plan and
if so wraps it into a Query.prepared() instead of a Query.simple().

code like bucket.query(QueryPlan) is now possible.

Result
------
Easier way to query with a query plan.
