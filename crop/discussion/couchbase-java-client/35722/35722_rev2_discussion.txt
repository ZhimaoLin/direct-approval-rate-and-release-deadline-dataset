DESCRIPTION

Make sure CCCPAwarenessTest always has a bucket.

Motivation
----------
It could be the case that the CCCPAwarenessTest does not have a bucket
to use if used in the wrong order by JUnit for all tests.

Modifications
-------------
The fix makes sure that a default bucket is created, it also makes sure
that the test doesn't fail against more than one node incorrectly.

Result
------
The test is now more failure resilient to false positives.
