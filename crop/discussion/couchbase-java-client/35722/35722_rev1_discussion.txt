DESCRIPTION

Make sure CCCPAwarenessTest always has a bucket.

Motivation
----------
It could be the case that the CCCPAwarenessTest does not have a bucket
to use if used in the wrong order by JUnit for all tests.

Modifications
-------------
The fix makes sure that a default bucket is created, it also makes sure
that the test doesn't fail against more than one node incorrectly.

Result
------
The test is now more failure resilient to false positives.

Line:66, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CCCPAwarenessTest.java -> No longer used?

Line:77, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CCCPAwarenessTest.java -> This seems like a scary idea really...

Line:66, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CCCPAwarenessTest.java -> it's used down in the test.

Line:77, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CCCPAwarenessTest.java -> this beforeTest block is used all over the place in the tests, we just try to get it to a clean state.. its slow but it works :/
