DESCRIPTION

JCBC-633: Add Iterator to sync ViewResult

Motivation
----------
Adding an iterator to ViewResult allows for nice for() syntax, without
having to pull out the iterator manually.

Modifications
-------------
Adds the Iterator<ViewRow> interface to the ViewResult and implementation,
just proxying through to the rows() automatically.

Result
------
More streamlined use of ViewResult and rows when iterating sync.
