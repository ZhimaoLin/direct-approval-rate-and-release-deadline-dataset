DESCRIPTION

JCBC-790: Ignore partial replica read failures on ReplicaMode.ALL

Motivation
----------
The accompanying change in core-io now quickly fails if the replica
is not available. This change silents those errors, leading to
the fact that if the replica is not available, only a subset
(the responding) replicas is returned.

Modifications
-------------
chain in an empty observable if the individual operation fails.

Result
------
The calls will now return and finish quickly if an individual
replica is not available. Note that this has no impact on
a replica read where the node is down, but the configuration
still thinks its up (to make it fail quickly, the fail fast
retry strategy needs to be used).

I think it'd be better to only swallow ReplicaNotAvailableException
