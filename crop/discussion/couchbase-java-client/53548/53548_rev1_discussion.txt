DESCRIPTION

JCBC-814: Refactoring query-related code out of AsyncBucket

Motivation:
-----------
In CouchbaseAsyncBucket, the code relative to executing N1QL queries is
starting to take too much space, becoming more difficult to maintain.
Externalize all the actual implementation into a separate class.

Modifications:
--------------
Refactored private methods queryRaw and queryPrepared as well as actual
implementation for prepare into a separate class QueryExecutor.

Results
-------
Code for query execution is isolated and will be easier to find/maintain
