DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1132: Bucket cache ignores custom transcoders

Motivation
----------

When openBucket is called multiple times with the same bucket name,
a cached Bucket instance is returned even if the calls to
openBucket specify different lists of custom transcoders.

Consequently, openBucket may return a bucket that uses different
transcoders than the ones requested.

Modifications
-------------

When performing bucket cache lookups, use a composite key consisting
of the bucket name and list of transcoders.

Result
------

Bucket cache hits only occur when both the bucket name and
transcoders match the values of a cached bucket.

Custom transcoders are always honored when opening a bucket,
even if the user previously opened the bucket without specifying
custom transcoders.
