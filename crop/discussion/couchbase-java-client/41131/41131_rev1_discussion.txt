DESCRIPTION

WIP: JCBC-525: More Document and Transcoder Types.

This (massive) changeset adds documents and their respective transcoders to achieve
both full JSON compatibility and "common flags" compatibility.

	- Json* Documents are read backwards compat, but not on write.
	- Only the LegacyTranscoder us fully read/write backwards compat.

Todo:

	- Add tests and impl for:
		* SerializableDocument (private type)
		* LegacyDocument (none)
		* BinaryDocument (binary type)
		* StringDocument (string type)

	- add support for decompression on legacy decodes
	- add support for JsonValue.NULL for all Json types.
