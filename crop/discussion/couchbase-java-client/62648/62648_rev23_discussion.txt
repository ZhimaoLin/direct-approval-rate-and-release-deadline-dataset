DESCRIPTION

JCBC-933: FTS, RFC 10 compliant (fts iteration2)

Motivation:
-----------
FTS, or Full Text Search, is a new mean of querying Couchbase introduced
in 4.5.0 as a BETA feature. RFC10 aims at providing support of FTS in
the SDKs.

Modifications:
--------------
Added a SearchUtils class with ISO 822 to RFC 3339 date conversion.

Added the FTS query API under package
com.couchbase.client.java.fts.SearchParams and at the Bucket level.

Response parsing is still based on 4.5.0 state of FTS and is not using
a streaming parser, but rather converting the whole response JSON into
the SDK's objects.

Added AssertJ test dependency for more expressive tests.

Results:
--------
RFC 10 is implemented, allowing FTS queries to be made.
