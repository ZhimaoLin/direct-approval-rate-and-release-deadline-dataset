DESCRIPTION

JCBC-622: Add name and description to generated pom.

Motivation
----------
These two properties were previously added by hand, but need to be part
of the POM for maven central publishing.

Modifications
-------------
Added the name and description, similar to the core-io implementation.
Also, Simon and Sergey have been formally added as developers.

Result
------
No more manually adding those properties by hand.
