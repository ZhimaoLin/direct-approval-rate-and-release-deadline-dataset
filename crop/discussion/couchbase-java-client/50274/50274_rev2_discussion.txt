DESCRIPTION

JCBC-761: DSL for index creation

Motivation
----------
Up until now there was no DSL for index creation (primary nor secondary)
so this improvement is needed.

Modifications
-------------
Added full DSL for both primary and secondary index creation. Starting
point is in Index static methods.

Added Path and Element implementations for all possible clauses (Index,
On, Using, Where, With).

Added tests to validate the DSL.

Results
-------
Indexes can now be created via the DSL rather than raw simple queries.
