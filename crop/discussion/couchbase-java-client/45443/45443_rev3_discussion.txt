DESCRIPTION

JCBC-685: Offer escaped id Expression method

Motivation
----------
Some identifiers in N1QL need to be escaped by backticks, for example
when they contain a dash. We need a method to create such identifier
Expressions.

Modifications
-------------
Added method "i" on Expression to create such escaped identifiers. The
method can create a list of identifiers, which are then separated by a
comma and space, each of them then escaped using `.

Allowed From clause in DSL to accept an Expression as identifier via
FromPath.

Result
------
Using identifier like "beer-sample" is possible by escaping it using i.
Also, using such an Expression in From clause is now also possible.
