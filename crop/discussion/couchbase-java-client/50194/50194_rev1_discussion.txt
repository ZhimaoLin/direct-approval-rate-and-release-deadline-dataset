DESCRIPTION

WIP: add annotation processor for n1ql DSL

Aim is to generate more complete xxxFunctions classes with various
overloads generated at compile time rather than explicitely coded.

TODO:
 - make both IntelliJ and Gradle generate into same directory
  (/generated/src/main/java)
 - actual creation of the classe(s)
 - enrich the annotation to choose what kind of override to generate
