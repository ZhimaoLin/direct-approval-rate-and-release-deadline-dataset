DESCRIPTION

JCBC-704: Funnel all durability errors into a DurabilityException.

Motivation
----------
Currently the documentation states correctly that all durability errors which
violate the requirement are caught and raised in the DurabilityException.
This is currently only the case on one mutation method, all the others
need to follow suit.

Modifications
-------------
Properly catch and collect the errors on mutation and remove observe methods.

Also the BinaryTest has been renamed to KeyValueTest for clarity.

Result
------
Proper exception thrown as advertised in the docs.
