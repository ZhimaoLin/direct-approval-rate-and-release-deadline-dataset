DESCRIPTION

JCBC-910: additional view query option to get items in original order or not

Motivation
----------
View query result order is randomly mixed; But it should be consitent sometimes.

Modifications
-------------
Apply addtitional enum paremeter DocumentEmitMode:
- DocumentEmitMode.FLAT (default): same as former action.
- DocumentEmitMode.CONCAT: preserves order, but slower than flatMap
- DocumentEmitMode.CONCAT_EAGER: use concatMapEager newly introduced in rxjava 1.0.15, as fast as flatMap

Result
------
A user can choose view query result order consistency.
