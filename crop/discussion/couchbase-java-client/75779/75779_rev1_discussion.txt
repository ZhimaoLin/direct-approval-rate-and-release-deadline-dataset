DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1063: Never compress JSON in LegacyDocument.

Motivation
----------
In spymemcached, the code checks if the string is JSON
and if it is it skips compression so the server can
understand it properly.

Modifications
-------------
Up until now the LegacyTranscoder didn't check for this
fact and as a result did compress larger JSON docs which
would then not be readable by the server properly.

This changeset ports the (not bulletproof) JSON check from
spymemcached and adds a test case to make sure that JSON is
indeed not compressed even if larger than the compression
threshold.

Result
------
better compatibility with spymemcache and making sure that
larger JSON docs are not compressed.
