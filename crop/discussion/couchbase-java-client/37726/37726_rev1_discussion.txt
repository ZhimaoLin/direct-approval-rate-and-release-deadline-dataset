DESCRIPTION

JCBC-463: Harden shutdown procedure in CouchbaseClient

Motivation
----------
Lingering bucket streaming threads are reported, this could be the case
if something is preventing them from being shut down.

Modifications
-------------
Split up the spymemcached IO and view IO shutdown in two different
try/catch blocks, to make sure the other part always runs, even if
something goes wrong in the other.

Result
------
Shutting down of the config threads now also happens if an exception
is raised during memcached IO shutdown.
