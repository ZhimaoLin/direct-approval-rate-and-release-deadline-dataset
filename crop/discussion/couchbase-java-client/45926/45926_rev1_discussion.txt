DESCRIPTION

Add Builder overrides for proper chaining.

Motivation
----------
The returned builder needs to be the one from the client, otherwise
the core environment gets built and not the extended one from the
java client.

Modifications
-------------
Builder methods have been properly overriden, and also sanity warnings
have been put into place to tell the user when his max lifetime is
smaller than the max configured blocking timeouts.
