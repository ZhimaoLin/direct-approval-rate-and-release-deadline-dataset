DESCRIPTION

JCBC-457: Force CCCP config fetching on node reconnect.

Motivation
----------
If a node needs to be reconnected, there is a strong indication that
the socket has been closed and this could be because of a topology
change.

Modification
------------
If a reconnect is scheduled, make sure it forces a config update.
Also, the method is added for memcache buckets to keep the behavior consistent.

Result
------
Quicker detection of topology changes, eventually getting quicker to
a valid config state.
