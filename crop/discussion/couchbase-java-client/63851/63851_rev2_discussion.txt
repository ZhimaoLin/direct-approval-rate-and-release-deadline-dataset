DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-271: Remove queryEnabled from core builder overrides.

Motivation
----------
queryEnabled and queryPort have been deprecated for quite some time and are
now removed, since they are not needed anymore. This changeset removes the
builder overrides, since the other pieces have been removed in core-io.
