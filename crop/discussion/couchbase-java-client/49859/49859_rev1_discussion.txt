DESCRIPTION

JCBC-744: Add support xxx@xxx.xxx alias

Motivation
----------
It should be possible to have a different name in the JSON field
than the field name in the object.

Modifications
-------------
The user can now supply an xxx@xxx.xxx which will be
used as the JSON field key instead of the actual object field name.

Result
------
More flexible field mapping.
