DESCRIPTION

JCBC-750: let DSL cover n1ql tutorial steps upt to 25

Motivation
----------
in SelectDslSmokeTests, only part of the tutorial steps are covered and
some have evolved. Make sure that steps up to #25 are now covered and up
to date, making simple additions to the DSL if needed.

http://query.pub.couchbase.com/tutorial/#25

Modifications
-------------
SelectDslSmokeTests now tests tutorial steps up to step #25.
Some steps have been updated to reflect changes in DP4.

Functions have been extracted into separate helper classes, by category.
Sort now has an option not to explicitly state the order.

Choice has been made not to provide the DSL for the shortcut AS syntax
(omitting the AS like in "FROM tutorial t" vs "FROM tutorial AS t").

Results
-------
Smoke tests pass, including new tests for steps 15-25.
