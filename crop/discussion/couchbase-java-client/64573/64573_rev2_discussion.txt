DESCRIPTION

[chores] Ignore travel-sample FTS demo test

Motivation:
-----------
The SearchQueryTest integration test case should only require an FTS
index on the beer-sample dataset. Travel-sample based test can be
useful as a quick mean of running FTS queries on that sample bucket,
but should not be considered as part of the normal integration test.

Modifications:
--------------
Travel-sample based integration test has been Ignored, can be run
manually from the IDE.
