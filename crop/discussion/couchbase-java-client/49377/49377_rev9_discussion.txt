DESCRIPTION

JCBC-744: Implement Repository and very basic upsert/get.

Motivation
----------
Due to popular demand a repository with entity mapping (POJO)
capabilities will be provided in the 2.2.0 timeframe.

Modifications

place (a repsitory, accessible from the bucket) and allows
to upsert and get a very simple POJO (no nested objects,
no args constructor required).

Result
------
Starting off the repository implementation with simple
upsert/get capabilities.
