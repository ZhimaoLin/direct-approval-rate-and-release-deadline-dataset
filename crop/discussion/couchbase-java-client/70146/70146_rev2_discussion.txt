DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1021: Print raw data if document decoding failed.

Motivation
----------
To better debug flag and decoding related issues it makes sense to
warn-log all known details at the point of decoding.

Modifications
-------------
Adds a WARN log to the decoding section of the abstract transcoder
which logs and dumps all known information for that specific document
at the time of failure.

Result
------
More insight into why a document failed to decode properly.
