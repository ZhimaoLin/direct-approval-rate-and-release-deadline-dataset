Line:414, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I feel like error checking here and returning something sane in the case of a bad value would be better. My concern here is that people not running with assertions on won't get this benefit. Plus I don't like the idea of crashing the program/thread if an error we can easily recover from.

Line:414, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> It's possible to recover from an assertion just like any other exception in Java.  

I agree with you though, so I've filed JCBC-100 to improve error handling-- should get to that before Beta.
