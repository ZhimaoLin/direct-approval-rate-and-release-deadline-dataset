DESCRIPTION

JCBC-477: Pass down the timeout to the getBulk for views

Motivation
----------
If no timeout is passed down to the BulkGetFuture, Long.MAX_VALUE
is used as a timeout which, if something goes wrong, basically
translates to block the thread forever. Also, this breaks the
contract since a custom time can always be passed in.

Modifications
-------------
The timeout is now passed down to the bulk get so that a timeout
is properly respected.

Result
------
Correct behavior from the client side.

Might it be better to do something to avoid this situation in the future?  Or is this testable?

we'd need to change spy semantics I think, which I guess we should avoid for now. I push this through as is for now.
