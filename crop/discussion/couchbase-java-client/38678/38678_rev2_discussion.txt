DESCRIPTION

JCBC-477: Pass down the timeout to the getBulk for views

Motivation
----------
If no timeout is passed down to the BulkGetFuture, Long.MAX_VALUE
is used as a timeout which, if something goes wrong, basically
translates to block the thread forever. Also, this breaks the
contract since a custom time can always be passed in.

Modifications
-------------
The timeout is now passed down to the bulk get so that a timeout
is properly respected.

Result
------
Correct behavior from the client side.

Patch Set 2:

normally this will never be an issue since view timeout is high and bulks are quick, but with laaaarge view results and shorter view timeouts it could be an issue
