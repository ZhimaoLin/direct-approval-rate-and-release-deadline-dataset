DESCRIPTION

JCBC-686: Make QueryResult iterable.

Motivation
----------
If the blocking query API is used, adding the Iterable interface provides
some nice syntactic sugar to iterate over rows with a for loop.

Modifications
-------------
Make the QueryResult implement the Iterable for the QueryRows and return
the iterator right away.

Result
------
Its now easier to just loop over the rows in the blocking api.
