DESCRIPTION

JCBC-1106: Add additional N1QL Params.

Motivation
----------
The server from time to time adds new query options which help
customizing behavior or optimize for certain scenarios. While
the Java SDK provides the possibility to add all kinds of custom
query params, exposing the common ones as first-class builder
methods is desired to steer the user in the right direction
and to also enforce some kind of typesafety.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the following four query params:

 - readonly
 - pipeline_batch
 - pipeline_cap
 - scan_cap

The first one can be used to tighten security-concious apps and
the other three can be used to fine-tune query performance.

Result
------
Easier accessible query options following the addition of those
params from the server side. As a caveat, they might not be
available against all server versions though.
