DESCRIPTION

JCBC-904: Override socketConnectTimeout in builder

Motivation:
-----------
DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment's Builder doesn't override its parent's
socketConnectTimeout method, breaking the capability of fluently
building the environment as soon as it is used.

Modifications:
--------------
Added socketConnectTimeout override in the CouchbaseEnvironment Builder.

Result:
-------
CouchbaseEnvironment can be fluently built even when using the socket
timeout.
