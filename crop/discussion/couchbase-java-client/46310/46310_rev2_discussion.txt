DESCRIPTION

JCBC-701: Error with DocumentDoesNotExistException on remove

Motivation
----------
Currently the catch-all CouchbaseException is thrown, which does
not provide the proper semantics needed.

Modifications
-------------
Throwing the proper exception makes it possible for the user to
apply fine grained control and retry logic as needed, so this
change adds a test to verify.

Result
------
Correct exception thrown on remove when the document is not found.
