DESCRIPTION

Remember non-note tree entries when reading

In order to safely edit a notes tree, NoteMap needs to retain any
non-note tree entries it read from the source tree and put them
back out into the modified tree when it commits a new version of
the note branch.

Remember any tree entries that didn't look like a note during
the parsing of the tree, so they can be put into a TreeFormatter
later when the tree writes to the repository.
