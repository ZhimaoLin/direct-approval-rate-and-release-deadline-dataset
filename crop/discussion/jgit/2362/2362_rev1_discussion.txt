DESCRIPTION

Optimize PackWriter's use of ObjectListIterator

Its pointless to lookup each object in the ObjectWalk's internal
revision pool, allocate a RevObject, and then turn around and just
redo a lookup for object in the PackWriter's objectsMap.  Combine
all of this work into a single step.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I already regret the predecessor patch that created ObjectListIterator.

I have an even better strategy in mind.  I'll probably post a revert to back out ObjectListIterator and propose a different implementation.  But my new idea is too simple so I think I'll try it first in C Git and see what the C Git contributors have to say there.
