DESCRIPTION

blame: Automatically increase commit abbreviation length

Ensure commit object names are unique by extending the default
abbreviation as long as necessary. This allows `jgit blame` to
more closely match the formatted output of `git blame` on large
histories like Gerrit Code Review's ReceiveCommits.java file.

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Blame.java -> Are you concerned that this is running once per line rather than once per unique commit?

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Blame.java -> Eh, yea, sort of. What if I remember the last commit and don't repeat this per line within a span of a commit? If the commit has more than one region it would compute again, but wouldn't compute for consecutive lines on the same commit.

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Blame.java -> Is it so bad to keep a HashSet of commits and run it once per commit after this loop? You're already looping through the whole file multiple times...
