Patch Set 12:

I made the requested changes to use TreeWalk and a TreeIterator. The SimpleIgnoreCache implementation now uses a TreeWalk to populate nodes for the cache. Checks the timestamp on the .gitignore to avoid unnecessary updates. Code coverage hasn't changed, but there are still more test cases to add to cover more cases (e.g. bad times to delete a .gitignore file).

I have a Windows XP box set up for EGit now and will try to get the tests fixed for Windows tonight, I need to fix a number of clumsy String manipulation attempts for compatibility with Windows path strings.
