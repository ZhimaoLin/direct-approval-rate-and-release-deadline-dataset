DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with gitignore specifications

I tried to meet the requirements. Let me know if there's
anything that needs changing :)

Please see my talk page for some documentation of the covered
cases (documentation is not comprehensive right now)

Todo:
- Implement more intelligent node parsing.
- Better cache than just a HashMap. Suggestion was to move
  this into RepositoryMapping in EGit.
- The rule for matching e.g. "/src/ne?" to "/src/new/file.c"
  is slow.
