DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with gitignore specifications

Updated to initialize with TreeWalk and FileTreeIterator. Uses
timestamps on .gitignore to avoid reinitializing unchanged files.
Used URI to avoid some path issues with Windows strings. Will
work on other optimizations to avoid messy String manipulation.
Currently nodes are parsed as needed so there's an extra
call to file.exists(), this could be avoided by swallowing
the IOException.

Will perform more tests on Windows to ensure everything runs
and look into Windows-specific test cases

Patch Set 14: (3 inline comments)

Good and important work!

You should change the commit message. It should describe the whole change. Comments meant for review should go into the gerrit comments. Otherwise it is difficult for a new reviewer to understand the whole change.
I would find it useful to have the description of compatibility tests here (as in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303925#c5).

Do you plan to add core.excludesfile? Regarding that I would however suggest to do that in a subsequent commit.

Please have a look at my inline comments.

Line:14, org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The version umber should be added.

Line:37, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We should stick to the pattern to use Import-Package here:
org.eclipse.jgit.ignore;version="[0.9.0,0.10.0)",

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreCacheTest.java -> To really create a Repo you should call repo.create(). Otherwise the repository does not really exist and I assume that this will sooner or later lead to problems.

I would to use LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase as a base class and then copy the test files to this new location. This ensures that each tearDown method does remove the repository.
