DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with gitignore specifications

This patch adds ignore compatibility to jgit. It encompasses
exclude files as well as .gitignore. Uses TreeWalk and
FileTreeIterator to find nodes and parses .gitignore
files when required. The patch includes a simple cache that
can be used to save results and avoid excessive gitignore
parsing.
