DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with gitignore specifications

Updated to initialize with TreeWalk and FileTreeIterator. Uses
timestamps on .gitignore to avoid reinitializing unchanged files.
Used URI to avoid some path issues with Windows strings. Will
work on other optimizations to avoid messy String manipulation.
Currently nodes are parsed as needed so there's an extra
call to file.exists(), this could be avoided by swallowing
the IOException.

Will perform more tests on Windows to ensure everything runs
and look into Windows-specific test cases
