DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with gitignore specifications

I tried to meet the requirements. Let me know if there's
anything that needs changing :)

Please see my talk page for some documentation of the covered
cases (documentation is not comprehensive right now)

Todo:
- Implement more intelligent node parsing.
- Better cache than just a HashMap. Suggestion was to move
  this into RepositoryMapping in EGit.
- The rule for matching e.g. "/src/ne?" to "/src/new/file.c"
  is slow.

Patch Set 4:

(Sorry for the triple commit) 

I've extended the test coverage as required.

If the tests are failing, it is probably because they are unable to create a .git/info/exclude file. I used a hack to generate the file on the fly because I can't commit excludeTest/.git/info/exclude to the repository. It's also useful for other testing. 

The current patch should correctly delete any extra files/folders created for testing purposes.

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to change :)
