DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with gitignore specifications

I tried to meet the requirements. Let me know if there's
anything that needs changing :)

Please see my talk page for some documentation of the covered
cases (documentation is not comprehensive right now)

http://wiki.eclipse.org/User_talk:Charley.wang.gmail.com

Todo:
- Implement more intelligent node parsing.
- Better cache than just a HashMap. Suggestion was to move
  this into RepositoryMapping in EGit.
- The rule for matching e.g. "/src/ne?" to "/src/new/file.c"
  is slow.

Patch Set 5: No score

I admit I did not even try to merge this code to my own repository.

Line:13, org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Should add a version identifier.

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNode.java -> Close the reader when you're done with it.

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Probably should use the same version numbers as the other packages.

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreCacheTest.java -> This stack trace, and all the other ones like it in this file, will never get printed because the fail(String) method itself will cause an exception to be thrown.

Personally, I tend to just declare exceptions in the test method though I don't know what's the JGit convention here.
