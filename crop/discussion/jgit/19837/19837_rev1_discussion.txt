why do you want to update to an older version of buck ? a0cea525aac6c69f9b3c00626ee5fef48b80326d is currently the tip of master

Yes, i've seen later, that you've updated to the latest upstream version of Buck in a new ps of dependent change.

I just picked up the version that is used by Gerrit project. Given that some developers are working on both projects, having different Buck versions in JGit and in Gerrit is going to be a pain. So may be we can update Buck version in Gerrit instead and abandon this change?
