DESCRIPTION

Parse RevCommit bodies before calling RevFilter.include()

RevFilter.include()'s documentation promises the RevCommit's
body is parsed before include is invoked.  This wasn't always
true if the commit was parsed once, had its body discarded,
the RevWalk was reset() and started a new traversal.
