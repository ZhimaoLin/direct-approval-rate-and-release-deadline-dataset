DESCRIPTION

A new index may require smudged entries

That happens when the index and a new file is created within the same
second and becomes a problem if we then modify the newly created file
within the same second after adding it to the index. Without smuding
JGit will, on later reads thing the file is unchanged.

Line:589, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> You also need to use the old snapshot from when we read the index.

git-core doesn't pre-smudge entries during the index write, it does the smudge during future index reads so we need to smudge here if the entry we are about to write is dirty clean relative to the old index timestamp.

Line:589, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Should I use the old snapshot if available and, the new one if not?

Line:589, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Maybe we should do like C Git, and smudge on read instead of here. At least tracking down strange behaviour would be simpler.

Line:589, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Done.
Can we perhaps skip smuding on write completely instead?
