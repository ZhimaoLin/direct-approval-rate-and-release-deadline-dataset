DESCRIPTION

Smudge index entries on first write (too), as well when reading

That happens when the index and a new file is created within the same
second and becomes a problem if we then modify the newly created file
within the same second after adding it to the index. Without smuding
JGit will, on later reads, think the file is unchanged.

The accompanying test passed with the smuding on read.

Line:408, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Could the second and nanosecond computation logic be moved into either a method in this class or a method in the FileSnapshot class? Since it is not used in multiple locations.

Line:408, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> I would need more code to reuse those three operators than the code being re-used.  Actually the pattern is used in three locations (IO included).

Line:408, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Just to clarify, I meant "now" instead of "not" in my initial comment.
