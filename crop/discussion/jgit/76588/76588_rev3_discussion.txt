DESCRIPTION

Move AtomicObjectOutputStream to lfs/internal

The class AtomicObjectOutputStream should be available to all lfs related
classes, not only to the server side. Move the class from
org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.fs to org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.internal to achieve
that.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/FileLfsRepository.java -> I still get in eclipse the warning: 

Discouraged access: The type 'AtomicObjectOutputStream' is not API (restriction on required project 'org.eclipse.jgit.lfs')
