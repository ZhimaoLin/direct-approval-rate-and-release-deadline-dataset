Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Mostly nits. I think the implementation is done. I would suggest switching the ObjectDirectory to use a FileSnapshot (see comments).

Line:1321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Don't you mean shallowCommitsAlreadyInitialized?

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> cuddle catch with the closing curly on the prior line

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> Trailing space was added here.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> Trailing space was added here.

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This is a much simpler way to inject the logic. Thanks for finding it.

Line:623, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> This is accessed somewhat often, and unlike alternates it can change between calls. I wonder if there is a noticeable performance difference between reading the file every time and using the snapshot code. I suspect there is, especially on Windows or if the repository is on NFS.

We use snapshots in the reference handling to avoid reading loose reference files that haven't updated since they were last read. It probably would be a good idea to use that here too.

Line:629, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Use the open(File) helper method that is declared in this class.

Line:856, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> The alternate shouldn't have this repository's shallow file. Define the alternate to have a shallow file of null and handle this case in getShallowCommits() where shallowFile == null means use the empty set.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FooterLineTest.java -> Do not import *

Line:371, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FooterLineTest.java -> Cuddle catch with the closing curly on the prior line

Line:372, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FooterLineTest.java -> In a test just declare the test to throw IOException if the exception is not expected from a passing test.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Wrap this onto the next line.

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkShallowTest.java -> PrintWriter is terrible at errorhandling, avoid at any cost. Use JGItTestUtil.write for writing simple files.
