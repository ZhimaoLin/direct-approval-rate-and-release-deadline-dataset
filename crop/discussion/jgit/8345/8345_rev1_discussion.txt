how to test this ?

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> I think "shallow" should be a constant in org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Constants

Line:217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> Don't we always want to enable shallow support on a RevWalk or ObjectWalk in a shallow repository?

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> Directory can be null. And I think a RevWalk can be built from an ObjectReader and doesn't have access to a Repository.
