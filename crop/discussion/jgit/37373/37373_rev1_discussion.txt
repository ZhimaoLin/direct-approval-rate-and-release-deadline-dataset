DESCRIPTION

Make jgit.sh work on windows when JGIT_CLASSPATH is set

jgit.sh was concatenating classpath entries with ":". On Windows systems
using "Git for Windows" this caused problems when JGIT_CLASSPATH was set.

Find out whether we are running on a platform which name starts with
"MINGW" ("Git for Windows" sets this) and use ";" as classpath
separator in this case.
