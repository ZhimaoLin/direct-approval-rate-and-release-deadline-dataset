DESCRIPTION

Add gitignore support to IndexDiff and use TreeWalk

IndexDiff was re-implemented and now uses TreeWalk instead
of GitIndex. Additionally, gitignore support and retrieval of 
untracked files was added.
This commit is a prerequisite for adding gitignore support to
the EGit Commit Dialog.
