Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmapWalker.java -> This is now a public class so it needs to have xxx@xxx.xxx in the javadoc.

Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmapWalker.java -> I'm not sure if these static classes also need their own xxx@xxx.xxx or if they inherit it from the superclass.
