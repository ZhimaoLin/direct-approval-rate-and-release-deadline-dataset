Line:216, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmapWalker.java -> I think these should be kept internal (i.e. not added to the stable API). Could they be new toplevel classes e.g. in org.eclipse.jgit.internal.revwalk or .storage?

Line:216, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmapWalker.java -> Another possibility is to keep them public, but as toplevel classes in org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.filter.
