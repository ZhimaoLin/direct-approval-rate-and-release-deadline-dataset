DESCRIPTION

Make PackWriterBitmapWalker public

Make PackWriterBitmapWriter class public and move it to a more central
location, in preparation for its use by another class (in a subsequent
commit).

One of its inner static classes, AddUnseenToBitmapFilter, previously
package-private, is also used directly in its former package. Therefore,
AddUnseenToBitmapFilter and its sibling class have been moved to an
internal package instead.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmapWalker.java -> optional: can avoid repetition by doing /** @return. (That's against Google style, but JGit seems to do it occasionally since they require xxx@xxx.xxx tag.)
