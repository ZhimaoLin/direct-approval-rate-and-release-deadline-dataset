Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/LfsServerTest.java -> Changing this per the comments in PS4 causes the tests to fail, although the expected and actual content of the exception message looks the same in the console output.  I suspect something related to UTF-8 encoding, but couldn't find a solution.

Can we merge this as-is and fix later, or rebase it above the getLargeFileRepository changes so at least that one can go in?

Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/LfsServerTest.java -> Using ByteBuffer is not as intuitive as it seemed. The problem is that using the ByteBuffer.array() method returns the whole array and not only the bytes we wrote into it. I debugged the PS5 and found out that the tests are failing because of a different string length.

We should make use of the position(), limit(), etc.. methods of the ByteArray in order to get only the bytes we wrote into. I didn't have time to provide a fix.

Yes, we can merge this as-is and then later find a solution with ByteBuffer.
