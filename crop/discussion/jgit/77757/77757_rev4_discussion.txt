Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/LfsServerTest.java -> This could all be replaced by something like:

  ByteBuffer buf = IO.readWholeStream(bis, 1024);

Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/LfsServerTest.java -> This decodes the byte array using platform default character set which could cause unexpected failures on some platforms. Can we provide a fixed character set for decoding?

The change in the tests causes them to fail, but I can't see why.  The expected and actual output seem to be the same.

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/LfsServerTest.java -> I did it in PS5 but it wasn't working and I couldn't figure out why, so undid it in PS6, and forgot to add a comment.
