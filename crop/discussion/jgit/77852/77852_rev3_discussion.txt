Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/LfsProtocolServlet.java -> Don't we want to return here a LargeFileRepository in order to support multiple LFS backends. Since we already have a getLargeFileRepository method (line 87) I propose to change its signature into:

  protected abstract LargeFileRepository getLargeFileRepository(LfsRequest request, String path);

and pass the two parameters at the calling place (line 131). Line 132 already handles returned null value properly.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/LfsProtocolServlet.java -> Is it OK to change the API?

Should we better add a new method and deprecate the existing one?

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/LfsProtocolServlet.java -> I am not really sure how to proceed. Matthias would be the right person to answer these question but he is on vacation these days.

On the other hand we are likely the only users of this API.
I am in favor of changing the existing method :-)

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/LfsProtocolServlet.java -> Having getLargeFileRepository accepting two parameters and returning repo or not apart from changing existing method signature would solve the problem ;) from the other hand not changing getLargeFileRepository signature would make implementation troublesome... +1 to Sasa ;)
