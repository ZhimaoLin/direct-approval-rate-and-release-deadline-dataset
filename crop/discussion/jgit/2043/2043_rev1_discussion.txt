Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

By implication, this one is not approved. If it was ok, the test should be in the same commit as the changed code.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Dropping this change, since its ancestor (which it should have been squashed into anyway) was also dropped.
