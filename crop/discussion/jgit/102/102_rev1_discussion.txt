DESCRIPTION

Switch pgm, test to proper plugin projects

This way we depend upon the MANIFEST.MF to define our classpath
and our build will act more like any other OSGI bundle build.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score

Is it by intention that you declare more package dependencies than currently needed ?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

No, that over-inclusion of imports was a copy-and-paste error.  I meant to only import what was required.  Thanks for catching it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Eclipse claims that the pgm plugin currently does not depend on the following packages in the current import-package list :

- com.jcraft.jsch
- org.eclipse.jgit.diff
- org.eclipse.jgit.fnmatch
- org.eclipse.jgit.merge
- org.eclipse.jgit.patch
- org.eclipse.jgit.util
- org.eclipse.jgit.util.io

Is it by intention that you already declare dependencies on these packages or should we better wait until we need them ?
