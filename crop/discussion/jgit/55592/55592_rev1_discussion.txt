DESCRIPTION

Deprecate FileUtil and move the code to FileUtils

As discussed on https://git.eclipse.org/r/53836 it does not make sense
to have two similar utility classes in same package with intersecting
functionality. To not break the API, all methods from FileUtil are
copied to FileUtils, all FileUtil API is made deprecated and redirecting
now to FileUtils.

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtil.java -> maybe we should better only deprecate the methods which are available in NIO API since Java 7 and not move the wrapper methods (which were needed to allow optional use of NIO on Java 7 when we still supported Java 5 and 6) to FileUtils, this would guide applications using JGit to directly use NIO

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> no, remove this since tag on the class, it exists since long time

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtil.java -> The purpose of this deprecation is to *remove* second "FileUtil" class entirely in the next major release, independently of the code to avoid confusion and simplify search for the right API to use for contributors.

If I get your point right, we should deprecate not only this class, but all "wrapper" methods which do not add any value on the current Java 7 - enabled platform. 

So I've made the moved methods now package private (no API) and we can do whatever we want later with those methods (right now they are still used in various FS classes).

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Oops, was automatically added by Eclipse refactor wizard. Will remove.
