DESCRIPTION

Fix ObjectChecker when normalization is enabled

When safeForMacOS is enabled the checker verifies a name does not
match against another name in the same tree after normalization to
NFC. The check was incorrect and failed when the first name was put
in, rejecting simple trees containing only one file like "F".

Add a test for this simple tree to verify it is accepted.
Fix the test for NFC normalization to actually normalize
and have a collision.
