Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Does this have a use outside of tests (does ObjectInserter.Filter have a use outside of tests)?  Just thinking it would be nice to segregate test code from production code.

This currently (at the end of this series) has no usage outside of ObjectInserter.Filter. However ObjectInserter.Filter is definitely used outside of tests, e.g. search in the Gerrit codebase.

So you may reasonably object that ObjectInserter.Filter has no tests, but it is definitely production code.

Ok, I found cases of where ObjectInserter.Filter is used, and have now read the whole patch set. Looks good.
