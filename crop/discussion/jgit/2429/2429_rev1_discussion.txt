DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Tag non-commits SATISIFIED earlier

This gets non-commits out of the wantSatisfied() main loop by making
use of the cached SATISIFIED flag and its existing bypass.  Anything
that isn't a commit cannot be discovered by the have negotiation, so
its always assumed to be SATISIFIED by the server.
