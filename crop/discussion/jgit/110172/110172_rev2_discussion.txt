DESCRIPTION

basic submodule merge handling

Fixes (sort-of)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494551

This doesn't handle the really hard thing, which is merging spurious
conflicts inside .gitmodules files.  That's OK: git.git doesn't
either.  Users can resolve the conflict themselves and then commit
the merge.

This does prevent crashes and leave the correct state for both
non-conflicting merges which add submodules, and submodule add/add
(and presumably add/edit) merges which do so.
