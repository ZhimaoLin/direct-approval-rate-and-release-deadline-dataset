DESCRIPTION

Basic submodule merge handling

This doesn't handle the really hard thing, which is merging spurious
conflicts inside .gitmodules files.  That's OK: git.git doesn't
either.  Users can resolve the conflict themselves and then commit
the merge.

Previously, jgit would crash when attempting to merge conflicting
submodule changes.  Even if there was no conflict, after a merge which
adds submodules, the repository would have been missing empty
directories for newly-added submodules.

This patch fixes the crash, and adds the empty directories whre
necessary. It ensures that the index is in a conflicted state when
submodule changes conflict.
