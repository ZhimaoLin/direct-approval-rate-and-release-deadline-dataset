DESCRIPTION

Fix FileSnapShot

We cannot use SystemReader to get the time, unless we do that consistently,
which is harder to do and be sure we are really testing what we want.

Then we need to update our lastRead variable whenever we conclude that
our file is not racily clean according to lastRead. It may well be clean,
but we do not know that until we check the system clock again.

Finally add a test for this class.

Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> A comment on a change accepted 6 years ago!

I think this is a bug. Imagine you have a FileSnapshot on file f. lastmodified and lastread are both t0. Now time is t1 and you 
1) modify the file
2) Update the FileSnapshot of the file (lastModified=t1, lastRead=t1)
3) modify the file again
4) wait 3 seconds
5) Ask the Filesnapshot whether the file is dirty or not. It will answer it's clean because of these lines

Without these lines Filesnapshot will report that the file is dirty unless it has been re-read at a point in time after t1. Only when we have read the file once after t1 we know it has not been modified during t1 multiple times.

I would like to remove this lines. Objections?

This bug causes gerrit to sometimes miss newly created packfiles created by a external process doing native git gc.

See my test and fix here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/86738
