DESCRIPTION

Make BitmapIndexImpl.CompressedBitmap, CompressedBitmapBuilder static

A CompressedBitmap represents a pair (EWAH bit vector, PackIndex
assigning bit positions to git objects).  The bit vector is a member
field and the PackIndex is implicit via the 'this' reference to the
outer class.

Make this clearer by making CompressedBitmap a static class and
replacing the 'this' reference an explicit field.

Likewise for CompressedBitmapBuilder.
