Line:148, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Bug in Eclipse.

The formatter insists on putting a space at the end of a blank Javadoc line.  The formatter runs after the remove trailing space on a blank line during save.

You can coax it into removing that space by deleting it manually, saving the file, then doing undo right away.  Yes, its crap.  But I don't have the time or the energy to debug this part of Eclipse and patch it.

Line:182, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Doesn't AndTreeFilter take a List also?  If so can't we make a temporary list here and put the three default items in, then the one conditional user filter?

If the user filter is a path filter (and it probably is) its faster if its first in the list.  Paths are very cheap to evaluate and they rule out most of the project's files.
