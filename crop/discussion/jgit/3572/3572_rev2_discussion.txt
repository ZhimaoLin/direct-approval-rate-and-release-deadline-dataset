DESCRIPTION

RFC: Use a repository specific path encoding

Introduces a setting which can be set per repository or globally. Default
is still UTF-8 (Composed Normal Form) on all platforms.

This touches quite a lot of places and I changes direction on the
way.

Should I add DirCacheOptions and TreeOptions and try to extend the
use. A pronlem I found was that I did not find a good source, i.e.
config, everywhere.

AFAIK: This patch "works", but so far only with manual testing with
one repo committed using Msys git (ISO-88591-1) and one with EGit.

Two repositories committed on Windows are included as zips. The EGit repo can
be used as-is on most *nix-like systems today, assuming UTF-8 encoding. Mac
non-ascii and C git presents a special problem since it recodes file names,
but lets ignore that for now. C Git isn't even compatible with itself on Macs.

The Msys repo will not be usable with EGit without this patch. It will work on
*nix systems with C Git (again excluding Macs).
