DESCRIPTION

Raise error if FileNotFoundException is caught for an existing file

File, FileInputStream and friends may throw FileNotFoundException even
if the file is existing e.g. when file permissions don't allow to access
the file content. In most cases this is a severe error we should not
suppress hence rethrow the FileNotFoundException in this case.

This may also fix bug 451508.
