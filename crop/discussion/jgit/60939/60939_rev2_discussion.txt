DESCRIPTION

Raise error if FileNotFoundException is caught for an existing file

File, FileInputStream and friends may throw FileNotFoundException even
if the file is existing e.g. when file permissions don't allow to access
the file content. In most cases this is a severe error we should not
suppress hence rethrow the FileNotFoundException in this case.

This may also fix bug 451508.

Patch Set 2:

This is just fixing the case where FileNotFoundException was caught and we can access the file which we tried to access in a simple way, there are more tricky cases where the file is opened in a different method than the places where the exception is caught, these cases will need larger modifications in there own individual changes.

In some cases jgit itself throws FileNotFoundException, in the cases I found we don't need to guard against non-accessibility since they are based on other considerations leading to the assumption the file doesn't exist.
