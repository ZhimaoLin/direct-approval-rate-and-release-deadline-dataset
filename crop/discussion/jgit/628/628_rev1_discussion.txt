DESCRIPTION

Repository can be configured with FS

On Windows, FS_Win32_Cygwin has been used if a Cygwin Git installation
is present in the PATH. Assuming that the user works with the Cygwin
Git installation may result in unnecessary overhead if he actually
does not.

Applications built on top of jgit may have more knowledge on the
actually used Git client (Cygwin or not) and hence should be able to
configure which FS to use accordingly.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score

I guess you wanted to upload this to Change	Ifc4278078b298781d55cf5421e9647a21fa5db24 as a new patchset.

In order to do so amend this change and add the following change footer in the last paragraph of the commit message:

Change-Id: Ifc4278078b298781d55cf5421e9647a21fa5db24

and push it again to gerrit, this should then end up as new patchset on your previous change. Then abandon this one.
