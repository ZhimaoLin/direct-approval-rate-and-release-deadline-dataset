Patch Set 1:

The idea behind the api package was to create interface to jgit which is very similar to what people know from native git. A developer who knows about native git's "git checkout --orphan " command should not search long in our api package to find the functionality. That "git checkout --orphan ..." functionality can be found in a "CreateOrphanBranchCommand" class seems odd to me. Why don't you put the feature in the "CheckoutCommand" command class?
