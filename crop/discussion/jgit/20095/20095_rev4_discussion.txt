Oh no, it's not rejected (not from my side). In the last days I was looking at it but couldn't find enough time for the final review and tests.

In general this looks much better now. You went down from 260 lines of code to 60 lines to achieve the same result (I don't count tests here).

There is only one unrelated change which you should revert and one optional suggestion for more validation of the parameters.

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> unrelated change. Please leave this lines untouched.

Line:493, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Optional: Took quite some time to understand this check. Shouldn't we check that we don't specify orphan AND pathes. That should not be allowed.

I was relieved.

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Done

Line:493, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> is this too complex? should i remove this?
