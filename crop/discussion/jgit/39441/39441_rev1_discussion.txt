DESCRIPTION

Update atomic constant

The atomic feature is now cooking in -next in git-core. Very rarely
features are ejected from the the next branch in git-core, so I consider
it reasonable to come up with this patch now to make the 2 implementations
interoperable.

The test suite passed here locally. I am not sure why Hudson is upset at me.

Patch Set 1:

the build failure was a temporary problem

This change makes the API tools raise an API breakage warning since the value of the public constant CAPABILITY_ATOMIC changed compared to 3.6. I understood from the commit message that this feature didn't yet fully pass review in git-core so I guess we can safely suppress the API warning without breaking anyone using what we released in 3.6. I pushed a patch for this here https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/39496/. Correct me there if I got this wrong.
