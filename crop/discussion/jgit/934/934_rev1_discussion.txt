DESCRIPTION

Use CoreConfig, UserConfig and TransferConfig directly

Rather than relying on the helpers in RepositoryConfig to get
these objects, obtain them directly through the Config API.
Its only slightly more verbose, but permits us to work with the
base Config class, which is more flexible than the highly file
specific RepositoryConfig.

This is what I really meant to do when I added the section parser
and caching support to Config, we just failed to finish updating
all of the call sites.
