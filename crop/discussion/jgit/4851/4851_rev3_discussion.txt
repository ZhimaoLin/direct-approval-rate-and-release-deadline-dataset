Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful; IP review completed

this didn't work only when setting the commit -o option, i.e. commit using commit dialog which is using this option failed whereas committing using the staging view succeeded.

- added a test
- improved commit message

Line:388, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> yeah, see line 335:

 // check if entry refers to a tracked file
 boolean tracked = dcTree != null || hTree != null;
 if (!tracked)
       break;

-> if hTree == null && dcTree == null this is untracked and we break out of the loop. 

In order to make this clear here without reevaluating that dcTree isn't null if hTree is null we could add a comment:

 if (emptyCommit
    && ( (hTree == null /* && dcTree != null (see tracked check above) */ ) 
     || !hTree.idEqual(fTree) 
     || hTree.getEntryRawMode() != fTree.getEntryRawMode()))

Line:388, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> now I got it. I overlooked this exit of the loop. We can leave it as it is - the comment is not required.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:388, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> doesn't 
  "htree == null ||"
mean that if htree is null (e.g. because we are in a new repo and trying to do the first commit on master) we will always believe that we are processing a non-empty commit? What is if htree is null and nothing has been added to the index. Then I would expect emptyCommit to be true.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:281, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitAndLogCommandTests.java -> you can replace these 5 lines by "writeTrashFile("a.txt", "content1")"
