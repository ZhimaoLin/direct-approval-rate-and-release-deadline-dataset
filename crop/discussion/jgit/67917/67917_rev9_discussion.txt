The missing tests are for a functionality which you don't invent here. So I uploaded a seperate change for that. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69841

+1 from me for this change. I have to talk with Matthias tommorror whether this will go into 4.3 our 4.4. We will have to adapt our since tags in case of 4.4.
