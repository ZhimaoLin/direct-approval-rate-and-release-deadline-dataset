Line:932, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> missing braces, more below

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> line is too wide

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> I'd rather explain explicitly what this strategy means

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> style nit: missing braces

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigConstants.java -> why does the value contain "Force" but not the key and javadoc ?
Is this configuration option also supported by native git ?
only found it in the API documentation https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/api-directory-listing.html

Line:734, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/AbstractTreeIterator.java -> Return whether or not ...

Line:737, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/AbstractTreeIterator.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx 4.3 tag for new API

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeOptions.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx 4.3 tag for new API

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> these lines seem too wide, import tools/eclipse-JGit-Format.xml to configure formatter

Line:1051, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> you can use writeTrashFile to shorten this:

 File readme3 = writeTrashFile("nested-repo", "README3.md", "content");

Line:1134, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> use writeTrashFile() to shorten this

Line:1140, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> same here

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigConstants.java -> Whoops, sorry about that. There was a previous change with a partial implementation of this feature, but I misunderstood one of the comments, which is why I made the key "dirForceNoGitLinks". It should just be "dirNoGitLinks", I'll go ahead and change that.

From what I can tell this isn't a configuration option in native git, and is only  present in the directory listing API. I believe this was deemed the best place to put the option in the previous change that partially implemented this feature, but it may be good to move it somewhere else.
