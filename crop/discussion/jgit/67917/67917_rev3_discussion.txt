Line:1119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalk.java -> I don't get this condition. Especially the precedence of the operators make it hard.

Before your change it was:

  t.matches == ch && !t.eof() && FileMode.TREE.equals(t.mode)
  a)                 b)          c)

Means: enter the subtree for t if all of the following is true
a) t should point to the path the treewalk is currently looking at
b) t should be able to provide at least one more element
c) t should be pointing to a tree

But you added a "|| (<your-condition>)" to the end. Means we would enter the subtree for
t always if <your-condition> is true. Even if t is pointing to "src/a/" but the treewalk is currently looking at "src/b/". Or even if t has already processed all the entries. That sounds wrong.

I would understand it if your code would have two more paranthesis. Like:

  if (t.matches == ch && !t.eof() && (FileMode.TREE.equals(t.mode) ||
    (FileMode.GITLINK.equals(t.mode) && t.isWorkTree())))

I upload a test which shows this

Line:736, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/AbstractTreeIterator.java -> eclipse says: xxx@xxx.xxx tag is missing

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> unneeded import

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> unneeded import
