DESCRIPTION

Add iso-8859 as alias for ISO-8859-1

Some real Git repositories discovered in the wild have
"encoding ISO-8859" in commit objects and cannot be read
by JGit. Add an alias for this broken charset.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> Weird. What repository does this?

I don't think native git supports this (the glibc-supported aliases for ISO-8859-1 are

 ISO-IR-100
 ISO_8859-1:1987
 ISO_8859-1
 ISO8859-1
 ISO88591
 LATIN1
 L1
 IBM819
 CP819
 CSISOLATIN1
 8859_1
 OSF00010001

). When it sees an unrecognized encoding git just gives up and prints things as is.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> I don't know who did this. I just found a random commit in a MapReduce tonight with insufficient context to answer "who". :)

I think you are right, we should handle that bad encoding differently here.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> latin-1 is a actually a good default for anything we don't understand since it's pass-through. Reading anything as latin-1 into unicode and writing as latin-1 it again never destroys the content. The intermediate unicode might be gibberish though.

..otoh we've learned that detecting decoding is more reliable than trusting the commit encoding header,.
