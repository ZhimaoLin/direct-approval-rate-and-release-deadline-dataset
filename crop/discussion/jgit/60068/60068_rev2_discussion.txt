DESCRIPTION

Add an attribute accessor to CanonicalTreeParser and use it in Treewalk

When checking out a branch we need to access the attributes stored
in the tree to be checked out. E.g. directly after a clone we checkout
the remote HEAD. In this case index and workingtree are still empty.
So we have to search the tree to be checked out for attributes.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/AbstractTreeIterator.java -> I assume when adding this field, then DirCacheIterator.attributesNode and WorkingTreeIterator.attributesNode can be deleted. There also is a warning about "hiding".

Line:1149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalk.java -> With the new AttributesNodeProvider we could remove the now obsolete methods WorkingTreeIterator.getInfoAttributesNode and WorkingTreeIterator.getGlobalAttributesNode as well as the corresponding fields infoAttributesNode and globalAttributesNode.
