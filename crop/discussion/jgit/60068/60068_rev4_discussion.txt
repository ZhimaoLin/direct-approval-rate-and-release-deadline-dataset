DESCRIPTION

Add an attribute accessor to CanonicalTreeParser and use it in Treewalk

When checking out a branch we need to access the attributes stored
in the tree to be checked out. E.g. directly after a clone we checkout
the remote HEAD. In this case index and workingtree are still empty.
So we have to search the tree to be checked out for attributes.
