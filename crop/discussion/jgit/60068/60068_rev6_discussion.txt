DESCRIPTION

Add an attribute accessor to CanonicalTreeParser and use it in Treewalk

When checking out a branch we need to access the attributes stored
in the tree to be checked out. E.g. directly after a clone we checkout
the remote HEAD. In this case index and workingtree are still empty.
So we have to search the tree to be checked out for attributes.

Line:379, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/CanonicalTreeParser.java -> While adding a novel feature, this created a bottleneck in some rather critical code. You cannot be allocating a new byte array using the random default platform encoding every time we consider a tree entry. No.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/61512 should help.
