Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> Same comment as before. The command added in this commit does not have the -i option.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> If I remove the '-i' in this message, would that resolve your concern?  Or do you only want to merge commands if they're 100% with CGit?

The other issue needed for 100% with CGit here would be for -f -f (two dash f's) to delete submodule .git directories.

I'd be fine with just removing it from the text. But I'm not a committer on this project, so maybe better to see what Matthias says.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> I think it's ok if a command doesn't support all options supported by cgit, but if an option isn't implemented yet it shouldn't be mentioned here. Maybe add a todo to the corresponding clean test so that we don't miss to add -i to this text if we implement the -i option
