Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Clean.java -> Is there any convention about making jgit's commands mimic the behaviour of equivalent cgit commands?

In cgit if we do `git clean -d` it will return an error:

 fatal: clean.requireForce defaults to true and neither -i, -n, nor -f given; refusing to clean

Should this also support those options and behave the same way?  JGit's CleanCommand already supports at least -n and -f.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Clean.java -> That's a good point.  I'll resubmit to require -f.  A great integration test would be if we ran the "jgit pgm" testsuite against both jgit and cgit to find any behavior discrepancies.  I don't think 100% accuracy with the pgm accuracy is that important in itself, but it's useful API for verifying underlying behavior.
