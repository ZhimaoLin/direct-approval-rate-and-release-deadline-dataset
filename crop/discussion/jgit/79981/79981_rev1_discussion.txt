Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> I prefer the "braces everywhere" style.  This source file doesn't have any optional braces, so I'm just matching the existing style (these lines didn't have braces before this patch).

I'm happy to submit another patch which adds all missing optional braces.

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> I meant only at this specific place, since the whole block is being modified anyway.

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Braces_for_one-line_statements

we changed style a while back to use braces around single line blocks for new or modified code, but refrain from applying the new style globally to avoid unnecessary conflicts

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> So since this code is being modified, braces should be added.
