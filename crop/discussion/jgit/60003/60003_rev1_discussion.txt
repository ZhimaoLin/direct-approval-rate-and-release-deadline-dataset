Patch Set 1:

if the API removed here is only used by implementors / extenders you should suppress the API error these breaking changes raise. Otherwise this is a breaking change and shouldn't be part of a minor release but wait for 5.0. Or do I miss something here ?

Please configure an API baseline as described in the contributor guide [1] to detect such API errors earlier.
