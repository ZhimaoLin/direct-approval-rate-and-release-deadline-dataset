DESCRIPTION

Set minimum Jetty version to 7.6

This reverts commit 0c6e7d71273b2b899f35e974d5a1463ce110fa7e which
didn't work since package imports need to be different with Jetty 7.5
and 7.6. Jetty 7.6 can be installed into Eclipse SDK 3.7.2 so rather
require Jetty 7.6 instead of adding a lot of reflective code to
workaround these incompatible changes.
