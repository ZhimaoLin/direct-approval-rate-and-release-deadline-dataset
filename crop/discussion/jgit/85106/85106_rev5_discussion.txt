DESCRIPTION

Define Clock interface for advanced timestamps

Clock can be implemented to provide more certainity about time
than the standard System.currentTimeMillis() can provide. This
can be used by classes such as PersonIdent and Ketch to rely on
more certainity about time moving in a strictly ascending order.

Gerrit Code Review can also leverage this interface through its
embedding of JGit and use Clock and ProposedTimestamp to provide
stronger assurance that NoteDb time is moving forward.
