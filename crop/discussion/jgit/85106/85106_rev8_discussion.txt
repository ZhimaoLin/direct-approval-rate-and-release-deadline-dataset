DESCRIPTION

Define MonotonicClock interface for advanced timestamps

MonotonicClock can be implemented to provide more certainity about
time than the standard System.currentTimeMillis() can provide. This
can be used by classes such as PersonIdent and Ketch to rely on
more certainity about time moving in a strictly ascending order.

Gerrit Code Review can also leverage this interface through its
embedding of JGit and use MonotonicClock and ProposedTimestamp to
provide stronger assurance that NoteDb time is moving forward.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/KetchSystem.java -> Without further explanation this is confusing. Why is max wait the amount that ketch should wait? What guarantee does the getMaxWait function provide (e.g. will the other wait function truncate waits to this cap)?

Line:383, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> Where does this number come from? A comment might help.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/time/MonotonicFakeClock.java -> My first thought on reading this was "Should this increase t?". Could fix by rephrasing:

  // Nothing to do, since fake time does not go backwards.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/time/ProposedTimestamp.java -> becoming
