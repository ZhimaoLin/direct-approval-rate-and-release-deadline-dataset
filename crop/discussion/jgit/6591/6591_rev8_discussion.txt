Patch Set 8:

I seem to be missing where in the code you handle the new POST request for authentication.

Patch Set 8:

I reused the real PublisherClient subscribe implementation, it simply exits early when reading the headers if it finds "done advertisement" instead of "done". It will exit after the call to publisher.connectClient, which checks authentication on each repository listed.
