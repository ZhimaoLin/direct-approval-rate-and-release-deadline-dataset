DESCRIPTION

Use 'reused' bitmap to filter tip commit setup walk

When garbage collecting, we decide to reuse some bitmaps in older
history from the previous pack to save time.  The remainder of commit
selection only involves commits not covered by those bitmaps.

Currently we carry that out in two ways:

1. by building a bitmap representing the already-covered commits,
   for easy containment checks and AND-NOT-ing against
2. by marking the reused bitmap commits as uninteresting in the
   RevWalk that finds new commits

The mechanism in (2) is less efficient than (1): rw.next() will walk
back from reused bitmap commits to check whether the commit it is
about to emit is an ancestor of them, when using the bitmap from (1)
would let us perform the same check with a single contains() call.
Add a RevFilter teaching the RevWalk to perform that same check
directly using the bitmap from (1).

The next time the RevWalk is used, a different RevFilter is installed
so this does not break that.

A later commit will drop the markUninteresting calls.

No functional change intended except a possible speedup.

Line:329, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> This is a change from before that concerns me.

Line:400, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> I think this goes to far. Consider a long-lived branch that diverged from the mainline, and there are reusable bitmaps for both the mainline and the branch. By unioning them all here, you get incorrect bitmaps at the branch tips that report commits that aren't reachable at those tips. We probably need a test for this.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> This is the line I am worried about.

Line:400, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> Gerrit does a bad job of showing the right context for changes between rebased patchsets. The change you're commenting on comes from https://git.eclipse.org/r/59622 --- there's more context there. (If you diff against the base, the change goes away.)

Probably we should discuss on that change. 'reuse' was always meant to be a union of the ancestry sets of reused bitmaps. Happy to add clarify the code and add tests if you have a good idea of what to test.

Line:400, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> *add clarifying comments, I mean. Sorry, I'm doing a bad job of typing today.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> On line 449 all the bits in 'reuse' are cleared. Definitely sounds worth a comment here. Will do.

Line:351, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> Yeah, I suppose so. CompressedBitmapBuilder isn't thread-safe.

Lots of other RevFilters 'return this' instead of admitting lack of support. Time to change habits.
