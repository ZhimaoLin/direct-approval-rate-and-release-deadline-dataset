DESCRIPTION

RefSpecs: allow construction of weird wildcarded RefSpecs

Gerrits superproject subscription feature uses RefSpecs to formalize
the ACLs of when the superproject subscription feature is allowed.

As this is a slightly different use case than describing a local/remote
pair of refs, we need to be more permissive. Specially we want to allow:

    refs/heads/*
    refs/heads/*:refs/heads/master
    refs/heads/master:refs/heads/*

Introduce a new constructor, that allows constructing these refs specs.

Yay, I like this.

Quick thoughts:
* a name like allowMismatchedWildcards would make it clearer what is going on (and after all, a wildcard mismatch when explicitly permitted like this is perfectly valid)
* Missing wildcard = true assignment in the ':refs/heads/*' case
* expandFromSource and expandFromDestination don't make sense in this mode. Perhaps they need a checkState.
* matchSource and matchDestination assume that there is a * present when wildcard == true. They'll need to handle the no-* case.
* Tests?
