DESCRIPTION

RefSpecs: allow construction of weird wildcarded RefSpecs

Gerrit's superproject subscription feature uses RefSpecs to formalize
the ACLs of when the superproject subscription feature is allowed.

As this is a slightly different use case than describing a local/remote
pair of refs, we need to be more permissive. Specifically we want to allow:

    refs/heads/*
    refs/heads/*:refs/heads/master
    refs/heads/master:refs/heads/*

Introduce a new constructor, that allows constructing these RefSpecs.
