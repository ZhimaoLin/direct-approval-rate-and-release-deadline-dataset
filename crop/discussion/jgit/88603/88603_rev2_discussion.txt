DESCRIPTION

Add support for refusing LFS request due to invalid authorization

Add a new exception type that server implementations can throw when a
client attempts to make an unauthorized LFS operation, which will result
in HTTP 401 Unauthorized being returned to the client.

An example of this is a Gerrit server that rejects a request to perform
an LFS operation on a ref that is not visible to the caller.

As defined in the LFS spec [1] the request may include authentication,
and per RFC 2616 [2], "401 response indicates that authorization has been
refused for those credentials".
