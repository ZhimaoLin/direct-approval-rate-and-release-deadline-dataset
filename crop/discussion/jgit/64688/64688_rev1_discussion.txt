Funny thing, I saw this once I had Java 1.8 installed and used as default also for 1.7 target projects. Is this your case too?
If yes, we should open a bug against PDE or JDT, since both environments are "equal" in this concrete API.

Yes, I'm also using Java 8. How do I configure Eclipse to use Java 7 for my 1.7 target projects?

That should be in the JRE preferences, where you first ned to add 1.7 instsll, and then confugure that it must be used for 1.7 target.
