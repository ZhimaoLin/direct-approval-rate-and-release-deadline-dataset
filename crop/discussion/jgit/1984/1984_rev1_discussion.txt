Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

(2 inline comments)

Looks good.

Line:324, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> constant somewhere?

Line:328, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> we should probably refactor these into private static String's somewhere.
