DESCRIPTION

UnionInputStream: combines sequential InputStreams into one

The UnionInputStream utility class combines multiple sequential
InputStreams so they appear to the caller as a single stream with
no gaps.  This can be used to concentate streams coming from multiple
independent HTTP connections (for example).

The companion unit test covers the class's full functionality.
