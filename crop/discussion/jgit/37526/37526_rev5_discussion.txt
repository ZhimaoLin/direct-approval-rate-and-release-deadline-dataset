Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Clone.java -> Possible NPE in next line when command.getDirectory() is null. When cloning into a bare repo it is possible to only specify gitDir.

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Clone.java -> Just a question: you changed the or of command execution and output to the message. By purpose? Maybe you wanted to use "db.getDirectory"

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Clone.java -> that's tricky since the computation done in init(URIish u) is only done during CloneCommand.call() and init has side effects. I'll try to add a callback interface to fix this.
