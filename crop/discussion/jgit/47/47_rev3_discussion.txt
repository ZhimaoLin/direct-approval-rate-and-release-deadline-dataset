DESCRIPTION

Smart push over HTTP: client side

Clients take advantage of the info/refs?service=git-receive-pack URL
to determine if the remote side will support a standard receive-pack
command stream.  If so, commands are sent along with their pack in a
single HTTP POST request.

Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Should this be some kind of constant rather than a String, to facilitate future NLS? We could pass in an int code INVALID_URL and a string:
class NotSupportException(int code, String data )
toString() { switch(code) case INVALID_URL: "Invalid URL " + data}
etc.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> I'm not sure how that helps NLS behavior very much.  We really just need a resource bundle which we can use to seed the exception with the error message for the current locale, or we need a unique exception object for every error code so the UI can handle the different types.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> I don't think you need to create a new exception object for every message; rather, a class should be for a class of problems and the code could be a subclass of that problem (or a specific instance of that). However, let's leave the NLS aside for now so that we can get this going.

Line:390, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> This could be a pre-defined (static final) instance of a static class, rather than an instance class instantiated anew each time.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> We should have a constants file for representing e.g. HTTP_METHOD_POST and HTTP_HEADER_CONTENT_TYPE

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:437, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Can this be 'static' ? I don't see that it's referring to anything in the enclosing class, but I could have missed where it is.
