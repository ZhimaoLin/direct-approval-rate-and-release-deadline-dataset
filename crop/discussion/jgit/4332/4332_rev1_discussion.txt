DESCRIPTION

Refactor HTTP server stack to use Filter as base

All Git URLs operate off a suffix approach, for example the default
binding is for paths such as:

  */info/refs
  */git-upload-pack
  */git-receive-pack

These names are not common on project hosting servers, especially
one like Gerrit Code Review.

In addition to offering Git-over-HTTP as a servlet, offer it as a
filter that triggers when a matching suffix appears, but otherwise
delegates the request through the chain.  This filter would permit
Gerrit Code Review to place projects at the root of the server,
rather than within the "/p/" subdirectory, making the HTTP and SSH
URL structure exactly match each other.

To prevent breakage with existing users, the MetaServlet and
GitServlet are kept as wrappers delegating to their filters,
returning 404 Not Found when the filter has no match.
