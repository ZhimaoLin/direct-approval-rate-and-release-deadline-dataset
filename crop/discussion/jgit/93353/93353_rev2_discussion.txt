DESCRIPTION

WiP: Rename RacyGitTests to RacyGitTest and xxx@xxx.xxx annotations

With the filename suffix "Tests", the module is not included in tests
when building with Maven, and without xxx@xxx.xxx annotations the tests
don't get executed under Eclipse or buck test.

WiP because testRacyGitDetection is failing.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Can be fixed without renaming the file, by configuring the surefire plugin to include *Tests.
