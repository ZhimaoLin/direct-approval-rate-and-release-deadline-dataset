DESCRIPTION

Fix test configuration to run RacyGitTests, and fix testRacyGitDetection

With the filename suffix "Tests", the module was not included in tests
when building with Maven, and without xxx@xxx.xxx annotations the tests
didn't get executed under Eclipse or buck test.

testRacyGitDetection was failing because the index file did not exist.

Add the missing configuration, the missing annotations, and add a call
to reset() in testRacyGitDetection to force creation of the index file.

length != 0 means the racy git condition wasn't met, this depends on resolution of filesystem timestamps which is platform dependent. git sets length to 0 if mtime of versioned file and git index is within the same tick of the filesystem timer, in that case we can't rely on modification time to detect if the file is dirty or not hence the file is smudged by setting length to 0 despite the fact that the file has length > 0 (see DirCacheEntry.smudgeRacilyClean())
