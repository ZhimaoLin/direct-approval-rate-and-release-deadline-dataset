DESCRIPTION

Remove RepositoryConfig and use FileBasedConfig instead

Change the Repository API to use straight-up FileBasedConfig.
This lets us remove the subclass RepositoryConfig and stop having
a specialized configuration type for repository, letting us instead
focus the config type heirarchy on type-of-storage rather than use.
