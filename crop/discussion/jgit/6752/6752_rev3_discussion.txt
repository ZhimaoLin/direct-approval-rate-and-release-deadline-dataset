Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Just one nit.

Line:198, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubTest.java -> Don't need volatile, tests are single-threaded. (Multiple test methods may be run concurrently, but there is one test object instantiated per thread, i.e. it effectively does:

PubSubTest t = new PubSubTest();
t.setUp();
try {
  t.testOneThing();
} finally {
  t.tearDown();
}

)
