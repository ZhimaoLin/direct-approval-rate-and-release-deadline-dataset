DESCRIPTION

Fix SubmoduleWalk.forIndex() to prefer working tree's .gitmodules

This was broken in fe1f1b8f8aba60fdd1ad6f0f72e9c9180978cc60, which
preferred the index over the working tree when both were present.

Line:390, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> How about simplifying this by just using a single if/else that uses the rootTree if non-null and falls back to the working tree config if the rootTree is null?

Then the useWorkingTree field can be removed.
