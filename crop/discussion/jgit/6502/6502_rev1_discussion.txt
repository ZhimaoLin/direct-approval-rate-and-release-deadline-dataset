DESCRIPTION

Fix SubmoduleWalk.forIndex() to prefer working tree's .gitmodules

This was broken in fe1f1b8f8aba60fdd1ad6f0f72e9c9180978cc60, which
preferred the index over the working tree when both were present.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> Does this make sense?

I didn't think bare repositories have an index so repository.readDirCache() would already throw an exception at this point since repository.getIndexFile() throws an exception for bare repositories as is called by DirCache.read

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> True, it should throw NoWorkTreeException, which is reasonable. So I guess we should never prefer .gitmodules in the index to .gitmodules in the working tree, that makes sense. Done.
