DESCRIPTION

Implement core.checkstat = minimal

There is a huge performance issue when using both JGit (EGit) and Git
because JGit does not fill all dircache stat fields with the values Git
would expect. As a result thereof Git would typically revalidate a large
number of tracked files. This can take several minutes for large
repositories with many large files.

Since 1.8.2 Git will restrict stat checking to the size and whole second
part of the modification time stamp, if core.statinfo is set to
"minimal".

As JGit checks only size and modification time this is close to what
JGit already does. To make the match perfect ignore the sub-second part
of the modification time stamp if core.statinfo = minimal.
