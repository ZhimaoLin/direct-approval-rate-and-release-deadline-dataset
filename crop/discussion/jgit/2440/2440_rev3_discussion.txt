DESCRIPTION

daemon: Use HTTP's resolver and factory pattern

Using a resolver and factory pattern for the anonymous git:// Daemon
class makes transport.Daemon more useful on non-file storage systems,
or in embedded applications where the caller wants more precise
control over the work tasks constructed within the daemon.

Rather than defining new interfaces, move the existing HTTP ones
into transport.resolver and make them generic on the connection
handle type.  For HTTP, continue to use HttpServletRequest, and
for transport.Daemon use DaemonClient.

To remain compatible with transport.Daemon, FileResolver needs to
learn how to use multiple base directories, and how to export any
Repository instance at a fixed name.
