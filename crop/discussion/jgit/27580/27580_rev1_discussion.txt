DESCRIPTION

Enable NLS / TranslationBundle to be used in OSGi

TranslationBundle#load() used to load resource bundles through
ResourceBundle#getBundle() without explicitly specifying a class loader.
In this case, the class laoder of the calling class (TranslationBundle
here) is used. This approach fails in runtime environments like OSGi
where there are multiple class loaders.

This change enables loading resource bundles in multi class loaders
environments. The fix is to passes the class loader of the
TranslationBundle-derived class to ResourceBundle#getBundle().

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/TranslationBundle.java -> This is annoying. It seems that the trailing spaces are inserted by the code format save action - respectively a bug in the formatter. Just make a one-char-change, save it and you'll see the spaces added.

Anyway, they removed now.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Good catch. Done

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/TranslationBundle.java -> Yeah, happens to me too. See also the contributor guide [1], which mentions a bug report regarding newlines in JavaDoc. The case mentioned there has been fixed, but there seem to remain cases, where it does not work.
