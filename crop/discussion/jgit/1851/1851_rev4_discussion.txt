DESCRIPTION

Add in-memory updating support to NoteMap

NoteMap now supports editing in-memory, allowing applications to
modify the NoteMap once it has been loaded from the branch.  The
ability to write the branch back to tree objects is not yet done,
so the edits are strictly transient.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/LeafBucket.java -> This part looked kind of funny to me, but I haven't had time to write a test that covers this part.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/LeafBucket.java -> Done.  Unit tests added.  This code is correct as written, because the unit tests say it is... :-)
