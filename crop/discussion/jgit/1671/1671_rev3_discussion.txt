DESCRIPTION

Enable providing credentials for HTTP authentication

This change is based on http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,1652
by Aracely Robinson. The change adds the concept of a CredentialsProvider
which can be registered for git transports and which is
responsible to return credential-related data like passwords and
usernames. Whenenver the transports detects that an authentication
with certain credentials has to be done it will ask the
CredentialsProvider for this data. Foreseen implementations for
such a Provider may be a EGitCredentialsProvider (caching
credential data entered e.g. in the Clone-Wizzard) or a NetRcProvider
(gathering data out of ~/.netrc file).

Patch Set 3:

I think this is a better strategy, as it was extensible into the JSch case where we also have to ask about unknown or changed host keys, and passphrases for private keys.

It is a bit ugly to implement.  Be sure to check the final patch in the series (http://egit.eclipse.org/r/1881) to see an example of the new provider implementation for AWT and Java 6's system console.
