DESCRIPTION

Fixed creation of branch from a tag

Creation of a branch X from an annotated tag, as the starting point,
resulted into .git/refs/heads/X containing the ID of the annotated tag
instead of the ID of the tagged commit.

This fix peels the tag ref before using it as the starting point for
the newly created branch.
