DESCRIPTION

Make GC cancellable when called programmatically

Sometimes, it is necessary to cancel a garbage collection operation.
When GC is called using the standalone executable, i.e., from a command
line, Control-Cing the process does the trick. When calling GC
programmatically, though, there is no mechanism to do it.

Add checks in the GC process so that a custom cancellable progress
monitor could be passed in order to cancel the operation at specific
points. In this case, the calling process set the cancel flag in the
progress monitor and the GC process will throw an exception that can
be caught and handled by the caller accordingly.

Line:1049, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Not related to this change but this should be spelled "Cancelled" to be consistent with method "isCancelled" of ProgressMonitor.

Line:1049, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I think we should throw a dedicated exception here otherwise callers have to parse the exception message to differentiate between cancellation and an IO problem

Line:1049, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> We thought about this and decided to use the same exception in order to avoid an API change. However, we agree adding a new exception is clearer and simplifies the caller's task. If you are OK with this API change, I'll add a new exception, CancelledGcException? Any suggestion of a better name?

Line:1049, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> If the new exception inherits from IOException there is no API breakage, right ? I would just name it CancelledException since the caller knows it started GC
