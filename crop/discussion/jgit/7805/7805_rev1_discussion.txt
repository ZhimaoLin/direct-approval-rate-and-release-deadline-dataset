DESCRIPTION

Fix resolving expression with ~ and ^ than extends beyond history

resolve("foo~X") where X is greater than the distance from foo to the
root should return null, but 2a2362fb introduced a bug causing it to
either return resolve("foo") or NPE. Add a test for the correct
behavior.

Also add an analogous test for foo^X where X is greater than the
number of parents (which was not broken by that commit).

Credits to Santos Moore for finding the issue and test cases.

Patch Set 1:

The IP log for release 2.1 was approved yesterday, so I'd prefer to release 2.1 without this change since we are running out of time (the final build for Juno SR1 is tomorrow).

If it's a critical fix we can release another 2.1.1 next week or so.
