DESCRIPTION

Bug 321237 - Add Ant tasks for common Git commands.

See build.test.xml as an example of how the build script may look like(note that the jgit.classpath may need to be tweaked in the build)

This is a very simple first pass attempt at some basic git commands(init, checkout, clone). There is currently no validation in place and not all possible options may be supported.
