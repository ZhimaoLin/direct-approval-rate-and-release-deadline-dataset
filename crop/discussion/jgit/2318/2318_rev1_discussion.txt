DESCRIPTION

Support for self signed certificate (HTTPS)

Add possibility to disable ssl verification, just as i can do with git
using: git config --global http.sslVerify false

To enable the feature, configure
Window->Preferences->Team->Git->Configuration
and add a new key/value: http.sslVerify=false

When handling repos over https, JGit will then check that flag to see
if security is loose and the ssl verification should be ignored.

Having it implemented as a key/value makes it not too obvious in the
GUI - so the user must know what he/she is doing when adding it. Being
aware of the risks etc.

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> This should be moved into the HttpConfig object, so its part of the cached HttpConfig we obtain from the repository config file when no changes have been made to the file.

Line:431, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> I think disableSslVerify is a better name for this method.

Line:814, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Style-nit: Make this class static, it doesn't need to hold onto the TransportHttp instance.

Line:816, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Style-nit: We prefer to import these names and use the short class name instead.
