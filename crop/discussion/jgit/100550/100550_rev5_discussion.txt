Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:213, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/attributes/AttributesRule.java -> I decided to strip the trailing slashes here.
The caller here don't care if it is "dir" or "dir/", so we will get the "native git" behavior. 

I decided not to do this in PathMatcher, because it is more generic one and this would also have implications on ignore rules, which I can't overlook right now.

Patch Set 5:

Thanks, I agree with the main idea of the change!
Whether or not

  a/** should match a/
and 
  a/b/** should a/b/
in FastIgnoreRuleTest is rather a philosophical question that has no practical application. Personally I think that no because in case of "git check-attr" it says they do not match and official .gitattributes documentation states:
===
  The rules how the pattern matches paths are the same as in .gitignore files; see gitignore[5]. Unlike .gitignore, negative patterns are forbidden.
===
To make them non-matched one can replace
if (left < endExcl)
  match = matches(matcher, path, left, endExcl, assumeDirectory);

with


if (left < endExcl) {
  match = matches(matcher, path, left, endExcl, assumeDirectory);
} else {
  match = match && !(matcher == matchers.size() - 1 && matchers.get(matcher) == WILD);
}

But I have no objection to your latest fix as in practice there's no real difference.

Yes, makes sense.

The else could be just 

match = match && matchers.get(matcher) != WILD;

I'm inclined to prefer your latest proposal (simplified) because being consistent makes sense even if the case has no practical use.
