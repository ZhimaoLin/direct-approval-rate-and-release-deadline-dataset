Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Thanks for reviewing my changes. To be honest I completely don't understand that 'return assumeDirectory;' solution as well as the whole if around it (and that's why I've changed it).

Now I've pushed even more tests for /**. Currently they fail with 'return assumeDirectory;' solution but succeed with

if (matcher == matchers.size() - 1
&& matchers.get(matcher) == WILD) {
return Strings.stripTrailing(path.substring(left, endExcl), slash).length() != 0;
}

Also I should add that except /** patterns problems there're also problems with patterns ending with /*. I'll apply my fixes once this one is merged as another change. They also contain this long ugly Strings.stripTrailing() but I find it the easiest way to ignore all slashes at the end of the path to match.

Maybe I should also add tests for

dir//

and

dir/sub//

Sorry, I didn't get it: *which* change should be merged?

assumeDirectory is about the pattern being considered a file or directory.

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/attributes/AttributesNodeTest.java -> This does not make sense, it is a directory

Patch Set 4: -Code-Review

The first one: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100550/1

+ I can apply the new tests on the top of it to make testing more rigorous.

If you agree, I'll do that now.

Patch Set 4:

No, just remove that one line with trailing slash added in your last patch. What should it test? Attributes applied to a directory?

Patch Set 4:

It tests if the behaviour is the same as of

  git check-attr C dir/

command whatever this means. In this case Git will print:

  dir/: C: value

so probably it makes sense for Git.

The same code is used for ignores and for ignores it makes sense.

What would be better: remove all trailing slashes from path *before* calling PathMatcher.iterate and inside iterate() assume the paths have no trailing slashes at all but the method wasn't designed that way for reasons I don't know.
