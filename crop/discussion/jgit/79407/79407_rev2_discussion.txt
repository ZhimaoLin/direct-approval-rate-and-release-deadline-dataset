DESCRIPTION

Use FS#lastModified instead of File#lastModified

FS uses java.nio API to get file attributes. The timestamps obtained from that
API are more precise than the ones from java.io.File#lastModified().

This difference accidentally makes JGit detect newly added files as smudged. Use
the precised timestamp to avoid this false positive.

I fixed the failing tests.

Note that WorkingTreeIterator has a workaround for idBuffer reuse. I described the root cause in the commit message.
