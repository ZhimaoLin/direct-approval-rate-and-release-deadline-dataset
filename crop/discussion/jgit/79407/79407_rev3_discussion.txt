DESCRIPTION

Use FS#lastModified instead of File#lastModified

Bug: 500058. This fixes the tests failed in JDK8.

FS uses java.nio API to get file attributes. The timestamps obtained
from that API are more precise than the ones from
java.io.File#lastModified() since Java8.

This difference accidentally makes JGit detect newly added files as
smudged. Use the precised timestamp to avoid this false positive.

WorkingTreeIterator needs a temporary hack because of this timestamp
preciseness. It reuses idBuffer in DirCacheEntry if the metadata is
matched. The problem here is that the metadata comparison of GIT_LINK
(submodules) is incorrect in many cases, and therefore the idBuffer
reuse is not valid. FileTreeIterator uses file timestamps as
lastModified metadata. For submodules, the timestamp of the submodule
directory is meaningless. It won't indicate the changes in submodule
repository refs. This was caught by
CommitCommandTest#commitSubmoduleUpdate when FileSnapshot started using
the precise timestamp. The reason that this was not problem before was
that the index entries were almost always detected as smudged during the
test, and WorkingTreeIterator didn't reuse the idBuffer.

Temporarily disable the idBuffer reuse for submodules.

Thanks for working on it!

It looks better now (I haven't checked the code), but I still see 2 failures on Java 8:

org.eclipse.jgit.lib.IndexDiffSubmoduleTest
testDirtySubmoduleWorktreeUntracked(org.eclipse.jgit.lib.IndexDiffSubmoduleTest)
org.junit.experimental.theories.internal.ParameterizedAssertionError: testDirtySubmoduleWorktreeUntracked("UNTRACKED" <from allModes[2]>)

org.eclipse.jgit.merge.RecursiveMergerTest
crissCrossMerge_mergeable2(org.eclipse.jgit.merge.RecursiveMergerTest)
org.junit.experimental.theories.internal.ParameterizedAssertionError: xxx@xxx.xxx <from strategiesUnderTest[0]>, "SameAsHead" <from indexStates[2]>, "SameAsOther" <from worktreeStates[4]>)

... and one new fail on Java 7:

org.junit.experimental.theories.internal.ParameterizedAssertionError: testDirtySubmoduleWorktreeUntracked("UNTRACKED" <from allModes[2]>)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style nit: we require the "Bug: <number>" line without extra words after, so please remove ". This fixes ..." from this line and begin the commit message with "This fixes ...".
