DESCRIPTION

Use FS#lastModified instead of File#lastModified

This fixes the tests failed in JDK8.

FS uses java.nio API to get file attributes. The timestamps obtained
from that API are more precise than the ones from
java.io.File#lastModified() since Java8.

This difference accidentally makes JGit detect newly added files as
smudged. Use the precised timestamp to avoid this false positive.

WorkingTreeIterator needs a temporary hack because of this timestamp
preciseness. It reuses idBuffer in DirCacheEntry if the metadata is
matched. The problem here is that the metadata comparison of GIT_LINK
(submodules) is incorrect in many cases, and therefore the idBuffer
reuse is not valid. FileTreeIterator uses file timestamps as
lastModified metadata. For submodules, the timestamp of the submodule
directory is meaningless. It won't indicate the changes in submodule
repository refs. This was caught by
CommitCommandTest#commitSubmoduleUpdate when FileSnapshot started using
the precise timestamp. The reason that this was not problem before was
that the index entries were almost always detected as smudged during the
test, and WorkingTreeIterator didn't reuse the idBuffer.

Temporarily disable the idBuffer reuse for submodules.

I cannot reproduce the test failures in my machine. But I saw the same failure before (and now it's gone somehow). I'll use another machine to see if I can reproduce them.

Line:266, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Christian, this reminds me about https://git.eclipse.org/r/78060/ and https://git.eclipse.org/r/78586/, which are still pending. This and other patches are doing similar things in different places in WorkingTreeIterator. Shouldn't we came up with the combined version?

Patch Set 4:

Great work! This time I see only one remaining fail on Java 8 and no fails on Java 7:

org.junit.experimental.theories.internal.ParameterizedAssertionError: testDirtySubmoduleWorktreeUntracked("UNTRACKED" <from allModes[2]>)
	at org.junit.experimental.theories.Theories$TheoryAnchor.reportParameterizedError(Theories.java:288)

Caused by: java.lang.AssertionError: diff should be false with mode=UNTRACKED
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertFalse(Assert.java:64)
	at org.eclipse.jgit.lib.IndexDiffSubmoduleTest.testDirtySubmoduleWorktreeUntracked(IndexDiffSubmoduleTest.java:207)

I will try to rebase your patch on top of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78586/ and see if this would solve the remaining issue and probably makes your workaround for WirkingTreeIterator not needed.
