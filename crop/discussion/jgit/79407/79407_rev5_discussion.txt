DESCRIPTION

Use FS#lastModified instead of File#lastModified

This fixes the tests failed in JDK8.

FS uses java.nio API to get file attributes. The timestamps obtained
from that API are more precise than the ones from
java.io.File#lastModified() since Java8.

This difference accidentally makes JGit detect newly added files as
smudged. Use the precised timestamp to avoid this false positive.

I've rebased your patch on top of Christian patch for submodules - this fixes finally last issue with Java 8 without workaround on WorkingTreeIterator, and also keeps Java 7 tests happy.

From my side I'm happy with *this* patch now, but honestly speaking, I have not much knowledge with the WorkingTreeIterator to judge if the Christian patch is good enough. The changes looks good *for me*.

It would be nice if you could review Christian patch for WorkingTreeIterator. The patch from Christian definitely solves my problems with submodules described in bug 498759.
