DESCRIPTION

Wait for EOF on stderr before finishing SSH channel

JSch will allow us to close the connection and then just drop
any late messages coming over the stderr stream for the command.
This makes it easy to lose final output on a command, like from
Gerrit Code Review's post receive hook.

Instead spawn a background thread to copy data from JSch's pipe
into our own buffer, and wait for that thread to receive EOF on the
pipe before we declare the connection closed. This way we don't
have a race condition between the stderr data arriving and JSch
just tearing down the channel.
