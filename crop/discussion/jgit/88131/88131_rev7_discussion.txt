DESCRIPTION

Normalizer creating a valid branch name from a string

Generic normalization method for a possible invalid branch name. 
The method compresses dividers between spaces, then replaces spaces  
and non word characters with underscores.

This method is needed in preparation for subsequent EGit changes.
