DESCRIPTION

Bug 509878 - Provide a way to fix the branch name in the
CreateBranchWizard

Generic normalization method for a possible invalid branch name. 
The method compresses dividers between spaces, then replaces spaces  
and non word characters with underscores.

This method is needed in preparation for subsequent EGit changes.

Line:1902, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> why not always trim ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: we put the link to the bug as a commit message footer in the last paragraph of the commit message, see [1].

If you want this method in JGit so that it can be reused by other applications than EGit the title of this commit message should be more generic, e.g. "Normalizer creating a valid branch name from a string"

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: remove trailing whitespace

Near perfect. All issues addressed, added extensive javadoc, made the method better and added more tests.
