DESCRIPTION

Bug 509878 - Provide a way to fix the branch name in the
CreateBranchWizard

Generic normalization method for a possible invalid branch name. 
The method compresses dividers between spaces, then replaces spaces  
and non word characters with underscores.

This method is needed in preparation for subsequent EGit changes.

Line:1899, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This is a public method, so it needs to have xxx@xxx.xxx tag in the javadoc

Line:1902, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I know it's done in plenty of other places in the code base, but I would prefer not to use parameter assignment.
