DESCRIPTION

Fix AnyObjectId's generic type declaration of Comparable

If you look at any implementation of Comparable in the JDK, you'll see
that the type parameter for Comparable is supposed to be the type of
the implementing class:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html

The current type signature of Comparable<Object> is pretty awful, at the
very least because you can not, in fact, successfully compare
AnyObjectId with any random subclass of Object. It also causes problems
with type-inference and the scala.math.Ordering trait in Scala.

In order to compile, this change *does* require removing the
AnyObjectId.ompareTo(Object) method - which actually only ever cast
to AnyObjectId in any case. Nothing in the JGit test suite requires this
method, but I suppose it does constitute a potential breaking API
change - however, I'm not able to imagine any sane code that would ever
have invoked it :-)

I'm afraid I wan't too sure how to push to refs/for/stable-3.0 - I got this error:

Looks like this build timed out after 30 minutes... Patch Set 1 only took 6 minutes to build, but looks like the GCTest went bad this time... don't think this is associated with my change tho...

Patch Set 2:

@Robin - yup, the commit was on my local copy of stable-3.0, so I think that should have worked.

Here's what I get doing 'git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/stable-3.0'...
