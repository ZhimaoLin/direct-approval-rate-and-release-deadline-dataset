DESCRIPTION

Introduce RawText#load.

This method creates a RawText from a blob, but avoids reading the blob
if the start contains null bytes. This should reduce the amount of
garbage that Gerrit produces for changes with binaries.

Line:339, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> Couldn't you check already here with isBinary(head, off,n) whether the last read chunk contained a null? We could avoid loading the header in multiple chunks if the first chunk already contains the null.

oh, darn; this is a gerrit that doesn't auto-publish comments :-/

Line:339, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> that method doesn't exist, but I did something equivalent.
