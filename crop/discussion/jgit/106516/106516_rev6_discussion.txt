DESCRIPTION

Introduce RawText#load.

This method creates a RawText from a blob, but avoids reading the blob
if the start contains null bytes. This should reduce the amount of
garbage that Gerrit produces for changes with binaries.

Line:968, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Optional: if you don't mind duplicating the "res.header =", you can move the binary case into this block with an early return. I think that control flow would be easier to read.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextLoadTest.java -> Missing copyright header

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextLoadTest.java -> Nit: extra blank line

Line:19, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextLoadTest.java -> static

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/BinaryBlobException.java -> Missing copyright header

Line:309, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> This doesn't match the implementation. It implies that if sz > threshold, it will always throw BinaryBlobException. But that's not guaranteed: if threshold=10 and sz=100, then threshold gets set to 8000 on line 318, but sz < 8000 so it does an exact binary check and might not throw BBE.

Line:322, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> Optional: you could save some casting below if you do:

 if (ldr.getSize() > threshold) {
   throw
 }
 int sz = (int) ldr.getSize();

(It'd be a stronger recommendation if you were doing more than 1 or 2 int arithmetic operations with sz.)

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> byte[]

Line:332, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> byte[]

Line:339, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> Needs to be a translatable string from JGitText. Or maybe EOFException  with no message would be ok?

(Eclipse should warn about this, so please check Eclipse warnings. Since this is the Eclipse Foundation we're working with, there is really only One True IDE to be using :)
