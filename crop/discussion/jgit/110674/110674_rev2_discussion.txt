DESCRIPTION

Move loggers to the top of their class

There is a possibility of hitting NPE on a logger if it is not the first
statically initialized member. For example, if another static
initializer creates an instance of its class and the logger is used
from the constructor.

Line:4, /COMMIT_MSG -> Interesting.  How did you manage to associate multiple email addresses to your account?
