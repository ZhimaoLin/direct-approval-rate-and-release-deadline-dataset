DESCRIPTION

Reject non-fast-forwards earlier in BaseReceivePack

If BaseReceivePack has setAllowNonFastForwards(false) configured
(such as by receive.denynonfastforwards), automatically reject
any command that attempts a non-fast-forward update before it goes
further in processing.

This matches with other checks in validateCommands(), such as the
early failure of delete attempts when isAllowDeletes() is false.
