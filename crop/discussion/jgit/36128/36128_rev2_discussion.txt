DESCRIPTION

Let RepositoryBuilder find bare repos

BaseRepositoryBuilder.findGitDir() was not searching correctly for bare
repositories. E.g. when running org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Log and the current
directory was that of a bare git repository an error "fatal: error:
can't find git directory" was raised. With this fix RepositoryBuilder
will also check whether the given directory is the root of a bare
repository.
