DESCRIPTION

RFC Update DirCacheEntry's copyMetaData to not copy stage info

The original user of this, i.e. DirCacheCheckout, should not copy
the stage.

There are other users though, which I believe should never be used
with anything but stage 0, hence this change in behaviour should be
non-dangerous.

As an alternative we could create a new method to do the copy
or add a setStage for DirCacheCheckout.
