DESCRIPTION

RFC Update DirCacheEntry's copyMetaData to not copy stage info

The original user of this, i.e. DirCacheCheckout, should not copy
the stage.

There are other users though, which I believe should never be used
with anything but stage 0, hence this change in behaviour should be
non-dangerous.

As an alternative we could create a new method to do the copy
or add a setStage for DirCacheCheckout.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

The change in copyMetaData is ok. But I am not sure whether we should really change the behaviour for all callers. When I was looking at the callers in EGit I got the feeling that not all of them really are aware about files which are not in stage 0. What is if you merged, you get a conflict on a file and then (before solving the conflict) you move the file to another location? Should the GitMoveDeleteHook allow this and create three new DirCacheEntries (for stage 1,2,3) with the new path?
Savest would be to create a new method for DirCacheCheckout. Cleanest would be to fix also all the usages of copyMetaData.

Line:649, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> Looks ok to me. Took me some time to investigate but now I think this change is correct.
