DESCRIPTION

Add client side support for authenticating clients by certificates

When pushing to a git server over https it should be possible to authenticate
the client by client certificates. Native git allows this by the configuration
parameters http.sslKey/http.sslCert which are added to jgit with this commit.
Also support for http.sslCAInfo is added which allows checking server
certificates during https communication.

Unit tests for this functionality are included in a subsequent commit which
brings the server side for authentication by client-certificates.

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.properties -> Maybe "... certificate/ key in..." would be better...

Line:293, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/CredentialItem.java -> We could add "/ private key" to this comment as well.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider.java -> Would it make sense to have a separate CertCredentialsProvider?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider.java -> Comment does not match list of parameters.

Line:244, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Should we also consider support for sslCAPath?

Line:245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Stupid question: Do we need http.sslCert?

Line:502, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Why are we getting the CertPassword if http.sslKey is null (because the user isn't using client certificates)?

Also, C Git suggests the user set http.sslCertPasswordProtected if their key is encrypted with a password. If its not set, C Git doesn't prompt until later when the key is required and a password is needed. Is there some way we can tell if the key is encrypted and avoid prompting if this variable is unset and the key is not stored encrypted?

Line:514, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> What is this TODO here?

Line:539, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> It may be true that you want to trust all hosts inside your company, but I don't think this is a sane default. :-)

I think C Git just ties this in with sslVerify. If sslVerify is false, then hostname verification isn't performed either. If sslVerify is true, then both certificate and hostname verification is done.

Line:549, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Style-nit: We prefer the idiom:

  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(path);
  try {
  } finally {
    fis.close();
  }

Line:560, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Style-nit: Please preserve the original chain of exceptions:

  IOException ioe = new IOException(e.getMessage());
  ioe.initCause(e);
  throw ioe;

Line:575, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Style-nit: See above about file handling.

Line:593, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Style-nit: See above about keeping the exception chain.

Having recently added X509 certificate authentication to Gitblit I would very much like to be able to use that from EGit.
