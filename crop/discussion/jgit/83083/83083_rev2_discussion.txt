DESCRIPTION

WiP: HttpClientConnection: Fix connecting to https through proxy

- Set the proxy on the config builder rather than on the client builder.

- Set the proxy with explicit http scheme.

- As mentioned in [1] it is necessary to register a socket connection
  factory to prevent the "http protocol is not supported" error.
