Trying to test this by cloning through mitmproxy as described in the comments on [1] but I'm getting SSL related errors [2] both with and without this change, so I suspect I'm missing something in the configuration of my environment or configuration of the proxy. Any hints?

This problem sounds familiar. I would set in your global git config at least temporary a http.sslverify=false. You are trying to talk ssl to a server which certificate can't be validated with the root certificates known to java programs.
Try: "git config --global http.sslverify false"

Thanks, that fixed it.  And now I can confirm that this change doesn't fix the "http protocol is not supported" problem.

the other way is to configure Java to trust the certificate created by mitmproxy
