DESCRIPTION

LockFile.commit: retry renaming

Currently the following can happen in LockFile.commit: deletion of the
original file succeeds but renaming fails afterwards. In this case the
original file (e.g. branch file in refs/heads) is lost.
To workaround the issue the same retry logic as for file deletion is
applied to file renaming.
