DESCRIPTION

Add constructors that take Throwable to ServiceMayNotContinueException.

ServiceMayNotContinueException usually wraps an underlying exception.
Add convenience constructors that take Throwable. In the case a
string is not provided, the message defaults to "internal server error",
since it may be reported to the client.
