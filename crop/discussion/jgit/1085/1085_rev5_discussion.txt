DESCRIPTION

Create FileHeader from DiffEntry

Added support for converting DiffEntrys to FileHeaders. FileHeaders
are DiffEntrys with a buffer containing the diff output as well as
a list of HunkHeaders. The HunkHeaders contain EditLists. The
createFileHeader(DiffEntry) method in DiffFormatter performs a Myers
Diff on the files refered to by the DiffEntry, then puts the returned
EditList into a single HunkHeader, which is then put into the
FileHeader to be returned. It also generates the appropriate diff
header an puts it into the FileHeader's buffer. The rest of the diff
output, which would normally be parsed to generate the HunkHeaders,
is not generated. In fact, the purpose of this method is to avoid
the costly diff output generation and parsing normally required to
create a FileHeader.
