DESCRIPTION

Create FileHeader from DiffEntry

Added support for converting DiffEntrys to FileHeaders. FileHeaders
are DiffEntrys with a buffer containing the diff output as well as
a list of HunkHeaders. The HunkHeaders contain EditLists. The
createFileHeader(DiffEntry) method in DiffFormatter performs a Myers
Diff on the files refered to by the DiffEntry, then puts the returned
EditList into a single HunkHeader, which is then put into the
FileHeader to be returned. It also generates the appropriate diff
header an puts it into the FileHeader's buffer. The rest of the diff
output, which would normally be parsed to generate the HunkHeaders,
is not generated. In fact, the purpose of this method is to avoid
the costly diff output generation and parsing normally required to
create a FileHeader.

Line:525, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> This new method should have a unit test.

Line:528, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> s/It it/It is/

Line:537, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> When can this be thrown?

Line:541, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Instead of "UTF-8" use Constants.CHARSET.

Line:542, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Don't initialize this here, it increases the chances that we would forget to set the return value from MyersDiff.

Instead just declare the variable as final, and initialize it in each of the arms below of the conditional statements.  Its only 2 locations, and the compiler can prove that we have set it for each of the different conditions.
