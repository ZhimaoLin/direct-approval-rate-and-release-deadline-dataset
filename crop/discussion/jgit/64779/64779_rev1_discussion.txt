DESCRIPTION

TreeWalk: Remove CorruptObjectException from addTree(AbstractTreeIterator)

This form of addTree() does not parse any objects and cannot throw the
declared checked exception.  Callers are being forced to try-catch
CorruptObjectException that cannot occur when the iterator instance
has already been constructed.
