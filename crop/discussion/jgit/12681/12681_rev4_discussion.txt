DESCRIPTION

Support refspecs with wildcard in middle (not only at end)

The following refspec, which can be used to fetch GitHub pull requests,
is supported by C Git but was not yet by JGit:

  +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*

The reason is that the wildcard in the source is in the middle.

This change also includes more validation (e.g. "refs//heads" is not
valid) and test cases.

Patch Set 4:

Can we get this into 3.0? The comments by Shawn in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/12516/ were addressed and the class has more test coverage than before this change.

It would be nice to have in 3.0 as GitHub is quite popular and automatically fetching pull requests is a very nice feature.
