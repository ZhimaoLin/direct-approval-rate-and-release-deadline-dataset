DESCRIPTION

Clone: add --recurse-submodules option

Add the --recurse-submodules option on the command, which causes
submodules to also be initilialzed and updated.

The API does not provide back details of the submodule clone progress,
so the output of the command is limited in comparison to the cgit
implementation.

I had another look at CloneCommand. I think we could add a FetchCallback interface:

 public interface FetchCallback {
         public void fetched(Repository repo, FetchResult res);
 }

* add a setFetchCallback(FetchCallback) to CloneCommand
* pgm.Clone should then implement this interface and set it on CloneCommand
* CloneCommand.call() would then call the registered callback
* this would enable Clone to access FetchResult including submodule FetchResults to improve its output
