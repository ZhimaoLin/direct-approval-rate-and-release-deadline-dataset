DESCRIPTION

Fix DirCache.isModified()

Change I61a1b45db2d60fdcc0f87373ac6fd75ac4c4a202 fixed a possible NPE
occurring for newly created repositories - but in that case a wrong
value (false = not modified) was returned.

If a current version of the index file exists (liveFile), but there is
no snapshot, this means that there have been modifications (i.e. true
has to be returned).
