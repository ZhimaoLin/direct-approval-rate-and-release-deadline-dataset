Looks good. The legal statement is missing (I am the author...).

Line:6, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> We don't add a copyright line for what is ostensibly less than 1 line of code added to the class. If we did that I think we would have a longer copyright notice than executable code.

Line:6, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This is mandatory unless the copyright statement says something like,
Copyright (C) date, some guy/company and others.

The important part here being "others". If my copyright is not added then the statement is legally incorrect.

In the top-level Eclipse project we keep the copyright short, e.g.
Copyright (C) 2008-2012, Google Inc. and others.

And then list the contributors of real/bigger contributions along with what they fixed (bug number) in the "Contributors:" section.

Patch Set 2:

Can we move on with this? If you really want the copyright removed, I can upload a new version.
