DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Start implementation of a Rebase command

This is a first try to implement Rebase. At the moment, this does not
try to implement --continue and --skip, so if the first conflict is
found, the only option is to --abort the command.
--abort depends on a fix for DirCacheCheckout.

Bug: 328217
