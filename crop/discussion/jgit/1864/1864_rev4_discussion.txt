DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Start implementation of a Rebase command

This is a first try to implement Rebase. At the moment, this does not
try to implement --continue and --skip, so if the first conflict is found,
the only option is to --abort the command.
The --abort must still be re-implemented in order to succeed in case
of checkout conflicts.
