DESCRIPTION

Initial implementation of a Rebase command

This is a first iteration to implement Rebase. At the moment, this
does not implement --continue and --skip, so if the first
conflict is found, the only option is to --abort the command.

Looks good.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> shouldn't 'rebase-merge' be a constant somewhere?
