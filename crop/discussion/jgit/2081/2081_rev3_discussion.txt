DESCRIPTION

Implement rebase --continue and --skip

For --continue, the Rebase command asserts that there are no unmerged
paths in the current repository. Then it checks if a commit is needed.
If yes, the commit message and author are taken from the author_script
and message files, respectively, and a commit is performed before the
next step is applied.
For --skip, the workspace is reset to the current HEAD before applying
the next step.

Includes some tests and a refactoring that extracts Strings in the
code into constants.
