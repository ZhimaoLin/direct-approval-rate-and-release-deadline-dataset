DESCRIPTION

Refactor pattern construction in URIish

There are quite some bugs related to our URI parsing in class URIish (see list
of referenced bugs). When trying to solve those and understand our parsing I
detected that we need more documention on the patterns we are using and maybe a
refactoring on how we construct those. Also the detection of wrong URIish
when the URIish was a local file reference has to be enhanced.

I extracted String constants for nearly every interesting part of our pattern
and documented each part. To detect wrong local file references I had to use
different patterns for standard URIs, local file references, SCP URIs and those
URIs created by java.io.File.toURI.toString().

I added more tests for file:// URIs and for wrong ssh URIs.

Line:464, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> Please provide more specific method name. It seems to me this should fail due to extra ':' between hostname and the path, right?

Line:464, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> I just copied the proposed test from bug: 315571. But you are right, the name is not ok. I fixed it.
