DESCRIPTION

Refactored URI parsing to detect wrong URIs

There where quite some bugs regarding wrong URI parsing. In order
to solve them the parsing has to be refactored. We now have
specialized regexps for 'scheme://host/...', scp URIs and local
file names. Now we can detect problems while parsing 'git://host:/abc' which
was previously not possible.
