DESCRIPTION

Repository: Log negative useCnt message together with stack trace

The message "close() called when useCnt is already zero" is logged with
level warning, and then if debug logging is enabled, the stack trace is
logged separately with level debug.

Log the message and the stack trace in the same call, so that they always
appear together in the output rather than potentially interleaved with
other log statements.
