DESCRIPTION

Update SUBMITTING_PATCHES

It contained outdated information about attaching patches to bug
reports. Shorten it to the essentials.

Also format it using markdown and rename it to CONTRIBUTING.md, which is
a convention and doesn't include "patches" in the name.

Patch Set 2:

Done, better? I cut out the legal stuff as it's not very interesting and already handled by the CLA (legal side) and the contributor guide (code side).
