DESCRIPTION

Fix JGit CLI to follow native git's interpretation of http_proxy...

Native git (as many other tools) interprete the environment variables
http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, ... in a specific way. "http_proxy" has to be
lowercase while "https_proxy" can be lowercase or uppercase (means:
"HTTPS_PROXY"). lowercase has precedence. This can be looked up in
"ENVIRONMENT" section of [1]. Teach JGit CLI to behave similar.

Additionally teach JGit not to interprete the environment variables if
the java process was explicitly started with the system properties
telling JVM which proxy to use. A call like "http_proxy=proxy1 java
-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy2 ..." should use proxy2 as proxy.

Patch Set 1:

Here are the experiments I did with git 2.6.2 on Debian:

  > env | grep -i proxy
  > # test http
  > git clone http://localhost:8080/testInitialEmptyCommit && rm -fr testInitialEmptyCommit
  Cloning into 'testInitialEmptyCommit'...
  ...
  > # didn't went through proxy
  >
  > http_proxy=http://localhost:9080 git clone http://localhost:8080/testInitialEmptyCommit && rm -fr testInitialEmptyCommit
  Cloning into 'testInitialEmptyCommit'...
  ...
  > # went through proxy!
  >
  > HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:9080 git clone http://localhost:8080/testInitialEmptyCommit && rm -fr testInitialEmptyCommit
  Cloning into 'testInitialEmptyCommit'...
  ...
  > # didn't went through proxy
  >
  > # test https
  > git clone https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git && rm -fr dondalfi
  Cloning into 'dondalfi'...
  ^C
  > # didn't went through proxy
  >
  > https_proxy=http://localhost:9080 git clone https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git && rm -fr dondalfi
  Cloning into 'dondalfi'...
  ...
  > # went through proxy
  >
  > HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:9080 git clone https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git && rm -fr dondalfi
  Cloning into 'dondalfi'...
  ...
  > # went through proxy
  >
  > https_proxy=http://localhost:9090 HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:9080 git clone https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git && rm -fr dondalfi
  Cloning into 'dondalfi'...
  ...
  > # went through lowercase proxy
  >
  > http_proxy=http://localhost:9090 git clone https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git && rm -fr dondalfi
  Cloning into 'dondalfi'...
  ^C
  > # didn't went through proxy

Line:40, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ProxyConfigTest.java -> Are wildcard imports OK in this project?

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ProxyConfigTest.java -> Isn't it enough to declare Exception here?  An exception will fail the test, regardless of the specific type.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ProxyConfigTest.java -> Maybe write this in normal case, but suffix the method name with "UpperCase"?

Same in others below.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> L

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> interpret

Line:350, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> takes

Line:360, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> nit: add braces even around 1-liners

Line:366, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> nit: missing braces
