DESCRIPTION

Introduce AbnormalMergeFailureException for CherryPickCommand

In order to distinguish cherry-pick failures caused by conflicts vs.
'abnormal merge failures' (e.g. unstaged changes), a new exception
class is introduced that can be handled accordingly by callers. The
exception contains details on the 'abnormal failure', e.g. paths of
unstaged files.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why do we introduce that on the CherryPickCommand. It's an 
AbnormalMergeFailure ... so why don't we let MergeCommand throw
it. A cherry-pick will in the end also call mergeCommand and will
therefore also benefit from this new exceptions

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> You are right. But to be even more consistent with the other commands, I have now introduced a CherryPickResult class.
