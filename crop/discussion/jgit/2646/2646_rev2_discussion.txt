DESCRIPTION

Introduce CherryPickResult

In order to distinguish cherry-pick failures caused by conflicts vs.
'abnormal failures' (e.g. due to unstaged changes or a dirty
worktree), a CherryPickResult class is introduced and returned by
CherryPickCommand.call() instead of a RevCommit. This new class is
similar to MergeResult and RebaseResult. The CherryPickResult contains
all necessary information, e.g. paths causing the cherry-pick (a merge
called within, respectively) to fail. This allows callers to better
react on failures.
