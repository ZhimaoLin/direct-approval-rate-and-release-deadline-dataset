DESCRIPTION

Refactor and comment complicated if statements

When debugging and enhancing DirCacheCheckout.processEntry() I found
that some of if-statements where hard to read/understand. This
change just splits some long if statements and adds more comments
explaining in which state we are. This change is only a preparation
for followup commits which introduce checks for untracked+ignored
files.
