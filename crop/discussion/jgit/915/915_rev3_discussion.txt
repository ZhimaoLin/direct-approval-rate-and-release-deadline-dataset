DESCRIPTION

Refactor alternate object databases below ObjectDirectory

Not every object storage system will have the concept of alternate
object databases to search, and even if they do, they may not have the
notion of fast-access / slow-access split like we do within the
ObjectDirectory code for pack files and loose objects.

Push all of that down below the generic API so that it is a hidden
detail of the ObjectDirectory and its related supporting classes.
