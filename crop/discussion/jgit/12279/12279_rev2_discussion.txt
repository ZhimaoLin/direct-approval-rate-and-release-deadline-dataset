DESCRIPTION

Only fetch tags that do not exist locally with auto-follow

This corresponds to what C Git does, quoting from the fetch man page:

  This is done by first fetching from the remote using the given
  <refspec>s, and if the repository has objects that are pointed by
  remote tags that it does not yet have, then fetch those missing tags.

Before, JGit would also fetch tags that exist locally but point to a
different object, resulting in REJECTED results for these.

Also add some test cases to cover more cases.
