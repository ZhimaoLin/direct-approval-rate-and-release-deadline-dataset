DESCRIPTION

Add path hash code to ObjectWalk

PackWriter wants to categorize objects that are similar in path name,
so blobs that are probably from the same file (or same sort of file)
can be delta compressed against each other.  Avoid converting into
a string by performing the hashing directly against the path buffer
in the tree iterator.

We only hash the last 16 bytes of the path, and we try avoid any
spaces, as we want the suffix of a file such as ".java" to be more
important than the directory it is in, like "src".
