DESCRIPTION

Revert Jetty from 8.1.3.v20120416 to 7.6.0.v20120127

This reverts commit 24a0f47e32ab7cdf20c2201d7100599ea057f8a3 and
updates JGit dependencies to use the latest available Jetty 7.x
release. We can't use Jetty 8.x since it depends on Servlet API 3.0
which requires Java 6 but JGit still wants to support Java 5.
Use one of the target platforms defined in
Ibf67a6d3539fa0708a3e5dbe44fb899c56fbd8ed to work with that in Eclipse.
