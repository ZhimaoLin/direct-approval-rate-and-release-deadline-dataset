DESCRIPTION

debug-diff-algorithms: Real world performance test implementations

When working on a difference algorithm's implementation, its generally
more important to care about how it behaves on real-world inputs than
it does on fake inputs created for unit test cases.  Run each
implementation against a number of real-world repositories, looking at
changes between files in each commit.  This gives a better picture of
how a particular algorithm performs.

This test suite run against JGit and linux-2.6 with the current
available algorithms shows HistogramDiff always out-performs
MyersDiff, and by a wide margin on the linux-2.6 sources.  Since
histogram diff has similar properties as patience diff, the resulting
edits are probably also more human-readable.  These test results show
that HistogramDiff is a good choice for the default implementation.

We really needed this possibility to test diff-performance easily on real-world data. I like it. But took me some time to understand the printed data - so I suggested some clarification on the format of the output.

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> I suggest "Maximum size in KiB to scan per file revision". I was mislead in believing thats a limit on the whole testcase: when DiffAlgorithms has diffed int total that amount of  bytes he'll stop.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> That's a limit on the number of comparisons you'll do. If if the repo contains only 1 file we can reach this limit. I suggest "Number of file revisions to be compared"

Line:281, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> This prints as strange heading for the last two columns. I thought the columns titled with "N=" string will contain something related to N.
Here my suggestion:

		out.format("Compared bytes per file: min N=%d, max N=%d\n", minN,
				maxN);
		out.format("%-25s %12s ( %12s %12s )\n", //
				"Algorithm", "Time (ns)", "Time(ns) on", "Time(ns) on");
		out.format("%-25s %12s ( %12s %12s )\n", //
				"", "", "smallest file", "biggest file");
		out.println("-----------------------------------------------------");

Line:363, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> shouldn't this method be called 'included' ? I wrongly thought "include()" would include something somewhere.

Line:384, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> min and max are mini-/maximal because of N, not because of the runtime. Right?

Thanks for the comments, I'll upload a replacement in a few minutes.

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> Done

Line:384, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/DiffAlgorithms.java -> Yes, min/max are because of N and not running time.  I'll rename these fields to clarify that.
