DESCRIPTION

Include list of assume unchanged files in IndexDiff

which may want to decide if specific actions are allowed on a file.

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> I would prefer to not reformat this HTML list, its harder to read in the source.

The reason its not formatting right is because its invalid HTML.  If you change the list to be a proper list type, the Javadoc formatter will do the right thing:

  * <ul>
  * <li>added files</li>
  * <li>changed files</li>
  * <li>removed files</li>
  * </ul>

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Style-nit: I would insert a blank line before this line.

Line:289, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> None of these methods should export HashSet.  They should be exporting Set<String> instead in case we change our internal representation to be something else, e.g a TreeSet, or a custom Set implementation that uses a smaller storage and is easier to construct given the fact that we iterate names in path-order.

You can add it as HashSet<String> here if you then immediately follow up with a change that fixes all of these methods to return Set<String>.  (Or please do the reverse, insert a new commit that fixes the existing methods to return Set<String> and change this commit to return Set<String>.)

Line:289, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Thanks for pointing that out. I did the second thing you proposed and did first fix the existing methods.
