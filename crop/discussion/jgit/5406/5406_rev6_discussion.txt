Patch Set 6:

I tried again the latest Jetty stuff from here:

http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/jetty/updates/jetty-bundles-8.x/8.1.3.v20120416/Jetty-bundles-repository-8.1.3.v20120416.zip

and the good news is, is that now 'GitServletInitTest' always passes. However, when running all 'org.eclipse.jgit.http' tests it still stalls.


I then retried from scratch on my Windows 7 machine:
1. start with fresh workspace using latest 4.2 build (I20120514-1900)
2. clone JGit repo
3. fetch refs/changes/06/5406/6
4. import all Jetty projects from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/jetty/updates/jetty-bundles-8.x/8.1.3.v20120416/Jetty-bundles-repository-8.1.3.v20120416.zip
5. select 'org.eclipse.jgit.http' project and then Run As > JUnit Test (I used Oracle JRE 6_21)
==> hangs in org.eclipse.jgit.http.test.DumbClientSmartServerTest.testListRemote()
6. run DumbClientSmartServerTest.testListRemote() as JUnit Test
==> hangs
'GitServletInitTest' runs without problems.

I suspect that I'm missing some additional plug-ins, but have no clue which ones. What steps are you using, so that it works for you? It also blocks with disabled firewall. Another difference might be, that my locale is Swiss German.

Patch Set 6:

Once a while I see this in the console:

org.eclipse.jgit.errors.TransportException: http://127.0.0.1:56985/git/test1337075908350_0.git: cannot open git-upload-pack

Maybe the test tries to write where it can't (I have Windows UAC enabled).

Patch Set 6:

To run this in Eclipse I used the target platform defined in [1].
As soon as this is settled I'll also create a target platform for
JGit for those developers who are not interested in EGit.

It also worked for me when installing all JGit dependencies manually.
(As described in the contributor guide using the versions listed
in the target platform)

Still there is some platform related problem:
- patchset 5 worked on Ubuntu 12.04 (Both from Maven and Eclipse 4.2) for me but it seems it doesn't on Windows or Mac
- patchset 6 doesn't work when run on Linux from Maven, somehow the RecordingLogger doesn't seem to work in that environment which causes
GitServletInitTest.testInitUnderContainer_NoBasePath() to fail

any idea how to fix this ?

:-(
