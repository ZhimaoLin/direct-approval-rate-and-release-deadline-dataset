Patch Set 3:

I spent an afternoon with Christian on this problem, here what we found:
- this test doesn't fail on Mac both from maven and Eclipse
- on Linux it fails when run from maven but succeeds in Eclipse, the expected exception is thrown and its stacktrace printed to the shell running maven but RecordingLogger fails to capture this
- by instrumenting the implementation with println's we found that this seems to be caused by the fact that RecordingLogger doesn't capture the warning which should be caused by the ServletException thrown
- in order to test this change in Eclipse either install this jetty version into Eclipse or use the target platform matching your Eclipse version from change

- Christian is on the way to test this also on Windows
