DESCRIPTION

Add the ability to set a repository on GitCommand

In some cases when a repository is created as part of a
GitCommand (e.g., clone), we should create a setter for
setting a repository.

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/GitCommand.java -> I think this should not be static.

How should that work in a multi-threaded environment like e.g. Gerrit which is hosting many repositories ?

I don't think you need to set the repo field in the command during clone.  Instead it starts to sound like Clone and Init cannot be GitCommand types, because they don't always start out with a Repository.  But that might be OK, they can't be created by a Git type either because the Git type needs a Repository and we don't have one yet.
