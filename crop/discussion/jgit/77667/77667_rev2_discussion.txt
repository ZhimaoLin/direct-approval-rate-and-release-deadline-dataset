DESCRIPTION

Annotate Sets#of xxx@xxx.xxx to prevent heap pollution warning

This prevents the warning:

  Potential heap pollution via varargs parameter

The method doesn't do any casting of types that would cause the heap
pollution, so it should be safe to xxx@xxx.xxx

See [1] for information about this warning.
