DESCRIPTION

Reduce multi-level buffered streams in transport code

Some transports actually provide stream buffering on their own,
without needing to be wrapped up inside of a BufferedInputStream in
order to smooth out system calls to read or write.  A great example
of this is the JSch SSH client, or the Apache MINA SSHD server.
Both use custom buffering to packetize the streams into the encrypted
SSH channel, and wrapping them up inside of a BufferedInputStream
or BufferedOutputStream is relatively pointless.

Our SideBandOutputStream implementation also provides some fairly
large buffering, equal to one complete side-band packet on the main
data channel.  Wrapping that inside of a BufferedOutputStream just to
smooth out small writes from PackWriter causes extra data copies, and
provides no advantage.  We can save some memory and some CPU cycles
by letting PackWriter dump directly into the SideBandOutputStream's
internal buffer array.

Instead we push the buffering streams down to be as close to the
network socket (or operating system pipe) as possible.  This allows
us to smooth out the smaller reads/writes from pkt-line messages
during advertisement and negotation, but avoid copying altogether
when the stream switches to larger writes over a side band channel.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitAnon.java -> Inlining the construction of sIn and sOut here makes for very long lines, which are hard to read.  And they line wrap poorly by default in Eclipse's source code formatter.  So I went with this simple approach of:  declare them, then wrap them, and finally use them.
