DESCRIPTION

DfsFsck: run connectivity check pass exactly once

The simpler algorithm is to load all branch tips into an ObjectWalk
and run that walk exactly once.  This avoids redoing work related to
parsing and considering trees reused across side branches.

Move the connectivity check into its own helper method.  This moves it
left one level of identation, and makes it easier to fit the method's
logic with less line wrapping.

Add a "Counting objects..." progress monitor around this phase.  Its
what is used when a server receives a push and is also trying to
verify the client sent all required objects.

Patch Set 1:

Thanks for optimizing the fsck code, Shawn!

I was thinking of finding as many as missing objects if I do a walk from every tips while a single walk from all tips will report at most one missing object.
