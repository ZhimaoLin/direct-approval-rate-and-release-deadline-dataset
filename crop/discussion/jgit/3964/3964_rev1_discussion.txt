DESCRIPTION

Correct comment on CloneCommand.setRemote method.

The previous comment stated that the value set was used
to keep track of the branch in the remote repository
which was incorrect.

Updated the method comment to match the format used
for the PushCommand.setRemote and FetchCommand.setRemote
methods.
