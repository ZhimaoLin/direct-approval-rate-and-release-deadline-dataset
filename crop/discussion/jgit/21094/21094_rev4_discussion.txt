DESCRIPTION

Fix push to repo with non-fetched refs

When JGit uses bitmaps (which is the case after a gc), the push command
doesn't go through the code where MissingObjectExceptions are caught
for remote objects not found locally.

Fixed by removing earlier non-locally-found remote objects.

This was seen withing gerrit, see:

I changed slightly the test to make it closer to original bug, where the remote had just some additional refs, but the "interesting" branch was kept in sync.
I managed to get the test running, and it still fails as expected without the patch.

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommandTest.java -> This is now unused.  (The remote branch was created by the push refspec of refs/heads/*).

I'm pushing a patchset without the unused refs

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommandTest.java -> Yes, I missed the fact that git1 stayed on master, so master is the common branch (never mind that had it been test, the push would still have failed for not being fast-forward).
My point was that the bug appeared even for branches without a local equivalent, not only if the local equivalent was behind.

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommandTest.java -> Understandable. I'm all for the simplest case that still reproduces the issue. I just wanted to mention this was unnecessary, then. Once you push the new patch, I'll be happy to +1
