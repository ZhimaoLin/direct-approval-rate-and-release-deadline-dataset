DESCRIPTION

Fix push to repo with non-fetched refs

When JGit uses bitmaps (which is the case after a gc), the push command
doesn't go through the code where MissingObjectExceptions are caught
for remote objects not found locally.

Fixed by removing earlier non-locally-found remote objects.

This was seen withing gerrit, see:
