DESCRIPTION

Fix push to repo with non-fetched refs

When JGit uses bitmaps (which is the case after a gc), the push command
doesn't go through the code where MissingObjectExceptions are caught
for remote objects not found locally.

Fixed by removing earlier non-locally-found remote objects.

This was seen withing gerrit, see : https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2025

Any chance this change be reviewed and perhaps integrated?

I have a huge repository (4+gigabytes) and this bug prevents me from run GC.

Can we have a unit test also?

I wish I could provide a unit test, but I don't have a real Java development environment (and not enough time to set it up) : I could find the bug thanks to the exception stacktrace and a (significant) bit of reading the code, then javac a modified .java file and patch the .war (with 7zip) so that I have a working gerrit, but I'm unable to run unit tests, let alone write one...

Please, I don't want to know about such practices :)

Patch Set 1:

I'm looking at a way this could be tested via unit test.  PushProcessTest seems to be the right place, at least, probably close to the testPushResult().  The problem comes about since reproducing this bug requires either a data set where the remote has a commit and the local does not, or you delete an object locally and gc (which would be more of an integration test).  If anyone can think of a way to help stack the test data set in such a manner (SampleDataRepositoryTestCase?), I don't think this would be very hard at all to validate -- in fact, the testPushResult test fits almost perfectly -- aside from the preconditions.

Functionally, yes, I've been applying the patch locally to JGit and including it with our internal Gerrit builds, and so far (after about 5 months of use), it's worked without problems.  So, I'd consider the patch stable, but would see the benefit from a unit test to ensure we don't ever introduce a regression.
