DESCRIPTION

Fix push to repo with non-fetched refs

When JGit uses bitmaps (which is the case after a gc), the push command
doesn't go through the code where MissingObjectExceptions are caught
for remote objects not found locally.

Fixed by removing earlier non-locally-found remote objects.

Adds a unit test to ensure this does not regress.

Patch Set 2:

This should add the requested unit test.  Maybe more of an integration test, but it does break preceding the change in this patch, and is resolved by the patch as well.

Unfortunately, due to Eclipse commit validation rules, I had to reset the author, though.
