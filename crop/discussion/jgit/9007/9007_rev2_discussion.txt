DESCRIPTION

[RFC] archive: Switch to commons-compress as ZIP archiver

The Apache Commons Compress library provides a similar interface to
java.util.zip with some features not found in java.util.zip, including
support for inclusion of metadata (file mode and symlink targets) and
support for multiple file formats (zip, .tar.xz, etc).

Use it, in preparation for making use of these features.  No
functional change intended yet.

A previous version of this patch used plexus-archiver.  That is a
heavier-weight dependency and offers a less convenient interface.

Thanks to Talon Contreras and Malia Sampson for advice.
