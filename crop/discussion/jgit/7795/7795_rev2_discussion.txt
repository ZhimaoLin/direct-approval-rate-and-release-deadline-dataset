DESCRIPTION

Introduce "never" as parseable date

For configuration parameter like "gc.pruneexpire" we need to understand
the value "never". This should cause the parser to return null. All
users of the parser have to be adapted to handle null return values
correctly

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Robin, that's a proposal in your style with a fake Date value representing never. I can live with that (already not fully convinced it is better).
