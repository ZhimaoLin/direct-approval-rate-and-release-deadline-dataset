DESCRIPTION

Introduce "never" as parseable date

For configuration parameter like "gc.pruneexpire" we need to understand
the value "never". Never is handled as a date so far into the future
that it will never happen. The actual value currently used is the
constant GitDateParser.NEVER.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Robin, did you take over authorship intentionally or was it by mistake? At least a small also-by would be nice then.

That was a mistake. It seems EGit does such things....

That wasn't a "mistake" from my side. It's an old bug (362391) from the time someone refactored the commit dialog.
