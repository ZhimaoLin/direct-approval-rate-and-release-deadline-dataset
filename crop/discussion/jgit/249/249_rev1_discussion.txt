Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.feature/feature.xml -> This is JGit, are we sure we want to be using the egit/updates site?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.feature/feature.xml -> I thought we agreed to publish a joint update site : http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg00742.html
which is now published under http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates. Currently we haven't published another http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/updates

If we want to publish another additional update site for JGit only, we end up with 2 URLs here (1 for joint update site with EGit + JGit and another one with just JGit). I feel this could look rather confusing for users.
