DESCRIPTION

Refactor Repository into simpler more abstract class

The new Repository can be used as an interface. We did not
make it an interface in order not to break compatibility with
older code.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> nit: you added trailing whitespace inside of javadoc blocks.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why are we doing this? Its a rather large refactoring but you haven't explained the value of having Repository be more interface like than it already is.
