DESCRIPTION

Enhance Eclipse save actions

Add the following Eclipse save actions executed when saving modified
lines. This should help to reduce manual work needed to maintain a clean
and consistent code style:
- organize imports
- always use braces around blocks
- add missing annotations
  xxx@xxx.xxx including implementation of interface methods
  xxx@xxx.xxx
- remove
  - unused imports
  - unnecessary $NON-NLS$ tags
  - redundant type arguments

Patch Set 1:

There seems to be a couple of other settings added in the preferences.  I guess these are default values for new settings that were introduced in Eclipse since last time these were updated?

Is it worth mentioning that in the commit message?
