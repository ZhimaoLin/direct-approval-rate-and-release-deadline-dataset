DESCRIPTION

Make DirCacheCheckout update timestamps in the index.

This updates the timestamp of files that are not touched during
checkout. Otherwise the timestamp will always be zero, causing the
IndexDiffFilter to always calculate the checksum of file contents.

Line:336, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Great. I think you found it. Yes, here we are safe. We know that the file has the same content as the index. Now it should be safe to copy the files modification time to the index entry.

I would like not to change the keep signature this way. By telling keep() you say that you want this entry entry to be reused unmodified. But saying keep() and telling how you want to modify the entry looks strange. Could you instead simply update the index entry before you give it to keep()? Like

 DirCacheEntry entry = i.getDirCacheEntry();  
 if (f != null && e.getLastModified() == 0)
   e.setLastModified(f.getEntryLastModified());
 keep(entry);

You can then remove all your other modifications to keep() and keep()-callers.

What I ask myself: this doesn't explain that during a checkout without head (e.g. during rebase, clone, reset) we reach a state where all modification timestamps are 0. That is the initial problem and we should find out why.

Line:336, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> i agree. still i think this change (or better: the upcoming patchset) still makes sense in any case. just to be bullet proof, as in the bad case it fixes things, and in the good case it cost very (very very) little.
