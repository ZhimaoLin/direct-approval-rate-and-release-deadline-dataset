DESCRIPTION

Track read IO for DfsReader

Compute how much disk IO a DfsReader is performing, and how long the
sum of those operations took on this reader instance. Implementations
of DFS and interested applications can get the stats by calling the
new DfsReader.getIoStats() method at or after close().
