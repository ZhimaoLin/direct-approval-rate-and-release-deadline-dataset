DESCRIPTION

Remove deprecated Repository.mapTree

The mapTree() routines have been deprecated for a long time, and their
sibilings for mapCommit() and mapTag() were already removed from the
main Repository API.

Remove mapTree().  Application callers who only need the tree's name
can use resolve("^{tree}") syntax to resolve to the tree ObjectId, or
fail if the input is not a tree.

Applications that want to read a tree should use DirCache or TreeWalk.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

mapTree() is still used by EGit (org.eclipse.egit.core.op.CommitOperation.prepareTrees(IFile[], HashMap<Repository, Tree>, IProgressMonitor)) so I'll wait a bit on this...

Patch Set 1:

I uploaded EGit change I85726413790fc87721271c482f6636f81baf8b82 which removes the last usage of this method from EGit. When this is in, we can submit this, too.
