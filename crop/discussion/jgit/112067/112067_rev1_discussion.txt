DESCRIPTION

Performance improvement on writing a large index

The index header consist of a 4-byte version number. The current
supported version numbers are 2 and 3. The code checks if any entries
are extended. If it find any entries that are extended if picks version
'3', otherwise it chooses version '2'.


DirCache.java
-Changed the 'extended' check to exit early when any entry is considered
'extended' in the index.

(Of course, I maybe missing a bitwise optimization that the is made in
the Java bytecode.)
