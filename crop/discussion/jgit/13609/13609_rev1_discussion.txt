DESCRIPTION

Pick default archive format based on filename suffix

Introduce a setFilename() method for ArchiveCommand so callers can
specify the intended filename of the produced archive.  If the
filename ends with .tar, the format will default to tar; if .zip, zip;
if .tar.gz, gzip-compressed tar; and so on.

This doesn't affect "jgit archive" because it doesn't support the
--output=<file> option yet.  A later patch might do that.

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> i don't grok the second sentence

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> Can't you just say:
Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(".tar"));

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> I wanted to warn callers that they can't count on any particular behavior when suffixes overlap (e.g., if one format takes ".7z" and another takes ".tar.7z"). Clarified.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> Good catch.
