Style comment, otherwise looks good.

Also, could you please create a bug report and link the review and the bug? It's very useful for triaging.

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> This is a bit confusing (also the two initializations at the beginning). Could you rename the inner variable to something else, e.g. just `count` or `blockHashedCount`? Same for other method.

Robin, I've added "Bug:" to the commit message -- is this the expected way of linking the bugtracker with gerrit?

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Done
