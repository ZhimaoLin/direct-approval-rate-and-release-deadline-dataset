> Robin, I've added "Bug:" to the commit message -- is this the expected way of linking the bugtracker with gerrit?

Yes that's right, thanks Marc!

(We also add a link to the bug report pointing to Gerrit, so people finding the bug report know that someone is already working on it. I've done that now.)
