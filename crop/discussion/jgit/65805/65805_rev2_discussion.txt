Nice. fishywang@ ran into the same thing recently.

Line:154, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DiffCommand.java -> Could this sanity-check that oldTree and oldTreeish can't both be set? (I realize the setters enforce that --- I just mean future-proofing and documenting here.) E.g.

  if (oldTree != null && oldTreeish != null) {
    // The setter for each clears the other.
    throw new AssertionError(); 
  } else if (oldTree != null) {
    ...
  } else if (oldTreeish != null) {

Likewise in resolveNewTree.

Think I should also add String methods? On the one hand, people probably want them (certainly the one person who I just talked to). On the other hand, calling repo.resolve is a lot easier than constructing a new CanonicalTreeParser

No strong opinion. My instinct would be to just add an example that
does repo.resolve to the javadoc.

This was less work, so done.
