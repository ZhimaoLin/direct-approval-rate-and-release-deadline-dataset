DESCRIPTION

Add CHERRY_PICK_HEAD for cherry-pick conflicts

Add handling of CHERRY_PICK_HEAD file in .git (similar to MERGE_HEAD),
which is written in case of a conflicting cherry-pick merge.

It is used so that Repository.getRepositoryState can return the new
states CHERRY_PICKING and CHERRY_PICKING_RESOLVED. These states, as well
as CHERRY_PICK_HEAD can be used in EGit to properly show the merge tool.

Also, in case of a conflict, MERGE_MSG is written with the original
commit message and a "Conflicts" section appended. This way, the
cherry-picked message is not lost and can later be re-used in the commit
dialog.
