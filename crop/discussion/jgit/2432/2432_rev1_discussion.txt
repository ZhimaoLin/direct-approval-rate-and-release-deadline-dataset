DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Donate parsed commits to PackWriter

When UploadPack has computed the merge base between the client's have
set and the want set, its already loaded and parsed all of the
interesting commits that PackWriter needs to transmit to the client.
Switching the RevWalk and its object pool over to be an ObjectWalk
saves PackWriter from needing to re-parse these same commits from the
ObjectDatabase, reducing the startup latency for the enumeration
phase of packing.

UploadPack doesn't want to use an ObjectWalk for the okToGiveUp()
tests because its slower, during each commit popped it needs to cache
the tree into the pendingObjects list, and during each reset() it
discards a bunch of ObjectWalk specific state and reallocates some
internal collections.  ObjectWalk was never meant to be rapidly
reset() like UploadPack does, so its perhaps somewhat cleaner to allow
"upgrading" a RevWalk to an ObjectWalk.
