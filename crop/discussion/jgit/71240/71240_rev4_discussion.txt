DESCRIPTION

Scan loose ref before packed in case gc about to remove the loose

Before this change, jgit used to read packed-refs before scanning
loose refs. That was not a problem if gc didn't run concurrently. When
gc did run concurrently with such refs reading, that order sometimes
broke the latter. This lead to reading an older version of a ref's
tip, which meant "losing" the real tip or commit. The specific
read-Vs-gc concurrency scenario which broke reading that way follows:

1. let ref R be in packed-refs and R' be in loose
2. jgit starts reading packed-refs
3. gc also starts its business around that very time
4. jgit still has the time to read R from packed-refs
5. as gc is not done yet updating packed-refs with R'
6. jgit then starts scanning loose refs (or is about to)
7. gc quickly ends up being done moving loose R' to packed-refs
8. so gc (quickly) removes loose refs
9. -while jgit is scanning loose refs, now gone
10. so jgit assumes no loose to consider => packed-refs winning
11. so jgit wrongfully returns R (from 4.) as the tip, instead of R'.

This fix switches the order so loose refs are scanned (secured) before
taking the time to read packed-refs. This way, knowledge of the
likelier tip is guaranteed for ref reading to return the true tip
- despite concurrent gc. If there is no loose ref to scan, jgit reads
packed-refs and lands on R' (or S), which it then returns, as
expected. The gerrit issue [1] should be solved by this fix.
