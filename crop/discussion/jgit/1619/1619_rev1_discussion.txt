DESCRIPTION

Fix UnsupportedOperationException while fixing thin pack

If a thin pack has a large delta we need to be able to open
its cached copy from the loose object directory through the
CachedObjectDatabase handle.  Unfortunately that did not support the
openObject2 method, which the LargePackedDeltaObject used directly
to bypass looking at the pack files.
