DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediately evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because pack files and
references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repository from the caches until
last use of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is
handled by a background task running periodically.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Line:271, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCacheTest.java -> The last sleep, for the last loop iteration when t=2^10, doesn't make sense
as the loop will exit immediately after that that the fail(..) will be invoked.

We should swap the order: first sleep then check.
