DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediately evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because pack files and
references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repository from the caches until
last use of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is
handled by a background task running periodically.
