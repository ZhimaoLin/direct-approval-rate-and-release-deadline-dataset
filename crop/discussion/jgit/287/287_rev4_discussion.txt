DESCRIPTION

Refactor SideBandOutputStream to be buffered

Instead of relying on our callers to wrap us up inside of a
BufferedOutputStream and using the proper block sizing, do the
buffering directly inside of SideBandOutputStream.  This ensures
we don't get large write-throughs from BufferedOutputStream that
might overflow the configured packet size.

The constructor of SideBandOutputStream is also beefed up to check
its arguments and ensure they are within acceptable ranges for the
current side-band protocol.
