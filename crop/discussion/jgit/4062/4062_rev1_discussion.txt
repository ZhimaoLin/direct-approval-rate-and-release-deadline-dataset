Line:177, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> to make it consistent with the other comments on other methods I agree.

What's your opinion: wouldn't it be more precise if we would call it "... the tree we want to checkout"? In this case we should of course modifiy it in several places in this file.
