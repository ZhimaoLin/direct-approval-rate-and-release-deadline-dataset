Line:242, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> The method you call is meant to create a folder containing the data of a repository. But here you just want to create a folder.

You could split the method createUniqueTestGitDir into two parts: 
- one which creates a folder
- one which creates a git dir and which calls the other
