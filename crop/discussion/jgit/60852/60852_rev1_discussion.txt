DESCRIPTION

Do not use search path to find refs/stash

The stash ref maintained by "git stash" is at refs/stash, not
refs/refs/stash or refs/heads/refs/stash.  Use exactRef to ensure that
commands that manipulate the stash are not confused if refs/stash does
not exist and a match later along the search path does.
