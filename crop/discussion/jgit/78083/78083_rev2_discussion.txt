Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> This is vague --- can it be made more precise? I don't have a better idea than

 /**
  * How strict to be about wildcards.
  *
  xxx@xxx.xxx 4.5
  */

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> This makes it sound like I can use multiple wildcards. Can it be made clearer by focusing on the use case?

 /**
  * Reject refspecs with an asterisk on the source side and
  * not the destination side or vice versa.  This is the mode
  * used by FetchCommand and PushCommand to create a one-to-one
  * mapping between source and destination refs.

  /**
   * Allow refspecs with an asterisk on only one side. This

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> Done, originally I thought this is ok as in the future we may allow multiple wildcards, but then we can still adapt this text. I just took your suggestions now.
