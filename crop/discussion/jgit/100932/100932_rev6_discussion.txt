DESCRIPTION

Separate RefUpdate.Result.REJECTED_{MISSING_OBJECT,OTHER_REASON}

ReceiveCommand.Result has a slightly richer set of possibilities, so it
makes sense for RefUpdate.Result to have more values in order to match.
In particular, this allows us to return REJECTED_MISSING_OBJECT from
RefUpdate when an object is missing.

The comment in RefUpdate#safeParse about expecting some old objects to be
missing is only applicable to the old ID, not the new ID. A missing new
ID is a bug or programmer error, and we should not update a ref to point
to one.

Fix various tests that started failing because they depended for no good
reason on setting refs to point to nonexistent objects; it's always easy
to create a real object when necessary.

It is possible that some downstream users of RefUpdate.Result might
choose to handle one of the new statuses differently, for example by
providing a more user-readable error message; that is not done in this
change.
