DESCRIPTION

Fail RefUpdate with REJECTED when object is missing

The comment in safeParse about expecting some old objects to be missing
is only applicable to the old ID, not the new ID. A missing new ID is a
bug or programmer error, and we should not update a ref to point to one.

This requires handling this case specially in BatchRefUpdate, since, it
assumes that a REJECTED result from RefUpdate means
REJECTED_OTHER_REASON.

Fix various tests that started failing because they depended for no good
reason on setting refs to point to nonexistent objects; it's always easy
to create a real object when necessary.
