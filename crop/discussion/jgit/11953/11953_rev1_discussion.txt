DESCRIPTION

Rescale "Compressing objects" progress meter by size

Instead of counting objects processed, count number of bytes added
into the window. This should rescale the progress meter so that 30%
complete means 30% of the total uncompressed content size has been
inflated and fed into the window.

In theory the progress meter should be more accurate about its
percentage complete/remaining fraction than with objects. When
counting objects small objects move the progress meter more rapidly
than large objects, but demand a smaller amount of work than large
objects being compressed.
