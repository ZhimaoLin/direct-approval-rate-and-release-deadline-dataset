Patch Set 3:

Why do we need two implementations?

We use FS to give one interface where the JDK has two or more ways (or none) of doing what we want. 

In this case why don't we just use the "Java5" version without going through FS?

Patch Set 3:

I'd much rather use what's in the JDK rather than a custom implementation. I did reimplement it in order to have something compatible with the JDK5, but I still think it would be more desirable to switch to the core implementation when it is available (java.nio.file.FileSystem#getPathMatcher() from Java 7 onward).

I can remove this if you think using the custom implementation in all cases is preferable...
