DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first basic implementation that displays current branch and
list of files of various status, but isn't as refined as its native
counterpart (e.g. does not say if we're ahead or behind the remote).
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.

Patch Set 4:

One more thing: C Git lists all changes-to-be-committed files ordered by file name rather than status.

Patch Set 4:

Made the output more C Git like. Removed the count...

Re-ordererd the files by name first.

I think we also need a CQ, due to the size of the patch. We'll do that once everbody is happy.
