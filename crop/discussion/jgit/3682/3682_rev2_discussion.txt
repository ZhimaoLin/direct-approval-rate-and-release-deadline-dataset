DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first basic implementation that displays current branch and
list of files of various status, but isn't as refined as its native
counterpart (e.g. does not say if we're ahead or behind the remote).
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.
Note that changes to CLIText.properties are not mingled with other
lines, as to preserve alphabetical order, but are kept together because
some padding alignment needs to be done across some of them. If later
on one needs to change a label, other labels will need to be changed
accordingly so that padding is respected.
Changes to CLIText.java are also kept together. It's less important to
keep them together in that file, but did so just because I kept them
together in the twin properties file.

Patch Set 2:

Ok, now it's pushed to master. I used stable-1.3 before because I had a few pb with master some days ago, and saw that stable-1.3 was merged to master from time to time. Also egit planning page says v2.1 will be based on 3.8 minimum, so I (wrongly) assumed v2.0 would perhaps require some eclipse 3.8 development code.
I'll create a unit test a bit later. This patch set at least validates the workflow on my side (maven3, artifactory, gerrit via mylyn review).

As a self-employed freelance I'm the sole writer and owner of this code, and hereby donate it to eclipse under EDL.

The padding doesn't work and it attempt to pad at the beginning rather than at then end. Some extra empty lines and untracked files are missing to match C Git output.

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Status.java -> My guess is that even the "#" part should be localized.

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Status.java -> AFAIK, These lists are alway non-null. So you don't need a null check.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Status.java -> Don't fix now, since all other commands mostly are wrong, but maybe we should make all pgm commands use the Git quoting rules.

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> This hurts my eyes. Left align and pad between key and '=' instead..

I'd also prefer a longer key name since these texts are so very context specific.

You should match C Git better. This includes padding after the ":". It also appears your current padding isn't honored at all. Spaces around they key and = are ignored.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add an empty line for new paragraphs.

I've reworked the text strings and added a test case. See next patch set.
