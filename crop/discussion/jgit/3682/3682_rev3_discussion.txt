DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first basic implementation that displays current branch and
list of files of various status, but isn't as refined as its native
counterpart (e.g. does not say if we're ahead or behind the remote).
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.

Note that changes to CLIText.properties are not mingled with other
lines, as to preserve alphabetical order, but are kept together because
some padding alignment needs to be done across some of them. If later
on one needs to change a label, other labels will need to be changed
accordingly so that padding is respected.

Changes to CLIText.java are also kept together. It's less important to
keep them together in that file, but did so just because I kept them
together in the twin properties file.

The untracked files are not shown by default.

Untracked files are indented too much.

Add the extra empty lines JGit has,

The set of untracked files listed is not the same as
shown by git. Maybe we should fix that is IndexDiff instead

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> The notes on alignment seems not apply anymore

See patch set #4
Regarding the listing of untracked files being different from git, I'm not sure I can do anything. As you said, it's probably in IndexDiff that a fix need to be applied. Plus I haven't noticed this so a proper bug report with test case would be a good starting point for this.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
