DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first basic implementation that displays current branch and
list of files of various status, but isn't as refined as its native
counterpart (e.g. does not say if we're ahead or behind the remote).
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.
