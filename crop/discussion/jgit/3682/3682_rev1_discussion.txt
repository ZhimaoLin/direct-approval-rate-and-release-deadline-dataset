DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first simple implementation.
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.
Note that changes to CLIText.properties are not mingled with other
lines in order to respect alphabetical order.
If that's really important we can certainly apply sorting to my changes.
However it's nice to keep them together because some padding alignment
needs to be done across some of them. If later on one needs to change a
label, other labels will need to be changed accordingly so that padding
is respected.
Changes to CLIText.java are also kept together. It's less important to
keep them together in that file, but did so just because I kept them
together in the twin properties file.
Finally, it would be nice to also print the current branch like native
'git status'. However being new to git/egit/jgit I wasn't sure of
certain corner cases (headless state, etc.) so I preferred not adding
that feature. I'm sure someone else can easily add this.

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Status.java -> add status.getConflicting() as 'unmerged'?

The code in change I8d2b108c89905c3f0496f3d517879596740787c0 would help for displaying branch status.

I pushed a new version of this change.
Unfortunately, due to some difficulties when migrating my gerrit user to the new eclipse git/gerrit server, pushing it again gave it a new home: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5765/ ChangeId is still the same though...

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- you ended up with a new change since you pushed it to refs/for/stable-1.3
- I propose you abandon the new change as stable-1.3 is closed anyway so we can't accept this change on branch stable-1.3

- then rebase this change onto the current origin/master since this is based on a very old version of jgit
- add some tests to ensure this creates the same output as the parts of native git's status command you are implementing here, have a look at the new project org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test this should help to make this an easy task

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> - use a more robust way to achieve correct formatting, also this doesn't allow translation to other languages, so instead use MessageFormat.format() to achieve proper formatting.
- I would prefer to keep this file sorted
- currently the output doesn't match the one from native git
