DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first basic implementation that displays current branch and
list of files of various status, but isn't as refined as its native
counterpart (e.g. does not say if we're ahead or behind the remote).
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.

See comment on TextBuiltin.java

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/TextBuiltin.java -> Actually, in what way does this change relate to adding a new status command? 
Because this change affects all other CLI commands perhaps it deserve its own separate commit.
Anyway, just making sure this change landed here voluntarily and not as a result of mingling with another context...
