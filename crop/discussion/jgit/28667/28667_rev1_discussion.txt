DESCRIPTION

Retry connecting to SshSession in case of an exception

Connecting to an SshSession may fail due to different reasons. Jsch for 
example often throws an com.jcraft.jsch.JschException: verify: false.[1]
The issue is still not fixed in JSch 0.1.51.
 
In such a case it is worth retrying to connect. 

Two retries should be sufficient.
