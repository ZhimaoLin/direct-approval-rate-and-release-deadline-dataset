DESCRIPTION

PushConnectionTest#limitCommandBytes: Increase maxCommandBytes

A higher limit is required to account for proper JGit version number
being sent in the UserAgent.

The version string "4.7.0.201704031717-r" is 20 characters, however
the strings used during development are shorter:

- When running from mvn, "4.7.0.qualifier" is used; 15 characters
- When running in Eclipse, "unknown" is used; 7 characters

All the tests passed.  It seems to have failed with a timeout after (or during?) signing the jars.
