DESCRIPTION

Rescale writing progress monitor as KiBs to write

Instead of reporting progress as number of objects to be written
into the output pack, use the kibibytes expected in the final pack
as the unit. This scales the percentage meter better, allowing
users to more accurately judge when GC will finish the writing step.

Objects being reused as-is are estimated by their currently stored
size, as the bytes are simply copied with no translation. This has
the most accurate impact on the estimate but is not always available.

Whole objects considered for delta compression get estimated using
their fully inflated size. This over-estimates the progress bar.

Deltas that are not cached are also estimated using the inflated
size of the delta commands, which also sets the worst case much
further than reality.

Because everything is an estimate it is possible for the packer to
overshoot that report >100% progress. Some clients that implement
ProgressMonitor may not like this.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Given how this overshoots or underestimates, it needs some rework to try and get a better estimate before submitting.

Abandoned

This is hard to get right, so I'm going to abandon it.
