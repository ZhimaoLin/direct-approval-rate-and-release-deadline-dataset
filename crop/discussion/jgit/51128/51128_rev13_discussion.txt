DESCRIPTION

Store push certificates in refs/meta/push-certs

Inspired by a proposal from gitolite[1], where we store a file in
a tree for each ref name, and the contents of the file is the latest
push cert to affect that ref.

The main modification from that proposal (other than lacking the
out-of-git batching) is to append xxx@xxx.xxx to filenames, which allows
storing certificates for both refs/foo and refs/foo/bar. Those
refnames cannot coexist at the same time in a repository, but we do
not want to discard the push certificate responsible for deleting the
ref, which we would have to do if refs/foo in the push cert tree
changed from a tree to a blob.

The xxx@xxx.xxx syntax is at least somewhat consistent with
gitrevisions(7) xxx@xxx.xxx describe operators on ref names.

As we cannot (currently) atomically update the push cert ref with the
refs that were updated, this operation is inherently racy. Kick the can
down the road by pushing this burden on callers.
