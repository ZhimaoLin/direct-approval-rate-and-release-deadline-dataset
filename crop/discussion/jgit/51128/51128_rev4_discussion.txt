DESCRIPTION

RFC: Store push certificates in refs/push-certs

Loosely based on a proposal from gitolite[1], where we store a file in
a tree for each ref name, and the contents of the file are all push
certificates affecting that ref. Unlike the gitolite proposal, store
the entire push cert, so we have the full payload available for
after-the-fact GPG verification.

Patch Set 4:

This has the serious issue that, like reflogs, we can't store values for both refs/foo and refs/foo/bar. For reflog this is ok (well, at least was historically ok), but if we want an audit log of accepted push certs, it's really not ok here.

I think we need to come up with a different format :(
