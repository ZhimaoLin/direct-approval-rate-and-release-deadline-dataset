DESCRIPTION

Don't create .git/branches and .git/remotes folders on init.

For historical reasons JGit was creating .git/branches and
.git/remotes folders on initialization of an empty repository.
However, these folders are never used and the new Git
repository format doesn't contain them.  Removed the
unnecessary folder creation.

Latest git master creates these directories (see the templates directory). So the motivation is partially wrong.

Long ago, in a time far away from the present, git versions all of
the planet created the branches folder to be compatible with the
most ancient of git tools, Cogito.

When that portion of JGit was written, C Git created branches,
and Cogito was still in active use.  So, we created branches too.

Almost two years ago (has it been that long?) Pasky put Cogito
up for sale and stopped maintaining the project.  Since then the
branches folder must have been removed from C Git's init routine,
and JGit just didn't catch up.

Yes.

Yup.  I don't think JGit even honors remotes from .git/remotes,
I think we require the newer-style config based remotes.

I will add Shawn as the reviewer for this change to get
his opinion again.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This directory has to stay.

The recent discussion on the Git mailing list has brought out the fact that Git has promised prominent kernel maintainers that this directory will stay, as it is part of their workflow.

Please edit your patch to insert it back.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This directory can be safely removed.  It was removed from C Git in 75c384efb52d0e3eb1e8c2f53668b4066fe6a8d6 ("Do not create $GIT_DIR/remotes/ directory anymore") by Junio C Hamano on Dec 19 2006.  C Git hasn't made it for almost 3 years, time for JGit to stop.
