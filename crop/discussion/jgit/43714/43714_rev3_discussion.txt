Patch Set 3:

Interesting. I don't recall changing any IDE settings, but it does compile for me in Eclipse. Anyhow, I don't see how it would compile without the package import, even using another build system...?

In order to see the additional problems you should have installed an API baseline (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Checking_for_JGit_API_Changes_using_API_Baseline).
Maybe you have silenced API tooling in your eclipse.

It does compile with maven even without your fix. Otherwise our automated builds would have detected this bug before.
I guess the reason is that the pom.xml already contains the needed dependency. Yes, it's a shame that we have two parallel ways how we define dependencies. See Matthias commit c18694e0 where he added slf4j and had to do that in pom.xml and MANIFEST.MF in parallel.

Try this out:
  
  > git checkout d1bda470d4      # That's the commit before your fix
  HEAD is now at d1bda47... Merge "ArchiveCommand: Allow to pass options to underlying stream"
  > mvn clean install -DskipTests
