DESCRIPTION

Revert Ie48d6556

This was a mistake that was missed due to historical reasons.

"The first /r/ tells our Apache to redirect the request to Gerrit.
The second /r/ tells Gerrit that the thing following is a Git SHA-1
and it should try to locate the changes that use that commit object.
Nothing I can easily do about it now. The second /r/ is historical
and comes from Gerrit 1.x days."
