DESCRIPTION

Add new method to get commit message without footer paragraph

Sometimes, we want to trim the commit message without the footers.
Footers are important for Gerrit, also clarify the definition of the
footers as follows:

* Footers have to be in their own paragraph, cannot share with the
subject paragraph.
* A paragraph is considered as a footer paragraph if and only if it
contains at least one well formed key:value pair.
* Only the last footer paragraph will considered.

Patch Set 3:

See find_trailer_start in https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/+/master/trailer.c for Git's equivalent to this.

Its definition is

 Get the start of the trailers by looking starting from the end for a
 blank line before a set of non-blank lines that (i) are all
 trailers, or (ii) contains at least one Git-generated trailer and
 consists of at least 25% trailers.

Could JGit use a similar definition?

Patch Set 3:

So any paragraph that satisfy either of the two conditions is considered as trailer.

I am concerned that if there are two Change-Id in two separate paragraph will confuse Gerrit.

No, only the final paragraph is eligible.

Sorry for the unhelpful message.  This change was abandoned automatically by a script, and due to operator error the correct message was not added.

It should have read:  "Abandoning after 3 months of inactivity.  If this change is still needed, please restore it."
