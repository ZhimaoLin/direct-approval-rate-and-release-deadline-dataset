concatenating different segments to a big String. Introduce
String constants for these segements and document them.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> typo: s/parts/paths/

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> - why "and ~username" ?
- I think semantically it doesn't make much sense to say that a host may contain user/password and port.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> previously we had some special constructs for scheme://host/~username/path . This is not needed anymore. So I will remove the '~username' reference from this javadoc.

I'll also reword the part saying that a host 'contains' user/pwd,... etc.
