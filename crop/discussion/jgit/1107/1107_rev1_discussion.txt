DESCRIPTION

Refactor ObjectToPack's delta depth setting

Long ago when PackWriter is first written we thought that the delta
depth could be updated automatically.  But its never used.  Instead
make this a simple standard setter so the caller can more directly
set the delta depth of this object.  This permits us to configure a
depth that takes into account more than just the depth of another
object in this same pack.
