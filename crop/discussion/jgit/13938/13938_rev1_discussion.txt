DESCRIPTION

Remove fix-headers and rewrite-history

These scripts were created to bootstrap the initial contribution for
Eclipse using information from the pre-Eclipse history. We are well
past the point where the project will rewrite history in order to
correct copyright statements, so these tools no longer make sense
to keep in the tip of the tree.
