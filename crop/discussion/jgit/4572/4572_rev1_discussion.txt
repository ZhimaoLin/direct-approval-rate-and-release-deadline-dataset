DESCRIPTION

DfsBlockCache: Fix NPE when evicting empty cell

The cache starts with a single empty Ref that has no data, as the
clock list does not support being empty. When this Ref is removed,
the size has to be decremented from the associated DfsPackKey,
which was previously null. Make it always be non-null.
