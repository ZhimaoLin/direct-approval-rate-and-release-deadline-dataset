DESCRIPTION

MergeFormatter: Suppress warning about unchecked conversion

The warning can be fixed by adding a type to the argument, but doing so
breaks the API and previous attempts to fix it in that way [1, 2] were
reverted [3, 4].

Patch Set 2:

I think the test error is unrelated - the tests seem a bit flaky recently.

Can you retrigger the build?  (I had permission to do that before, but seem to have lost it).
