DESCRIPTION

dfs: Use special ForReverseIndex DfsStreamKey wrapper instead of derive

While implementing a custom subclass of DfsStreamKey it became obvious
the required derive(String) was making it impossible to construct an
efficient key in all cases.

Instead, use a special wrapper type ForReverseIndex around the INDEX's
own DfsStreamKey to denote the reverse index stream in the
DfsBlockCache.  This adds a smaller layer of boxing, but eliminates
weird issues for DFS implementors using specialized DfsStreamKey
implementations for space efficiency reasons.

Now that DfsStreamKey is reasonably light-weight, avoid allocating the
index and reverse index keys until necessary.  DfsPackFile mostly
holds the DfsBlockCache.Ref handle to the object, and only needs the
DfsStreamKey when its looking up the handle.

Line:317, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> pardon my ignorance, why can't we just call desc.getStreamKey(REVERSE_INDEX) to get the key?  Because there is no PackExt.REVERSE_INDEX?

Line:317, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Correct. The reverse index is not persisted to disk, so it has no PackExt constant.

Line:317, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Fair enough, we could insert a PackExt for REVERSE_INDEX on the fly, but this is performant enough
