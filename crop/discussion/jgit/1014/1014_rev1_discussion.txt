DESCRIPTION

Move DirCache factory methods to Repository

Instead of creating the DirCache from a static factory method, use
an instance method on Repository, permitting the implementation to
override the method with a completely different type of DirCache
reading and writing.  This would better support a repository in the
cloud strategy, or even just an in-memory unit test environment.
