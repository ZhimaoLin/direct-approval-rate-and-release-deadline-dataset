DESCRIPTION

Compute DiffEntry in the case of only one tree

For the first commit in a repository only one tree is available to compute
a DiffEntry. However, such a DiffEntry may be useful for showing a list
of added files together with their content.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Someone deeper in JGit should also have a look. The History view behaves nicely now!

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffEntry.java -> Why do we need this?

Why not just add an EmptyTreeIterator to the TreeWalk in slot 0 inside of EGit?  Then you are comparing the initial commit to the empty tree, and everything magically falls out as added?

Its what I do inside of Gerrit Code Review for initial commits.  And it means I don't have to muck around with special corner cases like this inside of JGit.
