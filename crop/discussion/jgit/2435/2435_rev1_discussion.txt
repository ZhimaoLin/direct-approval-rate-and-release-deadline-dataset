DESCRIPTION

Remove quoting of command over SSH

If the command contains spaces, it needs to be evaluated by the remote
shell.  Quoting the command breaks this, making it impossible to run a
remote command that needs additional options.

Patch Set 1:

Wasn't there a reason to add quotes in the first place, but you discovered the rules weren't that simple?

Patch Set 1:

I thought we were supposed to quote... but some services that run their own SSH command filters (e.g. gitosis, gitolite, GitHub) didn't like having the git command names quoted.

It turns out CGit doesn't to do any quoting of the string supplied by the user. If quoting is required, the user must include it in the string they pass to CGit. Thus we shouldn't quote, at all, ever. Which is what this change does.
