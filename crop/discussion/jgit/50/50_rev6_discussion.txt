DESCRIPTION

client side smart HTTP

During fetch over http:// clients now try to take advantage of
the info/refs?service=git-upload-pack URL to determine if the
remote side will support a standard upload-pack command stream.
If so each block of 32 have lines is sent in one POST request,
prefixed by all of the 'want' lines and any previously discovered
common bases as 'have' lines.

During push over http:// clients now try to take advantage of
the info/refs?service=git-receive-pack URL to determine if the
remote side will support a standard receive-pack command stream.
If so, commands are sent along with their pack in a single HTTP
POST request.
