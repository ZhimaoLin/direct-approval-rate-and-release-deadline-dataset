DESCRIPTION

Smart fetch over HTTP: client side

Clients take advantage of the info/refs?service=git-upload-pack URL
to determine if the remote side will support a standard upload-pack
command stream.  If so each block of 32 have lines is sent in one
POST request, prefixed by all of the 'want' lines and any previously
discovered common bases as 'have' lines.
