DESCRIPTION

CloneCommand: Configure branch for rebase if autosetuprebase

The user's .gitconfig can contain "autosetuprebase" in the "branch"
section, with its value set to "remote" or "always". If that's the case,
C Git will configure the checked-out branch for rebase after clone.

For example, the following .gitconfig:

[branch]
        autosetuprebase = remote

will result in the following branch setup after clone:

[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
        rebase = true

With this change, JGit does the same.
