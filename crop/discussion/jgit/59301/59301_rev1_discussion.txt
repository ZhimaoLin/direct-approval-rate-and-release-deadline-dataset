DESCRIPTION

[performance] Make the bitmap commit selection revwalk more efficient

The inefficiency is caused by attempting to reuse the revwalk via repeated
reset()/markUninteresting() calls. On the MSM 3.10 Linux repository with an
existing bitmap index in the previous pack, the 1M commits with 2600+ branches
cause ~99% of the time in PackWriterBitmapPreparer.selectCommits() to be spent
in revwalk iteration, RevCommit.slowCarryFlags(), and the reset() call itself.
Replacing those calls with resetRetain(RevFlag.UNINTERESTING) reduced the
"Selecting commits (N/M)" phase from (2157 + 2327 + 2198)/3 = 2227 seconds to
(40 + 40 + 40)/3 = 40 seconds.

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> Please split the cleanup into a separate change from the functional change.

That would make the functional change easier to understand, since it would be a ~3-liner.
