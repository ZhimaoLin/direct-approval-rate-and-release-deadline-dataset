DESCRIPTION

Allow ObjectWalk to be filtered by an arbitrary predicate

This will make it possible to declare a collection of objects as
ineligible for the walk en masse, for example if they are known to be
uninteresting via a bitmap.

NEEDSWORK: This version of the change introduces the API but doesn't
implement it yet, so I can get early review.

Be interesting to see how much this negatively impacts the classical Counting ... phase of a packer when bitmaps are not available. The virtual dispatch for ObjectFilter.ALL is not free.

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> I would say no. If you want to filter commits use RevFilter?

Line:271, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> Document that if the filter returns false for a tree, the recursive children of that tree will not be considered by the ObjectWalk.

Line:281, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> nit: we now mostly avoid final in small methods

Line:286, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> obviously this will go away :)

Line:303, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> Probably want to add the filter here:

  if (objectFilter.include(this, r.getTree())
    pendingObjects.add(r.getTree());

Line:334, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> and here:

  if (!objectFilter.include(this, idBuffer))
    continue;

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> Agreed. I misremembered what RevFilter does. It's not actually analagous.

I'm tempted to call it

 void markUninterestingForObjectWalk(Set<AnyObjectId>);

That's not perfect, either, since markUninteresting recursively marks all referenced objects uninteresting --- here, we avoid adding referenced objects to the queue but if they are reached through another path then they are not filtered out.

With appropriate documentation that might be okay.
