DESCRIPTION

Allow ObjectWalk to be filtered by an arbitrary predicate

This will make it possible to declare a collection of objects as
ineligible for the walk en masse, for example if they are known to be
uninteresting via a bitmap.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

I want to look at the perf difference of this being here vs. not on a stock example like the Linux kernel, but I think the code is correct.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

This doesn't seem to negatively impact the kernel's counting, so I think its OK to move forward with it.
