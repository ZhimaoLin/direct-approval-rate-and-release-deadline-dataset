DESCRIPTION

Allow ObjectWalk to be filtered by an arbitrary predicate

This will make it possible to declare a collection of objects as
ineligible for the walk en masse, for example if they are known to be
uninteresting via a bitmap.

NEEDSWORK: This version of the change introduces the API but doesn't
implement it yet, so I can get early review.
