DESCRIPTION

Fix "remote: Counting objects: ..." formatting

Trailing whitespace is usually removed in properties files so
JGitText did not supply a space between : and the remote message.
Ensure the space exists at runtime by reading the localized string
and appending a space if it is missing.

Messages should be dynamically fetched and not held in a static
class variable, as they can be changed using thread locals.
