DESCRIPTION

Test that we can create a symlink before the target is created

According to Win32 API, you need to specificy whethere a symlink
points to a file or directory. These tests suggests a symlink created
for a file, can actually point to a directory. We can alos create the
link before the target exists, so at least in this respect Windows
symbolic links appears to work as POSIX links.
