DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support

This change is targetted specifically for storing repositories securely in
Amazon S3.
The basic code  has been implemented according to this stackoverflow
answer http://stackoverflow.com/q/992019 with few modifications.
AES cipher used : AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
This code expects the user to set these properties in the file.
accesskey: <AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
secretkey: <AWS_SECRET_KEY>
acl: <public|private>
crypto.algorithm: <AES|PBEWithMD5AndDES>
password: <PASSWORD_FOR_ENCRYPTION>
crypto.keylength: <KEY_LENGTH> #For AES Encryption only. Default 128.

Note: For using strong encryptions Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files needs to be installed
properly.

List of changes:
1. Adding class AesEncryption in WalkEncryption.java
   Constructor:
      * Create SecretKey given password and salt using PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1
   Encrypt:
      * Embedd IV in output stream to be stored along with the file.
      * Encrypt and store the rest of message
   Decrypt:
      * Extract IV and initialize the cipher
      * Decrypt the rest of the file
2. Modified AmazonS3.java to handle AES encryption

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> better don't hide these exceptions. I would do like ObjectEncryptionV2 where they have the same situation as here but they always "throw error(e)". The same is true also in decryt()

Line:203, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> Don't you want to validate that the stream is ok and check that you received 3 ':'? Same two lines below

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> please remove the trailing whitespace

Line:265, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> no need to to say equalsIgnoreCase. Simply use equals. Also in the next two occurrences.

Line:277, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> please remove debug statements and then you can say "else if (cAlg..."

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> this could be simplified with use of PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256
family of SecretKeyFactory/AlgorithmParameters:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html

and Use the AlgorithmParameters from the encrypting Cipher:
