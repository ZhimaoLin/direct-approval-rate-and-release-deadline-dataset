Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfigTest.java -> Usually we put test folders under the project's "target" folder which is ignored since it contains maven build output in order to ensure that the source folders aren't polluted in case deletion fails.

- test output directory fixed
- testLeadingWhitespaces added which confirms that leading whitespaces are already correctly handled.
