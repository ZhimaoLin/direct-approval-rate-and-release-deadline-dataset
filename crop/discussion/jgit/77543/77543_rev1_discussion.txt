Line:498, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> No need to initialize, set in ctor. Make final?

Line:511, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> There is only a single ctor that always initializes lastModified, so what is the need for this?

Line:511, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> Avoid an O(N) scan for callers (most) that don't need this.
