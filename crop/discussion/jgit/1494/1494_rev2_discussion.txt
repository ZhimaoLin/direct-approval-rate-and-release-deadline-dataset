DESCRIPTION

Move ObjectDirectory streaming limit to WindowCacheConfig

IDEs like Eclipse offer up the settings in WindowCacheConfig to the
user as a global set of options that are configured for the entire
JVM process, not per-repository, as the cache is shared across the
entire JVM.  The limit on how much we are willing to allocate for
an object buffer is similar to the limit on how much we can use for
data caches, allocating that much space impacts the entire JVM and
not just a single repository, so it should be a global limit.
