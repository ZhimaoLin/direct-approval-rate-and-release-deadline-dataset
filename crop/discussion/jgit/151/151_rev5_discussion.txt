DESCRIPTION

Implement multi_ack_detailed protocol extension

The multi_ack_detailed extension breaks out the "ACK %s continue" status
code into "ACK %s common" and "ACK %s ready" states, making it easier to
discover which objects are truely common, and which objects are simply
on a chain the server doesn't care learning about.
