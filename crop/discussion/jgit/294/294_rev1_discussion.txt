DESCRIPTION

Fix TimeoutInputStreamTest, TimeoutOutputStreamTest assertions

If the build server is really busy, we might wait longer than 250 ms
before being interrupted, simply because one of our threads couldn't
be scheduled onto a CPU.  Don't make that cause a test failure.
Instead tolerate longer than expected waits, but not shorter waits.
