DESCRIPTION

ObjectDirectory: Remove last modified check in insertPack

GC explicitly handles the case where a new pack has the same name as an
existing pack due to it containing the exact same set of objects. In
this case, the pack passed to insertPack will have the same name as an
existing pack, but it will also almost certainly have a later mtime than
the existing pack.

The loop in insertPack tried to short-circuit when inserting a new pack,
to avoid walking more of the pack list than necessary. Unfortunately,
this means it will never get to the check for an identical name,
resulting in a duplicate entry for the same PackFile in the pack list.
Remove the short-circuit so that insertPack does not insert a duplicate
entry.

FYI, this is on stable-4.9 because we want to include this series on a stable Gerrit release branch, without forcing Gerrit to switch to JGit master. (If other JGit contributors think that's a bad idea, I can move this series to master.)
