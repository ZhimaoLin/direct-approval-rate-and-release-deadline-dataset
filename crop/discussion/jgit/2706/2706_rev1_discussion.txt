DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Remove unused parameters form TransportProtocol.canHandle()

Repository and remoteName parameters seams to be never used in current
TransportProtocol.canHandle() implementations therefore they can be
removed.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm not sure does those unused parameters are somehow needed by feature protocol implementations.

> I'm not sure does those unused parameters are somehow needed by feature protocol implementations.

Exactly. I decided to pass these through so a future implementation could for example define their remote as:

  [remote "mine"]
    url = http://...
    useMineMagic = true

And then check for the useMineMagic variable in the canHandle method. If its set, the transport returns true, if its not, it returns false, allowing fallback to the built-in stock http:// transport.

It might be overkill, but I think its a good idea to expose the remote information as part of the canHandle decision making.

Patch Set 1:

This make code a little bit complicated when we only want to check does given uri is supported. It would be less complicated if the 'local' parameter would be allowed to be null. Currently the java-doc doesn't mention it can be null, it it is intended to allow local = null, it should be added into java-doc.
