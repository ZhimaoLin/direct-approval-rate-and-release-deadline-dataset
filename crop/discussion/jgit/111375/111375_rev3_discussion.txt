DESCRIPTION

GC: Delete stale temporary packs and indexes

When a GC operation is interrupted, temporary packs and indexes can be
left on the pack folder. In big, busy repositories this can lead to
significant amounts of wasted disk space if this interruption is done
with a certain frequency.

Remove stale temporary packs and indexes at the end of the GC process so
they do not accumulate; to avoid interfering with a possible concurrent
JGit GC process in the same repository, only delete temporary files that
are older than 24 hours.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:973, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I would calculate a threshold outside the loop as now-(24*60*60*1000). And in this loop all files with lastmodified<threshold can be deleted. Same as in the prune() method where we delete loose unreferenced objects if they are old enough. There we calculate a threshold in advance and use the same threshold for all delete decisions.
