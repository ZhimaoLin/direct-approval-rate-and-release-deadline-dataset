DESCRIPTION

GC: Delete stale temporary packs and indexes

When a GC operation is interrupted, temporary packs and indexes can be
left on the pack folder. In big, busy repositories this can lead to
significant amounts of wasted disk space if this interruption is done
with a certain frequency.

Remove stale temporary packs and indexes at the end of the GC process so
they do not accumulate. To avoid interfering with a possible concurrent
JGit GC process in the same repository, only delete temporary files that
are older than 24 hours.

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcTemporaryFilesTest.java -> Imagine Instant.now() and/or Filesystem modification timestamps have a resolution of 500ms. If both timers don't tick between pack creation in line 72 to threshold check in gc then this test would fail. To be on the saver side I would add 2 sec to the threshold because we all hope that clocks tick at least all 2 seconds. Like .... -24*60*62*1000...
