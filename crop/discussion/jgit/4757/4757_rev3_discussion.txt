DESCRIPTION

Fix ResolveMerger not to add paths with FileMode 0

When ResolveMerger finds a path where it has to do a content merge he
will try the content merge and if that succeeds it'll add the newly
produced content to the index. For the FileMode of this new index entry
it blindly copies the FileMode it finds for that path in the common base
tree. If by chance the common base tree does not contain this path it'll
try to add FileMode 0 (MISSING) to the index.

One could argue that this can't happen: how can the ResolveMerger
successfully (with no conflicts) merge two contents if there is no
common base? This was due to another bug in ResolveMerger. It failed to
find out that for two files which differ only in the FileMode (e.g. 644
vs. 755) it should not try a content merge.

Also ,pushed a linguistic cosmetic change to the commit message.

Line:392, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Yes, of course. you are right. If we don't have conflicts because of the content (either because contents are equal or conflict-free mergeable) then we should avoid reporting a conflict for mode changes happening on one side only.
And additionally: If we create new content through a content merge then we have to decide on a filemode for that new file revision. Also here we should do a better solution then just picking the first filemode we find as I do now in getFileMode():
I'll propose a fix for that
