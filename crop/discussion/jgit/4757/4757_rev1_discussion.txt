DESCRIPTION

Fix ResolveMerger not to add pathes with FileMode 0

When ResolveMerger finds a path where he has to do a content merge he
will try the content merge and if that succeeds he'll add the newly
produced content to the index. For the FileMode of this new index entry 
he blindly copies the FileMode he finds for that path in the common base
tree. If by chance the common base tree does not contain this path he'll
try to add FileMode 0 (MISSING) to the index.

One could argue that this can't happen: how can the ResolveMerger
successfully (with not conflicts) merge two contents if there is no
common base? This was due to another bug in ResolveMerger. He failed to
find out that for two files which differ only in the FileMode (e.g. 644
vs. 755) he should not try a content merge.
