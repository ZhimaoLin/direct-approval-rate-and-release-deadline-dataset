DESCRIPTION

Fix ResolveMerger not to add paths with FileMode 0

When ResolveMerger finds a path where it has to do a content merge he
will try the content merge and if that succeeds it'll add the newly
produced content to the index. For the FileMode of this new index entry
it blindly copies the FileMode it finds for that path in the common base
tree. If by chance the common base tree does not contain this path it'll
try to add FileMode 0 (MISSING) to the index.

One could argue that this can't happen: how can the ResolveMerger
successfully (with no conflicts) merge two contents if there is no
common base? This was due to another bug in ResolveMerger. It failed to
find out that for two files which differ only in the FileMode (e.g. 644
vs. 755) it should not try a content merge.
