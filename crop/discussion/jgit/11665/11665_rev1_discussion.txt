DESCRIPTION

Don't delta compress garbage objects

Garbage is randomly ordered and unlikely to delta compress against
other garbage. Disable delta compression allowing objects to switch
to whole form when moving to the garbage pack.

Because the garbage is not well compressed assume deltas were not
attempted during a normal GC cycle.

Override the reuse settings, garbage that can be reused should be
reused as-is into the garbage pack rather than switching something
like the compression level during a GC. It is intended that garbage
will eventually be removed from the repository so expending CPU
time on a compression switch is not worthwhile.
