DESCRIPTION

Fixed MyersDiff to be able to handle more than 100k

MyersDiff was crashing with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when
diffing huge files. This was because the snake data (begin and
end position while processing chunks of the text) was sequeezed
into a single int. But with longer texts to diff these values
exceeded the range of java int values. It is fixed by squeezing
the two ints into a long and by adding the LongList helper
class.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> I decided to go for long when I was trying to add good hashcode() to a LongPair. Thats expensive if x,y are not completely unrelated but are not so different. Standard hashcode which just XOR x and y are pretty bad when x is similar to y (hashcodes have only few binary '1' and therefore we have a lot of collisions). And while I was trying hashcodes like x^somePrime+y I knew that this will loose the performance battle. So I switched to squeezing into longs and get around the problem of having to write good hashcodes.

Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> Style nit: Spaces around operators, so this line should read:

  long ret = ((long)x) << 32;

Line:261, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> Style nit: We avoid parens in return so this line should read:

  return ret | (k + x);

But I'd even more prefer that we state what "y" is:

  long y = k + x;
  return ret | y;

Line:269, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> Isn't this going to have the same result as

  return (int) snake;

but without needing to first push a long constant onto the stack and issuing a boolean and instruction?

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LongList.java -> Oops.  set(size(), value) also doesn't match the Javadoc which says exclusive to size.  *sigh*

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LongList.java -> just for info: be aware that this feature that list.set(list.size(), value) is allowed and is equivalent to list.add(value) makes this list incompatible with standard List implementations. When replacing LongList by ArrayList<Long> Myersdiff will not work anymore. Costed me some minutes testing :-)
