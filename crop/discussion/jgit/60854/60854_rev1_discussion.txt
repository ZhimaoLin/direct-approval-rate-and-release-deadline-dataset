DESCRIPTION

Do not use search path to find just-written tag

When TagCommand.call finishes, it returns a ref to represent the
result.  Because this Ref is obtained with getRef, if the just-written
tag is deleted then the lookup continues along the search path:

	refs/refs/tags/newtag
	refs/heads/refs/tags/newtag
	...

Better to only look up refs/tags/newtag directly and avoid using the
search path, by using exactRef.

This change doesn't fix the underlying problem --- retrieving the Ref
from the ref database instead of from the RefUpdate is still racy
because an independent update can happen between the
RefUpdate.update() call and the following ref lookup.  A fix to that
would be more invasive so it's left for another day.
