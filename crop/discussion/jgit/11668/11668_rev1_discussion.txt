DESCRIPTION

Move wantWrite flag to be special offset 1

Free up the WANT_WRITE flag in ObjectToPack by switching the test
to use the special offset value of 1. The Git pack file format
calls for the first 4 bytes to be 'PACK', which means any object
must start at an offset >= 4. Current versions require another 8
bytes in the header, placing the first object at offset = 12.

So offset = 1 is an invalid location for an object, and can be
used as a marker signal to indicate the writing loop has tried
to write the object, but recursed into the base first. When an
object is visited with offset == 1 it means there is a cycle in
the delta base path, and the cycle must be broken.

Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/ObjectToPack.java -> Wouldn't a named constant like MAGIC_OFFSET_WANT_WRITE. rather than the anonymou magic constant 1 be better?
