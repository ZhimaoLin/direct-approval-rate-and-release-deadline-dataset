DESCRIPTION

Fix pre-push hook to not set null remoteName as first argument

According to [1] the pre-push hook expects two parameters which provide
the name and location of the destination remote, if a named remote is
not being used both values should be the same.

We did set the first parameter to null in that case which caused
ProcessBuilder to throw a NullPointerException since its start() method
doesn't accept null arguments.
