Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRefRename.java -> OK to make public, but I think we require Javadoc on public members.

It was a mistake to use them in the interface and they aren't even needed there. Since they are non-public we can change the API without actually breaking it. The fix is to use the public base classes in the API instead.
