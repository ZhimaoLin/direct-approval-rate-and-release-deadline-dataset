One comment, otherwise looks good.

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/CharacterHead.java -> Why not String.valueOf(expectedCharacter)?

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/CharacterHead.java -> No special preference, also could do
Character.toString(expectedCharacter).

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/CharacterHead.java -> I think I prefer "String.valueOf" because it reads more like natural language ("give me the string value of the character"). How it's currently looks a bit too complicated to me. Please change, I'll submit then.

Gerrit creates a review for each commit, yes.

For incorporating review feedback, what you want to do is amending the existing commit and then pushing it again. To do this easily, create one local branch for each change (or group of changes that belong together).
