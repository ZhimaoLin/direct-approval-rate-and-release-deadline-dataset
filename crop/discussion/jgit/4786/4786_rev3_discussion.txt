DESCRIPTION

Support more of AutoCRLF

This patch introduces CRLF handling to the DirCacheCheckout and
WorkingTreeIterator supporting the AutoCRLF for add, checkout
reset and status and hopefully some other places that depende
on the underlying logic of the affected API's.

The patch includes test cases for the Status command provided by
Clay Cameron for bug 353867.

The core.eol and core.safecrlf options are not yet supported.
