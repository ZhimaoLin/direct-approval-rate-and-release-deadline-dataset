DESCRIPTION

Support more of AutoCRLF

This patch introduces CRLF handling to the DirCacheCheckout and
WorkingTreeIterator supporting the AutoCRLF for add, checkout
reset and status and hopefully some other places that depende
on the underlying logic of the affected API's.

The patch includes test cases for the Status command provided by
Clay Cameron for bug 353867.

Line:938, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Do we really always to CRLF conversion - even on binary files? Wouldn't this corrupt all checked-in jpegs? Even if the file contains e.g. a null byte in the first X bytes - something we used before to check for binary/non-binary files? Or have I overlooked a check here?

I always felt that the lack of git attributes which we could use to specify what is binary and what is not is the biggest obstacle why we didn't have autocrlf.

Line:965, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Why spent another filesystem call if autoCRLF was not true? We should only look into the fs if needed.

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IO.java -> trailing whitespace!

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> I miss some test for binary data.
