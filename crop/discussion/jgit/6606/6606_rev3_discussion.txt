DESCRIPTION

CommitBuilder should check for duplicate parents

When setting the parents of a commit with setParentIds() or
addParentId() it should be checked that we don't have duplicate parents.
An IllegalArgumentException should be thrown in this case.

Line:201, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitBuilder.java -> These three lines, I do not understand. newParentCount is always newParents.length, unless we throw an exception. 

It might be a good idea, however, to make it safe, so that if we throw and exception, then parentId's will not be changed. In this patch we'll wind up with a partially initialized parentIds array.

sorry for the very late answer. I overlooked this change.

Line:201, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitBuilder.java -> Yes, it's true. We don't need that. Changed it and rebased the commit.
