DESCRIPTION

CommitBuilder should check for duplicate parents

When setting the parents of a commit with setParentIds() or
addParentId() it should be checked that we don't have duplicate parents.
Duplicate parents should be silently skipped.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Robin, do you mean we should leave all these checks as in this proposal but throw an exception when we detect that we have duplicates?
