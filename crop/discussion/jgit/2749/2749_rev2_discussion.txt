DESCRIPTION

PacketLineIn: Reuse internal lineBuffer for small strings

Most "ACK %s continue", "ACK %s common", "NAK" strings that are read
by the readACK() method and readString() are shorter than the
lineBuffer already available.  Reuse that buffer when reading from
the network stream and converting to a string with RawParseUtils to
avoid unnecessary temporary byte array allocations.
