Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/InitCommandTest.java -> debug this single test case and stop here, the resulting file system structure has the git repo structure twice, this looks weird,
I think something is wrong here :

test1291411370681_0
- .git
  - branches
  - config
  - HEAD
  - logs
  - objects
  - refs
- test1

Line:294, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/Git.java -> Style-nit: Static methods should appear at the start of the class, before instance members.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/InitCommand.java -> I think we should still use Callable:

  class InitCommand implements Callable<Git>

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/InitCommand.java -> Why are we running findGitDir()?  It should have been explicitly set above.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/InitCommand.java -> Why is directory a string and not a java.io.File ?
