DESCRIPTION

Remove getReverseIndexSize() from DfsPackDescription.

The method is used in only one location (DfsPackFile). Furthermore,
PackIndex already does an explicit computation of the size in
DfsPackFile. Simplify the DfsPackDescription by removing the method
and do the calculation similar to PackIndex.
