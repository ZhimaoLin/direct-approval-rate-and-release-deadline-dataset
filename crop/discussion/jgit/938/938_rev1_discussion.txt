DESCRIPTION

Added flag to ignore whitespace in Diff

I added a command line flag to ignore all whitespace in the diff
command. When the flag is given, the code now generates a
RawTextIgnoreAllWhitespace object, rather than the normal RawText
object, to perform the diff on.

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreAllWhitespace.java -> This should be squashed into your prior commit.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Please be very careful to not reformat existing code that isn't otherwise changing.  Especially for smaller changes like this.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Can you somehow refactor this code so that the db.openBlob(id).getCachedBytes() part isn't copy-and-pasted identically between two lines?
