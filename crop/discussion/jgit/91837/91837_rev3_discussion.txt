DESCRIPTION

Switch to pure Java SHA1 for ObjectId

Generate names for objects using only the pure Java SHA1
implementation, but continue using MessageDigest in tests.
This opens the possibility of changing the hashing function
to incorporate additional safety measures, such as those
used in sha1dc[1].

Since MessageDigest has higher throughput, continue using
MessageDigest for computing pack, idx and DirCache trailers.
These are less likely to be sensitive to SHAttered[2] types
of attacks, as Git uses them to detect random bit flips
during transfer, and not for content identity.
