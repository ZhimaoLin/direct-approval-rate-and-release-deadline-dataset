DESCRIPTION

Compare repository format version as parsed long

This allows repositoryies with a missing repositoryformatversion
config value to be successfully opened but still throws exceptions
when the value is a non-long or greater than zero.

git-core attempts to parse this config value as a long as well
and defaults to 0 if the value is missing.
