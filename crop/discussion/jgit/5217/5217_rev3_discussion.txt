DESCRIPTION

Compare repository format version as parsed long

This allows repositoryies with a missing repositoryformatversion
config value to be successfully opened but still throws exceptions
when the value is a non-long or greater than zero.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ugh. git-core really accepts repositories with no repositoryformatversion field? I thought this was a required property that was part of the way it was safe to assume this directory really contains a Git repository.

Before we make this change I would like some documentation in the commit message pointing to where in git-core it says its OK to open a repository without a repositoryformatversion field.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I am also not at all annoyed that this is at least the 2nd time I have seen a GitHub product "forcing Git" to redefine its formats because of a bug or misfeature in a GitHub implementation that gets spread so widely that we have no choice but to accept it.

JGit still chokes on and refuses to accept trees with the leading '0' mode that GitHub introduced with the web editor.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> It seems like in git-core config values attempting to be parsed as int/long that are missing just default to 0 which is how the repository format version is compared.
