DESCRIPTION

Move commit and tag formatting to CommitBuilder, TagBuilder

These objects should be responsible for their own formatting,
rather than delegating it to some obtuse type called ObjectInserter.

While we are at it, simplify the way we insert these into a database.
Passing in the type and calling format in application code turned
out to be a huge mistake in terms of ease-of-use of the insert API.
