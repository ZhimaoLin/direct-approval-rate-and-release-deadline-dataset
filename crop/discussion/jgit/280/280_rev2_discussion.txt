DESCRIPTION

Add a RefFilter interface to ReceivePack and UploadPack

When a user of ReceivePack or UploadPack wants to control what refs
are sent to the client, for instance when some refs should be hidden
from some clients, this interface can be extended to provide a fine
grained control over what refs are sent to the client.

Patch Set 2:

Also, your Change-Id: line has a tab after the : not a space.  Please amend and fix it to be a space.  Gerrit's web UI injects a tab when you copy literally from the info table.  Its a bug I'd like to fix in the Gerrit UI but haven't had time to do, and keep forgetting about.
