DESCRIPTION

Add a RefFilter interface to ReceivePack and UploadPack

When a user of ReceivePack or UploadPack wants to control what refs
are sent to the client, for instance when some refs should be hidden
from some clients, this interface can be extended to provide a fine
grained control over what refs are sent to the client.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Almost ready.  I apparently didn't read the Javadoc closely enough in the last rounds.  :-(

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Reading this again, this is awkward.  It makes no sense to me in context.  I would instead suggest:

  * <p>
  * Only refs allowed by this filter will be sent to the client.  This
  * can be used by a server to restrict the list of references the
  * client can obtain through clone or fetch, effectively limiting the
  * access to only certain refs.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:351, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Like in UploadPack I find this awkward wording.  Maybe:

  * <p>
  * Only refs allowed by this filter will be shown to the client.
  * Clients may still attempt to create or update a reference
  * hidden by the configured RefFilter.  These attempts should
  * be rejected by a matching xxx@xxx.xxx PreReceiveHook}.

Basically one of the corner conditions here is, lets say the RefFilter hides refs/heads/sekret from the client.  The client might still try to create that branch, as he can't see it, so he assumes its available.  We loosely enforce the security of that update within validateCommands(), but the PreReceiveHook really should be playing in partnership with the RefFilter to ensure the client doesn't overwrite a branch he can't see.
