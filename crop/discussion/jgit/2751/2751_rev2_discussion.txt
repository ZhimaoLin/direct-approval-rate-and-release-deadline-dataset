DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Report invalid want lines with ERR

Instead of aborting hard with a server-side exception, report an error
to the client with "ERR %s" in a context where the client is expecting
ACK/NAK.  Older clients will report this text to the user, but newer
ones know how to format this message in a more user-friendly way.
