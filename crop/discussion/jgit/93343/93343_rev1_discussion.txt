DESCRIPTION

Move SHA1 compress/recompress files to resource folder

This fixes Bazel build:

in srcs attribute of java_library rule //org.eclipse.jgit:jgit:
file '//org.eclipse.jgit:src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/sha1/SHA1.recompress'
is misplaced here (expected .java, .srcjar or .properties).

Another option that was considered is to exclude the non source files.
