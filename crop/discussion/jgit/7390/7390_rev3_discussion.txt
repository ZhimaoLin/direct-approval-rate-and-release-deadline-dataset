DESCRIPTION

Implement a parser for dates

In order to parse user specified strings containing date and time info
a thread-safe parser is implemented. This is needed for example to
interpret configuration parameters (e.g. gc.pruneexpire where need to
parse strings like "2 weeks ago"). The parser is thread-safe by caching
SimpleDateFormat instances in a ThreadLocal cache.

Native git has a parser called approxidate which is able to interpret a
huge number of formats ("1 year ago", "tea time", ...). Ideally JGit
should be able to parse the same strings as native git but for now this
parser understands the following subset:

"now"
"yesterday"
"(x) years|months|weeks|days|hours|minutes|seconds ago"
"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z" (ISO)
"EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z" (RFC)
"yyyy-MM-dd"
"yyyy.MM.dd"
"MM/dd/yyyy"
"dd.MM.yyyy"
"EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss yyyy Z" (DEFAULT)
"EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss yyyy" (LOCAL)

Patch Set 3:

IMHO as implemented GitDateParser has a serious flaw. It uses the strptime(3) behavior of stopping once it reaches a portion of the string that is no longer parseable. But strptime returns a pointer to the first char in the unprocessed portion, whereas GitDateParser just drops the rest of the string on the floor with no indication to the caller.

This means a user running (hypothetically, since I don't think Gc currently supports --prune):

 jgit gc --prune=2014-02-14-12:00:00

would be surprised to find that objects between midnight and noon on 2/14 have been pruned, simply because the last '-' should have been a ' '.

I suspect the simplest fix would be to require that the entire string be parsed. Any objections to that change?
