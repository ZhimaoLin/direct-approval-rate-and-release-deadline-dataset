DESCRIPTION

Fix some tests for running in bazel

Some tests call out to external cgit. Those tests all failed for me
locally on Mac. Turned out that the reason was that the system git
config used by the git in the bazel run contained paths with ~/ but
somehow $HOME was not set. As a result the external git returned
with exit code 128.

Fix this by passing along $HOME explicitly. Also improve assertions
to make sure we do get the stderr of the external command in the
test log.

I hadn't noticed that until now because apparently the maven build
does pass along $HOME.

What is the symptom without this change? I.e. what is the full error message?

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/CGitIgnoreTest.java -> Likewise.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/attributes/CGitAttributesTest.java -> Forgive my ignorance: is fs.userHome() a homedir set up by mvn/bazel, or is it my own HOME directory?

I'm assuming the former, but the latter would have been my assumption when just looking at this code. Maybe it's worth a comment.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> Likewise.

external git returns exit code 128, and the tests fail with the not very helpful message

  java.lang.AssertionError: External git failed expected:<0> but was:<128>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)
        ...

With the changed assertion, we also get the stderr in the log, and the tests fail with

  org.junit.ComparisonFailure: External git failed expected:<exit [0]
  > but was:<exit [128
  error: could not expand include path '~/.gitcinclude'
  fatal: bad config line 45 in file /usr/local/git/etc/gitconfig]
  >
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:115)
        ...

which is a bit more helpful and points to a problem with substituting ~/. Setting $HOME for the call to external git resolves the problem and the tests pass. (I have git 2.13.1 installed on my Mac, and line 45 is an include of ~/.gitcinclude.)

In mvn this problem didn't exist since mvn doesn't do any sandboxing for tests. Nor does Eclipse when the test is run from within Eclipse.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/attributes/CGitAttributesTest.java -> FS.userHome() reads the Java system property user.home and returns whatever is set there. Interestingly, that property is set also when the test is run via bazel.

In my bazel test runs, it was the real user home directory. Don't know if that could be changed via some bazel configuration; I don't know bazel well and only learned yesterday that is has some sandboxing capabilities. (And that it does pass along $PATH, but not $HOME.)

I don't know whether $HOME being unset in bazel is intended bazel behavior or a bug in bazel. Perhaps it's even a problem in my bazel setup, though I doubt that since otherwise bazel works fine, and all other tests did pass locally.
