Could you add a test case that shows the problem?

Patch Set 1:

Sorry, but I could not come up with how to test this problem.

To reproduce the problem, `repo.getWorkTree().getParentFile()` must be `null`.
`repo.getWorkTree()` should be "." or "..", etc., but the test repository is in "/tmp/..." (in my environment) which is not an ancestor of the current directory.
I tried to set the test repository to "user.dir" property, in vain.

Let me know if there is a good method to do such a test.

You're right, seems complicated to set this up. And it's a pretty straightforward fix, so let's merge it.
