DESCRIPTION

Enable writing pack indexes with bitmaps in the GC.

Update the dfs and file GC implementations to call
PackWriter.prepareIndexBitmaps() on the packs that contain the full
closure of the object graph. Update the DfsPackDescription to include
the index version.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)



Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> Are you aware that we are reaching this line also for Packs which don't contain the full closure of the object graph? This GC writes potententially two packs: one containing the objects reachable from heads and one for the remaining objects (e.g. reachable only through tags). At least the commit message makes me think that you only want it to be called on full-closure-packs.

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> See the block I just pointed you at in change Icdb0cdd66ff168917fb9ef17b96093990cc6a98d. This is a no-op on the non-head pack.

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> ok, got it. Then this is no problem. I was only confused by the commit message which says that the GC class will not even call prepareIndexBitmaps() on non-full-closure-packs.
