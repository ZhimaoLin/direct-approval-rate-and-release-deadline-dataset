Line:411, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Document as you have below that this will cause an InputStream to be ignored.

Line:522, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Can this be in the context of a try { } finally block to make sure the input stream is always closed?

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/internal/RepoText.properties -> It seems like we're losing information that's potentially useful for debugging. Would it make more sense to have two variants of each message?
