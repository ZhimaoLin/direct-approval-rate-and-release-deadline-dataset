DESCRIPTION

Fix pack index decoding problems

In PackIndexWriters, we encode crc and offset using NB.encodeInt32,
however, we decode them using NB.decodeUInt32 in PackIndex class. Offset
is probably fine, but crc32 can be negative.

I'm not sure what problem you are trying to solve with this commit.

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV1.java -> This is an incorrect change. In idx v1 format the offset is a 32 bit unsigned integer, supporting pack files up to 4 GiB in size.

decodeUInt32 is necessary to get the correct offset.

Line:226, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV2.java -> This is also an incorrect change. In pack index v2 the level one offset is a 32 bit unsigned integer, and the level two offset is a 64 bit unsigned.

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV2.java -> The CRC used is actually treated as a 32 bit unsigned value by storing it in a signed long in Java. E.g. we use this in DfsPackFile:

  crc1.getValue() != expectedCRC

Where crc1 is a java.util.zip.CRC32, and its getValue() method returns long because the CRC is actually an unsigned 32 bit value.

Abandon this change. 

Should we store the crc in PackedObjectInfo as a long to be consistent? Every time we set/compare the CRC value in PackedObjectInfo we need be careful about the inconsistent type with PackIndex.findCRC32 and CRC32.getValue.

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV1.java -> You're right. Offset needs to be decoded as unsigned.

Line:226, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV2.java -> Done

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV2.java -> Right, I was comparing a PackIndex.findCRC32() which returns long directly with PackObjectInfo.getCRC() which returns int.
