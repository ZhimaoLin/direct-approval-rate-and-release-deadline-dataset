DESCRIPTION

Don't delete .idx file if .pack file can't be deleted

If during an garbage collection old packfiles are deleted it could
happen that on certain platforms the index file can be deleted but the
packfile can't be deleted (because someone locked the file). This led
to repositories with packfiles without corresponding index files. Those
zombie-packfiles potentially consume a lot of space on disk and it is
never tried to delete them again. Try to avoid this situation by
deleting packfiles first and don't try to delete the other files if we
can't delete the packfile. This gives us the chance to delete the
packfile during next GC.

This commit only improves the situation - there is still the chance for
orphan files during packfile deletion. We don't have an atomic delete
of multiple files .
