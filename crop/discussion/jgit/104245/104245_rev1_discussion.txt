DESCRIPTION

Remove workaround for bug in Java's ReferenceQueue

Sun's Java 5, 6, 7 implementation had a bug [1] where a Reference can be
enqueued and dequeued twice on the same reference queue due to a race
condition within ReferenceQueue.enqueue(Reference).

This bug was fixed for Java 8 [2] hence remove the workaround.
