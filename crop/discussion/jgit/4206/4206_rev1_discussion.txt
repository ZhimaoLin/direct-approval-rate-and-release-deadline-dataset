Line:215, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> I like that we come closer to what native git would write with this. I am wondering whether we should also mention the diff algorithm used, because this really influences the merge result.

Line:215, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> This is mostly a compliance patch and I don't see C git writing the algorithm. For non-conflicting merge, the choice of algorithm rarely matters and the reflog is not long-term. 
Regardless, that would be a separate patch.
