DESCRIPTION

Preparation of OpenSshConfig for handling of multiple config files

The concrete configuration file represented by OpenSshConfig has been
refactored into a package-protected class. This allows for a future
extension deriving the SSH configuration from multiple files, i.e.
user-specific and general system settings.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/OpenSshConfig.java -> Given how much of this file you moved to OpenSshConfigFile, you should also copy over this copyright notice to the new home.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/OpenSshConfig.java -> This isn't really thread safe. The caller might see the wrong cache instance, or see a partially initialized one. Either cache must be volatile, or you need some synchronization around looking at the cache field and running the updateCache() method to replace its contents with a new map.

This used to work because everything was synchronized together inside of a single refresh() method.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/OpenSshConfigFile.java -> either mark lastModified volatile, or make this method synchronized to ensure the caller sees the correct version of the lastModified value from the last read() call.
