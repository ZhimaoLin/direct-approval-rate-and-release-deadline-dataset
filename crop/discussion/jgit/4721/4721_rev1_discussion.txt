DESCRIPTION

Preparation of OpenSshConfig for handling of multiple config files

The concrete configuration file represented by OpenSshConfig has been
refactored into an inner class. This allows for a future extension
deriving the SSH configuration from multiple files, i.e. user-specific
and general system settings.
