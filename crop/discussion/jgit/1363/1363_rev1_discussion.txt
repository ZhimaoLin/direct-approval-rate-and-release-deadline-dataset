DESCRIPTION

Correct PersonIdent hashCode() and equals() to ignore milliseconds

Git doesn't store millisecond accuracy in person identity lines,
so a line that we create in Java and round-trip through a Git object
wouldn't compare as being equal.  Truncate to seconds when comparing
values to ensure the same identity is equal.
