DESCRIPTION

Use build timestamp as OSGi version qualifier for SNAPSHOT builds

Default maven-bundle-plugin behaviour results in use of the same
.SNAPSHOT OSGi bundle version qualifier for all snapshot builds.
This causes problems for eclipse update manager and other consumers
that rely on OSGi bundle metadata to select "newer" or "best
matching" version of jgit bundle.

To solve the problem, maven-bundle-plugin is configured to replace
.SNAPSHOT with build timestamp in format like 20100106-1234.
