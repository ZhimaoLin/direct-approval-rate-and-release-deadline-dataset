DESCRIPTION

Use build timestamp as OSGi version qualifier for SNAPSHOT builds

Default maven-bundle-plugin behaviour results in use of the same .SNAPSHOT
OSGi bundle version qualifier for all snapshot builds. This causes
problems for eclipse update manager and other consumers that
rely on OSGi bundle metadata to select "newer" or "best matching"
version of jgit bundle.

To solve the problem, maven-bundle-plugin is configured to replace
.SNAPSHOT with build timestamp in format like 20100106-1234.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Seems to fail on my system, the generated manifest:

Import-Package: com.jcraft.jsch;version="0.1.41",org.eclipse.jgit.diff
 ;version="[${version;==;null;-SNAPSHOT;""}.null},

$ mvn -version
