DESCRIPTION

Consider parent rules if ignore rule is negated

The change tries to make jgit behave more like native CLI git regarding
the negation rules. According to [1] "... prefix "!" which negates the
pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become
included again." Negating the pattern should not automatically make the
file *not ignored* - other pattern rules has to be considered too.

The fix adds test cases for both bugs 448094 and 407475.

As a result of the discussion on bug 407475 I found out that my CLI git was too old and that the patch actually fixes bug 407475 too. I've updated test comments and the commit message accordingly.

This was a brain-heating change to review :). Looks like good work, some comments inline.

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNode.java -> I'm not sure if this is handled correctly with regards to negatePrevious. Running IgnoreNodeTest with coverage shows that this line is never hit.

Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> This doesn't seem to be included in the `assertEntry` below.

Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> Should be `tracked`, right?

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> "... and except all directories", right?

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> Isn't this just due to JGit iterating into untracked directories as well (e.g. staging view lists all the files as untracked, whereas C Git stops at the directory)?

Given that, from the assertions below for src/a and children, it looks like C Git and JGit behave the same with regards to the directory and all its children *not* being ignored.

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> This doesn't seem to be included in the `assertEntry` below.

Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> Other use of false instead of tracked.

Some ideas on naming.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNode.java -> Should this maybe be called CHECK_PARENT_NEGATE_FIRST_MATCH?

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNode.java -> I had some trouble understanding the meaning of "negatePrevious". Maybe it should be "negateFirstMatch" instead? It depends on how you look at it, I guess. The confusion comes from the fact that it's a previous rule in the file, but as this method goes through the rules in reverse order, it's the next rule in the order in which they are checked..

Is there a word that is unambiguous in this context? Maybe "negateHigherMatch"?
