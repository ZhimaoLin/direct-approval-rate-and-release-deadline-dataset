DESCRIPTION

Consider parent rules if ignore rule is negated

The change tries to make jgit behave more like native CLI git regarding
the negation rules. According to [1] "... prefix "!" which negates the
pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become
included again." Negating the pattern should not automatically make the
file *not ignored* - other pattern rules has to be considered too.

The fix adds test cases for both bugs 448094 and 407475.

Thanks for pointers, I've added missing tests and check now that all created files are matched in the test.
I've used your names, except this and the "empty" IgnoreNode case no logic is changed.

Cool, just one trailing whitespace left. Also, it would be good if someone else also reviewed.
