DESCRIPTION

Consider parent rules if ignore rule is negated

The change tries to make jgit behave more like native CLI git regarding
the negation rules. According to [1] "... prefix "!" which negates the
pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become
included again." Negating the pattern should not automatically make the
file *not ignored* - other pattern rules have to be considered too.

The fix adds test cases for both bugs 448094 and 407475.
