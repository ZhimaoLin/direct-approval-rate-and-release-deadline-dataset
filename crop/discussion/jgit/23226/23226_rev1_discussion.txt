DESCRIPTION

Reject '.git' as a tree name in ObjectChecker

Using .git as a name in a tree is invalid for most Git repositories.
This can confuse clients into thinking there is a submodule or another
repository deeper in the tree, which is incorrect. Reject .git on all
platforms and '.GIT' (mixed case) if case insensitive filesystems are
important to the project.
