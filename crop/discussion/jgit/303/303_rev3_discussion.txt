DESCRIPTION

Script to fix license headers and copyrights in Java sources

The script merges explicit copyright statements in all Java
sources with author information from git history, updates the
copyright headers accordingly and updates the license headers
to EDL. For recognized copyright formats see the test data in
tools/fixHeaders-TestData.txt.

To fix the headers for all revisions run (caution: don't do that
if you don't understand the implications of rewriting history):

  git filter-branch --tree-filter 'fixHeaders.pl' HEAD

There is no mapping from author information in git history to
explicit copyright headers yet which might be different. There is
also no normalization honoring .mailmap.

E.g. author "Joe Developer xxx@xxx.xxx might have
added an explicit copyright header of his company "Copyright (c)
2010, GreatCorp Inc."  to a file he committed a change for. The
script will then list copyright headers for both.

[sp: Cleaned up regex to run on Perl v5.8.8; changed header
     formatting to match current standards.]

Patch Set 3: Do not submit; No score

We're not changing our header.  See the message I just posted to jgit-dev under subject "Re: Copyright/License Template for JGit".  (I would have included a hyperlink to the archives, but it seems the archiving software isn't picking it up.)
