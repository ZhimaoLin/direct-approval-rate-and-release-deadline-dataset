DESCRIPTION

Script to fix license headers and copyrights in Java sources

The script merges explicit copyright statements in all Java
sources with author information from git history, updates the
copyright headers accordingly and updates the license headers
to EDL. For recognized copyright formats see the test data in
tools/fix-headers.tst.

To fix the headers for all revisions run (caution: don't do that
if you don't understand the implications of rewriting history):

  ./tools/rewrite-history.sh

To fix headers only in the current working directory:

  ./tools/fix-headers.pl

Authors are mapped to employer copyright statements through a
hardcoded table in the top of the script.  This is crude but
simple way to list date ranges under which certain changes need
to be attributed to other holders.

[sp: Cleaned up regex to run on Perl v5.8.8; changed header
     formatting to match current standards.]

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

I'm currently trying to run this script.  Its uh, how should we put it, slow?  Almost 1 minute per commit.  530 commits need to be processed to also try and salvage the Gerrit review history.

In the last round I ran it on a RAM disk this improved speed on win32 quite a bit, but still it took a lot of time.

At SAP we use individual copyright statements but if your approach is easier that's also fine.

It's late already, I need some sleep now, I'll give it a try tomorrow.

Patch Set 5:

Yea, that was actually one of the things I wanted you to look at.  What should copyright lines from SAP folks look like, just the "Full Name xxx@xxx.xxx that is in commit?
