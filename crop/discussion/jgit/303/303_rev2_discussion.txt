DESCRIPTION

Script to fix license headers and copyrights in Java sources

The script merges explicit copyright statements in all Java
sources with author information from git history, updates the
copyright headers accordingly and updates the license headers
to EDL. For recognized copyright formats see the test data in
tools/fixHeaders-TestData.txt.

To fix the headers for all revisions run (caution: don't do that
if you don't understand the implications of rewriting history):

  git filter-branch --tree-filter 'fixHeaders.pl' HEAD

There is no mapping from author information in git history to
explicit copyright headers yet which might be different. There is
also no normalization honoring .mailmap.

E.g. author "Joe Developer xxx@xxx.xxx might have
added an explicit copyright header of his company "Copyright (c)
2010, GreatCorp Inc."  to a file he committed a change for. The
script will then list copyright headers for both.

[sp: Cleaned up regex to run on Perl v5.8.8; changed header
     formatting to match current standards.]

Patch Set 2: No score; No score

You are right, we should not use real entities in the samples. You missed to remove the unused line.

I struggled a lot with the regex and felt that mine looks much too complicated, yours looks much simpler :) 
I'll try it out in the evening.

I found the trick with the uncommitted changes detected by git blame by experimenting, but I do not really understand why blame finds uncommitted changes. Is the offset we pass via -L incorrect or is this caused by the mechanics of filter-branch ?

Is there any detailed documentation about how filter-branch works ? It took me quite a while of experimenting to find out that I have to rewrite all files in every commit.
