DESCRIPTION

Script to fix license headers and copyrights in Java sources

The script merges explicit copyright statements in all Java
sources with author information from git history, updates the
copyright headers accordingly and updates the license headers
to EDL. For recognized copyright formats see the test data in
tools/fixHeaders-TestData.txt.

To fix the headers for all revisions run (caution: don't do that
if you don't understand the implications of rewriting history):

  git filter-branch --tree-filter 'fixHeaders.pl' HEAD

Authors are mapped to employer copyright statements through a
hardcoded table in the top of the script.  This is crude but
simple way to list date ranges under which certain changes need
to be attributed to other holders.

[sp: Cleaned up regex to run on Perl v5.8.8; changed header
     formatting to match current standards.]
