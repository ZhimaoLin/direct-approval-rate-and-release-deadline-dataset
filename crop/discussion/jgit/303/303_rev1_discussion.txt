DESCRIPTION

Script to fix license headers and copyrights in Java sources

The script merges explicit copyright statements in all Java sources with author
information from git history, updates the copyright headers accordingly and
updates the license headers to EDL. For recognized copyright formats see the
test data in tools/fixHeaders-TestData.txt.

To fix the headers for all revisions run (caution: don't do that if
you don't understand the implications of rewriting history):

git filter-branch --tree-filter 'fixHeaders.pl' HEAD

There is no mapping from author information in git history to explicit
copyright headers yet which might be different. There is also no normalization
honoring .mailmap.

E.g. author "Joe Developer xxx@xxx.xxx might have added an
explicit copyright header of his company "Copyright (c) 2010, GreatCorp Inc."
to a file he committed a change for. The script will then list copyright
headers for both.

Patch Set 1: No score; IP review completed

Please comment if we need an explicit mapping from authors to company copyright headers and how that could look like.

I left out the contributors section (other projects also seem to not use that) and the Foundation's copyright (there where doubts about that on jgit-dev) and wrapped the license text to a width of 80 chars. I think before we finally rewrite JGit history we should agree on that with EMO.

I am not really sure how to fully test this, so far I only did some random checks on a rewritten JGit history.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Some minor nits.  I'll try to reopen discussion with the foundation about the header format.

Patch Set 1:

There's also a flaw in the way git blame is finding the data.  For example on the tip of master we get this:

 diff --git a/org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/glue/MetaServlet.java b/org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/glu
 index 52bb69c..0d77354 100644
 --- a/org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/glue/MetaServlet.java
 +++ b/org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/glue/MetaServlet.java

Now I know Constantine didn't contribute any code to MetaServlet, because I wrote all of it, and there's only one commit which affects it.  But git blame seems to think he wrote something anyway:

 $ git blame -C -w org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/glue/MetaServlet.java
 ...
 (Veronica Mcdonald 2009-06-24 21:48:03 +0400  56) import java.util.List;
 (Jaycee Hickman       2009-07-25 11:52:57 -0700  57) import java.util.Map;
 (Veronica Mcdonald 2009-06-24 21:48:03 +0400  58) import java.util.Set;

Apparently, he wrote two import lines from java.util.List and Set somewhere else in our sources, and git blame decided to attach those same occurrences here in MetaServlet to him, rather than to me.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, tools/fixHeaders.pl -> I love that you wrote examples down.  But I'd prefer that these not name real sounding entities.  I don't want someone grepping out code to actually think that this company owns something in here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, tools/fixHeaders.pl -> For what its worth, I prefer the formatting of the current header where there is a blank line between each paragraph and the bullet items use - rather than * for each clause.  The current header is actually more similar to most uses of the BSD in the wild.
