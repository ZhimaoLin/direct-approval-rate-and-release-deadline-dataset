DESCRIPTION

Fixed Misleading Javadoc

The javadoc for the setRenameLimit method in RenameDetector said
that you could only have limits in the range (0,100), implying
that 0 and 100 were illegal inputs. The code, however, allowed 0 and
100. I changed the javadoc to say that the range [0,100] was legal.
I also documented the IllegalArgumentException that is thrown if the
limit is outside that range.
