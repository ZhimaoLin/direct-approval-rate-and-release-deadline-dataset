Line:643, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> I am not sure whether this is a problem. But by exposing the raw byte array to the outside world you cannot prevent that the path can be modified externally.

E.g.

  DirCacheEntry e=.....
  e.getRawPath()[0]='a'

could really break a lot of stuff. Before we had only getter methods return immutable objects like String.

Either we all accept this risk. Or we use different solutions like returning in getRawPath() a copy the array. But that's not as performant as this solution

Line:643, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> I'd return a copy

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> why is this needed ?
