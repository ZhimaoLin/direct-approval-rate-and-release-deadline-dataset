Line:1325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> You need to save the stats object here. See my comment below.

Line:1353, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Here we throw away the parser after a connectivity check, which I think runs before the caller gets control and could query this for the stats object. So obtain it above into a field when we get the packLock and packSize.

Line:938, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> s/this.//
