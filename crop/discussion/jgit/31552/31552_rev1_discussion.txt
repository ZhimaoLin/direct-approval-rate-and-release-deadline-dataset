DESCRIPTION

Revert "Add a method to DfsOutputStream to read as an InputStream"

This reverts commit b646578d89513c5db30151f0b865c7335c88d682.

openInputStream() is never used in JGit, nor is it used by any
known working DFS implementation. The method was added as a
utility for reading back from a DfsInserter, but the final
implementation of that feature does not requrire this method.
