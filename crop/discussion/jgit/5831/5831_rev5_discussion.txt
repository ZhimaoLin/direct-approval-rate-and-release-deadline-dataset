DESCRIPTION

Update smudged index entries when committing

The commit command has access to iterators over the
working directory and index and could use that information
to update any smudged entries currently in the index with
the current working directory length and modified time if
the object id of the index and working directory match.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:415, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> I think you can't rely on the ID of the working tree entry since it was smudged, the only way to fix this is to read the blob content and recompute its ID

Line:415, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> forget this comment, the ID is recomputed here so it's ok to rely on it

Line:415, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> Wouldn't it be better if we did this when dirache is written. That would work for all operations, not just commit.

That could be done as a followup to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5413/6
