DESCRIPTION

Cache gitPrefix in FS_Win32

readPipe() may consume rather much time, so
gitPrefix should be cached. If the git executable changes,
users should run FS.detect() again to get a new
instance of FS_Win32.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Good idea.

Stylistically, I would have pulled the current code into a new private method, and done something like:

  if (!gitPrefixEvaluated) {
    gitPrefix = theNewPrefixHelperMethod();
    gitPrefixEvaluated;
  }
