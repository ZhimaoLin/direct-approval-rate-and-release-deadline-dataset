DESCRIPTION

Refactored method to find branches from which a commit is reachable

The method uses some heuristics to obtain much better performance
than isMergeBase.

Since I wrote the relevant code in the method I approve the license
change from EPL to EDL implied by the move.

Patch Set 2:

I had pushed it to stable-2.0, but moving back now. Some of them comments I did not fix, but tried to in I78cc11cae15e0eee2ab015069c9583fd606b179e, but that did not work. One reason is that the current implemention accepts RevCommits from differente RevWalks. One set comes from getAllRefs in Repository. OTOH, having the constraint might be useful since this method is about speed anyway...
