DESCRIPTION

Refactored method to find branches from which a commit is reachable

The method uses some heuristics to obtain much better performance
than isMergeBase.

Since I wrote the relevant code in the method I approve the license
change from EPL to EDL implied by the move.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> typo s/.s/s./

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> If refs.size() is less than the number of RevFlags free in the RevWalk you are perhaps better off assigning a flag to each Ref and using the flag system to track reachability during a single traversal.

If you have more refs than RevFlags free, you could run them in batches. With your idea on line 144 of skipping any Ref whose tip commit is more than 1 day older than the target commit, you may be able to get most executions reduced down to just one batch and avoid additional traversals.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> This markStart is pointless. You run resetRetain() before doing anything else.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> You should require the commit to come from the RevWalk, and then this is a reference equality test and not an equals test.

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> This may be faster as a RevFlag if you can temporarily borrow or allocate a flag from the RevWalk. But see above about using RevFlags to track reachability for multiple Refs at once so you can reduce the number of traversals performed.

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> s/.toObjectId()//. You can just add current to the list/map.

Some of the comments taken into account.

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> Note that I'm just moving code around here (from egit) for re-use. I'll maybe improve more later. The primary goal is to speed up the commit view in EGit, and the refactored code seems a good fit for JGit, rather than keeping it in EGit.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> Done

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> This is not what we do, as the commits come from getAllRefs(). This feels a bit too strict. 

Maybe I should keep this routine internal within EGit

Patch Set 1:

Robin, are you going to send an updated version for the stuff you marked "Done"?  I think I am otherwise OK with this change since it is just a move of existing code from EGit->JGit. We can further clean it up in future commits.
