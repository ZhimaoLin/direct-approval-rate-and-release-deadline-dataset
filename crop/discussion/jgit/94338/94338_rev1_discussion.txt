Patch Set 1:

the following test fails
PushConnectionTest.limitCommandBytes:195 expected:<[remote: Too many commands]> but was:<[test://test/conn0: Pipe closed]>
strangely the same test succeeds for the parent commit, any clue what's wrong with this commit ?

when running only PushConnectionTest from Maven it succeeds as well:

mvn -Dtest=org.eclipse.jgit.transport.PushConnectionTest  test

I get this failure sometimes when running locally on my mac.  It seems to be transient.

I'm getting the same error consistently after checking out this commit.  On the head of master it works.  I also get the error after doing:

 ./tools/version.sh --release $(git describe)

so I've realised that the 'transient' error I mentioned before was probably only happening while I was building snapshot releases.

Could it be caused by the different version string?  I can't think of any obvious reason why that would be the case.

* on my Mac this test fails reproducibly when running all tests from Maven with this version
* it doesn't fail for the predecessor version which only has a different version number (or did the release script miss to update some version string ?)
* it doesn't fail when I only run PushConnectionTest from Maven
* it doesn't fail when I remotely debug this test run via Maven
* it doesn't fail when I run this test in Eclipse
* it still fails if I switch off concurrent execution of tests using the Maven option -T 1 instead of the default -T 1C we define in .mvn/maven.config

Patch Set 1:

If I run this:

  mvn -Dtest=org.eclipse.jgit.transport.PushConnectionTest  test

it fails with:

  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.19.1:test (default-test) on project org.eclipse.jgit: No tests were executed!  (Set -DfailIfNoTests=false to ignore this error.) -> [Help 1]

first do 

cd org.eclipse.jgit.test

then run

mvn -Dtest=org.eclipse.jgit.transport.PushConnectionTest  test

* the test succeeds when running all tests using Bazel

bazel test //...

I tested if this problem depends on length of the JGit version string, the result is that the test fails if the version tag name has length of 16 characters or longer (e.g. v4.7.0.2017040-r). If tag name is shorter than 16 characters the test passes. Any clue how to explain this behaviour ?
