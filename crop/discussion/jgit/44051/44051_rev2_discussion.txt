Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> Similar problem as with Git and Repository. As a user of TestRepository and a caller of TestRepository.git() it's not clear to me whether I have to close the repo or not. On platforms like linux, macos it don't care much. It's testcode and I let GC do the work for me. But on windows you can write tests and because of a missing close on Repository or Git the cleanup phase of the tests (where folder hierarchies in filesystem are deleted) fail. E.g. see my commit da595f09 where I had to fix this.

I would at least document whether I have to close what I get back from git(). Or more convinient: add a close() method.

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> The difference between TestRepository and Git is the only way to create a TestRepository is with a Repository that you pass in. You create it, so you're responsible for closing it; there's no ambiguity there. (And moreover, this change has nothing to do with that part.)

I suppose I can see the argument that the caller doesn't know whether they should close this Git instance. In practice it doesn't matter, but I could make this clearer I guess.
