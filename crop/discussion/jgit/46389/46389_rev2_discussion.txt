DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Added rename remote functionality

This will implement the command "git remote rename <old> <new>" and
allow the user to rename a remote. Along with the remote, the standard
fetch destination will be updated, any remote tracking branches with
that name will be updated, and any local branch's remote will be
updated.
TODO: command line connection and test cases

Sorry for the disappearance.
Requested changes are done.
I am still working on the tests. I am unsure how to create a branch and connect it to the remote for the final test. Some help would be appreciated.
