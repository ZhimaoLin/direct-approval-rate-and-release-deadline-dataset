Patch Set 1:

I don't understand why I can run the ssl tests in Eclipse (using the EGit target platform, which also doesn't have this (yet)). Is codec being re-exported somewhere?

Patch Set 1:

The version range in oej.http.test's MANIFEST.MF should be adapted to [1.6.0, 1.10.0), I suppose.

Patch Set 1:

Answering my own questions:

It is re-exported. org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net re-exports it. It has in its MANIFEST.MF:

  Require-Bundle: org.apache.commons.codec;bundle-version="1.3.0";visibility:=reexport,
   org.apache.commons.httpclient;bundle-version="[3.1.0,4.0.0)";visibility:=reexport,
   org.apache.commons.lang;bundle-version="2.3.0";visibility:=reexport

I also see that other bundles that use codec have version ranges like [1.2.0, 2.0.0), so perhaps our upper bound could also be 2.0.0 (exclusive).

So because we have the Mylyn Commons SDK in the EGit target, we also have codec in the target, and thus I was able to run the ssl tests. The JGit target doesn't have mylyn, and so it needs apache codec explicitly.

(It's needed by the test server. However, I kind of suspect a bug in the jetty server bundles: why does that server even advertise DIGEST if codec is not present but needed for the base64 encoding?)

yes, will change the version range

I think we should explicitly add it to the egit target platform in order to avoid depending on mylyn commons SDK' reexport.
I found this since I tried running the tests using a jgit target platform

file a bug for jetty ?
