DESCRIPTION

Revert "Quickfix for AutoCRLF handling"

This reverts commit 88fe2836edab8d8ce82d28acd9d07b061988ff3a.

Auto CRLF isn't special enough to be screwing around with the buffers
used for raw byte processing of the ObjectInserter API. If it needs a
buffer to process a file that is bigger than the buffer allocated by
an ObjectInserter, it needs to do its own buffer management.
