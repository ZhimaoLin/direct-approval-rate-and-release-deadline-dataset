DESCRIPTION

Fix concurrent read / write issue in GitIndex on Windows

GitIndex.write fails if another thread concurrently reads
the index file. The problem is fixed by retrying the rename
operation if it fails.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GitIndex.java -> This stuff should be part of the FS class.  Maybe declare:

  /**
   * Does this file system have problems with atomic renames?
   *
   xxx@xxx.xxx true if the caller should retry a failed rename of a lock file.
   */
  public abstract boolean retryFailedLockFileCommit();

Line:318, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GitIndex.java -> We should put this retry logic into LockFile too, because DirCache uses that.

We could either keep this code here, or better, convert the class to use LockFile rather than its own custom logic.  The LockFile stuff is more robust anyway.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GitIndex.java -> Done

Line:318, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GitIndex.java -> I'll do a separate change for DirCache.
I'll leave the stuff here as is because GitIndex is deprecated.
