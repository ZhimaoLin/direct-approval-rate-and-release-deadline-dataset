Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StashCreateCommand.java -> No need to set hasChanges to true here. It will anyhow be set when we leave the if clause.

Line:285, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StashCreateCommand.java -> shouldn't this line be inside the if clause. Like
  
    ...
    hasChanges = true;
   }
  ...

If the working tree is empty then wtIter will always be null. We will not do any modifications to wtEdits and therefore hasChanges should be false.
