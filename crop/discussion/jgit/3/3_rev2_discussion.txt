DESCRIPTION

Add support for logAllRefUpdates configuration parameter

Honor the configuration parameter core.logAllRefUpdates when writing
reflogs.  Instead of writing reflog entries always only write
reflogs if this parameter is set to true or if the corresponding
file in the <git-dir>/logs directory already exists. In other words:
if you are updating a ref and this parameter is set to false and
there is no file corresponding to your ref in the <git-dir>/logs
folder then no reflog will be written.

This is a fix for the issue http://code.google.com/p/egit/issues/detail?id=4

Actually, your +2 wasn't necessary by the workflow rules for the project.  I had marked it +2 and Matthias marked it IP Clean, which was all Gerrit wanted.

What its waiting for is someone to push the 'Submit Patch Set 2' button.  Which I guess I'll do now...
