DESCRIPTION

Add support for logAllRefUpdates configuration parameter

Honor the configuration parameter core.logAllRefUpdates when writing
reflogs.  Instead of writing reflog entries always only write
reflogs if this parameter is set to true or if the corresponding
file in the <git-dir>/logs directory already exists. In other words:
if you are updating a ref and this parameter is set to false and
there is no file corresponding to your ref in the <git-dir>/logs
folder then no reflog will be written.

This is a fix for the issue http://code.google.com/p/egit/issues/detail?id=4

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CoreConfig.java -> Style-nit: Although not necessary, our convention is to typically use lowercase names in the code.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ReflogConfigTest.java -> yes, you are right. I wanted to express that number of entries in the reflog doesn't change - but this will only be true of reflog entries 0 before we come here. And the comment is completely wrong. I post a fix.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ReflogConfigTest.java -> I'm confused, isn't this supposed to be an empty file at this point, because otherwise we'd still write into it when we logAllRefUpdates to false because the log file exists.

Can we put a better assertion about the starting value of nrOfReflogs before we start making changes?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I would prefer it if the case was consistent here, since we will store exactly this string in the configuration file.

Since our other properties like repositoryformatversion are all lowercase strings, I think we should to the same thing here and make this all lowercase.  Plus, I think that is what git.git does.
