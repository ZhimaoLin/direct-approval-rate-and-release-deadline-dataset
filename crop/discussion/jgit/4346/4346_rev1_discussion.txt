Line:246, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommandTest.java -> The tagList() command is clearly broken. It assumes all objects under the refs/tags/ namespace are annotated tags. The Orion server repository uses lightweight non-annotated tags, which cannot be cast to a RevTag object, which is why the tagList() command fails.

The tagList() command needs to be rewritten to not return a RevTag, but instead return some new tag type that supports both annotated and lightweight tags.
