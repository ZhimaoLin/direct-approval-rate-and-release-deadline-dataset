Line:390, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> During parsing we replace ' ' with '_' to match the toString() format, but during output we don't convert '_' in toString() output to ' '. Shouldn't these be identity transforms?

Line:726, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Why not:

  if (value.names().equals(value.toString())
    n = value.name().toLowerCase().replace('_', ' ');
  else
    n = value.toString();

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you give motivation for this change?

Given feedback on I9739679710e731901d0a50895c981bccc5c3f7a3 this change is likely to be abandoned. Do not commit.

Line:390, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Right, missed that as I don't have ' ' in my toString() in I9739679710e731901d0a50895c981bccc5c3f7a3.

Line:726, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Agreed.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The reason for the change is to fix I22471ee4c8be0ad094976137aa01c263e17f841d. In order to do that I looked for a way to control the way enums are (de)serialized. However, given Matthias' comment on I9739679710e731901d0a50895c981bccc5c3f7a3 I guess I will need to find a better way to do it.
