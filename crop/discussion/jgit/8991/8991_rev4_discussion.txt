DESCRIPTION

Add additional FastForwardMode enums for different config contexts

FastForwardMode should be represented by different enums depending on
context it is set or get from. E.g. FastForwardMode.FF_ONLY for
branch.<name>.mergeoptions is "--ff-only" but for merge.ff it is "only".

Line:390, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> This allows --no_ff, which is, I think, not legal. If we don't have any such options, which I think,. anywhere then it's a simple fix.

Line:390, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Good point, but I think it's valid for any kind of enum which has multiple "-" and "_" in its name. If this is ok with you I would open a separate bugzilla for this.

Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> Well, matching between a String with config value and enum is based the enum's name i.e. "StringUtils.equalsIgnoreCase(e.name(), n))", where n is "__no_ff" in this case. I could change that (in Config.getEnum(T[], String, String, String, T) ) but to be honest I'm find these names.
