DESCRIPTION

PullCommand: support upstream configuration for local branches

When creating a local branch based on another local branch, the
upstream configuration contains "." as origin and the source branch
as "merge". The PullCommand should support this by skipping the
fetch step altogether and use the base branch to merge with.

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Please declare this closer to where it is first initialized.

Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> This call is identical to the one before it on line 164.  Which means its pointless, if the call above returned null, we should get null again here.  I think you meant to test a different key here, but you tested CONFIG_KEY_MERGE again.

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> This comment is wrong.

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> FWIW, FetchCommand should always produce FetchResult, unless there was a network error that prevented communication from occurring.  Even if no objects were obtained, there should still be the advertised refs.  If the ref ISN'T found its an error and you should stop immediately, not fall back on a stale tracking branch that is guessed by naming convention.
