DESCRIPTION

PullCommand: support upstream configuration for local branches

When creating a local branch based on another local branch, the
upstream configuration contains "." as origin and the source branch
as "merge". The PullCommand should support this by skipping the
fetch step altogether and use the base branch to merge with.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

Rather than keep this review hanging, I'm going to cherry-pick it and introduce the local variable.

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Since we need this twice, maybe we should do:

  final boolean isRemote = !remote.equals(".");
