DESCRIPTION

Mavenize JGit build

The output jgit-core JAR file is valid in both Maven and as an OSGi
bundle, if it was renamed and placed into the Eclipse plugins folder.
Within the Eclipse workbench the m2eclipse plugin can be used to
import the existing top level Maven project and get access to the
plugin as well as tests, without needing to mess around with Tycho
or any other tools.

[sp: Whitespace, license, pom metadata corrections, Eclipse fixes]
