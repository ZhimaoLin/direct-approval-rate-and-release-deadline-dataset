You're my hero Matthias, this works well.

I'd advise that we call things "JGit" instead of "Java Git"? Can you make the necessary modifications and then we can push it and get a fresh build.

This is exciting!

Actually, let's just publish what we have now and I'll do the cursory review to see if we are missing anything or things need to change.
