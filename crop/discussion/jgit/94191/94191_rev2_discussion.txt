DESCRIPTION

Buffer "shallow" response until request parsing has done

This is a continuation from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/4716/. For
non-bidirectional request, we need to consume the request before writing
any response. In UploadPack, we write "shallow"/"unshallow" responses
before parsing "have" lines. This happened not to be a problem most of
the cases because the underlying InputStream has a 4KiB buffer.
