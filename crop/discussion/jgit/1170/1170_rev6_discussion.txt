DESCRIPTION

Break dissimilar file pairs during diff

File pairs that are very dissimilar during a diff were not being
broken apart into their constituent ADD/DELETE pairs. The leads to
sub-optimal rename detection. Take, for example, this situation:

A file exists at src/a.txt containing "foo". A user renames src/a.txt
to src/b.txt, then adds a new src/a.txt containing "bar".

Even though the old a.txt and the new b.txt are identical, the
rename detection algorithm would not detect it as a rename since it
was already paired in a MODIFY. I added code to split all MODIFYs
below a certain score into their constituent ADD/DELETE pairs. This
allows situations like the one I described above to be more
correctly handled.
