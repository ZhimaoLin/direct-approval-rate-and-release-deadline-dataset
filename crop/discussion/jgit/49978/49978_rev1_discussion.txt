DESCRIPTION

Add null check to CloneCommand.setBranch

This method is documented to take a branch name (not a possibly null
string).  The only way a caller could have set null without either
re-setting to a sane value afterward or producing NullPointerException
was to also call setNoCheckout(true), in which case there would have
been no reason to set the branch in the first place.

Forbid null to make the semantics clear.

Line:427, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Why don't we just document that branch should not be null. We will anyhow receive an NullPointerException even without your change.

Line:427, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Thanks for the sanity check. I've changed it to imitate what git clone --no-branch does --- what do you think?
