DESCRIPTION

Reduce memory held and speed up DfsGarbageCollector.

getObjectList() returns a list of ObjectToPack. These can hold on to a
lot of memory. Furthermore, binary searching for objects in a sorted
array can be slow. Improve the speed and reduce the memory by creating a
copy of the ObjectId and inserting it into an ObjectIdOwnerMap.
