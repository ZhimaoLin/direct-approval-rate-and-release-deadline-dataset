DESCRIPTION

GitSmartHttpTools: add method to get original status code

Calling one of the sendError methods to produce human-readable output
when talking to a Git client essentially erases some code-readable
information about what caused the error. This is particularly
noticeable when RepositoryFilter converts useful exception types to
HTTP 200 responses, which may cause problems for downstream filters
expecting to read the error code.

As a workaround, when sendError is called, store the provided status
code in a request attribute, and add a method to get it back out.

Unfortunately this only works if sendError was called, not if the
status was set directly, since prior to the Servlet 3.0 API there is no
getStatus() method on HttpServletResponse.
