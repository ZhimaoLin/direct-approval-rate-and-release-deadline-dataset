DESCRIPTION

IndexDiffFilter should never filter entries with stage!=0

If the IndexDiffFilter is asked whether it should include or filter out
a certain path and for that path there is a dircache entry with a stage
different from 0, then the filter should never filter out this entry.
IndexDiffFilter is an optimized version of AnyDiffFilter and there is no
case where the index contains non-0 stages but we still don't see any
diff for that path.
