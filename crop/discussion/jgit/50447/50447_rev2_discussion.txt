Patch Set 2:

This is basically what we need to record push certificates in our reflog for googlesource.com. I freely admit that the idea of a custom reflog implementation is not a very common one. Then again, this is not really much code.

We could also consider appending the push cert blob ID to the default ref update message, so "push: fast forward" => "push: fast forward (cert deadbeef)". Of course then we're back to needing a second ObjectInserter, plus the cert could potentially be garbage collected.

Line:1482, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Does any of this throw IOException? Seems like no.

I would prefer this on line 1480 after setRefLogMessage before addCommand.

Line:1482, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> getPushCertificate() throws IOException because it calls PushCertificateParser#build(), which throws in case of a certificate validation error (e.g. invalid version).
