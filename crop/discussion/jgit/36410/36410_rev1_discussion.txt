DESCRIPTION

Include the java7 feature in org.eclipse.jgit.feature

This way we no longer need to advertise it in the release train and
uncategorize the jgit features without making it harder for users to
find and install the java7 feature.

This looks good to me, and optional dependencies are indeed the right way to go since you want it by default unless it can't be installed.
Is there anything more specific you'd like me to check?

should we also add the source feature as optional dependency ?

Patch Set 1:

If we do that, it would mean that in general, people installing this feature would also get the source feature installed. Is this what they want? My first intuition is that it's not necessary.
