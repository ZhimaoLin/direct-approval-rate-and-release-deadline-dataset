DESCRIPTION

Serve 403 from RepositoryFilter on ServiceMayNotContinueException

This has no effect on Git clients, but for browsers, 403 Forbidden may
be more appropriate. 500 Internal Server Error implies that there is
a problem with the server, whereas ServiceMayNotContinueException is
specifically intended to cover cases where the server is functioning
correctly but has determined that the request may not proceed.
