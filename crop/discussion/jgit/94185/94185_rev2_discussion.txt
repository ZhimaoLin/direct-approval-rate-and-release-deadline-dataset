9.3.9 is the version used in Neon.3

no, it was not intentional to have 9.4.3 in pom.xml

OK, so it's OK to use 9.4.3 in Gerrit if that's the version actually used in JGit?

Note it also needs to be updated in WORKSPACE for the Bazel build.

this is a big mess, for downgrading from 9.4.3 to 9.3.x we have to revert the adaptions done to compensate for missing MappedLoginService used in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/92431/1/org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java

That change is on stable-4.6.  Assuming it should be reverted there:
