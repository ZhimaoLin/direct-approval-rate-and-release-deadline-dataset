DESCRIPTION

Simplify development of commands: added main() to CLIGitCommand

This will execute git commands (with arguments) specified on the command
line, handy for developing/debugging arbitrary git commands. 

The git repository path can be specified via system property
"-Dgit_repo". If not specified, current directory will be used.

I am sure there is something fundamental I didn't get. You teached CLIGitCommand so it can be used from commandline by typing:

  > java ... CLIGitCommand "git log -- src/a"

But why are you not directly calling the Main class

  > java .. org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Main log -- src/a

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> The system property is called "git_repo" and not "-Dgit_repo"

My use case was to supply multiple commands to jgit and debug them from the debugger. Main uses it's own parser so it supports only one command.

This can be done like:
java ... CLIGitCommand "git log -- src/a" "git status" "git add src/a" and by using an Eclipse launch config, this is pretty handy for debugging.
