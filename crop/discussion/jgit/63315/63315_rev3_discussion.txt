DESCRIPTION

Simplify development of commands: added main() to CLIGitCommand

This will execute git commands (with arguments) specified on the command
line, handy for developing/debugging a sequence of arbitrary git
commands working on same repository.

The git working dir path can be specified via Java system property
"git_work_tree". If not specified, current directory will be used.
