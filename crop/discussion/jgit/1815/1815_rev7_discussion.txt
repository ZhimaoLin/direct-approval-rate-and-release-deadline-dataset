DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Provide native lstat() via JNI

Before running the tests on a platform where the native library is not
available set the System property org.eclipse.jgit.fs.native to false
to skip the test of the native code.

For now only implemented on MacOSX until we decided on the platforms
to support.

Also integration of native make into build is not yet done.
Build jgitnative using CDT this will copy the resulting shared
library to the native bundle.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/fs/FSAccessNative.java -> I'm still not sure we need the absolute path here to go into the native layer.  From what I understand of the JRE, you can't change the current working directory, so it should be OK to use a relative path as returned by getPath().  Which avoids unnecessary VFS traversals on some systems.

But whatever.  We can optimize later if its worth it.  This is at least going to ensure an accurate path is passed into the native code.
