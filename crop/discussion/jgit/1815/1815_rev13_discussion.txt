DESCRIPTION

Provide native lstat() via JNI

To avoid building or testing the native code, use

  mvn -Djgit.native.skip=true ...

to disable the code.  If the native library isn't available at
runtime, the native code is disabled automatically, and the root
cause exception is saved for inquiry by applications.

Currently only MacOS X (x86_64) and Linux (x86 and x86_64) are
supported.  Solaris and many other POSIX systems should be simple
to support from the existing common code, but require tweaking of
the libjgit_native build process.  Some placeholder code already
exists for FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD, as it is required to support
the desired Mac OS X target.

Skeleton plugins are supplied to host the native library within
the Eclipse ecosystem, but these contain no code as the library is
built from the common libjgit_native package.

Win32 support is more difficult as an lstat(2) replacement must
be supplied.  This is tricker than just wrapping lstat(2) as the
native Windows APIs need to be used, and their results translated
into the POSIX standard structure.
