DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Provide native lstat() via JNI

Before running the tests on a platform where the native library is not
available set the System property org.eclipse.jgit.fs.native to false
to skip the test of the native code.

For now only implemented on MacOSX until we decided on the platforms
to support.

Also integration of native make into build is not yet done.
Build jgitnative using CDT this will copy the resulting shared
library to the native bundle.
