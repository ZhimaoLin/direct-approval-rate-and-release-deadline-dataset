DESCRIPTION

Allow to use a RAM disk to speed up jgit build & tests on Mac

To create and mount a RAM disk as /Volumes/ramdisk run
$ ./tools/ramdisk
to use it for running jgit tests using Maven run
$ mvn clean install -P ramdisk
This assumes that a ramdisk is mounted under /Volumes/ramdisk
and configures the Maven build directories to reside there.

If you want to use a ramdisk mounted on a different path run
$ mvn clean install -P ramdisk -Dramdisk=/path/to/ramdisk

On my MacBook Pro i7 8 cores 16GB RAM SSD this speeds up
running "mvn clean install -P jgit.java7" on jgit from
01:47 min to 01:37 min when using a test-fork-count of 1C.
On machines with a spinning disk the gains should be larger.

I think the commit could well contain a note on the use of tmpfs on Linux since tmpfs is standard there, and that there are non-standard solutions for Windows.

Line:184, pom.xml -> Only set ramdisk in the profile.
