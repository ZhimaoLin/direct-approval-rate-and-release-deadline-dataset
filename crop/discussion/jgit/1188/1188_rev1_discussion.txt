DESCRIPTION

Move PackWriter configuration to PackConfig

This refactoring permits applications to configure global per-process
settings for all packing and easily pass it through to per-request
PackWriters, ensuring that the process configuration overrides the
repository specific settings.

For example this might help in a daemon environment where the server
wants to cap the resources used to serve a dynamic upload pack
request, even though the repository's own pack.* settings might be
configured to be more aggressive.  This allows fast but less bandwidth
efficient serving of clients, while still retaining good compression
through a cron managed `git gc`.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Just some Javadoc nitpicking.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> We could change these to the following so that one can also see the value here:

Default value of deltas reuse option: xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:610, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> What's with the // at the end?

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java xxx@xxx.xxx should work here.
