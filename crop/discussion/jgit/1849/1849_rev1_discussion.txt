DESCRIPTION

Lazy load note subtrees from fanout levels

Instead of reading a note tree recursively up front when the NoteMap
is loaded, read only the root tree and load subtrees on demand when
they are accessed by the application.  This gives a lower latency
to read a note for the recent commits on a branch, as only the paths
that are needed get read.

Given a 2/38 style fanout, the tree will fully load when 256 objects
have been accessed by the application.  But unlike the prior version
of NoteMap, the NoteMap will load faster and answer lookups sooner,
as the loading time for all 256 levels is spread out across each of
the get() requests.

Given a 2/2/36 style fanout, the tree won't need to fully load until
about 65,536 objects are accessed.
