DESCRIPTION

Only mark packfile invalid if exception signals permanent problem

Add NoPackSignatureException and UnsupportedPackVersionException to
explicitly mark permanent unrecoverable problems with a pack 

Assume problem with a pack is permanent only if we are sure the
exception signals a non-transient problem we can't recover from:
- AccessDeniedException: we lack permissions
- CorruptObjectException: we detected corruption
- EOFException: file ended unexpectedly
- NoPackSignatureException: pack has no pack signature
- NoSuchFileException: file has gone missing
- PackMismatchException: pack no longer matches its index
- UnpackException: unpacking failed
- UnsupportedPackIndexVersionException: unsupported pack index version
- UnsupportedPackVersionException: unsupported pack version

Do not attempt to handle Errors since they are thrown for serious
problems applications should not try to recover from.

> Matthias, when are you planning to release 4.5.2?

I would like to first release 4.7 as soon as the broken EGit UI tests are fixed, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514336

if this takes longer then I can release 4.5.2 first
