DESCRIPTION

Only mark packfile invalid if exception signals permanent problem

Add NoPackSignatureException and UnsupportedPackVersionException to
explicitly mark permanent unrecoverable problems with a pack 

Assume problem with a pack is permanent only if we are sure the
exception signals a non-transient problem we can't recover from:
- EOFException: file ended unexpectedly
- AccessDeniedException: we lack permissions
- NoSuchFileException: file has gone missing
- CorruptObjectException: we detected corruption
- PackMismatchException: pack no longer matches its index
- UnpackException: unpacking failed
- Error: serious problems applications should not try to recover from

@since 4.7 APIs can't go on the stable-4.5 branch, can they?

But this looks like a good change for master.

yes, at least the annotation is wrong

I think we could ignore the API error on 4.5, in the end it's a minor non-breaking API addition helping to fix a problem in a clean way. What do you think ?

Line:662, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> should we handle this at all ?

Line:662, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> IMHO we shouldn't.
