DESCRIPTION

Only mark packfile invalid if exception signals permanent problem

Add NoPackSignatureException and UnsupportedPackVersionException to
explicitly mark permanent unrecoverable problems with a pack 

Assume problem with a pack is permanent only if we are sure the
exception signals a non-transient problem we can't recover from:
- AccessDeniedException: we lack permissions
- CorruptObjectException: we detected corruption
- EOFException: file ended unexpectedly
- Error: serious problems applications should not try to recover from
- NoPackSignatureException: pack has no pack signature
- NoSuchFileException: file has gone missing
- PackMismatchException: pack no longer matches its index
- UnpackException: unpacking failed
- UnsupportedPackIndexVersionException: unsupported pack index version
- UnsupportedPackVersionException: unsupported pack version

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndex.java -> Pass the value only, and format the message inside the constructor?
