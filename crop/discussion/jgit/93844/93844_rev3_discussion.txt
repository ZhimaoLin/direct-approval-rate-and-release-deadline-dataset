DESCRIPTION

Only mark packfile invalid if exception signals permanent problem

Add NoPackSignatureException and UnsupportedPackVersionException to
explicitly mark permanent unrecoverable problems with a pack 

Assume problem with a pack is permanent only if we are sure the
exception signals a non-transient problem we can't recover from:
- EOFException: file ended unexpectedly
- AccessDeniedException: we lack permissions
- NoSuchFileException: file has gone missing
- CorruptObjectException: we detected corruption
- PackMismatchException: pack no longer matches its index
- UnpackException: unpacking failed
- Error: serious problems applications should not try to recover from
