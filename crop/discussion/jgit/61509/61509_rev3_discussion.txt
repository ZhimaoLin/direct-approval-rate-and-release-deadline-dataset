DESCRIPTION

Null-annotated Ref class and fixed related compiler errors

This change fixes all compiler errors in JGit and replaces possible
NPE's with either appropriate exceptions, avoiding multiple "Nullable
return" method calls or early returning from the method.

*nod* sorry for the delay. I finally got the Nullable change out (https://git.eclipse.org/r/62148) so now I can look at this again.

Line:1162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> An alternative way to phrase this would be to make ObjectIdRef.Unpeeled.getObjectId return non-null:

xxx@xxx.xxx
xxx@xxx.xxx
 public ObjectId getObjectId() {
   ObjectId id = super.getObjectId();
   assert id != null; // checked in constructor
   return id;
 }

Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Ref.java -> to indicate a ref that does not exist yet or a symbolic ref pointing to an unborn branch
