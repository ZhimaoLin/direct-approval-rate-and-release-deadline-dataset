Patch Set 5:

I can try making a change on top for those two comments if you don't get to it first. This change has been in review for long enough.

For future classes, I'd be happiest with separate changes that fix the problems revealed by nullness annotations, followed by a change that annotates the class. That way most of the changes can be reviewed and applied quickly, instead of waiting for everything to be in good shape at once with a big bang. (Most are bugfixes so it is valuable to get them applied asap.) That said, the review-everything-at-once method has also been working fine for me if you strongly prefer it.
