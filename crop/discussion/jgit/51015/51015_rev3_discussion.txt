Thanks. I think this heads in the right direction.

Line:854, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> What does it mean when the return value is null? How should the caller interpret that result?

If HEAD is pointing to a branch yet to be born (e.g., immediately after running "git init"), will this return null or the name of that branch?

Line:857, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> JGit doesn't xxx@xxx.xxx anywhere else, so this looks out of place.

Line:880, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Likewise.
