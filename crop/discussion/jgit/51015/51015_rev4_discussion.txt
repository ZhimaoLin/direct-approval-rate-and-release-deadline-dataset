Line:854, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> RepositoryCache.FileKey.isGitRepository checks that HEAD exists and is either a symref or pointing to a valid objectid.

Alas, it's possible to bypass that check by creating a FileRepository directly (instead of using findGitDir). E.g:

 $ jgit init
 Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git
 $ rm .git/HEAD
 $ jgit status
 fatal: error: can't find git directory
 $ GIT_DIR=$(pwd)/.git jgit status
 Not currently on any branch.

So perhaps this should say

 or null if the current repository is an invalid repository
 without a HEAD.

For comparison, C git diagnoses this kind of repository as invalid:

 $ GIT_DIR=$(pwd)/.git git status
 fatal: Not a git repository: '/tmp/test/.git'

(Side note: I think teaching FileRepositoryBuilder to enforce that the repository it opens satisfies isGitRepository would be a good check. That still wouldn't take care of this, because it's possible for someone to corrupt the repository after it has been opened.)

I'm also tempted to make this throw an exception instead of returning null, but documenting it like you do is the more conservative change (so likely a better idea in the short term). Thanks.
