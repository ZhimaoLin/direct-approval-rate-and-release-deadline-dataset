Line:259, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BundleWriter.java -> this generates the warning:

"BundleWriter.setObjectCountCallback(PackWriterObjectCountCallback) has non-API parameter type ObjectCountCallback"

since this method is public API but ObjectCountCallback is not API because it's located in an internal package "org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.pack" which is not publicly exported in manifest.mf (only accessible by x-friends)

Looks like ObjectCountCallback should be public API as well
