DESCRIPTION

Expose PackWriter stats in BundleWriter.

Most stats are only available after writeBundle function finishes. The
count of objects is available during writeBundle function call, and is
most important, so add a callback in PackWriter and a dedicated function
in BundleWriter for it.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/WriteAbortedException.java -> It's too bad we have to do this.

An alternative would be to extend RuntimeException, which would also be unpleasant.

Line:257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BundleWriter.java -> Could this part go in a separate commit?

Line:182, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> How about something like this?

 /**
  * Invoked when the PackWriter has counted the objects to be written
  * to pack.
  * <p>
  * An ObjectCountCallback can use this information to decide whether
  * the xxx@xxx.xxx writePack} operation should be aborted.
  *
  * ...
  */

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Would another name make the meaning of the return value easier to remember?  E.g.,

 boolean writePackShouldContinue(long objectCount);

or:

 void onObjectsCounted(long objectCount)
     throws WriteAbortedException;

Line:946, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Please add a xxx@xxx.xxx WriteAbortedException" pointing to the callback.
