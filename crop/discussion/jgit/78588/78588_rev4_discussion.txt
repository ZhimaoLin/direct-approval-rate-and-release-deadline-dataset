Patch Set 4:

This still doesn't seem to be working properly, but I'm not sure what's going on.

When an error response is sent back to the client, the message is not displayed.  At first I thought it was simply that the client is not using the message, but after seeing this upstream issue [1] I realised that it does use it.  In the case of the responses from Gerrit it's simply displaying a generic error message because there is no content in the body.  See [2] for a log.
