DESCRIPTION

Add oldPath parameter to RepoCommand API.

This is for updating the repo manifest (instead of add a new manifest). It's
only available for bare repositories for now as remove submodules with working
tree is dangerous and we don't really need that.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> This is entirely unnecessary. You create an empty index on line 558. There is nothing to read from .gitmodules. There is nothing to delete from the index.

You then proceed to write all new content out to the index, and commit that. You "update" by just "replacing it all". Which is actually pretty damn simple.

So I'm confused about why you need this change.

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Although these delete operations are upon an empty index, they'll be executed upon real tree when writeTree() is called. Or that's what I understand it.

This will be useful when there were something in the old manifest but no longer in the new manifest, like removed copyfile, or removed/renamed project (gitlink). I have a unit test to make sure that the removal of copyfile works.

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> That is not how writeTree works. :)

The DirCache (aka index) has a complete list of the files in the repository. writeTree just copies that into the commit. If you pass an empty DirCache into writeTree, you get an empty repository.

Right, I have some misunderstanding on that before. Added note of the behavior and changed the change description. Removed the code but keep the unit test to ensure that behavior.

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Done.
