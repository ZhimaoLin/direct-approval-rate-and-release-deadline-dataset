Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/BranchTest.java -> is this test related to the feature? You can let it in, but I just want to understand whether the feature influences this situation.

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/BranchTest.java -> Yes, because this change changes the logic for that in Branch.java and there was no test at all for this before.
