DESCRIPTION

Add percent-encoding of reserved characters in URIish

We do this for the the names that have an explicit scheme and
do it both ways. The URIish is parsed before decoding. Only
a few special characters are encoded for the path part of the
URI, i.e. space, non-ASCII and control characters. The percent
encoding is assumed to be a stream encoding so we interpret it
as UTF-8.

Line:284, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> I was confused by the name 'reserve' (nothing is beeing reserved when this flag is true). Something like escapeReservedChars would be clearer

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Does C Git support escaping the path in a ssh:// or git+ssh:// or ssh+git:// style URIish?

And in an HTTP style URIish, we have to re-escape when we pass the URI to the remote HTTP server. So why are we bothering with the unescape here?

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> I don't think C Git supports escaped paths in the SCP style URIish. I thought it passed the path through as-is to the remote host. So isn't it wrong for JGit to unescape %20 here?

Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> This set reference can be final.

Line:294, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Instead of Error we throw RuntimeException when the encoding is not supported.

Line:301, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> This would encode %A not %0A. It should always be 2 digits.

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> C Git support escapes in ssh:// yes and this seems to apply for all scheme:// formats. I was a bit surprised when I
discovered it because I deliberately skipped this when I wrote this class originally, just because C Git didn't (or I though it didn't). I'll change class comment too.

I parse all fields so we can read them as clear text. Didn't think
of HTTP though. If we create an HTTP URL from plain text, we need to escape it even if it wasn't escape at first, so this is consistent, I think. It may not be very efficient, but then how many times do we decode/encode? The constructor throws
and exception if the string is not valid so we have to parse always. 

A bonus (or feature...) is that toString normlizes the encoding.

Done.
