DESCRIPTION

Add percent-encoding of reserved characters in URIish

We do this for the the names that have an explicit scheme and
do it both ways. The URIish is parsed before decoding. Only
a few special characters are encoded for the path part of the
URI, i.e. space, non-ASCII and control characters. The percent
encoding is assumed to be a stream encoding so we interpret it
as UTF-8.
