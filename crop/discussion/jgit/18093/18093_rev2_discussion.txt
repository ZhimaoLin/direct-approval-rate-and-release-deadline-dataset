DESCRIPTION

Cache SimpleDateFormat in GitDateParser per locale

Otherwise switching to another locale yields wrong results when parsing
date strings in GitDateParser. Since the MockSystemReader explicitly
uses english locale the tests need to specify the locale to be used when
parsing date strings.

Patch Set 2:

Looks good to me. But wouldn't it be nice to also have a test which shows the wrong behaviour? A test which does some parsing with one locale and then after switching the locale see unexpected results.
