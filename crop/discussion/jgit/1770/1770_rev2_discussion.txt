Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

- build fails since it can't find the specified SNAPSHOT version of the findbugs plugin
- we should only depend on released plugin versions
- plugin versions and their configuration should be defined in the plugin management section of the parent pom to prevent redundant configuration and problems caused by different plugin versions used by different individual poms

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit.console/pom.xml -> I don't like the idea to use a SNAPSHOT version
