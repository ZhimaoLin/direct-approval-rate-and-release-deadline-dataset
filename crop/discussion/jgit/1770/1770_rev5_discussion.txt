DESCRIPTION

Add FindBugs and CPD to the build.

We need to use findbugs-maven-plugin:2.3.2-SNAPSHOT
since otherwise build fails with maven-3.0 [1], [2].
We should switch to the release version as soon
as this becomes available.

I now understand why you wanted to use the snapshot version for the findbugs plugin [1]. The version 2.3.2 only works with maven 3.0 beta 3 but fails with the maven 3.0 version which has been released recently.

Hence I added the codehaus snapshot repository to enable using the maven-findbugs-2.3.2-SNAPSHOT version which fixes the problem.
