DESCRIPTION

Add a JGit-internal Nullable type

Commit 847b3d1 enabled annotation-based NPE analysis to JGit.

In so doing, it introduced a new dependency on the org.eclipse.jdt that
is undesirable. Follow Gerrit's lead by adding an internal Nullable type
(see
https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.11/gerrit-common/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/common/Nullable.java). 

The javax.annotations.Nullable class uses a retention policy of RUNTIME,
whereas the org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable class used a policy of
CLASS. Since I'm not aware of tools that make use of the annotation at
runtime I chose the CLASS policy. If in the future there is a benefit to
retaining the annotations in the running binary we can update this
class.
