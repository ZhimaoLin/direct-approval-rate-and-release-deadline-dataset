Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I miss the code updating these monitors, so it looks like you enable setting a monitor but it will never report any progress ?

Hi Matthias,

Actually we tried to minimize the changes made to JGit in this patch.
Passing the monitor allows EMFCompare to report progress in its own implementation of MergeStrategy, which can be time-consuming.
If you want, we can add progress reporting in JGit classes too.
And FYI, we also have a patch to push to EGit once this one is merged

Patch Set 2:

+1 from me to merge it now. Adding progress reporting to all JGit Mergers could be done in seperate changes.
