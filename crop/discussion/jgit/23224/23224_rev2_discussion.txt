DESCRIPTION

Permit ObjectChecker to optionally accept leading '0' in trees

The leading '0' is a broken mode that although incorrect in the
Git canonical tree format was created by a couple of libraries
frequently used on a popular Git hosting site. Some projects have
these modes stuck in their ancient history and cannot easily
repair the damage without a full history rewrite. Optionally permit
ObjectChecker to ignore them.

Line:330, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectChecker.java -> Probably not. Does git-core accept a tree with "0040000"?

Line:330, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectChecker.java -> It probably shouldn't accept that, but it does.

Only having to use 1 bit to count the leading zeroes would be useful for alternate index or packfile formats. But "git fsck" just checks whether the first character of the mode is '0' (emitting a warning if it is) and then uses the normal tree entry parsing machinery that doesn't care about such things.

I'll try a weather balloon patch to see if people are ok with tightening to always reject the 00... thing. Best not to make jgit stricter until it's been tried out in git-core.
