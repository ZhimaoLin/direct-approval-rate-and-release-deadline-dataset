DESCRIPTION

Permit ObjectChecker to optionally accept leading '0' in trees

The leading '0' is a broken mode that although incorrect in the
Git canonical tree format was created by a couple of libraries
frequently used on a popular Git hosting site. Some projects have
these modes stuck in their ancient history and cannot easily
repair the damage without a full history rewrite. Optionally permit
ObjectChecker to ignore them.
