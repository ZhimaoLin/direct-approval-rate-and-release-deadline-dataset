DESCRIPTION

Change test pom.xml to use plain junit launcher

Still resolving dependencies from p2 repositories. Tests from exttst source
folder are failing since they need additional external setup, so they are
excluded from execution.

Transferred to Gerrit from mail to egit-dev

Patch Set 3: Abandoned

No longer necessary since we aren't trying to use a manifest-first build process right now.
