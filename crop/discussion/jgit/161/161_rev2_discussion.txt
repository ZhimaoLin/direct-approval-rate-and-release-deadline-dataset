DESCRIPTION

Change test pom.xml to use plain junit launcher

Still resolving dependencies from p2 repositories. Tests from exttst source
folder are failing since they need additional external setup, so they are
excluded from execution.

Transferred to Gerrit from mail to egit-dev

Patch Set 2: No score

Made sure build uses the same encoding (UTF-8 for sources, ISO-8859-1 for filtered resources) regardless of host system configuration. All tests pass both on linux and windows for me now.
