DESCRIPTION

Add a log4j impl to the pgm package

When the calling commands from the pgm package from commandline you
used to get warnings from log4j about failing to load a
StaticLoggerBinder. Based on [1] I added slf4j-log4j12.jar to the
dependencies. Now you can call pgm commands without this warning.

I couldn't find out how to do the same for the exclipse environment
(MANIFEST.MF)? When I start a pgm command from inside eclipse I
still get the warning.

Abandoned

No, I overlooked this. I came from the mentioned buzgilla bug and I wanted just to get rid of the warning messages when you execute a pgm command.
