DESCRIPTION

Don't use java.util.regex for two simple wildcard cases

To improve ignore parser performance we can avoid using java.util.regex
code on simple wildcard patterns with leading or trailing asterisk. As
those patterns represent a majority of ignore rules, the index diff
performance can be drastically increased on huge repository with lot of
ignore rules.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/LeadingAsteriskMatcher.java -> asterisk:" -> asterisk: "

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/LeadingAsteriskMatcher.java -> Could you make j start at `endExcl - 1` and decrement it? May be a bit easier to understand if both go backwards and are indexes.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/Strings.java -> You could optimize these three methods by only going through the characters of the pattern in one iteration, checking for the special characters, and then returning an enum LEADING_ONLY, TRAILING_ONLY, COMPLEX.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/FastIgnoreRuleTest.java -> If you split the changes in this and the other test off into its own commit, we can game the legal requirement of having a CQ (which starts at 200 changed lines AFAIK) :).

CQ seems to be not needed, and the rest I will do next week. Thanks!

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/FastIgnoreRuleTest.java -> https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committerguidelines.php claims that it requires1000 lines to be significant.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/FastIgnoreRuleTest.java -> the threshold for CQ was increased from 250 to 1000 added lines some months ago. This is also mentioned in the contributor guide
https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Legal_Paperwork

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/FastIgnoreRuleTest.java -> Ok. Just remember in general not to mix unrelated changes. Having this change on its own would have been pretty much an instant approval, making the second review smaller.
