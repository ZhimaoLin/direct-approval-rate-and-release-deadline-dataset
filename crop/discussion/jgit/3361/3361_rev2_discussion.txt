Line:489, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.properties -> a text which doesn't contain "year" or "month" but called "yearsMonthsAgo"? Strange, or?

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RelativeDateFormatter.java -> That strategy of converting age incrementally from seconds to minutes, from minutes to days and so leads to very nice to read & understand code ... but in the end it's much slower than

// convert to seconds
long age = (System.currentTimeMillis() - when.getTime()) / 1000;

if (age < 90)
...
else if (age < 90*60...)
..

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:489, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.properties -> it's the template used to build the "x years, y months" format, if x or y are 1 we have to use singular, as other languages may require a different order of arguments I have chosen this nested approach
