DESCRIPTION

SignerV4: Remove TODO related to caching DateFormat instances

As described in this answer on Stack Overflow [1] DateFormat instances
are not thread-safe and should not be referenced from a static context.

The recommended way to use DateFormat is to use local instances, which
is what the current implementation already does.

It would be possible to avoid any performance overhead of allocating a
local instance each time by having a global instance with synchronized
access, but comments on [1] suggest that this would be a premature
optimization.

Yet another alternative solution [2] is to use the FastDateFormat from
commons-lang, but commons-lang is not used in this project so this would
require adding a new dependency.
