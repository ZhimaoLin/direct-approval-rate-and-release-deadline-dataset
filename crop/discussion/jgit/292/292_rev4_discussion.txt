DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: Enable side-band-64k capability for status reports

We now advertise the side-band-64k capability inside of ReceivePack,
allowing hooks to echo status messages down the side band channel
instead of over the optional stderr stream.

This change permits hooks running inside of an http:// based push
invocation to still message the end-user with more detailed errors
than the small per-command string in the status report.

Line:447, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Worth putting in a check to ensure that there is no LF in the message?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:447, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> No, I don't think its worth rejecting an LF in the string.  The reason we say "must not contain LF" in the javadoc is because we don't do a replaceAll of "\n" with "\nerror: " to get the prefix we insert injected at the start of each line.  Maybe I'll come back and actually relax that Javadoc to say "should not" instead of "must not".
