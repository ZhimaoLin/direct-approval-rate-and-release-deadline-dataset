DESCRIPTION

Throw IndexReadException if existing index can't be read

If the index file exists but can't be read for example because of wrong
filesystem permissions we should throw a specific exception. This allows
EGit to handle this error situation.

Line:423, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Strange --- does the FileInputStream constructor or readFrom throw FileNotFoundException for permissions errors?

Line:423, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Ah, yes it does. Strange API. Thanks for finding it.

RebaseCommand, LoadCachedPack, LockFile, ObjectDirectory, RefDirectory, ReflogReaderImpl, UnpackedObject, Repository, FileBasedConfig might have similar bugs.

Line:423, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> I am not sure whether we have similar problems a lot. One specific thing about the code here is that  we do receive an IOException but we don't want to let it bubble up. Instead we eat up the exception and continue with an empty index.

Remember: in this case we asked for file.exists() which returned true. Directly afterwards we open an inputstream and get an IOException (strangely a FileNotFoundException). In my personal opinion instead of assuming the very rare case that in between the two java statements somebody deleted the file we should simply let the exception bubble up.
