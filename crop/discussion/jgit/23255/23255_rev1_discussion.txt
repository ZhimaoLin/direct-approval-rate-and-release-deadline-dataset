DESCRIPTION

Rename test class so it is also executed during maven test phase

One specific test was executed when running tests from inside eclipse
(e.g. by using one of our checked in launch configurations). But when
running tests from maven this test was not executed. Maven (the surefire
plugin) looks for Tests only in java files which are named like
"Test*.java", "*Test.java" or "*TestCase.java". Tests in files named
"*Tests.java" are not found.
