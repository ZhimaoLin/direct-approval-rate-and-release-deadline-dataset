DESCRIPTION

Reset SSH connection and credentials on "Auth fail"

When SSH user/password authentication failed this may have been caused
by changed credentials on the server side. When the SSH credentials of a
user change the SSH connection needs to be re-established and
credentials which may have been stored by the credentials provider
need to be reset in order to enable prompting for the new credentials.

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> How does the caller break out of this loop when the reset() doesn't work?  The default reset() implementation does nothing, which means the retry attempt inside of the catch block will not change anything and the code will be stuck in a loop forever.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> Does disconnect() no-op if connect failed? Or do we need to guard this with if (session.isConnected()) session.disconnect()?

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> fixed this to allow not more than 2 retries

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> without this I wasn't able to reconnect as connect() did hang when retrying. session.disconnect() has a guard internally already.

Currently I can't test anymore as Denis' intrusion prevention heuristics locked my IP and he didn't yet manage to unlock me again.

Maybe we should seek IP approval for apache sshd to implement a sshd for testing this properly.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> If we seek IP approval for Apache MINA SSHD, we should also switch our main SSH client over to use MINA SSHD client. It is probably better written.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> I'll create the necessary CQs for that
