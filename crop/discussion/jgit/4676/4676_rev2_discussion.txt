DESCRIPTION

Reset SSH connection and credentials on "Auth fail"

When SSH user/password authentication failed this may have been caused
by changed credentials on the server side. When the SSH credentials of a
user change the SSH connection needs to be re-established and
credentials which may have been stored by the credentials provider
need to be reset in order to enable prompting for the new credentials.
