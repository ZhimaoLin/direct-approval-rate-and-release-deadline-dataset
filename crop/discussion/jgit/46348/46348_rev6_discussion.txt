DESCRIPTION

Better report too large pack-files from PushCommand

JGits PushCommand and BasePackPushConnection were throwing generic
TransportExceptions when the pushed pack-file was rejected by the server
since it was too big. Let JGit better interprete the server's response
to detect this situation and throw a more specific exception.

This detection works by parsing the status line sent by the server. This
change only recognizes the response sent by a JGit based server. All
other servers which report such problems in a different way still lead
to a generic TransportExceptions.

Line:319, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackPushConnection.java -> I think you want to remove the "error " prefix here, given how its added by the BaseReceivePack code.
