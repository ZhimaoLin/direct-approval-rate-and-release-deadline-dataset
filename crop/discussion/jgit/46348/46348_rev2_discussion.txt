DESCRIPTION

Better report too large pack-files from PushCommand

JGits PushCommand and BasePackPushConnection where throwing generic
TransportExceptions when the pushed pack-file was too big for the
server. Let JGit better interprete the servers response to detect this
situation and throw a more specific exception.
This detection works by parsing the status line sent by the server. This
change only recognizes the response sent by a JGit based server. All
other servers which report such problems in a different way still lead
to generic TransportExceptions.
