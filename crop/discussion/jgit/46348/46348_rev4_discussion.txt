DESCRIPTION

Better report too large pack-files from PushCommand

JGits PushCommand and BasePackPushConnection were throwing generic
TransportExceptions when the pushed pack-file was rejected by the server
since it was too big. Let JGit better interprete the server's response
to detect this
situation and throw a more specific exception.
This detection works by parsing the status line sent by the server. This
change only recognizes the response sent by a JGit based server. All
other servers which report such problems in a different way still lead
to generic TransportExceptions.

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/TooLargePackException.java -> unnecessary blank line between @param xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/TooLargePackException.java -> unnecessary final

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/TooLargePackException.java -> This could fit on one line.

Line:318, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackPushConnection.java -> why is Pack name case in the message? Maybe we should lowercase the p in the error text?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> oddly line wrapped

Line:318, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackPushConnection.java -> I think this string lacks a ":"

 s/error Pack exceeds the limit of/error: Pack exceeds the limit of/

I think the error message is here 

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tree/org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties#n485

and formatted here 

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tree/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java#n839

Line:318, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackPushConnection.java -> no I was wrong, the error message is formatted here

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tree/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java#n1460

not sure if this is correct or if this formatting is wrong and should read

 s#"unpack error " + unpackError.getMessage()#"unpack error: " + unpackError.getMessage()#
