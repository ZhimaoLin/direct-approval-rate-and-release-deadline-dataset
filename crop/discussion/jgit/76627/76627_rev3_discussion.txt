DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: report protocol parsing failures on channel 3

If the client sent a well-formed enough request to see it wants to use
side-band-64k for status reporting (meaning its a modern client), but
any other command record was somehow invalid (e.g. corrupt SHA-1)
report the parsing exception using channel 3.  This allows clients to
see the failure and know the server will not be continuing.

git-core and JGit clients send all commands and then start a sideband
demux before sending the pack. By consuming all commands first we get
the client into a state where it can see and respond to the channel 3
server failure.

This behavior is useful on HTTPS connections when the client is buggy
and sent a corrupt command, but still managed to request side-band-64k
in the first line.
