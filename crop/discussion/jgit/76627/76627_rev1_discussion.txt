DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: report protocol parsing failures on channel 3

If the client sent a well-formed enough request to see it wants to use
side-band-64k for status reporting (meaning its a modern client), but
any other command record was somehow invalid (e.g. corrupt SHA-1)
report the parsing exception using channel 3.  This allows clients to
see the failure and know the server will not be continuing.

git-core and JGit clients send all commands and then start a sideband
demux before sending the pack. By consuming all commands first we get
the client into a state where it can see and respond to the channel 3
server failure.

This behavior is useful on HTTPS connections when the client is buggy
and sent a corrupt command, but still managed to request side-band-64k
in the first line.

(3 comments)

Line:890, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> optional: could simplify by making errOut a MessageOutWrapper.

If not, please use the same comment

 // Ignore write failures.

to make it clearer what kind of failures are expected and that the intent is to ignore them, not just for them not to happen.

Line:1119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> unrelated? Moving the enableCapabilities() call here looks like a good change but makes the change harder to follow.

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> Why ignore the failure? It's not clear from the surrounding code.

It might be easier to follow if the catch were in the caller.

Line:890, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Changed the comment. I think a MessageOutWrapper is overkill.

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> Done
