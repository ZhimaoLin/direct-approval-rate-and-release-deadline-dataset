DESCRIPTION

Show notes in Log command

Support for --no-standard-notes and --show-notes=REF options is added
to the Log command. The --show-notes option can be specified more than
once if more than one notes branch should be used for showing notes.

The notes are displayed from note branches in the order how the note
branches are specified in the command line. However, the stanard note,
from the refs/notes/commits, is always displayed as first unless
the --no-standard-notes options is given.
