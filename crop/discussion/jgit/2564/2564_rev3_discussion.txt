DESCRIPTION

Show notes in Log CLI command

Support for --no-standard-notes and --show-notes=REF options is added
to the Log command. The --show-notes option can be specified more than
once if more than one notes branch should be used for showing notes.

The notes are displayed from note branches in the order how the note
branches are specified in the command line. However, the standard note,
from the refs/notes/commits, is always displayed as first unless
the --no-standard-notes options is given.

Patch Set 3: (6 inline comments)



Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Why are we using a new RevWalk and a new ObjectReader here? The base class has both already. Can we reuse those instead?

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Do you mean

  !additionalNoteRefs.isEmpty()

Here? Its always not null, so the last part is always true.

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Since getNoteMap() can return null, does it make sense to put a null NoteMap in the noteMaps? Or should we omit that entry?

If we are going to put it, maybe its better to have getNoteMap() return an empty NoteMap instead of null, so we don't need to worry about null pointer checks.

Line:307, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Style-nit:

  atLeastOnePrinted |= printedNode

is shorter.

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> This NPEs if the note ref doesn't exist because getNoteMap() returned null. Either change getNoteMap() to return an empty NoteMap, or don't put the null NoteMap into the noteMaps collection.

Line:337, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Why are you using RawText? The only reason to use it here is to have it split the lines up into strings for you... but then you go and convert the entire file to a string and split that manually.

Either use RawText to obtain the string lines one at a time (and thus rely on its LF splitting logic), or pass the whole blob through RawParseUtils.decode():

  String s = RawParseUtils.decode(reader
    .open(blobId)
    .getBytes(Integer.MAX_VALUE));

The issues will be fixed in another change. This one was submitted before they were identified.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Right we should reuse them. The RevWalk I found but I can't find an ObjectReader in the base class(es)

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Done.

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> if getNoteMap() returns null we should not put it into the noteMaps. Done

Line:307, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Done

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Done. Will not put nulls into noteMaps

Line:337, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> Done
