DESCRIPTION

ArchiveTest: Don't use string concatenation in loop

According to FindBugs:

  In each iteration, the String is converted to a StringBuffer/
  StringBuilder, appended to, and converted back to a String. This
  can lead to a cost quadratic in the number of iterations, as the
  growing string is recopied in each iteration.

Replace string concatenation with StringBuffer.

Thanks.

Line:531, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> nit: can simplify by using default constructor

Line:551, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> likewise
