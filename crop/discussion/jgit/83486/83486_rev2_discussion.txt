DESCRIPTION

ArchiveTest: Don't use string concatenation in loop

According to FindBugs:

  In each iteration, the String is converted to a StringBuffer/
  StringBuilder, appended to, and converted back to a String. This
  can lead to a cost quadratic in the number of iterations, as the
  growing string is recopied in each iteration.

Replace string concatenation with StringBuffer.
