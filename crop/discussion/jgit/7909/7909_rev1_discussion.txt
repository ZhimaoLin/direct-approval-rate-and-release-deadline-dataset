DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable test

Add more time to a timestamp to safely go beyond the granularity of
the timestamp resolution of the file system. The lowest resolution we
know of is FAT with two second resolution. Then add some to make sure we
are above the limit.

Line:324, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> We have the utility method fstick() to wait for a tick of the filesystem timer. So 

  write(file1, "content4");
  fsTick();  // wait until you see the the filesystem timer jumps
  write(file1, "content4");

should do the same. And the good think: on windows it runs much faster the your code.
