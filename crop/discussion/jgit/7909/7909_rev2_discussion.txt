DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable test

Add more time to a timestamp to safely go beyond the granularity of
the timestamp resolution of the file system. The lowest resolution we
know of is FAT with two second resolution. Then add some to make sure we
are above the limit.

Line:326, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> You can delete now this line containing setLastModified(). fsTick()+write(file1, "content4") is a replacement for the original assertTrue(file1.setLastModified(...)).
