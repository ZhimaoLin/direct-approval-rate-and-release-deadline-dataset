DESCRIPTION

Implement rebase fast forward for upstream branches with merge commits

Change Ib9898fe0f982fa08e41f1dca9452c43de715fdb6 added support for
the 'cherry-pick' fast forward case where the upstream commit history
does not include any merge commits.  This change adds support for the
case where merge commits exist and the local branch has no changes.
