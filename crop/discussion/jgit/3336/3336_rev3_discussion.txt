DESCRIPTION

Implement rebase fast forward for upstream branches with merge commits

Change Ib9898fe0f982fa08e41f1dca9452c43de715fdb6 added support for
the 'cherry-pick' fast forward case where the upstream commit history
does not include any merge commits.  This change adds support for the
case where merge commits exist and the local branch has no changes.

Line:546, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> We could create a static RebaseResult.FAST_FORWARD_RESULT, just like RebaseResult.UP_TO_DATE_RESULT, and use that.

Line:532, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> You are too fast for me :-) In order to explain what I wanted I was trying out the following lines here:

if (walk.isMergedInto(upstreamCommit, headCommit)) {
  return RebaseResult.UP_TO_DATE_RESULT;
} else if (walk.isMergedInto(headCommit, upstreamCommit)) {
  checkoutCommit(upstreamCommit);
  updatePreviousHead(headName, upstreamCommit);
  return new RebaseResult(RebaseResult.Status.FAST_FORWARD);
}

... just to see that your latest proposal is the nearly the same. I would only change your check for UP_TO_DATE_RESULT to mine. Imagine somebody invokes a rebase of HEAD to HEAD~3. That's also an up-to-date result

Line:546, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> +1
