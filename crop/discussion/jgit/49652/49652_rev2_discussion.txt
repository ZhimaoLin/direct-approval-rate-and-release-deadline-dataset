DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Use reachable-sha1-in-want configuration

C git 2.5 supports setting the equivalent of
RequestPolicy.REACHABLE_COMMIT with uploadpack.allowreachablesha1inwant.
Parse this into TransportConfig and use it from UploadPack. An explicitly
set RequestPolicy overrides the config, and the policy may still be
upgraded on a unidirectional connection to avoid races.

Patch Set 2:

Have now manually checked that uploadpack.allowreachablesha1inwant=true and =false on the server side works as expected for the client. Made similar tests as in C git t/t5516-fetch-push.sh
