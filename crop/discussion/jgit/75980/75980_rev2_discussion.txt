DESCRIPTION

Add GC_REST PackSource to better order DFS packs

Force reads to use a search ordering of:

  INSERT / RECEIVE
  COMPACT
  GC (heads)
  GC_REST (non-heads)
  GC_TXN (refs/txn)
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE

This has provided decent performance for object lookups.  Starting
from an arbitrary reference may find the content in a newer pack
created by DfsObjectInserter or a ReceivePack server.  Compaction of
recent packs also contains newer content, and then most interesting
data is in the "main" GC pack.  As the GC pack is self-contained (has
no edges leading outside) readers typically do not need to go further.

Adding a new GC_REST PackSource allows the DfsGarbageCollector to
identify to the pack ordering code which pack is which, so the
non-heads are scanned second during reads.  This removes a hack that
was unique to Google's implementation that enforced this behavior by
fixing up the lastModified timestamp.

Renumber the PackSource's categories to reflect this search ordering.
