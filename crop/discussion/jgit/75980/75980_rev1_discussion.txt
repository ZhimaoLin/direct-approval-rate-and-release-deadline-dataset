DESCRIPTION

Add GC_REST PackSource to better order DFS packs

Google's internal version of DfsObjDatabase enforces this ordering of
packs by fixing up lastModified timestamps to match try and force an
ordering of:

  INSERT / RECEIVE
  COMPACT
  GC (heads)
  GC (rest)
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE

This has provided decent performance for object lookups as starting
from an arbitrary reference may find the content in a newer pack
created by DfsObjectInserter, a ReceivePack server. Compaction of
recent packs also contains newer content, and then most interesting
data is in the "main" GC pack.

Add a new GC_REST PackSource allows the DfsGarbageCollector to
identify to the pack ordering code which pack is which, so the
non-heads are scanned 2nd during reads.  This removes a hack that was
unique to Google's implementation that enforced this behavior by
fixing up the lastModified timestamp.

Renumber the PackSource's categories to reflect this ordering.
