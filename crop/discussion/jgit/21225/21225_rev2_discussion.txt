DESCRIPTION

Initialise ReceiveCommand status to NOT_ATTEMPTED for all constructors

Formerly the 4-arg constructor did not do this, which was unfortunate
as that constructor's the only way for an external user of JGit to set
the /type/ of the ref-update - which you might want to do to indicate
that the update is expected to be a UPDATE_NONFASTFORWARD, and thus does
not require expensive isMergedInto() calculations:
