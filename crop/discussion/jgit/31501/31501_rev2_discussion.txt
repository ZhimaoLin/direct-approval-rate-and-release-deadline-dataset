Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV2.java -> I'm a fan of including as much information as possible in errors. Could you add the parsed bucketCnt to the message, and also mention that it was negative, something like "Invalid negative bucket count read from pack v2 index file: {0}"?

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV2.java -> This is not mentioned in the commit message, but it should be. Even better, please separate it into a separate change.
