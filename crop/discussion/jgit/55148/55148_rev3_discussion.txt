DESCRIPTION

Prevent alternates loop

When looping through alternates, prevent visiting the same object
directory twice. This could happen when the objects/info/alternates file
includes itself directly or indirectly via a another repo and its
alternates file.

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/CachedObjectDirectory.java -> That doesn't seem to match the style in these classes for single line blocks.

Line:32, README.md -> Done

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/CachedObjectDirectory.java -> It doesn't, but in recent reviews we have been told to add the braces on one-liners in new code (even when surrounding existing code does not have them).

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/CachedObjectDirectory.java -> we changed style a long time back but agreed to avoid global reformatting so for new or modified code we use braces
