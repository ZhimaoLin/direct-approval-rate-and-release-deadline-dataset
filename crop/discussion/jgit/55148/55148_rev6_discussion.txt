includes itself directly or indirectly via a another repo and its
alternates file.

Line:509, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Would this be useful to make public?

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/CachedObjectDirectory.java -> nit: add braces on the if-block.

Line:509, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I don't believe so, it is the internal version of the function above for calling recursively.  The function above initializes it.

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/CachedObjectDirectory.java -> Done
