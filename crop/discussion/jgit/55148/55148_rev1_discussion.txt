DESCRIPTION

Prevent alternates loop

When looping through alternates, prevent visiting the same object
directory twice.  This could happen when the objects/info/alternates
file includes itself directly or indirectly via a another repo and its
alternates file.

Line:415, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> JGit adheres to API standards that prevent us from breaking this method signature.

IIRC this is also declared in Repository to return an empty set and now we are using the empty set in a lot of places instead of the value returned by the file implementation.

Can we do this sort of filtering inside of the ObjectDatabase when it creates the list of alternates rather every time we are iterating it?
