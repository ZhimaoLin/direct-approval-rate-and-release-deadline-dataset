DESCRIPTION

Stop using deprecated CmdLineException constructors

Instead of taking a String, the constructors now take a Localizable
and a variable list of format arguments.

Introduce a new Format helper class in CLIText, which implements the
Localizable interface, and use it in place of raw Strings.
