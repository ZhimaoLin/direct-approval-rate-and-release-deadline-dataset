DESCRIPTION

Consume request body if it's not bidirectional pipe and request has failed

This is continuation from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/94249/. When an
error happens, we might not read the entire stream. Consume the request
body before we flush the buffer.

Line:781, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I don't understand this !sendPack condition.

Why should this happen when sendPack == false? Why shouldn't it happen when sendPack == true?

Line:781, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> When sendPack is true, then we recognize that the request is valid so far. If there's any trailing byte, it's a protocol error. This protocol error will be checked in sendPack() (see the CorruptObjectException).

Line:781, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Actually, in that case, we should throw an exception before calling stopBuffering. I'll move that trailer check code here.
