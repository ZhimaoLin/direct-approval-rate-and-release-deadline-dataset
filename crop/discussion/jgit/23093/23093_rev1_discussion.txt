DESCRIPTION

Make text alignment in history plotter more consistent

For every ref label to plot, there was a space of additional 2 pixels
between the last label and the commit message, which does not make
sense.

This change also fixes that the commit message for commits on the
right-most lane was closer to the lane than commit messages for commits
that were not on this lane, but where the right-most lane passed
through.
This can be seen in the JGit repository: The commit message c096b42 was
drawn slightly more to the left than the message of 36a8578.
