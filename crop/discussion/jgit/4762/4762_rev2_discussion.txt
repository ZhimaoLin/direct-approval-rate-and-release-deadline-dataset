DESCRIPTION

Validate paths during DirCheckout

DirCacheCheckout and CanonicalTreeParser cooperate. CanonicalTreeParser
can detect malformed, potentially malicious tree entries and sets a
flag, while DirCacheCheckout refuses to work with such paths.

Malicious tree entries are ".", "..", ".git" (case insensitive), any
name containing '/' and (on Windows '\') and also (on Windows)
any paths ending in a combination of '.' or space or containing a ':'.
We also forbid all special names like "con" etc on Windows.

Some of the test can execute on any platform by enabling partial
platform emulation.

A new runtime exception, InvalidPathException, is introduced. For
backwards compatibility it extends InvalidArgumentException.

Line:700, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> Should this use the same logic as in FS_Win32.isWin32() for the Windows check?

Line:700, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> Maybe, but then we git in trouble with the fact that it is static
and I want to change "os" during tests.

Line:700, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> But what about doing an indexof/case-insensitive comparison here?

I'm just not sure what os.name returns across different windows versions and the FS_Win32 logic would seem to cover more cases
