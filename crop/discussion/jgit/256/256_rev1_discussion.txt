DESCRIPTION

Correctly skip over unrecognized optional dircache extensions

We didn't skip the correct number of bytes when we skipped over an
unrecognized but optional dircache extension.  We missed skipping
the 8 byte header that makes up the extension's name and length.

We also didn't include the skipped extension's payload as part of
our index checksum, resuting in a checksum failure when the index
was done reading.  So ensure we always scan through a skipped
section and include it in the checksum computation.

Add a test case for a currently unsupported index extension, 'ZZZZ',
to verify we can still read the DirCache object even though we
don't know what 'ZZZZ' is supposed to mean.
