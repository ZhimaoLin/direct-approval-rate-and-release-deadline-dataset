Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorWithTimeControl.java -> headSet(Object,boolean) is a Java 6 API.  We need to define cutOff as super.getEntryLastModified() - 1 instead.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorWithTimeControl.java -> Shouldn't it be super.getEntryLastModified() + 1 ?
Then headSet will include the enry with timestamp super.getEntryLastModified()
