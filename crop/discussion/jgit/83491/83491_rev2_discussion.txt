DESCRIPTION

RFC: Proposal: Don't synchronize on AtomicReference object

According to FindBugs:

  This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance
  of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses).
  Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control
  mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by
  the Java keyword synchronized.

Move the synchronization to the method signature.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/Proposal.java -> Why is this an AtomicReference at all? Reference assignments are atomic anyway in Java, and I don't see any call to getAndSet or compareAndSet...

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/Proposal.java -> I wouldn't run callbacks inside a synchronized block.

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/Proposal.java -> I would have thought this would throw IllegalMonitorStateException since now the current thread is not holding the monitor of state but the one of 'this'. (More occurrences below, also for notifyAll()). Do the tests not exercise this code?

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/Proposal.java -> It's not actually running the callback in this method, just adding it to the list.

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/Proposal.java -> > Do the tests not exercise this code?

Possibly not :/

And I don't think any clients are using it either, yet.

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/ketch/Proposal.java -> Doh.  Sorry, of course.
