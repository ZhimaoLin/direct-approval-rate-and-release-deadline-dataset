DESCRIPTION

RFC: Proposal: Don't synchronize on AtomicReference object

According to FindBugs:

  This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance
  of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses).
  Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control
  mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by
  the Java keyword synchronized.

Move the synchronization to the method signature.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> RFC because I'm not really sure if this is any better/different.  It does get rid of the FindBugs warnings though.
