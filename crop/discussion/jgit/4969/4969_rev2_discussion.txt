DESCRIPTION

Workaround incompatible refactoring in Jetty 7.6.0

In Jetty 7.6 package org.eclipse.jetty.http.security was renamed to
org.eclipse.jetty.util.security [1] breaking compatibility.

Compare docs for the package in 7.5.4 [2] and missing part in 7.6.0 [3].
To fix until we switch to Jetty 8, restrict the maximum version to 7.6.0
exclusive.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

- rebased
- added update for the other test bundle
- improved commit message
- I tried replacing Jetty 7.5 with Jetty 8.0.4 but this needs more dependencies so let's go for this workaround for now
