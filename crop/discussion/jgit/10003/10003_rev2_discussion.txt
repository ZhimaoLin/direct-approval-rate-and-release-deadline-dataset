Line:1013, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> nit-pick; trailing whitespace x3

Line:1027, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> I think this name is wrong, but I'm not sure if there is a standard name, This the command that produced the diff.

The head lines are the two lines that follow this line.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> add some "context"

Line:1027, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> referring section "Generating patches with -p" at http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.7.3/git-diff.html
"diff --git a/file1 b/file2" is the "git diff" header
followed by extended header lines. I couldn't find any other sources on how to name this line. I'd appreciate any suggestions.

Anyways, I think "write" should be replaced by "format" following the naming convention in DiffFormatter
