DESCRIPTION

Improve MergeResult

Add paths causing abnormal merge failures (e.g. due to unstaged
changes) to the MergeResult returned by MergeCommand. This helps
callers to better handle (e.g. present) merge results.

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> nice refactoring. This should really belong in our test infrastructure and not in one specific test

Line:669, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommandTest.java -> I would be careful with including the smudge state. It could be 
platform dependent whether we are hitting smudged situations or not. If you don't want to test it then leave it out.

Line:685, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommandTest.java -> We could add a test for the other case. A merge with staged content for a file which is not touched by the merge should suceed.

Whats about a test for dirty working trees?

Line:617, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Maybe one sentence or comment in brackets about what could cause such situations would be good
