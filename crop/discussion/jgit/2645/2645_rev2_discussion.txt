DESCRIPTION

Improve MergeResult

Add paths causing abnormal merge failures (e.g. due to unstaged
changes) to the MergeResult returned by MergeCommand. This helps
callers to better handle (e.g. present) merge results.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

Seems OK, but unstaged changes preventing merge isn't abnormal... its the most common way I see my merges fail. :-)
