DESCRIPTION

Make 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile used in ResolveMerger configurable

This change makes it possible to configure the 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile
used in ResolveMerger#insertMergeResult. Since LocalFile itself has some
risks, e.g. it may be left behind as garbage in case of failure. It should
be good to be able to control the size limit for using LocalFile.

Line:291, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> This should be 10 << 20 so that the default is 10 MiB.

That allows users to specify configuration with standard suffix units e.g.:

  [merge]
    inCoreLimit = 10m

for a 10 MiB limit.

Line:852, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Just use inCoreLimit here. Don't convert units to MiBs.
