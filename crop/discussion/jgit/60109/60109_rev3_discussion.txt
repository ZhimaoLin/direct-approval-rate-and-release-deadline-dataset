DESCRIPTION

RefDirectory.exactRef, getRef: Do not skip RefsChangedEvent on error

getRef and exactRef can produce recoverable exceptions when, for
example, a corrupt loose ref cannot be parsed.  If refs were read in
the process, RefsChangedEvent should still be fired.

This only affects exactRef and getRef --- other methods may be
similarly skipping firing RefsChangedEvent in their error handling
code, and this change does not fix them.
