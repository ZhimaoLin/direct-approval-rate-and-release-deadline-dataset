DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Implement auto gc

With the auto option, gc checks whether any housekeeping is required; if
not, it exits without performing any work. Some JGit commands run gc
--auto after performing operations that could create many loose objects.
Housekeeping is required if there are too many loose objects or too many
packs in the repository.

If the number of loose objects exceeds the value of the gc.auto option,
then all loose objects are combined into a single pack using repack -d
-l. Setting the value of gc.auto to 0 disables automatic packing of
loose objects.

If the number of packs exceeds the value of gc.autoPackLimit, then
existing packs (except those marked with a .keep file) are consolidated
into a single pack by using the -A option of repack. Setting
gc.autoPackLimit to 0 disables automatic consolidation of packs.

Like git the following jgit commands run auto gc:
- fetch
- merge
- rebase
- receive-pack

The auto gc for receive-pack can be suppressed by setting the config
option receive.autogc = false

I like the idea. I'm not sure if we could enable this on our Gerrit servers because we run gc from a different machine to not take resources from Gerrit server but still, I like the idea of automatically running gc if loose objects exceeds a threshold.

Is the AddCommand not required to trigger autoGC?

Line:388, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> maybe autoGc could take a Git instance as parameter

Line:1127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> since JGit always writes one new single pack file we don't need this optionn
