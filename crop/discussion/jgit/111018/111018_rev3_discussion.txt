DESCRIPTION

GC: Delete stale temporary packs and indexes

When a GC operation is interrupted, temporary packs and indexes can be
left on the pack folder. In big, busy repositories this can lead to
significant amounts of wasted disk space if this interruption is done
with a certain frequency.

Remove stale temporary packs and indexes at the end of the GC process so
they do not accumulate. To avoid interfering with a possible concurrent
JGit GC process in the same repository, only delete temporary files that
are older than one day.
