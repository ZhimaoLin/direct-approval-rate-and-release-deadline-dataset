Patch Set 2:

Also note that I removed the successful tests now. They might be useful for completeness, but this part now has nothing to do with symblic links. I have not verified whether all failing tests are valid not, but at least some are.

What about the symlinks test file ? It is intentional to removed it ?

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> What does 'Replace file 'a' by file 'a' mean? I took over this test into a bugfix commit which is now a predecessor of this change. There I renamed this comment to "modify file 'a'"

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> why is it called 'symlinkA' . This test doesn't create symlinks. I took over this test into a bugfix commit which is now a predecessor of this change. There I changed this variable name to fileA
