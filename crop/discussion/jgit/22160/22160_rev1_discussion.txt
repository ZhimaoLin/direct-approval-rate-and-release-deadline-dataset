Patch Set 1:

Starting from Christian's comments on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/19237/ Patch set 15 review: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/19237/: "An idea for more tests: All the tests here work mainly with two different states. What's in the current commit and what's in the commit I want to checkout. During checkout there are two more states which could differ from these two states. The index and the working tree. So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes."; I added further symlinks tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from
index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.

All these tests have been executed on Windows and Linux and results are the same.

My reference is native git, so failing tests are those who have differences with native git.

I didn't try to fix differences. These tests are a good starting point to fix differences.

yeah! finally we see the bugs I was expecting.

I would like to refactor these tests a bit by introducing a helper method which does the setup for working-tree, index, head state. Do you mind?

Patch Set 1:

Are these symlink issues, or just so far undetected regular file issues. At least fileModeTestFileThenSymlinkWithFolderInIndex is not related to symlinks, but fails the same if "a" is a regular file. 


Can we split these tests into regular file issues, and symlink issues?
