Patch Set 5:

Concerning my tests, I try to handle conflict situations the same way as C Git. If some tests looks wrong to you, do not hesitate to reproduce with C Git, in order to be sure the tests are right.

On windows 8.1, with this patchset nÂ°5, the DirCacheCheckoutTests#testDirectoryFileConflicts_9 succeeds.

Patch Set 5:

I mean that C Git fails on the setup that DirCacheCheckoutTests#testDirectoryFileConflicts_9 uses, while it succeeds with JGit.

Then after fixing the cases you presented, DirCacheCheckoutTests#testDirectoryFileConflicts_9 fails in JGit too. See the followup change I did
