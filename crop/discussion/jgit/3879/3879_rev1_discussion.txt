DESCRIPTION

Throw JGit exception when ResetCommand got wrong ref

If the ResetCommand should reset to a invalid ref (e.g. HEAD in a repo
whithout a single commit) it was throwing an NPE. This is fixed now by
throwing a JGitInternalExcpeption. It would be nicer if we could throw
a InvalidRefException, but this would modify our API.
