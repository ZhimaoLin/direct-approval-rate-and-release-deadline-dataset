DESCRIPTION

Fix HttpClientConnection leaking temporary buffer files

HttpClientConnection uses a TemporaryBufferEntity which uses
TemporaryBuffer.LocalFile to buffer an HttpEntity. It was leaking
temporary files if the buffered entities were larger than 1MB since it
failed to destroy the TemporaryBuffer.LocalFile.
