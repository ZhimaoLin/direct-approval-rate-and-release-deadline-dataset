DESCRIPTION

Fix authentication type names broken by 0b5441a8

0b5441a8 introduced an enum for authentication types and changed the
case of digest and basic authentication type names to all uppercase.
This broke digest authentication at least when using Gerrit as the git
server. According to RFC2617 [1] "Basic" and "Digest" have to be used
and not "BASIC" [1] and "DIGEST" [2].

Line:538, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HttpAuthMethod.java -> Have you forgot this .name() call? This line set's the "Authorization" header and from what I read from the specs it should also be named "Basic", "Digest", ...
