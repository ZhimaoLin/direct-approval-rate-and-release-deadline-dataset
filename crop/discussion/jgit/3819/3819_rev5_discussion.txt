DESCRIPTION

Adds DiffEntry.scan(TreeWalk, boolean) method

Adds method into DiffEntry class that allows to specify whether changed
trees are included in scanning result list. By default changed trees
aren't added, but in some cases having changed tree would be useful.

Also adds check for tree count in TreeWalk and when it is different from
two it will thrown an IllegalArgumentException.
