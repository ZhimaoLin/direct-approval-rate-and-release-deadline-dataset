DESCRIPTION

Fix sorting of names in RefDirectory

RefDirectory did not correctly follow the contract of RefList.  The
contract says if you use add() method of RefList builder, you MUST
sort() it afterwards, and later every other method assumes that list
is properly sorted (especially the binary search in the find() and
get() methods).  Instead RefDirectory class tried to scan the refs
recursively while sorting every folder in the process before
processing and did not call sort().

For example, when scanning the contents of refs/tags project1 string
is smaller than project1-*, so it will recursively go into the folder
and add these tags first and only then will add project-* ones. This
will result in a broken list (any project1-* string is less than
project1/* one, but they all appear after them in the list), that's
why binary search will fail making loose RefList and the whole local
RefMap completely unusable.
