DESCRIPTION

Introduce PostUploadHook to replace UploadPackLogger

UploadPackLogger is incorrectly named--it can be used to trigger any
post upload action, such as GC/compaction. This change introduces
PostUploadHook/PostUploadHookChain to replace
UploadPackLogger/UploadPackLoggerChain and deprecates the latter.

It also introduces PackStatistics as a replacement for
PackWriter.Statistics, since the latter is not public API.
It changes PackWriter to use PackStatistics and reimplements
PackWriter.Statistics to delegate to PackStatistics.

Mostly looks good, but a few comments.

Line:601, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> @deprecated comes xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:684, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> @deprecated xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:701, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> But below you never pass it null.

Line:601, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:684, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:701, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Fixed the deprecated method above but the documentation is correct. The object is initialized by sendPack(boolean), but only if "wants" is empty or negotiation fails or some other error.
