DESCRIPTION

Throw IncorrectObjectTypeException on bad type hints

If the type hint isn't OBJ_ANY and it doesn't match the actual type
observed from the object store, define the reader to throw back an
IncorrectObjectTypeException.  This way the caller doesn't have to
perform this check itself before it evaluates the object data, and
we can simplify quite a few call sites.
