DESCRIPTION

reftable: binary reference storage format

Some repositories contain a lot of references (e.g. android at 866k,
rails at 31k). The reftable format provides:

  - Near constant time lookup for any single reference, even when the
    repository is cold and not in process or kernel cache.
  - Occupy less disk space for large repositories.
  - Support atomic pushes with lower copying penalities.

This is a simple writer to create reftable formatted files, and file
format documentation. Follow-up commits will add support for reading
from reftable, debugging utilities, and tests.
