Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableWriter.java -> For exceptions, always xxx@xxx.xxx Exception IF ..."

Line:322, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableWriter.java -> Rename to "finishRefAndObjSections" or something since it may be closing the index block section or index.

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/BlockWriter.java -> Please add Javadoc.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/BlockWriter.java -> Do you mean INDEX_BLOCK_TYPE here?

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableOutputStream.java -> This high level comment doesn't belong at this low level, and could easily get out of sync. It seems like it could be ok to flush the header at any time, even for a non-log only file.
