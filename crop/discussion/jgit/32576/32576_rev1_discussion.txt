DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Always make PackWriter.Statistics available

If the packer fails, still obtain the stats and make them available
to the logger and the caller. Failures can frequently happen when
a client disconnects in the middle of a pack stream. Server admins
may still want to examine the timing metrics from counting and
compressing phases.
