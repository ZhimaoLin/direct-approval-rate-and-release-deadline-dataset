Patch Set 1:

I authored 100% of this patch and have authorization from Google to donate it to Eclipse under the Eclipse Distribution License (EDL, http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.html), which is a 3-clause BSD-style license. It depends on Id01146950bb9c18dae0169311e3cde2c3bfa675e which is waiting on a contribution questionnaire, though.

I ended up tweaking how Archivers work (moving the "loader.copyTo(out);" part into the format-specific putEntry method) to get symlink targets in tarballs working correctly. I'll resend this one with that change included to make it easier to comment on the Archiver interface.
