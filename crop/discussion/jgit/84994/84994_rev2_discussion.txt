DESCRIPTION

Add set,get description to Repository

This method pair allows the caller to read and modify the description
file that is traditionally used by gitweb and cgit when rendering a
repository on the web.

Gerrit Code Review has offered this feature for years as part of
its GitRepositoryManager interface, but its fundamentally a feature
of JGit and its Repository abstraction.

git-core typically initializes a repository with a default value
inside the description file. During getDescription() this string
is converted to null as it is never a useful description.

Line:445, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Can simplify using ternary:

  if (old == null ? description == null : old.equals(description))

Or, better, java.util.Objects.equals:

  if (Objects.equals(old, description))
