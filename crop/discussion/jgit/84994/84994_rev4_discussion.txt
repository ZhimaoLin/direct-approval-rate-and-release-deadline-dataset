DESCRIPTION

Add {get,set}GitwebDescription to Repository

This method pair allows the caller to read and modify the description
file that is traditionally used by gitweb and cgit when rendering a
repository on the web.

Gerrit Code Review has offered this feature for years as part of
its GitRepositoryManager interface, but its fundamentally a feature
of JGit and its Repository abstraction.

git-core typically initializes a repository with a default value
inside the description file. During getDescription() this string
is converted to null as it is never a useful description.
