DESCRIPTION

Introduce findRef synonym for getRef, deprecate getRef

Using findRef instead of getRef makes it clearer that the caller wants
to search for the ref in the search path, instead of looking for a ref
that exactly matches the input.

This change introduces the new findRef method.  It does not update
callers outside tests to use it yet.
