DESCRIPTION

Fixed FileNameMatcher for the case of escaping characters in patterns.

Now it is possible to ignore "[" with pattern "\\[" as it is possible to to it in Git.

If the separator character is '\\', escaping is turned off.

Patch Set 2:

I fixed the nits. And added a reference to the bug to the commit message. Also I verified that it works for some examples. For the org.eclipse.ptp project it would be great if this bugfix could get into the 3.0 stable branch.
