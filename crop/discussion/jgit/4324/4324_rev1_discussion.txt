DESCRIPTION

Fixed FileNameMatcher for the case of escaping characters in patterns.

Now it is possible to ignore "[" with pattern "\\[" as it is possible to to it in Git.

If the separator character is '\\', escaping is turned off.

Only style-nit. I did no user testing, but it is plausible that this could work.
