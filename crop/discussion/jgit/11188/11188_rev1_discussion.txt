DESCRIPTION

Fix GC for FileRepo in case packfile renames fail

Only on Windows the rename operation which renames temporary Packfiles
(and index-files and bitmap-files) sometime fails. This happens only
when renaming a temporary Packfile to a Packfile which already exists.
Such situations occur if you run GC twice on a repo without modifying
the repo inbetween. 

In such situations there was bug in GC which led to a corrupted repo
whithout any packfiles anymore. This commit fixes this problem the hard
way: if a OS rename fails we check source and destination packfile for
content-equality. If they are equal simply delete the source file
instead of trying to rename.

I am searching for a better solution because the content-check is
expensive and the root cause why Windows doesn't allow the rename is not
found. It is proofen that on the source file and the destination file we
don't have any OS FileHandles anymore - but still the rename fails. Unix
and Mac don't see this problem.

the FileUtils enhancement should go in a separate change and it needs tests
