DESCRIPTION

Fix GC for FileRepo in case packfile renames fail

Only on Windows the rename operation which renames temporary Packfiles
(and index-files and bitmap-files) sometime fails. This happens only
when renaming a temporary Packfile to a Packfile which already exists.
Such situations occur if you run GC twice on a repo without modifying
the repo inbetween.

In such situations there was bug in GC which led to a corrupted repo
whithout any packfiles anymore. This commit fixes the problem by
introducing a utility method which renames a file and throws an
IOException if it fails. This method also takes care to repeat a
failing rename if our FS class has found out we are running on a
platform with a unreliable File.renameTo() method.

I am searching for a better solution because even with this utility
method in hand a GC on a already GC'ed repo will fail on Windows. But
at least with this fix we will not produce corrupted repos anymore.
