DESCRIPTION

Handle "ERR %s" when ACK/NAK is expected

If the remote peer replies with "ERR %s" instead of "ACK %s common" or
"NAK" during ancestor negotiation in the fetch-pack/upload-pack
protocol, treat that as an exception that aborts processing with the
error text as supplied by the remote system.

This matches behavior with "ERR %s" during the advertisements, which
is also a way for the remote to abort processing.
