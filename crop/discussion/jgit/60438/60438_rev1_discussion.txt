DESCRIPTION

Handle InternalError during symlink support detection on Windows

When JGit tries to detect symlink support the attempt to create a
symlink may fail with a java.lang.InternalError. This was reported for a
case where the application using JGit runs in Windows XP compatibility
mode using Oracle JDK 1.8. Handle this by assuming symlinks are not
supported in this case.
