Line:536, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> What line has the potential null access?

We could include an explicit null check to pacify the linter without losing the benefit of the warning in the rest of the function.

Line:536, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> many lines show a potential null pointer access warning

the static checks don't understand that crc1, crc2 are guaranteed to be non-null if validate is true
