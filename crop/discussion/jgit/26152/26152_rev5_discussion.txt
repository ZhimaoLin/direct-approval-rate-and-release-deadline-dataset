DESCRIPTION

Archive: Add the ability to select one or more paths.

Previously, it was only possible to archive the entire repository. 
This patch introduces the ability to select specific files and
directories to archive.
Archiving the entire repository remains the default behaviour.

org.eclipse.jgit.api.ArchiveCommand: Adding setPaths(String... paths) 
method.
