Nice --- thanks for adding API tests.

Line:476, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> Is this supposed to match the "-- <path>..." arguments to git archive? Those are patterns (pathspecs):

 $ git archive HEAD -- ':(glob)' '*.c' |tar -tf - | head -6
 .gitattributes
 .gitignore
 .mailmap
 COPYING
 Documentation/
 Documentation/.gitattributes

Looking around, it seems that jgit has some support for fnmatch patterns in org.eclipse.jgit.fnmatch.FileNameMatcher but it is only currently used for .gitignore handling.

What should the documented semantics of this be? Is it a list of literal paths to match against, even if they contain glob special characters and globs would use a different method if support is added for them later? Or should it check for glob special characters and error out to make it possible to introduce that behavior later?

I think just doing literal paths should be fine and could be controlled by a flag later, but it seems worth documenting here that the paths are literal and relative to the root of the tree (not e.g. relative to the cwd).

Line:477, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> Line should start with a tab.

The paths are indeed a list of paths to match against - paths could be either files or directories, for the latter the all files and directories are selected recursively.
The addition of paths uses similar logic as does org.eclipse.jgit.api.AddCommand by using org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.TreeWalk.setFilter

Please see the following patch for updated documentation.
