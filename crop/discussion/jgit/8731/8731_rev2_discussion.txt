DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Silence some API warnings

We don't want to bump the major version because of changed translatable
texts.

Not sure yet why these stream classes create API problems. None of them
changed since 2.1.

Line:14, org.eclipse.jgit/.settings/.api_filters -> I tried to do another incompatible change on top of this filter and it seems PDE is still able to detect new API changes (I tried to change the return type of ObjectStream.getType()), though I am not sure if this is always the case.
