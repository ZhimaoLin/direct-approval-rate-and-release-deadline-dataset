Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

GitIndex is deprecated, we should avoid any changes do it and use DirCache.

Patch Set 1:

Porting this to DirCache later will be a problem.
Change operations use Repository.lockDirCache(). This creates a new DirCache instance. 
Thus e.g. a commit inside EGit using the Git porcelain API would cause an "external change".

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This is not going anywhere, and Robin is proposing removing GitIndex.
