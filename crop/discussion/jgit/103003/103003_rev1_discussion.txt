Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

You should have amended the commit for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102957/ and then pushed to Gerrit with the same change ID.That would have created a new patch set 2 on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102957/ instead of a dependent child change.

Please do so; then abandon this change here.

Thanks for pointing this out! Just to be sure, are you talking about git commit --amend (like in https://nathanhoad.net/git-amend-your-last-commit)?
