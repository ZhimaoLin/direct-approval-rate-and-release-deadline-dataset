DESCRIPTION

Don't warn for methods that can be static

Making the methods static would gain little in performance,
make the code harder to change. Removing unncessary warnings
is more important.

I agree, we should either fix the warnings or set them to ignore. In this case, I'm fine with setting to ignore.
