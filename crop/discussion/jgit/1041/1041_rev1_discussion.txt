DESCRIPTION

Use core.streamFileThreshold to set our streaming limit

We default this to 1 MiB for now, but we allow users to modify
it through the Repository's configuration file to be a different
value.  A new repository listener is used to identify when the
setting has been updated and trigger a reconfiguration of any
active ObjectReaders.

To prevent a horrible explosion we cap core.streamFileThreshold
at no more than 1/4 of the maximum JVM heap size.  We do this
because we need at least 2 byte arrays equal in size to the
stream threshold for the worst case delta inflation scenario,
and our host application probably also needs some amount of the
heap for their working set size.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/events/ListenerList.java -> I still think this is the wrong class to be adding the 'addListener' to, since it will always keep growing. Can we not have a ConfigChangeEvent.addListener(listenerList) instead? That way, to add a new one, you just need to add a new class and not modify this one every time.

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/events/ListenerList.java -> I think Shawn wanted to have fewer event listener collection and we don't want globals for this.
