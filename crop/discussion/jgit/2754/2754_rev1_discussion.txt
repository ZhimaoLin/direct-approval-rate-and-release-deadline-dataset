much better now. This is still a mixture of refactorings and semantical changes (the "untracked files" check) but ok for me.

Line:372, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> This was handled correctly also before, right?

I think the comment is not correct. We also catch tracked files here: newly created files which have been added to the index but which didn't exist in OURS,THEIRS or BASE.

Line:396, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> OURS is always unchanged regarding BASE and we always take what we find in THEIRS --- without any exception. If we find something in THEIRS we copy and if we don't find we don't copy.
Only one case get's additional treatment: if THEIRS contains a deletion we trigger an explicit working tree cleanup.

From that point of view I liked the old comments more then this new one.

Line:372, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Yes, this was handled correctly before. But when debugging such a case, we dived into the pick-from-theirs handling which seemed a little bit confusing to me.

But you are right, the comment is wrong and I have changed it.

Line:396, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Okay, I have changed it back. It's clear to me now - whereas it wasn't in the beginning...
