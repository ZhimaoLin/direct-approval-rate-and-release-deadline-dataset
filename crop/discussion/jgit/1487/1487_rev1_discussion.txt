DESCRIPTION

Add reset() to AbstractTreeIterator API

This allows callers to force the iterator back to its starting point,
so it can be traversed again.  The default way to do this is to use
back(1) until first() is true, but this isn't very efficient for any
iterator.  All current implementations have better ways to implement
reset without needing to seek backwards.
