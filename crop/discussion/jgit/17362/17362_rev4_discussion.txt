DESCRIPTION

CLI executable script for each OS

An executable script for each OS type is added to the
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm plugin. For Linux and MacOS - it is just the
existing jgit.sh bash script, but renamed to "git". For Windows - it is
a batch script with name "git.bat" with similar implementation to
jgit.sh.

Patch Set 4:

Patch Set 4 adds a small fix in git.bat. The classpath is surrounded by double quotes to avoid issues when %JGIT_CLASSPATH% contains spaces.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

Looks good to me in general (but I'm not the right person to judge the p2/build changes because of missing knowledge in that area).

Line:213, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/pom.xml -> Probably a dumb question, but shouldn't this include the newly added jgit.bat file too?

Patch Set 4:

(1 comment)

Line:213, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/pom.xml -> This is related to producing the jgit binary executable, not to what is included in the pgm bundle. The binary is a concatenation of the shell script and the jgit-cli.jar (which is the pgm bundle + all dependencies).
