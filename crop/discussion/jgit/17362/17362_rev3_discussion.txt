DESCRIPTION

CLI executable script for each OS

An executable script for each OS type is added to the
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm plugin. For Linux and MacOS - it is just the
existing jgit.sh bash script, but renamed to "git". For Windows - it is
a batch script with name "git.bat" with similar implementation to
jgit.sh.

Patch Set 3:

I see (and agree) that it is a major concern to have the jgit.sh script duplicated in many places. So, I reworked the patch. 

Now all executable scripts are in the pgm plugin, no fragments added. The pgm plugin is now installed as unpacked folder instead of as JAR. This way the executable scripts can be added to the PATH env variable.

I renamed jgit.sh to git and modified the pom.xml to generated the standalone jgit executable from the renamed script. This way we have only one Unix script with name "git" that works as executable for both Linux and MacOS, and as source for building the jgit binary.
