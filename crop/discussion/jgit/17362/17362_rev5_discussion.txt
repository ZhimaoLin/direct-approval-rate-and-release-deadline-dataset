DESCRIPTION

CLI executable script for each OS

An executable script for each OS type is added to the
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm plugin. For Linux and MacOS - it is just the
existing jgit.sh bash script, but renamed to "git". For Windows - it is
a batch script with name "git.bat" with similar implementation to
jgit.sh.

It's been a while since the last comment. Had everybody the chance to review it? Is there anything else I can do for improving the patch?

Patch Set 5:

It's really crucial for the use case to keep the names "git" and "git.bat". The use case is described in more details in the bug.

The goal is that programs depending on having "git" executable in the PATH are tricked to use JGit CLI when no native git client is installed.
