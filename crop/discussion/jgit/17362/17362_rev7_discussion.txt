DESCRIPTION

CLI executable script for each OS

An executable script for each OS type is added to the
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm plugin. For Linux and MacOS - it is just the
existing jgit.sh bash script, but renamed to "git". For Windows - it is
a batch script with name "git.bat" with similar implementation to
jgit.sh.

Patch Set 7:

- this looks better
- can we try to tweak the maven build so that we jar the class files inside the bundle with bundle shape dir ? I found that org.eclipse.jdt.debug does something like that

Patch Set 7:

Unfortunately the jgit bundles are not built with Tycho, but with "pure" Maven. I expected there is an appropriate configuration for the Maven Archiver (http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/), but I could not find one. Do you have any hints?

Patch Set 7:

We build jgit bundles using plain Maven since we need both Maven and OSGi artifacts since there are both types of consumers. Unfortunately Tycho doesn't support creation of Maven artifacts hence we maintain dependencies twice (in pom.xml and manifest.mf) and keep them in sync manually. <translate-qualifier/> is used to transform the qualifier in the OSGi manifest to the build timestamp generated by Maven for the corresponding Maven artifacts using some Ant snippet defined in the root pom.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

I still don't like calling it "git". Can't you create a fake-git bundle and install it too? 

Or have you client try jgit if git cannot be found? The jgit executable isn't a full replacement for git.

Patch Set 7:

As described in the bug the client integrated in the Eclipse product invokes "git". It is not feasible changing the client. The jgit executable does not need to be a full replacement of git client. It needs to be good enough.
