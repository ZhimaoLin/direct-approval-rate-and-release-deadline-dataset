DESCRIPTION

HistogramDiff: Convert stack recursion to heap managed queue

Each time the longest common substring is found the diff algorithm
recurses to reprocess the regions before and after the common string.

Large files with many edits can trigger StackOverflowError as the
algorithm attempts to process a deeply split tree of regions. This
is especially prone to happen in servers where the Java stack size
may have been limited to 1M or even 256K.

To keep edits produced in order a queue is used to process edits
in a depth-first strategy.

Patch Set 4:

LGTM but I don't support running this in production until we have verified it doesn't eat all the heap on a live server.

The issue it is causing in our Gerrit Code Review instance is loading the main dashboard to overflow the stack, as it uses the number of changed lines from the diff in the main change table.

Fortunately I think with our canarying process we can test this out on a small pool of servers at lower risk.
