DESCRIPTION

HistogramDiff: Convert stack recursion to heap managed queue

Each time the longest common substring is found the diff algorithm
recurses to reprocess the regions before and after the common string.

Large files with many edits can trigger StackOverflowError as the
algorithm attempts to process a deeply split tree of regions. This
is especially prone to happen in servers where the Java stack size
may have been limited to 1M or even 256K.

To keep edits produced in order two queues are used. "tmp" stores
between 0 and 2 edits found in this cycle, which are then pushed
onto the head of the global processing queue. This preserves the
depth-first search strategy previously implemented through recursion.
