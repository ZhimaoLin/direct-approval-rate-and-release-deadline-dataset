DESCRIPTION

Files should be deleted with "retry" option

Some of our Windows users have reported sporadic file system access
problems related to ObjectDirectory(Inserter) file deletion code in
combination with antiviral/firewall tools. For one of these users the
problem was fairly reproducible and changing deletion to RETRY solved
his problem.
