DESCRIPTION

Files should be deleted with "retry" option

Some of our Windows users have reported sporadic file system access problems related to ObjectDirectory(Inserter) file deletion code in combination with antiviral/firewall tools. For one of these users the problem was fairly reproducible and changing deletion to RETRY solved his problem.
