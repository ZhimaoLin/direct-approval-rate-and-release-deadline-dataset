Line:315, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> This code is strange both before and after. A RevTree is only supposed to be used in the scope of the RevWalk that produced it.

Maybe this class should keep a RevWalk and close it when finished?

That makes sense. Can we change the type to ObjectId?
