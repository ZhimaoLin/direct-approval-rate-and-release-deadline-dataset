DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Expose PackWriter activity to a logger

The UploadPackLogger interface allows applications that embed
GitServlet or otherwise use UploadPack to service clients to
track and log how PackWriter was used, and what it sent.  This
provides more granularity into the request activity than might
be available from the HTTP server logs, helping administrators
to better understand utilization and Git server performance.
