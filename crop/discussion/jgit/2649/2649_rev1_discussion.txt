DESCRIPTION

PackFile: Fix copy as-is for small objects

When I disabled validation I broke the code that handled copying small
objects whose contents were below 8192 bytes in size but spanned over
the end of one window and into the next window.  These objects did not
ever populate the temporary write buffer, resulting in garbage writing
into the output stream instead of valid object contents.
