DESCRIPTION

Update ORIG_HEAD when resetting/rebasing

Write the old object id from the RefUpdate to the
ORIG_HEAD file after the update completes.

Add two new convenience methods to Repository to read
and write the ORIG_HEAD reference similar to the methods
for reading/writing CHERRY_PICK_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD.
