reports failure by returning false. To ease proper checking of return
values provide a utility method wrapping createNewFile() throwing
IOException on failure.

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> What does this note mean?  Are you just trying to keep people from using this method rather than our LockFile class?

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> I am just citing the javadoc of java.io.File.createNewFile() since we use that to implement this method. I thought that I shouldn't hide this note since we don't change this property of the implementation by wrapping it.

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> OK.  Given what this method exists for, I can agree with leaving the note in place since its just echoed from the system Javadoc.

I do love the differences in summary though, the Javadoc starts out saying its atomic, but then later implies it might not actually be atomic since it cannot be made to work reliably.  Cute.  :-)
