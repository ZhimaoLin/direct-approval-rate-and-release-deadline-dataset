DESCRIPTION

TestRepository: Add a cherryPick method

CherryPickCommand only works on a non-bare repository, as it must
modify the working tree and index in case of a merge conflict. In
tests, being able to recover from a merge conflict is less important,
as the caller should be able to control the full contents of files in
advance of the cherry-pick.
