Line:346, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepositoryTest.java -> I think this is really a conflict. Even with native git. The commit you wanted to cherry-pick was deleting lines 2-11 from the predecessor content (and additionally it was modifying line 1). On the master branch you have modified line 11. So, the commit you cherry-picked and the commit on master both touch line 11 -> conflict.

  > git init b
  Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/b/.git/
  > cd b
  > echo -e "foo contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n" >foo
  > git add foo
  > git commit -m initial
  [master (root-commit) 23ffd22] initial
   1 file changed, 11 insertions(+)
   create mode 100644 foo
  > git checkout -b side
  Switched to a new branch 'side'
  > echo -e "changed foo contents" >foo
  > git commit -a -m "message to cherry-pick"
  [side 612dd32] message to cherry-pick
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 11 deletions(-)
  > git checkout master
  Switched to branch 'master'
  > echo -e "foo contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlast line" >foo
  > git commit -a -m "modify on master"
  [master 2c24317] modify on master
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
  > git cherry-pick 612dd32
  error: could not apply 612dd32... message to cherry-pick
  hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
  hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
  hint: and commit the result with 'git commit'

If your cherry-pick commit would be "changed foo contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n" everything would be ok. The the cherrypicked commit wants to modify line 1 and the master commit modifies line 11 -> mergeable.

PTAL, all working now.

Line:346, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepositoryTest.java -> *facepalm* thank you.

You know, I literally tried to reproduce this failure in a git client and I accidentally did the right thing (i.e. not what I did here in the test).
