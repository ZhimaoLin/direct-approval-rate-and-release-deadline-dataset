DESCRIPTION

Use BatchRefUpdate for tracking refs in FetchProcess

If there are a lot of references to modify, using BatchRefUpdate can
save time if the underlying storage is able to combine these updates
together. This should speed up initial clone or fetch into an empty
repository, as some projects can have hundreds of release tags, or
hundreds of branch heads.
