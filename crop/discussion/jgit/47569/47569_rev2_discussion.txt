DESCRIPTION

Fix memory leak in dfs.DeltaBaseCase

The LRU chain management code was broken leading to situations where
the chain was incomplete.  This prevented the cache from removing
items when it exceeded its memory target, causing a leak.

One case was repeated hit on the head of the chain. moveToHead(e)
was invoked linking the head back to itself in a cycle orphaning
the rest of the table.

Add some unit tests to cover this and a few other paths.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DeltaBaseCacheTest.java -> What is the point of having these gets with no asserts following?

My previous suggestion was to have the same asserts in both places. But maybe that was even superfluous, and these gets can just be dropped.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DeltaBaseCache.java -> valueOf is redundant, %d should work fine with the unboxed value, right?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DeltaBaseCacheTest.java -> The get itself is an assert. See the get() method below.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DeltaBaseCache.java -> Yes. But JGit has warnings configured to warn on autoboxing because we have been bitten by that before.

We explicitly manually box, and its only OK in error paths that are never traversed, like this.
