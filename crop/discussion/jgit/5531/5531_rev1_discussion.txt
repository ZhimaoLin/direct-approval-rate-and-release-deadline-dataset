Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> I would prefer not to deprecate this, see below.

Line:502, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> No, this really should be 50 MiB. Its a different animal than the stream file threshold. This caps how big of a file the packer will attempt to perform delta compression with. Git has determined that above certain sizes, using delta compression when packing has a significant negative performance impact and shouldn't be done.

The default of 50 MiB here is a rough estimate of what is reasonable to delta compress. Even if your application sets core.streamFileThreshold to 128M or 256M, the packer shouldn't create deltas for objects >50M by default because it hurts other readers too badly who might have lower streamFileThresholds.

Does that make sense?

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CoreConfig.java -> We don't use ClassName.foo references within a class. Instead rename the parameter so it doesn't conflict with the member name.
