DESCRIPTION

URIish is incorrectly parsing some valid URIs

When passed a URL of the form "scheme://host:/path" the regular
expression used was incorrectly splitting the path and host
components.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Add new tests to existing testcase instead of creating a new one.
Don't add junit dependency to non-test-project
Run all tests, not just the new ones and in particular the already existing tests that relate to the URIIsh class
Add a Change-Id
