DESCRIPTION

Fix URIish to prevent incorrectly parsing some URIs

When passed a URL of the form "scheme://host:/path" the regular
expression used was incorrectly splitting the path and host
components.  Fix that, and add some tests.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Cleaned up Robin's issues and rebased onto master... but there are tests that are failing now.  These need to be resolved before we can submit the change:

  testWindowsFile(org.eclipse.jgit.transport.URIishTest)
  testWindowsFile2(org.eclipse.jgit.transport.URIishTest)

Line:370, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> This test violates the rule "exactly one test to fail for any given bug". Would it be better to split it up into 5 individual tests?

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

I think this has been resolved by other changes made by Zachary Orozco.
