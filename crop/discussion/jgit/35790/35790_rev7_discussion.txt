Patch Set 7:

I think we should try to move the execution of the hook into a hook class in order to not pollute the jgit commands with this code.

Instead of calling FS.DETECTED.findHook(repo, Hook.COMMIT_MSG) returning the
file containing the hook script we could ask a factory class to construct an instance
of a corresponding commit message hook class. The factory class would check
if a matching hook script can be found, if not it would simply return null to signal
there's no hook installed. If a matching hook script is found the factory returns
an instance of the hook class.
The code needed to execute the hook script could be encapsulated in the hook class
and the JGit commands don't need to know that the hook implementation is a script.

So instead of

 if (!noVerify && FS.DETECTED.findHook(repo, Hook.COMMIT_MSG) != null) {
 .... lengthy execution code polluting jgit commands ...
 }

we could write something like

 if (!noVerify) {
        CommitMessageHook hook = factory.findCommitMessageHook(repo);
        if (hook != null) {
               hook.execute(parameters needed for execution);
        }
 }

Visibility of the Hook enum can then probably be reduced to package visibility.

if we go for this approach we should also change the implementation of pre-commit hook accordingly

This definitely makes sense.
We'll do that right away unless some unforeseen issue comes up.
