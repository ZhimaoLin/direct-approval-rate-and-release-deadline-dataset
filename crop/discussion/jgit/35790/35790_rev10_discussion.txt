Hi,

Here is an attempt to take your latest comment into account.
Commands now don't have to check whether the hook is supported, present, or not. They just build a hook using a small fluent API and run it.
If the hook is not supported or not present, running it is a no-op, but the caller doesn't have to mind.

What the command must do is catch HookFailureException if it wants to prevent the hook to block the current command. If the hook is allowed to block the command, no try/catch is required (this is the case in this change set since both pre-commit and commit-msg can block the commit).

Does this seem better?
Do you have other suggestions?
