DESCRIPTION

Add support for getting the system wide configuration

These settings are stored in <prefix>/etc/gitconfig. The C Git
binary is instaled in <prefix>/bin, so we look for the C Git
executable to find this location, first by looking at the PATH
environment variable and then by attemting to launch bash as
a login shell to find out.
