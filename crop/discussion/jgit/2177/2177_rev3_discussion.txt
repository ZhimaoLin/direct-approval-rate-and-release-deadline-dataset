DESCRIPTION

Add support for getting the system wide configuration

These settings are stored in <prefix>/etc/gitconfig. The C Git
binary is installed in <prefix>/bin, so we look for the C Git
executable to find this location, first by looking at the PATH
environment variable and then by attemting to launch bash as
a login shell to find out.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful

I'm happy with patch set 3.  Robin, can you ack since its still authored by you?

Line:257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I preferred making this abstract, and putting the bash executions down into the FS implementation that might actually use it.
