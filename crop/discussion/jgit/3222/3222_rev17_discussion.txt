DESCRIPTION

Add command support for line history.

This command supports generating a comprehensive
collection of all the lines that have been present in any
revision of a file.  Each revision contains a collection of
lines in that revision and each line has a start revision,
end revision, and the line number it existed at in each
revision it was present in.

Patch Set 17: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Only minor nit-picks and one question. The question could be addressed separately.

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LineHistoryCommand.java -> Drop these extra white saces (all comments)

Line:269, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/RevisionBuilder.java -> Do we only want to do rename detection for non-merge commits?

Line:135, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/Line.java -> nit-pick: startCommit.hashCode can just be xored/added in since it is well distributed

Line:269, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/RevisionBuilder.java -> Would rename detection across merge commits just be computed by running a DiffEntry scan between the commit tree and each parent tree looking for any rename change type?
