DESCRIPTION

blame: Compute the origin of lines in a result file

BlameGenerator digs through history and discovers the origin of each
line of some result file.  BlameResult consumes the stream of regions
created by the generator and lays them out in a table for applications
to display alongside of source lines.

This is a basic implementation.  Quite notably it is missing support
for the smart block copy/move detection that the C implementation of
`git blame` is well known for.  Despite being incremental, the
BlameGenerator can only be run once.  After the generator runs it
cannot be reused.  A better implementation would support applications
browsing through history efficiently, or getting blame data for only a
specific subset of the result.

Patch Set 31: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I'm finally happy with this implementation. Very little of Kevin's code actually survives, what I did keep was the unit tests and the BlameCommand class. The BlameGenerator is completely rewritten and bears no resemblance to the code Kevin contributed in earlier revisions.

Based on descriptions I have read on the Git mailing list, I am fairly certain this implementation is very similar to the C implementation in terms of the algorithm that is used, however I know *nothing* about how the C code is actually structured. `git blame` is the one corner of C git that I have never ventured into before.  A tricky part of the algorithm is handling merge commits and passing blame back onto the ancestors correctly here. I'm not sure how the C code actually does it, I took a stab that sounds logically correct. :-)
