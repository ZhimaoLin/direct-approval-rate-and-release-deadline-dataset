DESCRIPTION

blame: Compute the origin of lines in a result file

BlameGenrator digs through history and discover the origin of each
line of some result file.

This is only an initial implementation. Notably it is missing
support for the smart copy/move detection that `git blame` in the
C implementation is well known for. Despite being incremental,
it is also only one-shot. A better implementation would support
applications browsing through history efficiently, or getting blame
data for only a specific subset of the result.
