DESCRIPTION

blame: Compute the origin of lines in a result file

BlameGenerator digs through history and discovers the origin of each
line of some result file.  BlameResult consumes the stream of regions
created by the generator and lays them out in a table for applications
to display alongside of source lines.

This is a basic implementation.  Quite notably it is missing support
for the smart block copy/move detection that the C implementation of
`git blame` is well known for.  Despite being incremental, the
BlameGenerator can only be run once.  After the generator runs it
cannot be reused.  A better implementation would support applications
browsing through history efficiently, or getting blame data for only a
specific subset of the result.
