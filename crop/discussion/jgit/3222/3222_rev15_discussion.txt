DESCRIPTION

Add command support for line history.

This command supports generating a comprehensive
collection of all the lines that have been present in any
revision of a file.  Each revision contains a collection of
lines in that revision and each line has a start revision,
end revision, and the line number it existed at in each
revision it was present in.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/LineComparator.java -> "containing every line from every revision"

Only the lines visible in the last revision are returned.

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/LineComparator.java -> Using TreeSet may not be the fastest way, but if it
drowns in the rest of the code that may not matter much.

Using another implementation in the future, if we think performance is a a problem may make the use of Set inconvenient, so perhaps a Collection would be less implementation dependent, providing a stable interface.

The Set interface does not quarantee ordering anyway, and the uniqueness does not be that explicit.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/LineComparator.java -> Don't override javadocs this way

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/Revision.java -> Equals and hashCode don't match. this cannot work

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/Revision.java -> We should be able to use a non-default encoding here.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/Line.java -> I think  we will see fewer bugs in callers if the range works like other java ranges, i.e. the upper limit is NOT included in the range.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/Line.java -> So would you be okay storing the initial revision number and the age of the line instead? Similar to the LineRange and StyleRange classes.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/LineComparator.java -> This method return every line in all specified revisions sorted by line number and initial revision it appeared in.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/LineComparator.java -> That still does not match what I think it does and what I expect it to do. A few more test cases would possibly clear things up.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/Line.java -> Both start/end and start/length are common pattern and when you mix them accidentally, people usually find out quickly, that means changing more code, so I don't understand why you want to to that. It also means slightly more complicated code for the user. 

The [start...end[  pattern leads to the simplest client code.

Incorporated changes and pushed new patch.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/LineComparator.java -> I removed this class since it needs more discussion and is not required for initial blame support and so it should be moved into another changeset.
