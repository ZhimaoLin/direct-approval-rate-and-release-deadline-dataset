DESCRIPTION

blame: Compute the origin of lines in a result file

BlameGenerator digs through history and discovers the origin of each
line of some result file.  BlameResult consumes the stream of regions
created by the generator and lays them out in a table for applications
to display alongside of source lines.

Applications may optionally push in the working tree copy of a file
using the push(String, byte[]) method, allowing the application to
receive accurate line annotations for the working tree version.  Lines
that are uncommitted (difference between HEAD and working tree) will
show up with the description given by the application as the author,
or "Not Committed Yet" as a default string.

Applications may also run the BlameGenerator in reverse mode using the
reverse(AnyObjectId, AnyObjectId) method instead of push(). When
running in the reverse mode the generator annotates lines by the
commit they are removed in, rather than the commit they were added in.
This allows a user to discover where a line disappeared from when they
are looking at an older revision in the repository.

This is a basic implementation.  Quite notably it is missing support
for the smart block copy/move detection that the C implementation of
`git blame` is well known for.  Despite being incremental, the
BlameGenerator can only be run once.  After the generator runs it
cannot be reused.  A better implementation would support applications
browsing through history efficiently.

Patch Set 35: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The reverse computation isn't quite right. I thought it was... :-(
