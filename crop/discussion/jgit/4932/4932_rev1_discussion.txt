Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LsRemoteCommand.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx tags for GitApiException and JGitInternalException.  Perhaps something similar to the descriptions given in FetchCommand.call

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LsRemoteCommand.java -> Perhaps move this variable out of the try blocks as well and close it in the finally before transport is closed.  That way there would be a single try block in this method.
