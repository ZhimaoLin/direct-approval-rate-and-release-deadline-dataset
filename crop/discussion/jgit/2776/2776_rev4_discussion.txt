DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Speed up pruning of objects from cached packs

During object enumeration for the thin pack, very few objects come
out that are duplicated with the cached pack. Typically these are
only cases where a blob or tree was cherry-picked forward, got a
copy or rename, or was reverted... all relatively infrequent events.

Speed up pruning of the thin pack object list by combining the phase
with the object representation selection. Implementers should already
be offering to reuse the object from the cached pack if it is stored
there, at which point the implementation can perform a very fast type
of containment test using the cached pack's identity rather than yet
another index lookup.  For the local disk case this is probably not a
big improvement, but it does help on the DHT implementation where the
two passes combined into one reduces latency.
