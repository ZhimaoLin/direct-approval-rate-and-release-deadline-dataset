DESCRIPTION

Rename Commit, Tag to CommitBuilder, TagBuilder

Since these types no longer support reading, calling them a Builder
is a better description of what they do.  They help the caller to
build a commit or a tag object.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks good. I'm a bit torn on this on naming the objects *Builder as that usually implies you using the builder pattern which has a bunch of factory methods to build* stuff. I think this is better than we have now so we should let it slide. When we release 0.9 and do another API review for 1.0, we can revisit this topic again...

Patch Set 1:

In a later change I add a format() method to these that actually does the "building".  If we simply renamed format() to build() then this perfectly fits the magical Builder pattern that people expect.
