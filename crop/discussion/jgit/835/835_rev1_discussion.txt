DESCRIPTION

Allow to read configured keys

Currently, there is no way to read the content
of the Git Configuration in a  way that would
allow to list all configured values generically.
This change extends the Config class in such a
way as to being able to get a list of sections and
to get a list of names for any given section or
subsection.
This is required in able to implement proper
configuration handling in EGit (show all the
content of a given configuration similar to 
"git config -l").

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Thanks for writing this!  I've been putting off adding a pgm.Config class because we didn't have the ability to enumerate the sections and keys.

Please also add some new JUnit test cases to RepositoryConfigTest to cover the section name functions you are adding.

Once this is submitted, I'll follow-up with a resurrected copy of my pgm.Config class that I started writing, but never finished.

Line:1122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> I think its OK to assume section != null here.

Line:1137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Like in hashCode, I think its OK to assume section != null.

Line:1157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Like below with SectionNames, I think we should export the name in lower case, so the caller sees a consistent case in the returned set.

Line:1172, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Style-nit:  Just use the default constructor supplied by the compiler.  It will be visible to public, but the class is private, so its effectively not visible.

Line:1180, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> We should export lower case section names, so the caller has a consistent case to examine against in the returned set.

IIRC, e.section is null on a blank line or a comment line.  These shouldn't appear in the returned set.  So please add a if (e.section != null) guard around this addition.
