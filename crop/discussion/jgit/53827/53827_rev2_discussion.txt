DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Delete non empty directories before checkout

I the checkout target is currently a non-empty directory (and was a link
or a regular file before), this directory will be removed before
performing checkout.

TODO: this works so far only if the new non-empty directory has no files
but only directories added. If there are files, they are currently not
deleted and the code still fails to checkout.

The fix must be improved to check which files can be safely deleted and
which shouldn't and to delete all files not added to the index
recursively (same as Git CLI does).
