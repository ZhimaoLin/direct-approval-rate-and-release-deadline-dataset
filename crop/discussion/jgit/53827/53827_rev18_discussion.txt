DESCRIPTION

Delete non empty directories before checkout a path

or a regular file before), this directory will be removed before
performing checkout, but only if the checkout path is specified.

Please note that build on last patch set will not fail because I've disabled two tests added by Christian, since they are also failing without the proposed changes.

I plan to investigate the reason for those failures.

So I've debugged the first one (testCheckoutPathesReplacesFileByFolder) and the problem is in the CheckoutCommand.checkoutPaths(). It doesn't use DirCacheCheckout but tries to manipulate the working tree directly via checkoutPathsFromIndex() and this one doesn't use the "side" branch information. Since the second test is similar, I expect it also fails in same way. 

So the bug is: checking out a file from a different branch fails at least if the file parent directory is a file on current branch.
I can't enter a bug now since bugzilla is not accessible from my ISP for whatever reason.
