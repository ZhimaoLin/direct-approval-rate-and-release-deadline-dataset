DESCRIPTION

Delete non empty directories before checkout a path

or a regular file before), this directory will be removed before
performing checkout, but only if the checkout path is specified.

I spent a lot of time today in inspecting and testing the tests. There are minor comments in the tests but other the overall functionality is ok for me now.

Line:955, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I suggest to remove the setName("master") here and in nearly all the other tests. Whenever you want to checkout HEAD then git.checkout.setStartPoint(Constants.HEAD)... is sufficient and a further setName() is redundant and not needed.

Only exception are tests where you want to checkout something different than HEAD.

Line:1355, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I propose to move this test and the next one out to it's own change. First of all: both tests run even without your modifications. But the main problem: they test a behavior which differs from native git. In native git both checkouts would succeed but we expect exceptions. That should be fixed ... but is unrelated to what you wanted to achieve here.

Line:1614, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> That's strange. By setting setRecursive(true) we will not get entries for folders. You have no chance to write tests which tests the existence of an empty folder or which should fail when an empty folder exists unexpectedly. I suggest an enhancement to this method and rebase your change upon it.

I think all comments must be now addressed wit the last patch set.

Line:955, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> Done

Line:1355, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I haven't added those tests, they existed before this patch.

Line:955, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> Didn't they came in with PatchSet #7? Anyhow - let's leave it as it is. We can move these tests later.
