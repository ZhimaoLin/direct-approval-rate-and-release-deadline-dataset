DESCRIPTION

Delete non empty directories before checkout

If the checkout target is currently a non-empty directory (and was a
link or a regular file before), this directory will be removed before
performing checkout, but only if it contains no indexed files.

If the current directory contains indexed files, the checkout will first
delete all untracked files and then report a conflict.
