DESCRIPTION

Delete non empty directories before checkout a path

If the checkout path is currently a non-empty directory (and was a link
or a regular file before), this directory will be removed before
performing checkout, but only if the checkout path is specified.

Christian, what do you think about updated patch?

Line:1136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I can't find any delete command for files in #checkoutEntry() regardless whether the "deleteRecursive" flag is set or not. #checkoutEntry() should not delete files/folders before this change. Other methods took care about this before #checkoutEntry was called(). E.g in a normal checkout (non-path) when we had to replace a file by a folder the file was deleted before #checkoutEntry was called.

I will investigate, but the tests fail independently from this patch.

Line:1136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I will rephrase this in the next patch
