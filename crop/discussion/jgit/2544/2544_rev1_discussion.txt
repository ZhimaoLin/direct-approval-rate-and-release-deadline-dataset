Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; Unclean IP, do not check in

I wish we could include this in 0.11.3, but its a non-committer authored patch. That's why it missed 0.11.1 in the first place.

:-(

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

There's nothing in the dev process that would prevent us from including this in the maintenance release.

Patch Set 1: IP review completed

Really? I thought we cannot include non-committer contributions without doing an IP log, even for a maintenance release, and even for small ones such as this.

Patch Set 1:

I'd update the ip log and move on. I haven't found anything in the dev process that prevents us from doing this. I can double check with the IP team, but everyone is off today in Canada Day due to Family Day. I mean, if we can live without this one in 0.11.3 then let's just dump it to master and not take chances.

Patch Set 1:

Its already in master, this was a cherry-pick back to 0.11.3.
