Line:554, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> according to [1] parameters must be separated from media type by a semicolon, I think we should enforce this

Line:554, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Not only that, but the Git MIME type used here does not have a character encoding specified. The server is wrong for sending a charset. We have been through this before. The Git protocol documentation states the MIME type is only "application/x-git-upload-pack-advertisement" and does not specify a character set, as the references are in an undefined character set.
