Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.properties -> copy&paste error: s/execution of commit command/execution of tag command/

Line:330, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.properties -> Signing isn't supported on tag operations yet.

I think we want to implement this ...

Line:343, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.properties -> avoid slang which might confuse users:

Tag on repository without HEAD is currently not supported

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> that's wrong, should be:

 return message;

Line:243, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> if signed == true we could fail fast throwing an UnsupportedOperationException here until we implement signed tags

Line:274, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> I think setting forceUpdate on not yet existing tag is also valid
