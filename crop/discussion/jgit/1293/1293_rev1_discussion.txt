Patch Set 1:

Still need tests.

We currently don't support any of the signing crap that is part of tagging... not sure how to do this yet...

Patch Set 1:

We can't sign tags in JGit because the only PGP implementation available in Java is BouncyCastle, which is forbidden for use by Eclipse projects.

We'll have to fork out to sign tags, which means we'll have to be dependent upon a user-supplied external program that is most likely going to need to be the GPL'd GnuPG program.  Yay.

Patch Set 1:

I'm fine with throwing an unsupportedoperation exception at the moment.

What's required as part of a tag?

message? author? tagger?

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> We return a RevTag not a Tag.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> Document ConcurrentRefUpdateException?

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> Style-nit: Subsequent lines get indented another level IIRC.

But do we really throw UnmergedPathException?  Or WrongRepositoryStateException?

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> You also need to setAuthor().  The ObjectInserter formatting code will NPE if author is null in the Tag.

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> objId within the tag is always null, which will cause the tag code below to always NPE because we can't open the object specified by the null ObjectId...

You need to use HEAD if the caller hasn't set the id, and you need a setter to allow the caller to set an id if they choose to tag something other than HEAD.

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> Don't bother setting the id.  Just use tagId below instead of newTag.getTagId().

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> Style-nit: We don't put braces around a case block unless the case block is allocating local variables.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> What are we falling through from?

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> An empty message is OK.

Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> Please don't leave a TODO if we can avoid it.

Line:225, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> Actually I would do the reverse and have setSigned(boolean).
