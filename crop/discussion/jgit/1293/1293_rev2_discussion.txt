Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> This should only fail if id == null.

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> These args aren't right for the message.  Shouldn't we be recording refName here instead of Constants.HEAD?  And is newTag.toString() the right thing to embed as {1} in the message?  (I'm not sure, I don't know exactly what this message text says.)

Also I think this is supposed to be a ConcurrentRefUpdateException.

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> We should explain in a message that signed isn't supported.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommand.java -> We really should validate that the expression Constants.R_TAGS + name will pass Repository.isValidRefName().  If it doesn't we should fail-fast either here during setName(), or during processOptions() above.

I'm pretty sure that updateRef() will blindly do whatever you tell it, and we are relying on callers to check that the name is reasonable.

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommandTest.java -> Please also add a test for when you use setId() to tag something that is not HEAD.
