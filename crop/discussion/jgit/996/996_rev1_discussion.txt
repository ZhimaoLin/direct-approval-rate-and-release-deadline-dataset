DESCRIPTION

Use ObjectReader in RevWalk, TreeWalk

We don't actually need a Repository object here, just an ObjectReader
that can load content for us.  So change the API to depend on that.

However, this breaks the asCommit and asTag legacy translation methods
on RevCommit and RevTag, so we still have to keep the Repository
inside of RevWalk for those two types.  Hopefully we can drop those in
the future, and then drop the Repository off the RevWalk.
