Patch Set 1:

This patch is totally untested, but I think it does what I was proposing on the mailing list... have the WorkingTreeIterator use data from the DirCacheIterator, so that TreeFilter.ANY_DIFF can compare with idEqual() and not trigger a scan of the contents.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Aside from my less-than-usual descriptive commit message (sorry, baby started crying and I had to attend to that... I only found 15 minutes today for coding and this was it)... I've realized this probably isn't going to be a complete solution to Robin's commit performance problem.  So I'm yet not convinced we should commit this.  See the mailing list thread "Avoiding stat calls (again)" for more discussion.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This isn't the solution to the ANY_DIFF problem.
