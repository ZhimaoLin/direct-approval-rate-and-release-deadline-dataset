Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:658, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> It might be OK for a missing file to fail to delete here.  It depends on how the repository was constructed during a test as to whether or not a pack will contain an object that should be removed or not.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/IgnoreNodeTest.java -> Why FileUtils.delete() here, but assertTrue() in other JUnit tests?
