DESCRIPTION

Checkout paths from different branch fails in some cases

Checkout command can now checkout specified paths from another branch.
Checkout command recognizes now if the given path is not available in
the given branch and throws an error instead of silently ignoring this.

Enabled testCheckoutPathesReplacesFileByFolder and
testCheckoutPathesDeletesFile tests contributed by Zachary Orozco.

Line:399, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> I am not sure what you really want to fix here. Do you really want to allow  

  git.checkout()....setName("xyz").addPath("a.txt").call() ?

This should be disallowed. We should use

  git.checkout()....setStartPoint("xyz").addPath("a.txt").call()

The javadoc of setName() tells so. If I try out this change but I leave out the modifications in this block then the tests fail. But if I change the test to use setStartPoint() instead of setName() then they work. I guess we don't need this modification.

Maybe we should really enrich processOptions() and throw exceptions when a combination of options is set which we don't support. Like:

- pathes are specfied AND createBranch is true
- pathes are specfied AND name is specified

Line:466, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> The fix here is really needed. +1
