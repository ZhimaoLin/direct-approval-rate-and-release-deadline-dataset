DESCRIPTION

Trim author/committer name and email in commit header

C Git trims name and email before inserting them into the commit header
so that " A U Thor  " and "  xxx@xxx.xxx " becomes 
"A U Thor xxx@xxx.xxx with a single separating space.

This changes PersonIdent#toExternalString() to trim name and email
before concatenating them.
