DESCRIPTION

Make the FileLfsRepository thread safe

The FileLfsRepository.out member could have been accessed from multiple
threads which would corrupt the content.

Don't store the AtomicObjectOutputStream in the FileLfsRepository.out but
move it to the ObjectUploadListener which is instantiated per-request.

Add a parallel upload test.
