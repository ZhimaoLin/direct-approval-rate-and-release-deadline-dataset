Don't get me wrong. I'm just probing to understand the design. I'm not saying it's bad.

It might be that accumulating deletion entries is exactly the right thing. I don't have enough context to know, so I was asking you for that.

The beauty of this is that it's an internal class so we can remove the flag later if we decide true is always the right value. LGTM.

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> false is the default for a field, so this doesn't need an initializer

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> language nit: "from resurrecting"
