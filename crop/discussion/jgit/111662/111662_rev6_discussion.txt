Line:590, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> What does this part do?

Line:441, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> ooh, good catch as well.

This is orthogonal to the DfsGarbageCollector change, right? Could it be a separate commit?

Line:590, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> RefUpdate doesn't seem to process delete otherwise.

Line:441, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Thanks.  Test is good? I split it out to a separate change.
