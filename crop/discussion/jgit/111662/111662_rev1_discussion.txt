DESCRIPTION

Keeping ref tombstones in GC reftable

A tombstone will prevent a delayed reference update from resurrect the
deleted reference.  This is consistent with COMPACT reftable.

What prevents the deletion entries from accumulating forever (or are we okay with that)?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you say more about this? Is it possible to illustrate using a test?

We are OK with that for GoB, but maybe this is not a necessary burden for pure JGit.  I'll investigate on a flag instead.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I can add a test, but with the code being fixed the ref would not be resurrected, so that's not illustrative.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Update index ranges should not affect reftable merging since merging is done on individual ref, since we store update index per ref.

The best test I could think of is to garbage collect a GC reftable with a tombstone (at later update index) and a delayed INSERT reftable with a ref update (at an earlier update index); and expect that the ref is still deleted.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, I think a test would help.

E.g. is this about what happens when there are overlapping update index ranges?
