DESCRIPTION

RFC: Add merge algorithm

This is the first version of the jgit merge algorithm. Only the pure algorithm and one minimal test is contained.

This commit is not meant to be merged. I propose this only to have a discussion about the merge algorithm itself started. I don't
do that on mailing-list but as a gerrit proposal because I do have some code and I want reviewers to easily put comments directly
into that code.
There are a lot of things missing and I expect that this Change will get receive a lot of additional patch sets before beeing
accepted. But I don't want to work too long without getting your comments on this complicated stuff.

The merge algorithm in MergeAlgorithm.java will
- get as input parameters the common base, the two new contents called "ours" and "theirs"
- compute the Edits from base to ours and from base to theirs with the help of MyersDiff
- iterate over the edits
-- independent edits from ours or from theirs will just be applied to the result
-- for conflicting edits I first harmonize the regions of the edits (so that they start and end at same points in base)
   and then write the two conclicting contents into the result
