Line:468, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> You would have to update the javadoc also. It explicitly says it will look in the index in a bare repo (do we have a index in that case?). Maybe the best way would be to look into the HEAD tree for a .gitmodules instead of examining the index.
