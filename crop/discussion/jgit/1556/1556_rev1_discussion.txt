DESCRIPTION

Unpack and cache large deltas as loose objects

Instead of spooling large delta bases into temporary files and then
immediately deleting them afterwards, spool the large delta out to
a normal loose object.  Later any requests for that large delta can
be answered by reading from the loose object, which is much easier
to stream efficiently for readers.

Since the object is now duplicated, once in the pack as a delta and
again as a loose object, a `git prune-packed` will automatically
delete the loose object variant, releasing the wasted disk space.

As prune-packed is run automatically during repack and gc, and gc
--auto triggers automatically based on the number of loose objects,
we get automatic cache management almost for free.  Large objects
that were unpacked will be periodically cleared out, and will simply
be restored later if they are needed again.

After a short offline discussion with Junio Hamano today, we might
later want to propose a change to prune-packed to hold onto larger
loose objects which also exist in pack files as deltas if the loose
object was recently accessed in the last 2 days.
