Remove use of GitIndex to detect index changes

We can detect index changes using FileSnapshot. This is more efficient
and removes usage of a deprecated class.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Great improvement. Saves a lot of memory (loading not required GitIndex instances).
