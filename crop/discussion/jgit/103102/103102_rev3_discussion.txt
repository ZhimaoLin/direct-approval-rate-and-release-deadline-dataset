DESCRIPTION

Improve getting typed values from a Config

Make the handling of typed values somewhat configurable by using
a separate converter. The default converter is the same as before;
just the implementations of the getters were moved. They also still
raise IllegalArgumentException on invalid values as before.

The converter can be set globally via Config.setTypedConfigGetter(),
which EGit can use in its core Activator to plug in a variant that
catches the IllegalArgumentException, logs the problem, and then
returns the default value.

In this way the behavior for other users of the JGit library is
unchanged, while EGit can deal gracefully with invalid git configs.
