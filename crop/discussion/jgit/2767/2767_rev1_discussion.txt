Line:216, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Strictly speaking, the -- is to break options away from non-option arguments. Saying its the same as -- <path> is a little weird then.

Line:217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Style-nit: Trailing space.

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Please document that the path is relative to the top level of the repository, and must either name a file or a directory exactly (it doesn't support regex, wildcards, etc.)
