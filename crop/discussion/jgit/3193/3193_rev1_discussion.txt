Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(couldn't test this fix yet as I don't have Windows at hand currently)

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> you shouldn't attribute that to Shawn's copyright here, instead use your own copyright statement on another line

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> style nit: we don't use curly braces around single line blocks

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: don't put the bug id in the commit message header, instead add a bug footer and also add Gerrit change-id

Line:272, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> We actually already have most of this code:

  InterruptTimer timer = new InterruptTimer("FS.readPipe");
  try {
    TimeoutInputStream in = new TimeoutInputStream(p.getInputStream(), timer);
    in.setTimeout(10000);
    BufferedReader lineRead = new BufferedReader(in, encoding));
    ...
  } finally {
    timer.terminate();
  }

If a timeout triggers, lineRead.readLine() will throw InterruptedIOException.

Line:277, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Style-nit: There is no reason to hoist this outside of the try block. Please leave it initialized by the Runtime.getRuntime().exec() invocation.

Line:307, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> A read exception should be considered before looking at the result string.
