DESCRIPTION

Repository can be configured with FS

On Windows, FS_Win32_Cygwin has been used if a Cygwin Git installation is
present in the PATH. Assuming that the user works with the Cygwin Git
installation may result in unnecessary overhead if he actually does not.
Applications built on top of jgit may have more knowledge on the actually
used Git client (Cygwin or not) and hence should be able to configure which
FS to use accordingly.
