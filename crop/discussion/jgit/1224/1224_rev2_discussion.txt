DESCRIPTION

Allow ObjectReuseAsIs to have more control over write ordering

The reuse system used by an object database may be able to benefit
from knowing what objects are coming next, and even improve data
throughput by delaying (or moving up) objects that are stored near
each other in the source database.

Pushing the iteration down into the reuse code makes it possible
for a smarter implementation to aggregate reuse.  But for the
standard pack file format on disk we don't bother, its quite
efficient already.
