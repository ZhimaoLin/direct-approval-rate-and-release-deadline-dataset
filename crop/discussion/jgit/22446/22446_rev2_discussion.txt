DESCRIPTION

Add getPackFile to ReceivePack to make PostReceiveHook more usable

Having access to the pack file that was created by the ReceivePack
may be useful for post receive hooks. For example, a hook may want
to check the size of the received pack and the created index.

Line:176, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> You should mention that not all Implementations of JGit's ObjectDatabase will work with java.io.File and can return something different from null here. What you suggest here works with FileObjectDatabase but not with DfsObjDatabase. See the different implementations of PackParser.parse(). DfsPackParser will return always null instead of a PackLock instance. Only ObjectDirectoryPackParser will use the constructor which you have modified in this change.

Line:176, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Have you overlooked this comment? Googles gerrit instances (I think they use DfsObjDatabase) will not be able to make use of this and that should be documented.
