DESCRIPTION

Fix MissingObjectException in RenameDetector

When attempting to determine the size of a blob that does not exist,
the RenameDetector throws a MissingObjectException.

The fix is to return a size of zero if the size is requested for a blob
id that doesn't exist.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> right, this is meant to ensure the behavior you mentioned in comment #3 in bug 481577. It would probably haven been better to discuss and submit that in a separate patch. Let me know if I should remove this test.
