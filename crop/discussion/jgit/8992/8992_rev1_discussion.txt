Patch Set 1:

did you consider that the global configuration option "merge.ff" [1] maps these enum values in a different way ? This option can be used to set the ff merge option for all branches vs. merge.<branch>.mergeoptions is used to configure merge options for one branch.

- merge.ff = true maps to --ff
- merge.ff = only maps to --ff-only
- merge.ff = false maps to --no-ff

on the other hand
- merge.<branch>.mergeoptions = --ff maps to --ff
etc.

> did you consider (..) the global configuration option "merge.ff"

Nope... Hey, bug 336933 was supposed to be a trivial fix! ;) 

I will try to propose a better patch later this week. Thanks for catching this now.
