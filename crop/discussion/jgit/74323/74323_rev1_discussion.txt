DESCRIPTION

RFC: DfsInserter: Optionally disable existing object check

When using a DfsInserter for high-throughput insertion of many
objects (analogous to git-fast-import), we don't necessarily want to
do a random object lookup for each. It'll be faster from the
inserter's perspective to insert the duplicate objects and let a later
GC handle the deduplication.
