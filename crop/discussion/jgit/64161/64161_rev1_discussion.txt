DESCRIPTION

'CredentialItem' check for strings extended

Clone of an repository via ssh fails when the private key is protected with a passphrase.
The problem is that the method to checking the prompt text only looks for the String "Password:".
But the ssh prompt text looks like "Passphrase for ####". So the check fails, throws an
'UnsupportedCredentialItem" exception and closes the connection.

If condtion extended to check for both prompt texts.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider.java -> Shouldn't it always end on ':'? Currently 'password' must be followed by ':' but 'passphrase for' can be suffixed by everything. Not even a space after 'for' is required.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider.java -> No, because the sshd's password prompt is depending on the os where the repo is. Some systems appending ":" at the end of the message and some not. But you're right. My regex is too specific at this point. I'll update the check.
