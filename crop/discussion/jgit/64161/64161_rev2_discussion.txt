DESCRIPTION

'CredentialItem' check for strings extended

Clone of an repository via ssh fails when the private key is protected with a passphrase.
The problem is that the method to checking the prompt text only looks for the String "Password:".
But the ssh prompt text looks like "Passphrase for ####". So the check fails, throws an
'UnsupportedCredentialItem" exception and closes the connection.

If condtion extended to check for both prompt texts.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider.java -> looks like this part of the pattern doesn't help to differentiate between texts which should match and those which should not match since (.*)? already allows arbitrary text
