Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Don't clutter the API. Make this a separate utility

Line:422, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I'm with Robin on this, I don't think we want to clutter up this class with this method.

I might be open to the smaller definition of just long count(), where the caller sets up the start/uninteresting points first and then calls count() to run the iteration and increment the counter for it.

Line:422, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Ok, I'll move it into a new class RevWalkUtil (or RevWalkUtils? (both naming conventions seem to be used in jgit)).

Should the new method then have the following signature?:

  public static long count(final RevWalk walk, final RevCommit start, final RevCommit end)

Should the caller be responsible for doing reset() or should that be done inside the method?

Line:422, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I think the method should do the reset() for the caller, given that it is acting as a small utility.

Match what we call our StringUtils class. Its either StringUtil or StringUtils, I don't remember which, but whatever it is use the same pluralization for the RevWalk utility.
