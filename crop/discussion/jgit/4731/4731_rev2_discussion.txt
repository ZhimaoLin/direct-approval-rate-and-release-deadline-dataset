Patch Set 2:

I seem to have managed to confuse Gerrit.. I rebased the changes and switched the order of I09f7d9b049beea417da7ff32c9f8bf0d4ed46a7f (RevWalkUtils) and I896a2384217936c8b672df8b81c9599f5c350458 (BranchConfig). Then I pushed the whole branch.

But patch set 2 of this change doesn't seem to be picked up properly.
