DESCRIPTION

Add "Branch" command

The need for this becomes more pressing with the addition of "Pull"
support: we need to make sure the upstream configuration entries
are written correctly when creating and renaming branches 
(and of course are cleaned up when deleting them).
This adds support for listing, adding, deleting, and renaming branches
including the more common options.
