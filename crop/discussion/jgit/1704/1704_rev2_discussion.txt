DESCRIPTION

Add "Branch" command

The need for this becomes more pressing with the addition of "Pull"
support: we need to make sure the upstream configuration entries
are written correctly when creating branches (and of course are cleaned
up when deleting them).
This adds support for listing, adding, deleting, and renaming branches
including the more common options.
There is one TODO left as an Exception should be re-used which
comes as part of the "Pull" support (change 1696).
