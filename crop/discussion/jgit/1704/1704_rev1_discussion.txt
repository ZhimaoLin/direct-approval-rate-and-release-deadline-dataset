DESCRIPTION

Add "Branch" command

The need for this becomes more pressing with the addition of "Pull"
support: we need to make sure the upstream configuration entries
are written correctly when creating branches (and of course are cleaned
up when deleting them).
This adds support for listing, adding, deleting, and renaming branches
including the more common options.
There is one TODO left as an Exception should be re-used which
comes as part of the "Pull" support (change 1696).

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BranchCommand.java -> This is hideous.  What about having branchList(), branchCreate(), branchRename(), branchDelete() methods on Git that create different command objects for each operation?

I think callers can handle typing branchCreate() vs. branch().setCreate(...)

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please rebase one change on top of the other, so that the Exception is properly defined before its used in either place.

I expect that the next changeset would look quite different because we split the different modes into own classes. Therefore I don't review fully now.

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BranchCommand.java -> If we implement each mode in his own class (BranchDelete, BranchCreate,...) then we don't need the Mode enum anymore. I hope we can also get rid of this options map. Why not store the options simply in plain attributes?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BranchCommand.java -> I also think so. If git porcelain commands have different modes which don't even share common paramenters (like create vs. list) they should go into different commands implemented in seperate classes.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:210, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BranchCommand.java -> that's not really a commit message, or? No commit get's this message. I suggest reflogMessage.
