DESCRIPTION

Add "Branch" command

The need for branching becomes more pressing with pull
support: we need to make sure the upstream configuration entries
are written correctly when creating and renaming branches
(and of course are cleaned up when deleting them).
This adds support for listing, adding, deleting and renaming
branches including the more common options.
