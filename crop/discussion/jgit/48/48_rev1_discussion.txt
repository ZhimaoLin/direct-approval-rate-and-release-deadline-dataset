DESCRIPTION

Teach UploadPack how to use an RPC style interface

If biDirectionalPipe is false UploadPack does not start out with
the advertisement but instead assumes it should read one block of
want/have lines, process that, and write the ACK/NAKs out.

This means it only is doing one read through the input followed by
one write to the output, which fits with the HTTP request processing
model, and any other type of RPC system.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Only a couple of observations in the code rather than the change itself

Line:329, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Long ago I worked with C compilers that were too stupid to remove the boolean test for "while (1)".  So unending loops were written as "for (;;)" to work around it.  The Java compiler is obviously not that stupid, and neither are any modern C compilers, but habit is habit.

Our coding standard at this point is more-or-less "loop with no conditional" is spelled as "for (;;)" because most of them have been written by me.

Line:329, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I've always found 'while(true)' more canonical way of looping forever.

Line:368, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> We don't document private methods.  If the code isn't obvious to the reader it should be refactored to be obvious as-is, rather than documenting it.  That is part of the reason why this project has maintained (and continues to maintain) the rule "thou shall not commit a change without a review by another committer".  If its not obvious to another committer, its not obvious enough to survive.

Line:368, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Might be worth documenting here what the return value of 'negotiate' means, even if it's not a public method
