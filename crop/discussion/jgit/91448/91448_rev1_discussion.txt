Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> this dependency is unused and can be removed

Line:15, org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> which problem does this fix ? With the old package import for org.hamcrest I can still run the tests from Eclipse (tried with Oxygen)

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I think that should be done in a separate change.

Line:15, org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Without this change, I get a warning:

 API analysis aborted: org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test has unresolved constraints: org.hamcrest [1.1.0,2.0.0)

All the other instances of hamcrest in manifest files are for org.hamcrest.core so I changed this one to the same.

Patch Set 1:

The warnings I'm fixing here all started to appear today.

After pulling the latest master, my Eclipse build was failing with errors caused by the jetty upgrade.  I fixed that by installing new snapshot, rebuilding the packaging project, and resetting the target version.  Then these warnings appeared.

I've also upgraded Eclipse today from neon.1 to neon.2.
