DESCRIPTION

Keep submodules in index that are missing in working directory

Submodules present in the index but missing from the working
directory should not be staged for deletion when AddCommand
is called with the update flag set to true.

This mirrors the behavior of CGit.  Submodules can still be
staged for deletion by running by using the RmCommand.
