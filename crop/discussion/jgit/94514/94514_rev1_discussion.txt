Line:602, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> Is that always what LOCK_FAILURE means? E.g. if I try to lock the ref but there is a concurrent ref update happening, wouldn't that produce LOCK_FAILURE, too?

Thanks for working on this.

Part of the trouble with LOCK_FAILURE is that it is ambiguous but pretends to be precise.

If the message can enumerate possible causes or, even better, pick which one happened, then that would be amazing.

Sorry for the unhelpful message.  This change was abandoned automatically by a script, and due to operator error the correct message was not added.

It should have read:  "Abandoning after 3 months of inactivity.  If this change is still needed, please restore it."
