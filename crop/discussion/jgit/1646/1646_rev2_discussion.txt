DESCRIPTION

[DO NOT SUBMIT] Add diff performance test tools

The DiffPerformanceTest isn't a very real-world example of a source
code file, as there are too many identical segments.  This isn't
very fair to PatienceDiff, which was designed around more typical
human written source code that uses unique function declarations
within a source file.
