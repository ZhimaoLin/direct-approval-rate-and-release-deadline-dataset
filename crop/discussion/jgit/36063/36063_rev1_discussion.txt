DESCRIPTION

Make sure checkout doesn't report conflicts on ignored pathes

In a situation where a certain path was ignored but a working tree file
existed jgit didn't allowed to checkout a branch which didn't ignored
this path but contained different content. JGit thought it is forced to
override unsaved content and raised an error. This commit fixes this by
checking that dirty working tree files only lead to conflicts if they
are not ignored.
