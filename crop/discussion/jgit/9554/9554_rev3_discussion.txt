DESCRIPTION

Only replace the ChangeId in the footer, not in the body

Additionally expose methods to find the first footer line and to find
the position of the ChangeId footer in the commit message in order to
enable reuse of these methods introduced for the fix.

Change-Id: I87ecca009ca3bff1ca0de3c436ebd95736bf5a10
