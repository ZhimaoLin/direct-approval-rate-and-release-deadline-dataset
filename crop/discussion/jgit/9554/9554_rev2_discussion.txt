Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> this index is counting characters whereas the index in indexOfFirstFooterLine counts lines, this isn't clear neither from method names nor from javadoc

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> style nit: no braces around single line blocks

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtilTest.java -> why does this test need to change ?

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtilTest.java -> why does this test need to change ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> maybe you should mention that you also expose the new public methods indexOfChangeId and indexOfFirstFooterLine in order to enable reuse of these methods introduced for the fix

Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> Done

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> Done

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtilTest.java -> Because there was a bug before: ChangeIdUtil looked for an existing ChangeId by just looking for message.indexOf(CHANGE_ID). This is fixed with this change. In the test the ChangeId was not in a valid footer, the last paragraph contained the line "more text".

I'll change this test to make that more clear.
