DESCRIPTION

DiffFormatter: Use IndexDiffFilter to speed up working tree

If DiffFormatter is asked to compare the index to the working tree,
it can go faster by using the cached stat information to compare
the two entries rather than relying on SHA-1 computation alone.

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> style-nit: somehow the ordering got changed...

Line:448, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> According to the setter, pathFilter cannot be null.

I'll post a new version of this later this morning.

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> This ordering change must be a bug in the Eclipse "Organize Imports" command.  I can't see why it would do this though, FileHeader.PatchType should always be sorting before HunkHeader.  *sigh*

Line:448, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Oh, right.  OK, that will certainly simplify this block.
