DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Display totals after sending objects

CGit pack-objects displays a totals line after the pack data
was fully written.  This can be useful to understand some of
the decisions made by the packer, and has been a great tool
for helping to debug some of that code.

Track some of the basic values, and send it to the client when
packing is done:

  remote: Counting objects: 1826776, done
  remote: Finding sources: 100% (55121/55121)
  remote: Getting sizes: 100% (25654/25654)
  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (11434/11434)
  remote: Total 1861830 (delta 3926), reused 1854705 (delta 38306)
  Receiving objects: 100% (1861830/1861830), 386.03 MiB | 30.32 MiB/s, done.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

You know, not sure I like the approach of having the stats object accessible like that. I can't think of anything better so we'll just push it in.

Patch Set 2:

I do want the stats object exposed.  Longer term I want to get that exposed (with much more detail) up into the daemon layer, i.e. our Daemon or GitServlet object, and then use it to create a git-specific access log.

One of the things Git hosting sites don't know is what remote fetches cost.  We cannot tell a remote clone from a remote incremental fetch.  We cannot tell how out-of-date clients are when they fetch, or what it costs to bring them current.  The only way to know that data is to peek into the state of PackWriter.  This stats object is going to carry that data up to a higher level, allowing the daemon to log it in a way that makes sense for the daemon.

I don't want PackWriter making its own log files, that's insanity.  But its the only part of the system that knows what the damn cost was, or what the details of the request were.
