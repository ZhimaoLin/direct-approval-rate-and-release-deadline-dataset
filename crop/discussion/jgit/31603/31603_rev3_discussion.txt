DESCRIPTION

Bug 433387: "Missing unknown" on zero length object

Stop DataFormatException being thrown by the Inflater when a zero length
object is encountered in the repository. This was resulting in the entire
pack file being dropped and causing a lot of subsequent "Missing unknown"
errors.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Good catch.

I think we need a unit test here. I think you'll want to create a test operating on a pack containing a non-empty-object;empty-object;non-empty-object and verify that you can retrieve all of them.

Line:322, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCursor.java -> No ; here

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We put the bug number in the footer. See any other commit

Patch Set 3:

I did notice the other review (Impeccable timing!) and have been commenting on it.

With regards to unit testing it - Its not something I've got the knowledge to do correctly, I don't understand anything about the way git stores stuff (or indeed why they'd be zero length objects in there), so may even have misdescribed what we actually were seeing.

Abandoned

I now cannot reproduce the original issue we were seeing that caused this change to be needed in our install, which I started to look at in light of the changes in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/31604/ conflicting with these.
As I can't reproduce now may as well abandon the change.
