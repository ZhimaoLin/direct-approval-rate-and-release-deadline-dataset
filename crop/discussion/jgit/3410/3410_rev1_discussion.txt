DESCRIPTION

Optimize MergeAlgorithm if ours or theirs is empty

Previously when merging two contents with a non-empty base and one of
the contents was empty (size == 0) and the other was modified there
was a potentially expensive calculation until we finally always come
to the same result -> the complete non-deleted content should collide
with the empty content.

This proposal adds an optimization to detect empty input content and
to produce the appropriate result immediatly.
