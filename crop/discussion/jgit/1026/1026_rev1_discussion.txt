DESCRIPTION

Permit AnyObjectTo to compareTo AnyObjectId

Assume that the argument of compareTo won't be mutated while we
are doing the compare, and support the wider AnyObjectId type so
MutableObjectId is suitable on either side of the compareTo call.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Does not look good after all, though I cannot understand why.

See I09d0aafb3d15436e942acc4b722a63d35f58051a for the version of EGit I tried where BlobStorageTest.testFailCorrupt2 fails. I had to change it to actually read data now that we are streaming.

Patch Set 1:

If this change is causing EGit to fail, that's EGit's problem.  Its a signature change, but that should be reflected as a compile or runtime linkage error that is easily fixed by rebuilding EGit.

Patch Set 1:

I did rebuild EGit, but sometimes Eclipse just doesn't do a clean well enough.
