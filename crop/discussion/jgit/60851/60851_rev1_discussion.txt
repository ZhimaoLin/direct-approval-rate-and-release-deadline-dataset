DESCRIPTION

rebase: Do not use search path to find ORIG_HEAD

When executing a 'fixup' command from rebase --interactive, if
ORIG_HEAD does not exist directly under .git, do not read the value to
fill ORIG_HEAD from refs/heads/ORIG_HEAD.

This code still throws NullPointerException if ORIG_HEAD cannot be
found --- this change does not fix that, but a followup change should.
