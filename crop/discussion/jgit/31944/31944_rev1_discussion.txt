DESCRIPTION

Throw URISyntaxException for incorrect percent-encoding

URIish.unescape() threw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the given
url has incorrect percent-encoding (e.g. http://example.com/%gg). But an
URISyntaxException is much better to know the reason of the failure.

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Please separate them into two lines, much easier to read.

Line:282, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Could you extract that into a function? That way, you can just write `byte val = parseHexByte(c1, c2);` and in the function have a single return.
