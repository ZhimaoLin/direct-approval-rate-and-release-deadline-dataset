DESCRIPTION

Add a RepeatRule to help repeating flaky tests

A JUnit TestRule which enables to run the same JUnit test repeatedly.
This may help to identify the root cause why a flaky tests which succeed
most often does fail sometimes.

Add the RepeatRule to the test class containing the test to be repeated:

public class MyTest {
xxx@xxx.xxx
	public RepeatRule repeatRule = new RepeatRule();
	...
}
 
and annotate the test to be repeated with xxx@xxx.xxx
annotation:
 
xxx@xxx.xxx
xxx@xxx.xxx = 100)
	public void test() {
		...
	}
 
 then this test will be repeated 100 times
