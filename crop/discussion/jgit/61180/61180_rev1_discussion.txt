DESCRIPTION

Change FS_Win32_Cygwin not to throw NPE when facing InMemory databases

The FS_Win32_Cygwin class assumes in the findHook() method that every
repository has a valid gitDir. But in tests when using
in-memory-repositories this is not true and this method was generating
NPEs. Change the method to return null if no repository directory can be
determined.
