DESCRIPTION

Handle executable mode limitations of our fs abstractions more gracefully

Similar to 2202e90 (Handle symlink limitations of our filesystems
abstractions more gracefully 2014-07-10), we have a similar problem with
executable files.  If the underlying filesystem supports files with an
executable mode bit AND our FS abstraction doesn't AND core.filemode is
either unset or true (e.g. clone was made with cgit on cygwin), then we
simply have no way of correctly handling the users' executable files.

This problem is often avoided because jgit clone will, on Windows (even
under Cygwin where executable bits are supported), unconditionally set
core.filemode to false.  However, not all clones are made by jgit, which
leads us to this problem.

Since we lack support for executable files, it will be impossible for us
to do everything a full git implementation would be able to.  We therefore
need to be cautious about what we chose to do with such files and what we
report about them, in an effort to make things as consistent as possible.
Sadly, we currently lie to the user and simply claim that all their
executable files have been modified, resulting in them trying to pick out
the truly modified files from among screenfuls of data.  Other users get
all their artifacts built and published with a phony 'dirty' tag.  Since
we detect filemode "changes" incorrectly in this scenario, a better route
to take, especially since git is designed for trees of slowly changing
data, is to simply ignore filemode "changes" in such cases, i.e. to behave
the same as if core.fileMode were set to true.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeOptions.java -> Only fix FTI/WTI

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure this behavior in JGit is correct, but nobody has really challenged it. It comes from the fact that Windows programs tend to set the executable "bit" (ACL actually) by default, hence we do what C Git does on Windows (or did, haven't checked for a while).

As for Cygwin. we don't seem to have anyone supporting it. The code still hangs around until it becomes a burden.
