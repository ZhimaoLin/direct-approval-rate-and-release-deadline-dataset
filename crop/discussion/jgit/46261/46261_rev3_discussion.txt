DESCRIPTION

Line:520, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> debug?

Line:412, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.java -> The other entries here are in alphabetical order, so this should go after invalidPathReservedOnWindows.

Line:353, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Missing closing quote here?

Also to keep the entries in alphabetical order, this should be moved after invalidPathReservedOnWindows

It seems that this fix goes the wrong way, see comments in TransportHttp.java

Line:516, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Response code 301 and 302 of a HTTP GET was checked for redirection here, which was unnecessary. By default, both `HttpURLConnection` and `HttpClient` will handle redirection of GET automatically.

Line:969, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> More work should be done here since conn is a POST request opened in TransportHttp$Service.openStream() method, whose response will not be handled by TransportHttp.connect() method above.

Patch Set 3:

Ok. When this is picked up:

1. Bo mentioned above that HttpURLConnection and HttpClient both transparently did redirect handling. Well, they also do authentication handling, yet it is done explictly here. (And needed, too.) 

2. Updating baseUrl is the right way; that way the POST could already work with the correct URL. Perhaps MOVED_PERM redirects should even be logged so that users are aware of them and
can update their git URLs.

3. The recursive unlimited redirect following on POST added in change 88811 should be fixed.

4. In any case, tests should be included. 88811 should have had tests from the start.

5. The whole redirect following business should honor the git config http.followRedirects (possible values true (meaning always), false (never), and initial (only on GET, but not on POST)). See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config .

6. git config has no way to specify the number of redirects that will be followed. C git uses curl, and that has its own way of specifying a redirect limit. Some redirect limit config may need to be introduced. Quick off-the-top-of-my-head suggestion: introduce a git config setting "http.redirectLimit".

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for working on this. But be careful: see

 https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/+/50d3413740d1da599cdc0106e6e916741394cc98
 https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/+/6628eb41db5189c0cdfdced6d8697e7c813c5f0f

To avoid certain kinds of attacks, the approach Git took is to handle redirects on the initial /info/refs request and update the base URL accordingly, and then refuse to follow redirects after that.

I haven't looked carefully at the code, but I noticed the commit message and tests didn't cover this issue, so I thought I should mention it.

Jonathan, note that this is an older commit that once was abandoned. Matthias has resurrected it because 88811 evidently didn't fix the issue, there's a new attempt https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102442/ coming in, and I thought it would be better to resurrect this and finish it.

Do you see more than the 6 items I had mentioned in my previous global comment?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> These are excellent links; nice to see such informative commit messages :-)

I had mentioned http.followRedirects already in my global patch comment (item #5). And I suggest to even limit following redirects only a certain number of times.

Patch Set 3:

A note on point 1 (httpUrlConnection already does follow redirects): it looks as if that's true only iff

1. the new URL has the same protocol (line 2556 at [1]). This would explain why the Github http->https redirects are not working.

2. a redirected POST is turned into a GET unless the http.strictPostRedirect system property is set.

This explains why we need to do our own redirect handling on top of the one provided by the JDK. And the POST->GET translation looks rather bothersome; I think we must even disable the built-in redirect connection handling and enforce that on our connections via setInstanceFollowsRedirects(false). Also, the special cases mentioned by Jonathan might require us doing that anyway.
