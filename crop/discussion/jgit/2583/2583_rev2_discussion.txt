DESCRIPTION

Created RemoteSession interface

The RemoteSession interface operates like a simplified version of
java.lang.Runtime with a single exec method (and a disconnect
method). It returns a java.lang.Process, which should begin execution
immediately. Note that this greatly simplifies the interface for
running commands. There is no longer a connect method, and most
implementations will contain the bulk of their code inside
Process.exec, or a constructor called by Process.exec. (See the
revised implementations of JschSession and ExtSession.)
Implementations can now configure their connections properly without
either ignoring the proper use of the interface or trying to adhere
to an overly strict interface with odd rules about what methods are
called first.  For example, Jsch needs to create the output stream
before executing, which it now does in the process constructor. These
changes should make it much easier to add alternate session
implementations in the future.

I'm really happy with this approach. I'm just down to style nits, and what appears to be a bug where you use milliseconds but document the timeout as seconds.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SshTransport.java -> Style-nit: Revert this reflow.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SshTransport.java -> Style-nit: Trailing whitespace.

Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SshTransport.java -> Here the timeout is in milliseconds, but the API Javadoc suggested seconds. That's why I wanted to clarify it.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SshSessionFactory.java -> Why seconds? More typical is for timeouts to be in milliseconds. Or to pass both a long and a TimeUnit.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> Style-nit: Remove the added final keywords.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> Style-nit: Remove the added final keyword, and undo the reflow.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> Style-nit; Remove the added final keywords.

Line:24, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.java -> Since the constructor is public, and the class is well documented, should we just make the class public?

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.java -> Style-nit: Trailing space.

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.java -> Style-nit: Trailing space.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.java -> Please reflow this comment text. Its badly mangled.

Maybe consider pulling from 105 through 145 into a method called setupStreams(). This would remove at least one level of indentation (as the try is in the constructor now) and might make it easier to deal with the deeper nesting inside of the else block for the timeout setup.

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.java -> Style-nit: No curly braces on single statements.

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.java -> I guess there really isn't a better way to implement waitFor(). *sigh* At least this has a short timeout.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> Style-nit: Please revert this reflow of the javadoc.

Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> Style-nit: Can you try pulling this back up onto the prior line so the block more closely matches the old version?

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> Style-nit: Please revert this reflow of the javadoc.

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> Style-nit: There was no reason to add final here.
