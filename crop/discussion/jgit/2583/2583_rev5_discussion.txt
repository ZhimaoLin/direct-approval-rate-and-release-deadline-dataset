DESCRIPTION

Create RemoteSession interface

The RemoteSession interface operates like a simplified version of
java.lang.Runtime with a single exec method (and a disconnect
method). It returns a java.lang.Process, which should begin execution
immediately. Note that this greatly simplifies the interface for
running commands. There is no longer a connect method, and most
implementations will contain the bulk of their code inside
Process.exec, or a constructor called by Process.exec. (See the
revised implementations of JschSession and ExtSession.)
Implementations can now configure their connections properly without
either ignoring the proper use of the interface or trying to adhere
to an overly strict interface with odd rules about what methods are
called first.  For example, Jsch needs to create the output stream
before executing, which it now does in the process constructor. These
changes should make it much easier to add alternate session
implementations in the future.
