DESCRIPTION

Correct distribution of allowed delta size along chain length

Nicolas Pitre discovered a very simple rule for selecting between two
different delta base candidates:

  - if based whole object, must be <= 50% of target
  - if at end of a chain, must be <= 1/depth * 50% of target

The rule penalizes deltas near the end of the chain, requiring them to
be very small in order to be kept by the packer.  This favors deltas
that are based on a shorter chain, where the read-time unpack cost is
much lower.  Fewer bytes need to be consulted from the source pack
file, and less copying is required in memory to rebuild the object.

Junio Hamano explained Nico's rule to me today, and this commit fixes
DeltaWindow to implement it as described.

When no base has been chosen the computation is simply the statements
denoted above.  However once a base with depth of 9 has been chosen
(e.g.  when pack.depth is limited to 10), a non-delta source may
create a new delta that is up to 10x larger than the already selected
base.  This reflects the intent of Nico's size distribution rule no
matter what order objects are visited in the DeltaWindow.

With this patch and my other patches applied, repacking JGit with:

  [pack]
    reuseObjects = false
    reuseDeltas = false
    depth = 50
    window = 250
    threads = 4
    compression = 9

  CGit (all) 5,711,735 bytes; real 0m13.942s user 0m47.722s [1]
  JGit heads 5,718,295 bytes; real 0m11.880s user 0m38.177s [2]
       rest      9,809 bytes

The improved JGit result for the head pack is only 6.4 KiB larger than
CGit's resulting pack.  This patch allowed JGit to find an additional
39.7 KiB worth of space savings.  JGit now also often runs 2s faster
than CGit, despite also creating bitmaps and pruning objects after the
head pack creation.

[1] time git repack -a -d -F --window=250 --depth=50
