DESCRIPTION

Improve MergeAlgorithm to produce smaller conflicts

The merge algorithm was reporting conflicts which where to big.

Example: The common base was "ABC", the "ours" version contained
"AB1C" (the addition of "1" after pos 2) and the "theirs" version also
contained "AB1C". We have two potentially conflicting edits in the
same region which happen to bring in exactly the same content. This
should not be a conflict - but was previously reported as
"AB<<<1===1>>>C".

This is fixed by checking every conflicting chunk whether the
conflicting regions have a common prefix or suffix and by removing
this regions from the conflict.
