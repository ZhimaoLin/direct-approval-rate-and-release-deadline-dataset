DESCRIPTION

Add readAheadBuffer hint to ReadableChannel

This hint allows an underlying implementation to read more bytes when
possible and buffer them locally for future read calls to consume.

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/InMemoryRepository.java -> Is this the only implementer of ReadableChannel in JGit?

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReadableChannel.java -> Differentiating this "setter" from the accessors above by prefixing with "set" would be helpful.

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/InMemoryRepository.java -> Yes :)

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReadableChannel.java -> Probably? I went non-setter because position(long) above is a setter that is not called setPosition(long).
