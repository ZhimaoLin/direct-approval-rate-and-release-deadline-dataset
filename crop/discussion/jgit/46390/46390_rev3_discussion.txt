DESCRIPTION

Add readAheadBuffer hint to ReadableChannel

This hint allows an underlying implementation to read more bytes when
possible and buffer them locally for future read calls to consume.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReadableChannel.java -> What is the contract of this function from the caller's point of view? Is it a promise that reads will tend to be in chunks of size bufferSize? If I read an amount n which is less than bufferSize, should the callee read another bufferSize in the next call or, say, bufferSize - n?

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReadableChannel.java -> of approximately

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReadableChannel.java -> s/,//

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReadableChannel.java -> It's tempting to call this something like setReadAheadSize or setReadAheadBytes, to make the meaning of the argument more obvious at call sites.
