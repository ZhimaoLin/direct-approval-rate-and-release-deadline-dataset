DESCRIPTION

Retry to call credentials provider if http authentication failed

If the user provided wrong credentials or credentials changed we
shouldn't give up immediately but retry to get valid credentials from
the credentials provider. Reset the credentials provider if
authentication failed repeatedly to avoid it reuses wrong credentials in
case it stored them in a persistent store.
