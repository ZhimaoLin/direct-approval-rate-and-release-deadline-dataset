DESCRIPTION

Adds a paranoid 'must be provided' option to ReceivePack

By default, a receive pack assumes that its user will only provide
references to objects that it can see. In certain cases, an additional
check that verifies that the objects that were provided are reachable
by a tree or a commit that the user can see is necessary.

For example, it is useful when the code doesn't trust the client not
to provide a forged SHA-1 reference to an object in an attempt to
access parts of the DAG that they weren't allowed to see by the
configured RefFilter.
