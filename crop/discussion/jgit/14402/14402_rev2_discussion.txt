DESCRIPTION

Add option to make jgit return after initializing rebase interactive

Preparing the list of rebase steps may be a long-term user interaction,
and therefore a callback may not be most appropriate but rather using
atomic operations (initialization;prepare;process)

Calling rebase interactive with option stopAfterInitialization set to
true, the command will return with INTERACTIVE_PREPARED_RESULT after
initialization (i.e. writing initial files to "rebase-merge" directory)
instead of starting processing the rebase steps immediately.

After initialization the list of rebase steps can be changed and
processed later on (See I8c7f0e5990cf79da2c73b5ccb153f990fde6e6eb and
I7e28474faed2dff3d42dd4d156fe9ba295f36d0d).
