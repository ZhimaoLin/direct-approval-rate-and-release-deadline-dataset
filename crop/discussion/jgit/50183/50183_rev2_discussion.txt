Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> I've read the documentation for receive.certNonceSlop in git-config(1) a few times and while it's a little hard to parse, I think this behavior matches the intent of C git. Specifically, if slop is set, "they only can check GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS is OK," implying OK means "ok within slop".
