DESCRIPTION

Replace Change-Id even if the footer is not well-formed

Instead of only looking for a Change-Id in the last section if it 
consists of well-formed footer lines replace the last occurrence of
a valid Change-Id line in the last section. Some tools require footer
lines e.g. without a colon.
