DESCRIPTION

Replace Change-Id even if the footer is not well-formed

Instead of only looking for a Change-Id in the last section if it 
consists of well-formed footer lines replace the last occurrence of
a valid Change-Id line in the last section. Some tools require footer
lines e.g. without a colon.

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> I think we should not trim here since this leads to strange effects when amending a commit message with indented Change-Id  in the footer, e.g.

 test

         Change-ID: Ic4bfb17d790c1250b7bfc22589bfe473d1509151

in the staging view amending such a commit deletes the Change-Id which looks wrong

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> we could be more tolerant and allow whitepace here and leave it to Gerrit to complain if there is whitespace before

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> I tried pushing a change with indented change-id and Gerrit rejects that with the following error message:

 missing Change-Id in commit message
 Processing changes: refs: 1
 Processing changes: refs: 1, done    
 ERROR: missing Change-Id in commit message
 Suggestion for commit message:
 testing commit with indented change-id

	Change-Id: I4e310313c27873446519b09c82ef9a2e754f1b23

 Change-Id: Ic869add51cf3d82990102320004fa2a9d360b92b
 Hint: A potential Change-Id was found, but it was not in the  footer of the commit message.

There is no point to allow an indented change-id in EGit if Gerrit doesn't accept it
