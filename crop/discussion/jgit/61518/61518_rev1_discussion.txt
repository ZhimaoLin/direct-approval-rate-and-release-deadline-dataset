DESCRIPTION

DirCacheBuilder: Speed up reading from trees

Recursively copying a tree into a DirCache is a bottleneck for some
algorithms like the in memory merge code in Gerrit Code Review.  Drop
a layer down in the stack and use CanonicalTreeParser directly as the
addition logic only processes 1 tree at a time and does not need the
merge sorting feature (or overhead) of TreeWalk.

Combined with 761814fe9c ("DirCacheEntry: Speed up creation by
avoiding string cast") tree loading nearly halves in running time
from 70ms to 36ms on some platforms.
