DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: Add method for parsing from a stream

We intend to store received push certificates somewhere, like a
particular ref in the repository in question. For reading data back
out, it will be useful to read push certificates (without pkt-line
framing) in a streaming fashion.

Not as bad as I thought once we worked it all out. Done in a parent.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Per your comments on the previous change, wrapped this in a BufferedReader if necessary.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Er, that was a bad idea. Leave it to the callers.
