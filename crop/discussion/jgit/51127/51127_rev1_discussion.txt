DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: Add method for parsing from a stream

We intend to store received push certificates somewhere, like a
particular ref in the repository in question. For reading data back
out, it will be useful to read push certificates (without pkt-line
framing) in a streaming fashion.
