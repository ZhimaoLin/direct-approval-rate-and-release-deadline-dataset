DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: Add method for parsing from a stream

We intend to store received push certificates somewhere, like a
particular ref in the repository in question. For reading data back
out, it will be useful to read push certificates (without pkt-line
framing) in a streaming fashion.

Patch Set 4:

FWIW, I think this change is fine as-is even when we change Id3eb3241 to store a single cert per file.

Patch Set 4:

Ugh.

Making trailing newlines optional in push certificates will require a complete rewrite of the parser.
