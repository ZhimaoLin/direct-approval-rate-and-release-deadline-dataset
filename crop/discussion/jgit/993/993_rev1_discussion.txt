DESCRIPTION

Rename openObject, hasObject to just open, has

Similar to what we did on Repository, the openObject method
already implied we wanted to open an object, given its main
argument was of type AnyObjectId.  Simplify the method name
to just the action, has or open.

Patch Set 1:

Regarding the names being this short, I got tired of typing "hasObject" or "openObject" in contexts that seemed to me to be, well, damn clear it was an object we were hasing or opening.  In every case the argument seemed unambiguous, and it often felt redundant to be saying "fooObject" everywhere.

Also, the semantics have changed slightly.  open no longer returns null, it throws an exception.  Chopping the method name shorter forces callers to update their call sites.  Hopefully when they do that they would also update their error handling, if necessary.
