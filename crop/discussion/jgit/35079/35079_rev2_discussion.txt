DESCRIPTION

Add retainOnReset(RevFlag) to RevWalk to simplify reset usage

Applications sometimes use a RevFlag instead of a Set<RevObject>
to track boolean state bits about objects being processed. However
this requires careful use of the resetRetain() methods to avoid an
accidental clearing of the RevFlag bits, effectively clearing the
Set<RevObject> the application wanted to track.

Simplify that use case by offering retainOnReset, a collection of
flags that are never cleared by the RevWalk.

> Should we document that a flag cannot be removed from the retain set once added?

PTAL, I added this doc and fixed an omission in dispose().
