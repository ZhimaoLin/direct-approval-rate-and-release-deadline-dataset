Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Both of these changes look like no-ops.

The API docs for String.valueOf say 'if the argument is null, then returns a string equal to "null"'.

If id == null then that implies n != null because id != n. If we want to make this "if" condition clearer, how about

 if (id == null || n == null || !id.equals(n))

?

Patch Set 1:

String.valueOf is overloaded and javac picks one that does an NPE here. String.valueOf((Object)null) would call the intended method.
