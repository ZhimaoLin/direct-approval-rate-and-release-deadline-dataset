DESCRIPTION

WiP: LfsProtocolServlet: Add support for insufficient storage error

According to the feature request [1] and planned roadmap update [2] on
git-lfs, the specification will allow the server to return HTTP 507 if
there is insufficient storage for the uploaded object(s).

Add a new exception class, which implementations may throw from the
getRepository() method, causing HTTP 507 to be returned to the client.

> do you intend to implement this for FileLfsRepository ?

Possibly.  I haven't really though that far ahead yet.

For now I just want to at least make it so the status *can* be returned if necessary.

Note: This change shouldn't be merged until git-lfs decides when to add it to the list of supported status codes.  I have a PR pending [1] that only documents it.

File LFS Repository is natural candidate for that but I can imagine that quota might be reached for any provider.
