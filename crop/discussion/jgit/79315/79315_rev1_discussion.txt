DESCRIPTION

WiP: LfsProtocolServlet: Add support for insufficient storage error

According to the feature request [1] and planned roadmap update [2] on
git-lfs, the specification will allow the server to return HTTP 507 if
there is insufficient storage for the uploaded object(s).

Add a new exception class, which implementations may throw from the
getRepository() method, causing HTTP 507 to be returned to the client.
