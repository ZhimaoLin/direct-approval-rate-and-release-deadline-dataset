DESCRIPTION

LfsProtocolServlet: Add support for insufficient storage error

Since [1], the git-lfs specification allows the server to return
HTTP 507 if there is insufficient storage for the uploaded object(s).

Add a new exception class, which implementations may throw from the
getRepository() method, causing HTTP 507 to be returned to the client.
