DESCRIPTION

Don't flag a packfile invalid for file open issues

A packfile random file open operation may fail with a
FileNotFoundException even if the file exists, possibly
for the temporary lack of resources.

Instead of managing the FileNotFoundException as any generic
IOException it is best to throw the exception still but prevent
the packfile for being flagged as invalid until it is actually
opened and read successfully or unsuccessfully.
