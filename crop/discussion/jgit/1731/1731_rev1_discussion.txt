DESCRIPTION

Remove AmbiguousObjectException from BranchCreateCommand.call()

We wanted to wrap all LowLevel JGit excpetions into a
JGitInternalException so that users of this high-level interface
don't have to explicitly catch all of them. This
was forgotten on BranchCreateCommand.call() and I added
it.
