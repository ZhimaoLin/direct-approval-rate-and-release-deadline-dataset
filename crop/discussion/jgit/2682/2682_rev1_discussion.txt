DESCRIPTION

ObjectIdSubclassMap: Grow before insertions

If the table needs to be grown, do it before the current insertion
rather than after. This is a tiny micro-optimization that allows
the compiler to reuse the result of "++size" to compare against
previously pre-computed size at which the table should rehash itself.

Line:242, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectIdSubclassMap.java -> means: the array grows when it is filled to 50%, correct? Have you tried out to grow later and with more increase?

Line:242, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectIdSubclassMap.java -> forget this comment. I missed the discussion about load factors and optimizations on http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg00980.html
