Line:1930, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Please make this consistent with isValidRefName:

* / is allowed except at the end
* Two consecutive // are not allowed
* . is allowed, except as first or last character, or after a /
* Two consecutive .. are not allowed

Line:1930, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Besides, I don't think restricting this to 7-bit ASCII is good. Why would a Japanese programmer not name his branches in Japanese? Or a Spanish or French programmer use accented characters?

And how about stripping off all Unicode whitespace instead of just trim() above?

Something like

  // Replace whitespace by underscore
  // Replace characters that isValidRefName doesn't accept by dash
  // Collapse sequences of underscores, dots, and dashes
  // Remove underscores, dots, and dashes following slashes
  // Collapse sequences of slashes
  // Remove leading or training slashes, underscores, dots, and dashes
  return result.replaceAll("(?:\\h|\\v)+", "_")
    .replaceAll("[\\\\~^:?*\\[]+", "-")
    .replaceAll("_+", "_")
    .replaceAll("\\.+", ".")
    .replaceAll("-+", "-")
    .replaceAll("[_.-]{2,}", "_")
    .replaceAll("/[_.-]+", "/")
    .replaceAll("/+", "/")
    .replaceAll("^[/_.-]+|[/_.-]+$", "");

should do a minimal fix and leave things like accents, umlauts, or Japanese text alone.

Where in the git docu does it say branch names could be only 7bit ASCII?

Line:1930, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I took the initial code from the Mylyn normalizer which was even more restrictive than this version. Please note that isValidRefname(S) also does some local platform filename checking which might still fail after this normalizer has executed.

That being said, I agree with your comments. Please go ahead and update to your regex.
