DESCRIPTION

Improve Repository.normalizeBranchName()

The initial implementation was very restrictive. Rewrite to attempt a
minimal fix such that the result will pass isValidRefName.

* Replace all Unicode whitespace by underscore.
* Replace troublesome special characters by dash.
* Collapse sequences of underscores, dots, and dashes.
* Remove underscores, dots, and dashes following slashes, and
  collapse sequences of slashes.
* Strip leading and trailing sequences of slashes, dots, dashes,
  and underscores.
* Avoid the ".lock" extension.
* Avoid the Windows reserved device names.

This still allows branch names with single slashes as separators
between components, avoids some pitfalls that isValidRefName() tests
for, and leaves other character untouched and thus allows non-ASCII
branch names.

Also move the function from the bottom of the file up to where
isValidRefName is implemented.

yes, this test isn't 100% reliable and fails from time to time

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This doesn't make the motivation clear. I guess the idea is

 Make Repository.normalizeBranchName less strict

? Please also say a little about the context in the commit message body --- where did this come up in practice, or what new use becomes possible after this change?
