DESCRIPTION

Index config section and subsection names in one pass

Instead of indexing the subsection nmaes on each request for a given
section name, index both the section and subsection names in a single
scan through the entry list. This should improve lookup time for
reading the section names out of the configuration, especially for the
url.*.insteadof type of processing performed in RemoteConfig.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigSnapshot.java -> We put only the first so that when there are two different variations of the same string we report the first in the file. E.g. if a user has both "pushurl" and "pushUrl" in the file, we report the first case variant used, not the last.

Line:236, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigSnapshot.java -> See above about reporting the first variation rather than the last.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
