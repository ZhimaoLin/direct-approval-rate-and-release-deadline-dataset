DESCRIPTION

Index config section and subsection names in one pass

Instead of indexing the subsection names on each request for a given
section name, index both the section and subsection names in a single
scan through the entry list. This should improve lookup time for
reading the section names out of the configuration, especially for the
url.*.insteadof type of processing performed in RemoteConfig.
