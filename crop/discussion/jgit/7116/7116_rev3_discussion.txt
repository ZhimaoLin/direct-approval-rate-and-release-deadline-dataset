DESCRIPTION

Set core.precomposeunicode to true when creating repository on Mac

Java has no option but to use precomposed Unicode, so we should
state that when creating a new repository. Not that Java will use
precomposed unicode regardless of this setting, but this reduces
the risk of incompatibility with C Git.
