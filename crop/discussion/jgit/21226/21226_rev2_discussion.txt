DESCRIPTION

Non-Fast-Forward Ref-Updates: Omit isMergedInto() calls

When the caller specifies to JGit in advance that a ref-update is a
non-fast-forward update, and that those are permitted, we should never
need to call the potentially expensive isMergedInto() check. Re-checking
that the older commit is /not/ reachable from the newer is superfluous.

Patch Set 2:

I don't think this patch set could have caused the test failure in org.eclipse.jgit.util.FSJava7Test.testSymlinkAttributes reported by Hudson - the test passes locally and doesn't appear to do anything involving ref-updates.
