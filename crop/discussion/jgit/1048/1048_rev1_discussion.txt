DESCRIPTION

Added content based rename detection

I had added SHA1 based rename detection in a prior commit. This class
builds on that work by adding content based rename detection, along
the lines of what C Git does. This content based detection works by
hashing portions of each file (every 60 bytes or until a newline)
and populating a hash table of content hash -> number of occurences.
It then walks through the hash tables it created for the files to
determine commonality. Finally, it determines the files most likely
to be renames based on their commonality.
