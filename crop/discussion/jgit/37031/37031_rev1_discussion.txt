DESCRIPTION

Deprecate TemporaryBuffer.LocalFile without parent directory

Encourage callers to explicitly name a directory to hold any
overflow data. Call sites have more information about what is
going into the buffer and how it should be protected at the
filesystem level than just throwing content to the system wide
temporary directory.

Callers that still really don't care (or need to care) can pass
null for the File argument to have the system directory used.
