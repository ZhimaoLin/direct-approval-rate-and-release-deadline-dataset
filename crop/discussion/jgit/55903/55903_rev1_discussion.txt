DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Verify clients send only commits for shallow lines

If a client mistakenly tries to send a tag object as a shallow line
JGit blindly assumes this is a commit and tries to parse the tag
buffer using the commit parser. This can cause an obtuse error like:

  InvalidObjectIdException: Invalid id: t c0ff331234...

The "t" comes from the "object c0ff331234..." line of the tag tring
to be parsed as though it where the "tree" line of a commit.

Run any client supplied shallow lines through the RevWalk to lookup
the object types. Fail fast with a protocol exception if any of them
are non-commit.

Skip objects not known to this repository. This matches behavior
with git-core's upload-pack, which sliently skips over any shallow
line object named by the client but not known by the server.

Line:741, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Is the 'depth == 0 && !clientShallowCommits.isEmpty()' case possible?

Line:741, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ick, I think it is. Client can send a shallow but not a depth. Good catch.
