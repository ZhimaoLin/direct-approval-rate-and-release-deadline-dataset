DESCRIPTION

Fix serving fetch of existing shallow client

In certain cases a JGit server updating an existing shallow client
selected a common ancestor that was behind the shallow edge of
the client. This allowed the server to assume the client had some
objects it did not have and allowed creation of pack deltas the
client could never inflate.

Any commit the client has advertised as shallow must be treated
by UploadPack server as though it has no parents. With no parents
the walker cannot visit graph history the client does not have,
and PackWriter cannot consider delta base candidates the client
is lacking.

Line:1323, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I think handling fetches from a server that has its own shallow commits will take more work (see v1.9-rc0~3^2~17, "upload-pack: make sure deepening preserves shallow roots", 2013-12-05). Are the above two lines needed here?

Line:1353, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Is this safe when !clientShallowCommits.isEmpty()?

The PackWriter knows not to use bitmaps in the shallowPack case, but up only calls setShallowPack for depth requests.

Line:1323, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Right, I think we can drop these two lines.

Line:1353, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Argh, yes you are correct we cannot use bitmaps if the client is shallow. Its going to assume the client has things it does not have.

Line:688, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> IIRC when depth != 0 this is passed into the PackWriter which builds its own list of of what to send using a DepthWalk instead of the classical algorithm. I should double check my assumptions but I don't think we need to pass in the shallow commit list.
