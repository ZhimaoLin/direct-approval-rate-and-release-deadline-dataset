DESCRIPTION

Fix serving fetch of existing shallow client

In certain cases a JGit server updating an existing shallow client
selected a common ancestor that was behind the shallow edge of
the client. This allowed the server to assume the client had some
objects it did not have and allowed creation of pack deltas the
client could never inflate.

Any commit the client has advertised as shallow must be treated
by UploadPack server as though it has no parents. With no parents
the walker cannot visit graph history the client does not have,
and PackWriter cannot consider delta base candidates the client
is lacking.
