DESCRIPTION

RevWalk: Make fields available to subclasses

Subclasses of RevWalk that override toObjectWalkWithSameObjects()
need to be able to directly set the objects and freeFlags fields, so
make them protected.

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> This becomes new API, since anyone can create a subclass of RevWalk.

Could it be package-private instead?

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Any set of classes similar to DepthWalk.RevWalk and DepthWalk.ObjectWalk will need access to these fields, but I looked at RevWalk/ObjectWalk subclasses and DepthWalk seems to be a special case, so I'm fine with keeping it a special case and keeping these package private.

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Thanks. I'm happiest not making these public so we have more flexibility about what state to keep in the RevWalk later. If we wanted this to be public, I think the simplest interface would be a (protected) copy constructor which a subclass could use to copy all relevant fields.
