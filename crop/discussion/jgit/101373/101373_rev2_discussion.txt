DESCRIPTION

Derive DfsStreamKey from DfsPackDescription

By making this a deterministic function, DfsBlockCache can stop
retaining a map of every DfsPackDescription it is ever seen.  This
fixes a long standing memory leak in DfsBlockCache.  It also
simplifies the idea of setting up more lightweight objects around
streams.
