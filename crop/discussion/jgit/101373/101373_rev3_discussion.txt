DESCRIPTION

Derive DfsStreamKey from DfsPackDescription

By making this a deterministic function, DfsBlockCache can stop
retaining a map of every DfsPackDescription it is ever seen.  This
fixes a long standing memory leak in DfsBlockCache.

This refactoring also simplifies the idea of setting up more
lightweight objects around streams.
