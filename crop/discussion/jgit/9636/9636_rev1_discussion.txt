DESCRIPTION

Add getConflictingNames to RefDatabase

This has the same logic as isNameConflicting, but instead of only
returning a boolean, it returns a collection of names that conflict.

It will be used in EGit to provide a better message to the user when
validating a ref name, see Ibea9984121ae88c488858b8a8e73b593195b15e0.

Existing implementations of isNameConflicting could be rewritten like
this:

  return !getConflictingNames(name).isEmpty();

But I'm not sure about that, as isNameConflicting can be implemented in
a faster way than getConflictingNames.

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> perhaps: cannot coexist with existing ones

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> It is common to let the user sort the list, if that is needed, usually for performance reason which I doubt we have here.

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Done

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> So, should I change it? I would change it to a Set so that it's clear that it has no particular order, right?

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Do not change to Set. A List does not convey any promise of being sorted that a Set does.
