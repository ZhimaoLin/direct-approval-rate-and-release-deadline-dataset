DESCRIPTION

Add getConflictingNames to RefDatabase

This has the same logic as isNameConflicting, but instead of only
returning a boolean, it returns a collection of names that conflict.

It will be used in EGit to provide a better message to the user when
validating a ref name, see Ibea9984121ae88c488858b8a8e73b593195b15e0.

Existing implementations of isNameConflicting could be rewritten like
this:

  return !getConflictingNames(name).isEmpty();

But I'm not sure about that, as isNameConflicting can be implemented in
a faster way than getConflictingNames.

Turns out this has O(n^2) performance.

That last comment actually refers to the pre-existing code and not a problem introduced by this patch.

Patch Set 3:

Hm, do you think it could be improved by working on `new HashSet<String>(allRefs.keySet())` instead of the returned RefMap directly?
