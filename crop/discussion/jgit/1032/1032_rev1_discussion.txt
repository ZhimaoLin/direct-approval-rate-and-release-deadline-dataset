DESCRIPTION

Support large loose objects as streams

Big loose objects can now be streamed if they are over the large
object size threshold.  This prevents the JVM heap from exploding
with a very large byte array to hold the slurped file, and then
again with its uncompressed copy.

We may have slightly slowed down the simple case for small
loose objects, as the loader no longer slurps the entire thing
and decompresses in memory.  To try and keep good performance
for the very common small objects that are below 8 KiB in size,
buffers are set to 8 KiB, causing the reader to slurp most of the
file anyway.  However the data has to be copied at least once,
from the BufferedInputStream into the InflaterInputStream.

New unit tests are supplied to get nearly 100% code coverage on the
unpacked code paths, for both standard and pack style loose objects.
We tested a fair chunk of the code elsewhere, but these new tests
are better isolated to the specific branches in the code path.

Patch Set 1:

I suspect the issue is we don't check that the inflater consumed everything in the stream, which means we aren't checking the CRC that is embedded in the compressed data.  The test in question from EGit is chopping off only the last byte of the object file, which is part of the checksum but isn't necessary to inflate the content.

I'll work up a fix for JGit and a test case for this particular issue.  We should always be checking that CRC at the end of the stream.
