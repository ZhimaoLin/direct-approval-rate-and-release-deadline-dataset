DESCRIPTION

Avoid storing large packs in block cache during reuse

When a large pack (> 30% of the block cache) is being reused by
copying it pollutes the block cache with noise by storing blocks
that are never referenced again.

Avoid this by streaming the file directly from its channel onto
the output stream.
