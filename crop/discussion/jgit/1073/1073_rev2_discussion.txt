DESCRIPTION

amend commit: Support large delta packed objects as streams

Rename the ByteWindow's inflate() method to setInput.  We have
completely refactored the purpose of this method to be feeding part
(or all) of the window as input to the Inflater, and the actual
inflate activity happens in the caller.
