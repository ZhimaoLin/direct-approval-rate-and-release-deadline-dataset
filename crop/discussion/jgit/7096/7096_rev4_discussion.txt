DESCRIPTION

Ensure a directory exists before trying to create/merge a file into it.

Since git doesn't keep track of empty directories, they should be created
first. Test case included demonstrates that using StashApplyCommand().
Bugfix is applied to the DirCacheCheckout class, because StashApplyCommand()
uses internally to apply a stash.

Patch Set 4:

Douglas Trujillo, thanks for your feedback and instructions. I was not aware that JGit is licensed under EDL until you told me. You might consider updating license information here (about EPL), since that's where I got it from:

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions#Gerrit

That page is linked directly from here: http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Legal_Paperwork
