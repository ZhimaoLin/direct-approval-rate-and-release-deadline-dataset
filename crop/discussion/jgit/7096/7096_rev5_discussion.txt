DESCRIPTION

Ensure a directory exists before trying to create/merge a file into it.

Since git doesn't keep track of empty directories, they should be
created first. Test case included demonstrates that using
StashApplyCommand(). Bugfix is applied to the DirCacheCheckout class,
because StashApplyCommand() uses it internally to apply a stash.

- fixed typo in commit message
- section 4. in contributor guide [1] and also LICENSE file [2] and jgit about.html [3] in jgit sources mentions that jgit is licensed under EDL. [3] is a generic page for all Eclipse projects explaining how to contribute using Gerrit. AFAIK jgit is the only Eclipse project which is not licensed under EPL.
