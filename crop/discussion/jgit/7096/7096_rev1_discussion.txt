DESCRIPTION

Ensure a directory exists before trying to create/merge a file into it.

Since git doesn't keep track of empty directories, they should be created
first. Test case included demonstrates that using StashApplyCommand().
Bugfix is applied to the DirCacheCheckout class, because StashApplyCommand()
uses internally to apply a stash.
