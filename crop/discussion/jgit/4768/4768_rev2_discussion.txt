Patch Set 2:

Does Hudson use 1.5 or 1.6 for these build tests? The only difference between patch sets 1 and 2 was just xxx@xxx.xxx on an interface method implementation, which should be a compile error in 1.5. Yet Hudson says patch set 1 built fine.

Patch Set 2:

I think our Hudson is using Java 6 for the build, because of the console package which uses Java 6 APIs.
