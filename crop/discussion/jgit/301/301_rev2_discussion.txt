DESCRIPTION

Use "ERR message" for early ReceivePack problems

If the application wants to, it can use sendError(String) to send one
or more error messages to clients before the advertisements are sent.
These will cause a C Git client to break out of the advertisement
parsing loop, display "remote error: message\n", and terminate.

Servers can optionally use this to send a detailed error to a client
explaining why it cannot use the ReceivePack service on a repository.
Over smart HTTP these errors are sent in a 200 OK response, and
are in the payload, allowing the Git client to give the end-user
the custom message rather than the generic error "403 Forbidden".
