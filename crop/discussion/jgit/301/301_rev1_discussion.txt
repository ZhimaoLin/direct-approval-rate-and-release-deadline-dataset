DESCRIPTION

Use "ERR message" for early ReceivePack problems

If the application wants to, it can use sendError(String) to send one
or more error messages to clients before the advertisements are sent.
These will cause a C Git client to break out of the advertisement
parsing loop, display "remote error: message\n", and terminate.

Servers can optionally use this to send a detailed error to a client
explaining why it cannot use the ReceivePack service on a repository.
Over smart HTTP these errors are sent in a 200 OK response, and
are in the payload, allowing the Git client to give the end-user
the custom message rather than the generic error "403 Forbidden".

Line:640, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Should this be a Constant reference? It's used in a few places.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:640, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> I'm not going to bother making "ERR" a constant.  Its used twice, once here to tell the client we're broken, and once in the client to detect the server is broken and abort.  Its just not worth complicating the code with an additional constant.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:641, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Is this return; strictly necessary? We're at the end of a method, after all.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:641, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> You thought this return wasn't necessary.  It is necessary, we're breaking out of the method early, before a whole lot of other work occurs.  So yes, it has to be here.  And I didn't want to reindent the rest of the method body into an else block just to avoid doing a return here.  That's a bigger patch, and possibly complicates reading the code worse than an early return does.
