Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> Do you think this needs to return the actual Format in case it's different from fmt? If I hold on to the fmt I passed in, because of the way the classes are written, it will behave identically, so I think that's ok. But it would still be a reference to the class, in case that matters.

Gitiles plugin works. Please see my comment on the return value of register however.

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> It seems like we have undefined behavior in terms of which entry is used if multiple callers register the same format with different names; formatBySuffix just does a linear search till it finds a matching suffix.

In fact, other than a couple of hard-coded examples and constants, how is a caller supposed to know what name to register a given format with at all?

This comes up because I just noticed I'm actually, unintentionally, registering uppercase format names.

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> That's what the TODO below is about. I'd rather leave it for a separate change.

Adding a note to the javadoc now, though.

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> Not sure it matters, but can't hurt.

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> Ok to not fix this now.

Throwing an error on overlapping suffixes does nothing to help the caller choose an appropriate name.
