When I first looked at this I thought man this is overkill, but honestly I can't think of anything cleaner that is still lockless in the lookup case.

Line:255, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> If you use a do loop, like you do in unregisterFormat, you don't need this initialization outside the loop I don't think.

I'd like to include some tests before submitting, unless we're in a hurry (in which case I can postpone tests to another change on top).

I think I'm in a hurry, this is blocking the Gerrit Gitiles plugin, for which I've gotten two requests in the last 24 hours.

I will make sure to verify that this actually fixes the problem in Gitiles of course.
