DESCRIPTION

Detaching HEAD when checking out the same commit.

Detaching HEAD didn't work in some corner checkout cases.  If, for example,
HEAD is symbolic ref to refs/heads/master, refs/heads/master is ref to commit
c0ffee... then:

    checkout c0ffee...

would leave the HEAD unchanged.

The same symptom occurs when checking out a remote tracking branch or a tag
that references the same commit as refs/heads/master.

In the above case, the RefUpdate class didn't have enough information to decide
if the update needed to detach symbolic ref because it dealt only with new/old
objectIDs. Therefore, this fix introduced the RefUpdate.detachingSymbolicRef
flag.
