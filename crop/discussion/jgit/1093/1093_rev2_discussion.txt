DESCRIPTION

Added file path similarity to scoring metric in rename detection

The scoring method was not taking into account the similarity of
the file paths and file names. I changed the metric so that it is 90%
based on content (which used to be 100% of the old metric), and 10%
based on path similarity. Of that 10%, half (5% of the total final
score) is based on the actual file names (e.g. "foo.java"), and half
on the directory (e.g. "src/com/foo/bar/").

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I forgot to update the test cases in SimilarityIndexTest to take into account the new parameter on the score method. I'll upload another patch set shortly.
