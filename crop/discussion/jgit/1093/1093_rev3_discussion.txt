DESCRIPTION

Added file path similarity to scoring metric in rename detection

The scoring method was not taking into account the similarity of
the file paths and file names. I changed the metric so that it is 99%
based on content (which used to be 100% of the old metric), and 1%
based on path similarity. Of that 1%, half (.5% of the total final
score) is based on the actual file names (e.g. "foo.java"), and half
on the directory (e.g. "src/com/foo/bar/").
