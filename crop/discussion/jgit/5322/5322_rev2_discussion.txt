DESCRIPTION

Make CheckoutCommand behave when checking out same Revision

If the underlying revision of the two input commits is the same, we can
simply tear head to the new Ref, and let it be.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Basically this seems reasonable, but don't reformat a lot
of unrelated code. If you feel that is important, make it
a separate change.

Also, it seems the subject lacks a word.

"simply tear head" means ???

Patch Set 2:

i will push a new patchset with a better commit message in a second, thanks for reviewing!

i don't know why eclipse thought i "edited" those lines, because it was the project specific code formatter that did the changes. i manually reverted them now.
