DESCRIPTION

push: Do not use push options unless requested

Unless the user passed --push-option, the client does not intend to
pass push options to the server.

Without this change, all pushes to servers without push option support
fail.

Not enabling the feature (instead of enabling it and sending an empty
list of options) in this case is more intuitive and matches the
behavior of C git push's --push-option parameter better.
