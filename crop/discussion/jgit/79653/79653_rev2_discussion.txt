DESCRIPTION

push: do not use push options by default

When the push options are null in the transport code, the client doesn't
intend to use the push options. When the push options are an empty list,
the client explicitly asks for push options to be used.

So align the code in the user facing push command to follow this intent.
This is also aligning the behavior with git core.

Postpone solving the problem of a user wanting to transmit an empty push
options list as there is no immediate use case for it.

I think this is the right fix, just with a flaky test.
