Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why?

I had good reason for hiding this. It only works on the FileRepository backend and shouldn't be relied upon as-is because we need to correctly abstract it for other storage backends.

Why was this also self-approved?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> There was no negative comments for almost two weeks. It's not to late to change the abstraction. 

The API itself is not dependent on the FileRepostory, but only the FileRepository has an actual implementation, but that could be fixed without changing the API.
