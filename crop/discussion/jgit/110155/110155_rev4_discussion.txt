Patch Set 4:

> The submodule deinit functionality in git.git includes removing the
 > submodule from the root repositories .git/config file. Even JGits
 > SubmoduleInitCommand takes care to add the submodule there. This
 > SubmoduleDeinitCommand should take care to clean the root repo
 > config.

I looked, and discovered that SubmoduleInitCommand does it wrong, so I fixed that while I was in there.  (JGit isn't the first time I've seen this: I fixed a related issue in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/10798 )
