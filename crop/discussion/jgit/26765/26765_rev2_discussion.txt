DESCRIPTION

Cherry-Pick: Support --mainline to pick merges

By specifying a mainline parent, a merge is cherry picked as if this
parent was its only parent. If no mainline parent is given, cherry
picking merges is not allowed, as before.

Line:372, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> Try to be more specific. It is way too common to catch the wrong exception. GitAPIException could be anything.

Line:379, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> Again... an NPE is not expected here, but that is what Exception would catch, among other things.

Line:393, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> It'd be nice to test cherry-picking either parent. Not just one

Line:296, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> This allows cherrry-picking of merges

Line:379, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> Do you think an new subclass of GitAPIException would make sense here, or should I just catch JGitInternalException (and maybe check the exception message)?

Line:393, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> I'm not sure I understand. The test covers both C and D as mainline of M.

Line:379, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> The latter is ok, I think. This is not an exception anyone should take any action other than reporting.

Line:393, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommandTest.java -> I skimmed this too quickly. I'm sorry. You're right.
