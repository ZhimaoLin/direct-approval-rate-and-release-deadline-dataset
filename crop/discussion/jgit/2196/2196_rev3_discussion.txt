DESCRIPTION

Convert all JGit unit tests to JUnit 4

Eclipse has some problem re-running single JUnit tests if
the tests are in Junit 3 format, but the JUnit 4 launcher
is used. This was quite unnecessary and the move was not
completed. We still have no JUnit4 test.

This completes the extermination of JUnit3. Most of the
work was global searce/replace using regular expression,
followed by numerous invocarions of quick-fix and organize
imports and verification that we had the same number of
tests before and after.

- Annotations were introduced.
- All references to JUnit3 classes removed
- Half-good replacement for getting the test name. This was
  needed to make the TestRngs work. The initialization of
  TestRngs was also made lazily since we can not longer find
  out the test name in runtime in xxx@xxx.xxx methods.
- Renamed test classes to end with Test, with the exception
  of TestTranslateBundle, which fails from Maven
- Moved JGitTestUtil to the junit support bundle
