DESCRIPTION

Always add FileExt to DfsPackDescription

Instead of forcing the implementation of the DFS backend to handle
making sure the extension bits are set correctly, have the common
callers in JGit set the extension at the same time they supply the
file sizes to the pack description. This simplifies assumptions for
an implementation of the DFS backend.
