DESCRIPTION

Optimize ref scanning

We can avoid one stat call by trying to perform a directory
listing without checking if the reference File is a directory.
Attempting a directory listing is defined to return. The other
case for null returns from list is when an I/O error occcurs.

Both cases are now intepreted as a possible plain reference. I/O
errors when reading plain references will be handled (ignored)
in scanRef().
