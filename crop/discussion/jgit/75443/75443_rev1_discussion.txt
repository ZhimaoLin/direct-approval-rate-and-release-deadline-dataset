DESCRIPTION

Fix DirCacheCheckout to return CheckoutConflictException

Problem occurs when the the checkout wants to create a file 'd/f' but
the workingtree contains a dirty file 'd'. In order to create d/f the
file 'd' would have to be deleted and since the file is dirty that
content would be lost. This should lead to a CheckoutConflictException
for d/f when failOnConflict was set to true.

Line:1256, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I think this is the wrong place. This check should happen earlier, probably in the prescan methods. Throwing an exception here may lead to a partial checked out work dir. In addition, the CheckoutCOnflictException is supposed to list all conflicts, which isn't the case here either.

Line:1618, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> The name is misleading. How about testFolderFileConflict or testFailWithFolderFileConflict?

Besides, there is no test case for failOnConflict == false.

I have uploaded a patch with two test cases to demonstrate how the CheckoutConflictException should list all conflicting files:

could you upload again? The test cases seem to be missing

Line:1256, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> you are right. We will not completely get rid of the risk of hallways workingtrees. But implementing this in preScanTwoTrees would lower the risk and be much more in-line with the other detection of dirty workingtrees. I'll upload a pathset

Line:1618, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> agree, I name it like you suggested.

I concentrated in this change on the main use case failOnConflict==true. failOnConflict==false handling will follow.
