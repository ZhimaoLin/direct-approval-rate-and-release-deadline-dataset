DESCRIPTION

Fix DirCacheCheckout to return CheckoutConflictException

Problem occurs when the the checkout wants to create a file 'd/f' but
the workingtree contains a dirty file 'd'. In order to create d/f the
file 'd' would have to be deleted and since the file is dirty that
content would be lost. This should lead to a CheckoutConflictException
for d/f when failOnConflict was set to true.
