DESCRIPTION

Fix DirCacheCheckout to return CheckoutConflictException

Problem occurs when the checkout wants to create a file 'd/f' but
the workingtree contains a dirty file 'd'. In order to create d/f the
file 'd' would have to be deleted and since the file is dirty that
content would be lost. This should lead to a CheckoutConflictException
for d/f when failOnConflict was set to true.

This fix also changes jgit checkout semantics to be more like native
gits checkout semantics. If during a checkout jgit wants to delete a
folder but finds that the working tree contains a dirty file at this
path then JGit will now throw an exception instead of silently keeping
the dirty file. Like in this example:

	git init
	touch b
	git add b
	git commit -m addB
	mkdir a
	touch a/c
	git add a/c
	git commit -m addAC
	rm -fr a
	touch a
	git checkout HEAD~
