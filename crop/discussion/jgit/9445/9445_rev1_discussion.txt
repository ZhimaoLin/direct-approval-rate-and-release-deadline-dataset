DESCRIPTION

Do not install unnecessary Orbit bundles

The org.eclipse.jgit.orbit.feature introduced recently in order to
install 3rd party Orbit dependencies is a too coarse grained approach
and has the effect to install some dependencies only needed for
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm when installing org.eclipse.jgit.feature.

Hence include the required 3rd party bundles into the respective jgit
features directly in order to avoid this problem.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good but I would remove the empty line that is now in the feature.xml files.
