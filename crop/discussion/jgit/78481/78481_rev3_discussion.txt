DESCRIPTION

Shallow fetch/clone: Make --depth mean the total history depth

cgit changed the --depth parameter to mean the total depth of history
rather than the depth of ancestors to be returned [1]. JGit still uses
the latter meaning, so update it to match cgit.

depth=0 still means a non-shallow clone. depth=1 now means only the
wants rather than the wants and their direct parents.

This is accomplished by changing the semantic meaning of "depth" in
UploadPack and PackWriter to mean the total depth of history desired,
while keeping "depth" in DepthWalk.{RevWalk,ObjectWalk} to mean
the depth of traversal. Thus UploadPack and PackWriter always
initialize their DepthWalks with "depth-1".
