DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Introduce pluggable content merge strategy

In order to support specific file formats, we need to have a way to plug
in alternative content mergers. This is useful when there is a better
way to merge the file contents than just line based.

Looks already quite good to me. Please rebase and adapt to my refactoring in change 4366

Line:593, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Having one method 'mergeContent()' and another one 'contentMerge()' in this class is not nice. It's hard to find out which method is doing what. Therefore I refactored ResolveMerger so that there is only one method where we do content merge (see change #4366). I would suggest you rebase this change on top of 4366 and adapt it to the new structure. That will look much cleaner.

Line:342, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> I think that casual users of our GitAPI will be a confused. Many people will have problems understanding the difference between MergeStrategies (Resolve, Recursive, Ours, Theirs, ...) and content-mergers. Even I would on the first look expect that "mergeWith()" expects a strategy. Also because native git only allows me to specify the merge strategy together with the "git merge" command.

I suggest to name this "contentMergeWith" or "setMergeTool()" (to be consistent with how you set a content merger in native git).

Of course the same argument goes for all commands you touched.

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ContentMerger.java -> Wouldn't it better to have a named class (instead of a anonymous one) for the Default content merger? The we could reuse the instances of  DefaultContentMerger. We would only need one DefaultContentMerger per repository.
