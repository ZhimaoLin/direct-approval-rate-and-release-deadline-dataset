DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Introduce pluggable content merge strategy

** DO NOT SUBMIT **

In order to support specific file formats, we need to have a way to plug
in alternative content mergers. This is useful when there is a better
way to merge the file contents than just line based.

First the first pass, only CherryPickCommand exposes the means to use
an alternative content merger. Support for other cases should be added
as part of this change once we agree on the API of ContentMerger.
