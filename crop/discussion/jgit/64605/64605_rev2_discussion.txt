DESCRIPTION

Transport: Implement AutoCloseable

After creating a Transport instance callers should always call
its close() method. Use AutoCloseable to document this idiom
and allow use of try-with-resources.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> IIUC, technically this is a breaking API change, since even though close() is already declared by this class, AutoClosable.close() declares that it throws Exception, which changes the post condition of the function. :-(

That said, none of the current implementations throw exceptions, so the call sites will only be surprised when the first subclasser decides to throw one.

Maybe add JavaDoc that specifies that implementers shouldn't throw exceptions?

Line:1357, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Drop this declaration and move the JavaDoc close to the "implements AutoClosable"

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Connection.java -> Same comments I made about AutoCloseable for the Transport class apply here.

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Connection.java -> This is now redundant.

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HttpClientTests.java -> Done

Line:343, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HttpClientTests.java -> Done

Line:1357, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Can't for a lot of reasons.

By redeclaring close() here we have told implementors they cannot throw any checked exceptions. That allows us to promise to callers that although AutoCloseable says it can throw Exception, we will never throw Exception, so they don't have to catch Exception from us.

So we have to keep our close() override to narrow the exception set to only RuntimeException and Error.

We also have to keep our close() to keep API compatibility. Existing Java bytecode is complied to call our close method. I don't think we can delete it and still be binary API compatible. So the method has to stick around until at least JGit 5.0.

But even then we don't want to delete close() because of the mentioned throws issue above. We don't want to throw Exception. We want to throw nothing here.

Line:1357, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Got it. I hadn't seen this form of narrowing before. It should stay as is.

Please add:
<p>
AutoClosable.close() declares that it throws xxx@xxx.xxx Exception}. Implementers shouldn't actually throw checked exceptions, so this override narrows the signature to prevent them from doing so.
