and allow use of try-with-resources.

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HttpClientTests.java -> Could these be combined into a single try-with-resource block?

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> Move this to the outer try-block and reduce a level of indentation?
