DESCRIPTION

Remove DFS locality ordering during packing

PackWriter generally chooses the order for objects when it builds the
object lists.  This ordering already depends on history information to
guide placing more recent objects first and historical objects last.

Allow PackWriter to make the basic ordering decisions, instead of
trying to override them.  The old approach of sorting the list caused
DfsReader to override any ordering change PackWriter might have tried
to make when repacking a repository.

This now better matches with WindowCursor's implementation, where
PackWriter solely determines the object ordering.
