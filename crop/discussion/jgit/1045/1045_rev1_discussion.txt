DESCRIPTION

Remove pointless size test in PackFile decompress

Now that any large objects are forced through a streaming loader
when its bigger than getStreamFileThreshold(), and that threshold
is pegged at Integer.MAX_VALUE as its largest size, we will never
be able to reach this code path where we threw OutOfMemoryError.

Robin pointed out that we probably should include a message here,
but the code is effectively unreachable, so there isn't any value
in adding a message at this point.

So remove it.
