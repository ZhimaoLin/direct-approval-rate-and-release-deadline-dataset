Please see my inline comments.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please use the term start-point here.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please do not refer to a specific client here. JGit is used in many environments and it is not clear what "the Create branch dialog" means.

Maybe write something like "...can be used by tools to determine a default start-point..."

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> start-point
