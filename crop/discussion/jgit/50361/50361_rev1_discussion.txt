DESCRIPTION

Fix encoding problem from curl repostory on github

Pushing curl repository to gerrit fails with a message:
remote: error: internal error while processing changes
java.nio.charset.IllegalCharsetNameException: 'utf8'

curl repository url: https://github.com/bagder/curl.git

To avoid this problem encodingAliases in RawParseUtils have
been extended to contain "'utf8'" (single quoted utf8) string.
