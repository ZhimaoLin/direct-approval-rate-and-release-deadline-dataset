DESCRIPTION

Added API to TextBuiltin for piped usage.

Added a public method to TextBuiltin which makes it possible for
clients to initialize all of its state, including output and error
streams.  This gives clients the ability to customize the way in
which a command is run.

I added the ability to set input as requested, and added a usage example as TextBuiltinTest.  It's the same concept as org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.CLIGitCommand, just using a public API so that clients can control it.
