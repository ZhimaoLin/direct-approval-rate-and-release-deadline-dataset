Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Sounds good; are we not building the CLI at the moment?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

For now no, my goal is to get a simple build running on Athena:

https://build.eclipse.org/hudson/view/Athena%20CBI/job/cbi-jgit/

Once that's in place and people are happy with it in terms of ease of use... producing maven artifacts etc... we can work on building pgm and other things ;)

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Dropping the releng project in favor of the current Maven/Tycho based build.
