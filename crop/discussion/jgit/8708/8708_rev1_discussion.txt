DESCRIPTION

Make an exception for the formatting rules (turn off) for some files

Our rule to enforce javodocs for public members gives us a problem
because there are some patterns where javadoc make little sense so we
make the comments as small as possible, which our formatting rules do
not like, so disable it for those source files.
