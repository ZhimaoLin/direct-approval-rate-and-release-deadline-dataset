DESCRIPTION

Add builtin LFS smudge filter for local case

Adds a JGit builtin implementation of the "git lfs smudge" filter. This
filter should do the same as the one described in [1] besides that it
only supports the local case when the lfs objects are already present in
the media directory. Remote cases where download of LFS objects from LFS
servers is needed will be done in a later commit.

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsPointer.java -> It's a flag telling that we found the "version ..." line. I renamed the variable to clarify this. Done

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsPointer.java -> Done

Line:227, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> Found out that we indeed read the data two times (at least). Changed the comment to clarify that. But the solution has to go into a different commit.

Line:399, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Done

Line:466, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I removed the todo. I don't think we write twice. Since this is the cleanFilter then at least for the lfs use case we will always have cleant content which is so small that it will be kept in memory.
