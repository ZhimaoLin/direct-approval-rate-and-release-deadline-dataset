DESCRIPTION

Add Publisher implementation

Adds the server-side Publisher implementation and protocol. The
Publisher hooks the post-receive update and generates packs to cover
all connected Sessions. Clients establish Sessions that store their
subscriptions and stream pointers for PublisherPushes. PublisherPacks
are generated on the fly by PublisherPushes and the
PublisherPackFactory. Each Pack is split into PublisherPackSlices.
All Packs are placed in a global linked-list for which each client
creates an iterator. The memory footprint of Packs is managed by the
PublisherMemoryPool, which loads the Slices in and out of memory as
necessary to reclaim memory.
