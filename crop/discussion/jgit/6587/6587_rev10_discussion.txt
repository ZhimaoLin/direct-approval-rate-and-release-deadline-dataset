DESCRIPTION

Add Publisher implementation

Adds the server-side Publisher implementation and protocol. The
Publisher hooks the post-receive update and generates packs to cover
all connected Sessions. Clients estabilsh Sessions that store their
subscriptions and stream pointers for PublisherPacks. PublisherPacks
are split into PublisherPackSlices, which are created by the
PublisherPackFactory. All Packs are placed in a global linked-list
that each client creates an iterator for. The memory footprint of
Packs is managed by the PublisherBuffer, which garbage-collects the
list of Packs and loads the Slices in and out of memory as necessary
to reclaim memory.
