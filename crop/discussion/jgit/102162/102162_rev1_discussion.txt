DESCRIPTION

RefDirectory: Add in-process fair lock for atomic updates

In a server scenario such as Gerrit Code Review, there may be many
atomic BatchRefUpdates contending for logs on both the packed-refs file
and some subset of loose refs. We already retry lock acquisition to
improve this situation slightly, but we can do better by using an
in-process lock. This way, instead of retrying and potentially exceeding
their timeout, different threads sharing the same Repository instance
can wait on a fair lock without having to touch the disk lock. As a
server is probably already using RepositoryCache anyway, there is a high
likelihood of reusing the Repository instance.
