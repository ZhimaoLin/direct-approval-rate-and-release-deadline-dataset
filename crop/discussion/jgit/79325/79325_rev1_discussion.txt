LGTM but it needs to be rebased on the current head of the master branch.

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Add.java -> Is this the kind of string we want //$NON-NLS-1$ to prevent?  If not, why do we use //$NON-NLS-1$?  (I don't know the policy, I am just trying to learn)

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Add.java -> This comment is regarding whether we are doing the right thing in AddCommand.java:

Is this really what native git does? If you are not in the root of the working tree and you say "git add ." then this will add only files in that folder (or subfolders). But "git add --all" would also add files above your current directory.

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Add.java -> No, I think this is wrong.  There should be a corresponding "public String usage_addNothingSpecified" added in CLIText.java, and then this line should be:

 CLIText.get().usage_addNothingSpecified

(although also note the comment in the .properties file)

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> In the rest of the code the properties prefixed with "_usage" seem to only be used for strings that are passed as the 'usage' argument xxx@xxx.xxx

I think the ones added here should probably just be named "addAll" and "nothingSpecified" or something like that.

Sorry for the unhelpful message.  This change was abandoned automatically by a script, and due to operator error the correct message was not added.

It should have read:  "Abandoning after 3 months of inactivity.  If this change is still needed, please restore it."
