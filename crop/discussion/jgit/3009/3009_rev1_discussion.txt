DESCRIPTION

Add parameters for timeout and branches to clone

The timeout is also used in the FetchCommand called by the
CloneCommand. 

The possibility to provide a list of branches to fetch initially is a
feature offered by EGit. To implement it here is a prerequisite for
EGit to be able to use the CloneCommand.
