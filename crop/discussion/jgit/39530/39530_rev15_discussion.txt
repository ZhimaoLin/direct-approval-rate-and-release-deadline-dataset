DESCRIPTION

Port push certificates

Push certificates ("git push --signed") have been part of
git-core since version 2.2.0 (released Nov 26 2014). We also
want to support that feature.

This is not complete and is lacking the actual functionality
to validate the signature for now.

One last issue to fix.

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> The Mac object is not thread safe and can only be used once.

It would be cleaner to retain the SecretKeySpec and build the Mac object on each method call.

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> We only use it to mac.doFinal
which is specified with 

    A call to this method resets this Mac object to the state it was in when previously initialized via a call to init(Key) or init(Key, AlgorithmParameterSpec).
