DESCRIPTION

WIP: Port push certificates

push certs have been part of git-core for a few months now. Let's try
to support that feature.

This is not complete and is lacking the actual function to validate
the signature for now

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> Fields probably should be either private or default package access. That way a subclass won't see them and try to extend this type and muck with our internal state.

It also means we can change the internal state more freely across versions of JGit. If you mark the fields protected we must keep those fields exactly unchanged for several years. That is difficult to do for compatibility reasons.

Line:320, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> I thought we had a 2 arg form of getString() so this wasn't necessary.

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Avoid protected for fields on public types

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> nit: avoid final in newer code

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> You don't have to store this if its passed into the verify() method.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> I think ISO-8859-1 might be a better encoding for the seed/key.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> allowedSlop

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> No need to use = 0 here. Leave the variables unassigned so the compiler can help us prove they are set in the try block, or we abort without using a garbage value.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> Why would we want to permit allowedSlop == 0?

If allowedSlop == 0 then the nonce must match exactly. Which precludes HTTP transactions. Maybe that is what the admin wants?

If the admin doesn't care about the slop, we should just use a reasonable default figure of e.g. 5 minutes of slop.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> allowedSlop

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> allowedSlop

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/NonceGenerator.java -> Did you mean

 xxx@xxx.xxx timestamp
            The current time in milliseconds.

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/NonceGenerator.java -> nit: don't use final in an interface method.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/NonceGenerator.java -> nit: no final

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> This was done, so the PushCertificateParser which derives from PushCertificate can write these fields.

TIL about default package access.

Line:320, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> We have a 2 arg form for any other kind such as getInt can take 2 arguments describing just section and name. subsection and default value are optional. I think it's hard to for getString to have those 2 optional, as subsection and default value have the same type, so we cannot have both being optional in a 3 arg form. 

I found however, the "" can be replaced by null.
