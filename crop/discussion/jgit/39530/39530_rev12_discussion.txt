DESCRIPTION

WIP: Port push certificates

push certs have been part of git-core for a few months now. Let's try
to support that feature.

This is not complete and is lacking the actual function to validate
the signature for now

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Instead of passing the seed and slop to the methods, maybe we should pass the ReceiveConfig to the NonceGenerator's constructor. Then it can store the relevant data (seed, slop) as its own fields and the API becomes less specific about how the seed used during the calls.

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> readString() would trim the LF for you.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> readString() for the version so you can ignore the LF?

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Use parseNextLine(), as this is basically the same as the pusher, pushee and nonce.

Line:158, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> this 3rd arg can be computed from the 2nd. no need to pass it.

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Write this part custom since you want to do readStringRaw() here to check for LF and everyone else wants to skip the LF.

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> This should be optional, and better if we can somehow combine it into the new pack being handled by the PackParser inside of ReceivePack.

I would punt on writing the object in this commit and do that in another commit.

Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> You have the commandList in a buffer. Don't pass it as a method.

I would also punt on the verify. Lets leave it for now to something the caller can do in a PreReceiveHook.

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> You should return the ObjectId if you are going to write it out.

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> DFS is part of JGit so maybe we say:

  String path;
  if (repo instanceof DfsRepository)
    path = ((DfsRepository) repo).getRepositoryName();
  else if (repo.getDirectory() != null)
    path = repo.getDirectory().getPath();
  else
    throw new IllegalStateException();

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> Looks like you need to pass in the ReceivePack instance?

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> Long.parseLong

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Lets drop the WIP part.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> They were released weren't they? Lets name what version they first shipped in.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: missing . at end of sentence.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> Would it make sense to write it the other way round? We only pass in a boolean flag `statelessServer` or maybe even a more descriptive name `boolean allowSlop` (which is similar to `allowedSlop`, so rename that to just `slop`)
