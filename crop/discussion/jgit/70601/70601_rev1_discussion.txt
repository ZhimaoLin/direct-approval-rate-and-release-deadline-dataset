DESCRIPTION

Make streamFileThreshold configurable

Previously, the streamFileThreshold, the threshold at which
a file would be streamed rather than loaded entirely into memory,
was configurable, but only on a global basis.

This commit makes this threshold configurable on a per-loader
basis.

Rebekah Huber took over https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69292/ from me, so this is identical to that patch. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69292/ was abandoned in favor of this.
