DESCRIPTION

Check that DfsBlockCache#blockSize is a power of 2

In case a value is used which isnâ€™t a power of 2 there will be a high
chance of java.lang.ArrayIndexOutBoundsException and
org.eclipse.jgit.errors.CorruptObjectException due to a mismatching
assumption for the DfsBlockCache#blockSizeShift parameter.

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsBlockCache.java -> * fail earlier by moving this check to DfsBlockCacheConfig.setBlockSize() ?
* I think we should also prevent blockSize == 0
