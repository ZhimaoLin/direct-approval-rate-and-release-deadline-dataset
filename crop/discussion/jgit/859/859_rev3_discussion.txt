DESCRIPTION

Refactor object writing responsiblities to ObjectDatabase

The ObjectInserter API permits ObjectDatabase implementations to
control their own object insertion behavior, rather than forcing
it to always be a new loose file created in the local filesystem.
Inserted objects can also be queued and written asynchronously to
the main application, such as by appending into a pack file that
is later closed and added to the repository.

This change also starts to open the door to non-file based object
storage, such as an in-memory HashMap for unit testing, or a more
complex system built on top of a distributed hash table.

To help existing application code port to the newer interface we
are keeping ObjectWriter as a delegation wrapper to the new API.
Each ObjectWriter instances holds a reference to an ObjectInserter
for the Repository's top-level ObjectDatabase, and it flushes and
releases that instance on each object processed.
