DESCRIPTION

Allow ../relative paths in remotes

git allows remotes to be relative paths, but the regex
validating urls wouldn't accept anything starting with "..".
Other functionality works fine with these paths.

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> gopher?  Seriously?  Why not http?  :-)

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Style-nit: We put the + at the start of the line, not at the end.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Do we want to promote this pattern?  This seems to allow "http://example.com/../foo" which is nonsense as a URL.

I wonder if we don't just need a different URL pattern altogether for this, similar to the SCP_URI special case we have.  Maybe a new pattern that we test before SCP_URI and FULL_URI that looks like:

  PATH_URI = "(?:[A-Za-z]:"  // optional drive-letter
    + "|\.|\.\.)?" // or optional relative path indicator
    + "(/.+)$"

That's just off the top of my head while distracted by other things going on in the room around me, so don't hold me to this being the correct pattern or anything, but I think its possible to recognize a local file path that isn't like a URL before trying the FULL_URI variant and without allowing "http://example.com/../foo".

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> I was reading http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt and it's the first non-deprecated example in section 1.3. ;)

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Done

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> It accepts these hilarities with or without my original patch applied, so it's no worse than it is before.  I'm not volunteering for making it more restrictive.

public void testRelativeURL() {
  new URIish("http://../example.com/bar.git");
  new URIish("http://example..com/bar.git");
  new URIish("http://example.com/../bar.git");
  new URIish("http://example.com/foo/../bar.git");
}
