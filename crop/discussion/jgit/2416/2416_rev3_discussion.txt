DESCRIPTION

Fix JGit --upload-pack, --receive-pack options

JGit did not use sh -c to run the receive-pack or upload-pack programs
locally, which caused errors if these strings contained spaces and
needed the local shell to evaluate them.

Win32 support using cmd.exe /c is completely untested, but seems like
it should work based on the limited information I could get through
Google search results.
