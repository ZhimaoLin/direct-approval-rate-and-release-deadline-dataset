DESCRIPTION

Ignores attempts to set the timeout to -1 to resolve bug 389003

The value of -1 is the default value used by the underlying http transports provided by the jre. On some
versions an attempt to set the timeout explicitly to -1 triggeres a check condition, disallowing negative
numbers.

Patch Set 2:

I am confirming points 1 through 4 regarding:

With every contribution, you will have to explicitly assert on the corresponding bug or as a comment on the Gerrit push record: 

1. that you are the author 100% of the content you are contributing. 
2. that you own the copyright of the contributed content (this is typically your employer.) 
3. that you have the right to contribute the content to Eclipse. (You need to confirm this with the copyright owner.) 
In addition ensure 

4. that the contributed code is licensed under the project license (EPL for EGit and EDL for JGit). This is done by putting a copyright and license header into every new java file. See other existing project source files for the correct content.

Patch Set 2:

Matthias: The part about Signed-off-by seems obsolete, since that is not the wording required by the Eclipse Foundation, though the implication is the same.

Robin: I updated [1]  regarding handling of the Signed-off-by footer, it is not required but can be used to track all users who touched a change.
