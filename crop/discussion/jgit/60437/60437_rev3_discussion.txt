DESCRIPTION

Added jgit own NonNull annotation type

The annotation is required for example in Repository case (patch
follows), where almost all non-void return methods return Nullable
except few returning NonNull. I definitely do not favor this style, but
it is a nightmare to clients to guess if the null check is needed or
not.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/annotations/NonNull.java -> No, I meant exact this :-) This is the name from widely used but dead JSR-305 annotations :-(

But it *also* works as a replacement for org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull which were designed few years later :-)
