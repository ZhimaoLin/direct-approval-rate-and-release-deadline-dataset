DESCRIPTION

Added jgit own NonNull annotation type

The annotation is required for example in Repository case (patch
follows), where almost all non-void return methods return Nullable
except few returning NonNull. I definitely do not favor this style, but
it is a nightmare to clients to guess if the null check is needed or
not.
