DESCRIPTION

Added jgit own NonNull annotation type

The annotation is required for example in Repository case (patch
follows), where almost all non-void return methods return Nullable
except few returning NonNull. I definitely do not favor this style, but
it is a nightmare to clients to guess if the null check is needed or
not.

Thanks for taking this on.

I wish we could assume everything not @Nullable is non-null, but (1) we're not there yet, (2) this is useful for getting there, and (3) if we get there, that's fine and we can decide whether to drop xxx@xxx.xxx annotations at that point.

So lgtm.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

I think this is good for the transitional period, thanks.

It would be good if we could become less verbose when we get full  annotation coverage of our APIs. From looking at the documentation it looks like xxx@xxx.xxx in a package's package-info.java tells the Eclipse that there is full coverage for the package. A goal we can aspire to. :)
