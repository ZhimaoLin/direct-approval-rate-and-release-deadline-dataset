DESCRIPTION

Add the new class Attributes holding multiple Attribute(s)

Attributes represents a semantic collector of Attribute(s) and replaces
the anonymous Map<String,Attribute>. This class will be returned by
TreeWalk.getAttributes(). It offers convenient access to the attributes
wrapped in the Attributes object. Adds preparations for a future
Attribute Macro Expansion

Only minor things left, otherwise looks good

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/AbstractTreeIterator.java -> Shouldn't the changes in this file belong to the followup request where macro-expansion is handled?

Line:12, org.eclipse.jgit/.settings/.api_filters -> MacroExpander? That class is not known yet. This complete <filter> block should be removed
