DESCRIPTION

Add the new class Attributes  holding multiple Attribute(s)

Attributes represents a semantic collector of Attribute(s) and
replaces the anonymous Map<String,Attribute>. This new class is used in
the getAttributes method of the TreeWalk as return type and offers
convenience access to the attributes wrapped in the Attributes object.
Adds preparations for a
future Attribute Macro Expansion
