Patch Set 1:

This change deletes RepositoryBuilder, because I needed FileRepositoryBuilder to specifically accept a FileRepositoryBuilder in it's constructor for https://git.eclipse.org/r/27325 and this was the minimal code change to achieve that. An alternative would be to give FileRepositoryBuilder 2 constructors (one that accepts FileRepositoryBuilder and another that accepts just BaseRepositoryBuilder) - but this approach seemed cleaner in the long run.
