The change to make BaseRepositoryRepository abstract, whilst sensible, is API breaking and we can't do that without a suitable bump in version number.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/Git.java -> Suggest breaking line after the setFS(fs) and put a single line comment // at the end to prevent reflowing

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> This is potentially an API breaking change for clients that may be instantiating it directly. I don't think it's safe to just change this here without a suitable bounce in API.

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryBuilder.java -> This build method is not necessary if BaseRepositoryBuilder is not changed. If this is removed in 4.0 the BaseRepositoryBuilder can be marked as abstract as well.

Line:225, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportLocal.java -> Maybe line break before setGitDir()?

Line:365, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportLocal.java -> Maybe line break before setGitDir()?

Line:273, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/TextHashFunctions.java -> The trailing single-line comment prevents an IDE from flowing the following lines up in a reformat, so should be left in.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would personally have a commit message that is more declarative, rather than opinionated. The "It's only" and "..." can probably be removed to improve the message.
