DESCRIPTION

Shallow fetch: Pass a DepthWalk to PackWriter

d385a7a5e5ca (Shallow fetch: Respect "shallow" lines, 2016-08-03) forgot
that UploadPack wasn't passing a DepthWalk to PackWriter in the first
place.  As a result, shallow clones fail:

 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Shallow packs require a DepthWalk

I don't know how shallow fetching is supposed to work. I can dig into it if that's the best way forward, but I wonder if Terry has this closer to the top of his brain.
