DESCRIPTION

Shallow fetch: Pass a DepthWalk to PackWriter

d385a7a5e5ca (Shallow fetch: Respect "shallow" lines, 2016-08-03) forgot
that UploadPack wasn't passing a DepthWalk to PackWriter in the first
place.  As a result, shallow clones fail:

  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Shallow packs require a DepthWalk
