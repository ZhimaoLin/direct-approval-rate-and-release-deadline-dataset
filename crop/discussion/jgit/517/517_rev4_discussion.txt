DESCRIPTION

JGit plugin not compatible with Eclipse 3.4

The JSch bundle in Eclipse 3.4 does not export its packages with
version numbers. Use Require-Bundle on version 0.1.37 that comes
with Eclipse 3.4

There is no 0.1.37 in the maven repositories so the pom still refers
to 0.1.41 so the build can get the compile time dependencies right.

Bug: 308031
CQ: 3904 jsch Version: 0.1.37 (using Orbit CQ2014)

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I feel uncomfortable with proposed solution for 0.1.37...

Ok, just to summarize:
* 0.1.31 is available in Sonatype's repository but not in Eclipse;
* 0.1.37 present in Eclipse Ganymede and not in Maven Central;
* 0.1.41 is available in both Eclipse Galileo and Maven Central.

The best solution is to push 0.1.37 to Maven Central in some way ;-). http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html

0.1.31 seems to me too old to be used at all.

Chris, Shawn: Opinions on having different dependencies for Maven build and bundle runtime?

Any specific reason why you want to switch from Import-package  to Require-bundle for the JSch dependency ?

As long as 0.1.37 and 0.1.41 are API compatible (what I would assume since only last digit of version changed) I don't see any issue to build against oldest version which is API-wise sufficient for our needs and use the newest compatible version which is available at runtime.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Sorry, didn't read your commit message carefully. Now I understand why you switch to Require-bundle ;-)

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

I'm OK with the dual version situation for now.  There isn't a major difference between the two releases that I think would impact JGit enough for us to worry about it.
