DESCRIPTION

Make sure CLIGitCommand and Main produce (almost) same results

Currently execution of tests in pgm uses CLIGitCommand which
re-implements few things from Main. Unfortunately this can results in a
different test behavior compared to the real CLI runtime.

The change let CLIGitCommand extend Main and only slightly modifies the
runtime (stream redirection and undesired exit() termination).
