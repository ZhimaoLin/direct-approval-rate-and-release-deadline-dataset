DESCRIPTION

Introduce Config.set that rejects null values

Config.setString was never meant to accept a 'value' argument of null,
but since it didn't check the argument, some callers started passing
that value anyway.  Introduce a new method Config.set that behaves
just like setString except that it null-checks its argument.

Deprecate Config.setString, since its semantics with a null argument are
not well defined.  Callers should be adapted to use Config.set() or
unset() as appropriate.

This commit doesn't update callers yet, except in the Config unit tests.
