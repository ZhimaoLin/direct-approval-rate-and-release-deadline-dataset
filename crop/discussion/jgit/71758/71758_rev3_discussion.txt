Patch Set 3:

Thank you for your comments and review! It seems that my editor of choice (Atom) automatically appends a newline to patch files, which unfortunately led me to believe that the patch files were valid for Git.

I've now modified the test patches to include said newline and verified Git works as expected. I'll try to see if I can pin down why JGit accepts those files and submit another changeset.
