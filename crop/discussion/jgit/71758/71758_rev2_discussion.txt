"new mode" or "new file mode" headers. This patch adds support for
setting files as executables and vice-versa.

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/M1.patch -> git-apply complains here: "fatal: corrupt patch at line 9"

adding a line feed at the end of line 9 fixes this

why does ApplyCommand behave differently and accepts this patch which git-apply considers to be corrupt ?

Line:10, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/M3.patch -> git-apply complains here: "fatal: corrupt patch at line 10"

adding a line feed at the end of line 10 fixes this

Line:10, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/M2.patch -> git-apply complains here: "fatal: corrupt patch at line 10"
