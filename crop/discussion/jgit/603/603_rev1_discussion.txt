Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Minor style nits.  Also pending a respin of the API change.

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Commit.java -> FYI, the native git commit command uses the environment variables GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE to set the committer name.  If these aren't set, they are inherited from the repository and/or the current system time.

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Commit.java -> Style-nit:  We tag the option/argument fields private.

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Commit.java -> Style-nit: Spaces around operators (=, !=, etc.)

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Commit.java -> Should we try to print a short summary of the commit that was just created, similar to what C Git does?

  $ git commit
  [pack-bugs 374c280] Don't insert the same pack twice into a pack list
   1 files changed, 13 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Maybe we skip the status line right now, but print that first line listing the branch, commit SHA-1, and subject line.
