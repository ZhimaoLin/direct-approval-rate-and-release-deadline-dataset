DESCRIPTION

Make possible to overwrite the object count

Right now, PackParser relies on the object count from the pack header.
However, when creating Dfs INSERT packs, the object count is not known
at the beginning of the operation. And when we append the base to a
RECEIVE pack, we can't modify the pack header for object count in most
Dfs implementations.

Make it possible to tell PackParser the expected object count by adding
a setter for expectedObjectCount, implementation can overwrite the
object count in onPackHeader function.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Does the project still encourage the aggressive use of "final" local objects? This file's style seems a bit archaic.
