DESCRIPTION

Make possible to overwrite the object count

Right now, PackParser relies on the object count from the pack header,
however, in Dfs INSERT/RECEIVE packs, the object count is usually not
correct.

Make it possible to tell PackParser the expected object count by adding
a setter for expectedObjectCount, implementation can overwrite the
object count in onPackHeader function.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Please update the change description to say "however, when creating Dfs INSERT/RECEIVE packs, the object count is not known at the beginning of the operation."

Also isn't expectedObjectCount really the actual object count? If so rename that variable to be just objectCount in the code and here in the description.

Patch Set 1:

I renamed it to expectedObjectCount since we expect this many of objects in this pack before pack footer. The actual object count should be the entryCount, see PackParser#getObjectCount.
