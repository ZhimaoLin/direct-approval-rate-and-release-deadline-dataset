DESCRIPTION

eclipse-ipzilla: Correctly parse result with empty last field

If the last field of our IPzilla query comes back empty, we were
skipping over and not including it in the result List, causing an
IndexOutOfBoundsException when it was read into our data model.

If the last field is empty, actually add the empty string.
