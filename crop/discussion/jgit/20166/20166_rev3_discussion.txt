DESCRIPTION

archive: Include entries for directories

Entries for directories are optional and mostly wasted space in most
archive formats (except as a place to hang ownership and filesystem
permissions), but "git archive" includes them.  Follow suit.

This will make it easier in a later change to include empty
directories as placeholders for missing submodules.
