DESCRIPTION

archive: Include entries for directories

Entries for directories are optional and mostly wasted space in most
archive formats (except as a place to hang ownership and filesystem
permissions), but "git archive" includes them.  Follow suit.

This will make it easier in a later change to include empty
directories as placeholders for missing submodules.

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> Why the change from == to .equals? Do we expect mode to be null?

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> This seems a bit like you're leaking the underlying commons compress API into the JGit API.

Why not just be nice to callers and automatically append a slash if the mode is TREE? (I would probably still be ok with throwing IAE if there is a trailing slash and mode is _not_ TREE.)

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> This string should be a property; cf. the output of "find . -name \*.java | xargs grep -A1 'new IllegalArgumentException'"

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> Property

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/ZipFormat.java -> Property (since it's reused with different classes you can use a placeholder for the method name part as well).

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> == is easier to read. Changed back.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> The idea is that most people wouldn't use classes like TarFormat directly --- instead, those are used by ArchiveCommand, and the more important public API is that when people want to write their own ArchiveCommand.Format that should be as easy as possible.

So that interface specifies a consistent convention for how trees are named (with the trailing slash).

The assertion here is to protect against regressions in that, since the commons-compress API isn't going to pay attention to the mode. As you say, there's no harm in just adding the '/' and that should make it easier to use this class directly, so done.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> Yeah. :(

Does the EGit UI show text from IllegalArgumentExceptions or something? Would it make sense to revisit this some time?

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/TarFormat.java -> Done

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/src/org/eclipse/jgit/archive/ZipFormat.java -> The method name will show up in a stack trace already, so dropped it from the message.
