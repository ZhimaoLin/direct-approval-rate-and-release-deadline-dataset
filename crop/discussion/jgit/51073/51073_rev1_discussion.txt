Line:312, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Can this check be performed without catching unchecked exceptions? E.g. something like

 private static final Pattern COMMAND = Pattern.compile("^[0-9a-f]{40} [0-9a-f]{40} ");

 if (!COMMAND.match(line)) {
   throw ...
 }

or by making parseCommand throw a checked exception?

Yes, but that should probably go in ReceiveCommand.

> or by making parseCommand throw a checked exception?

Only if you don't name it parseCommand, or wait until 5.0.

Line:312, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Isn't parseCommand package-private, and so not part of the API?

Line:312, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateParser.java -> Indeed. I don't know why I thought it was public on ReceiveCommand.
