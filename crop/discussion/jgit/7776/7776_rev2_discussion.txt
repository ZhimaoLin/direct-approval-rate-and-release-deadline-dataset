DESCRIPTION

Introduce ParseExceptions for GitDateParser

Instead of just returning null when something was not parseable we
should throw a real ParseException. This allows us t distinguish between
specifications which are unparseable and those which represent no date
(e.g. "never")

Line:150, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/GitDateParser.java -> This isn't used unless all of the ParseableSimpleDateFormat values fail. Maybe instead of building this up in the loop as we try to parse and fail, build it only after all alternatives have failed and we know we are going to throw?

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/GitDateParser.java -> parse_simple can't return null anymore. So this is useless. What about:

  try {
    return parse_simple(dateStr, f);

and make the code shorter?

Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/GitDateParser.java -> allFormats.append(", ").append(f.formatStr) so we can avoid using {} on the else block?

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> To quote a string don't we need ''{0}'' because of the way MessageFormat treats ' as an escape preventing the variable {0} from being replaced?
