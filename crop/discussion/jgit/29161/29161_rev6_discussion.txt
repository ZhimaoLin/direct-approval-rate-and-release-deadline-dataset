DESCRIPTION

Try to fix intermittent test failure related to file timestamps

Improve how tests do a "touch" operation on files. Instead of doing
"f.setLastModified(System.currentTimeMillis)" open a Outputstream on the
file and directly close it again. This makes this method rely only on
one clock - the clock of the filesystem.

as a side effect this seems to be a nice performance improvement, on my Mac JGit Maven build including tests is 1 min faster :-)
