DESCRIPTION

dump HTTP: Avoid being confused by Content-Length of a gzipped stream

TransportHttp sets 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' to allow the server to
compress HTTP responses. When fetching a loose object over HTTP, it
uses the following code to read the response:

       InputStream in = openInputStream(c);
       int len = c.getContentLength();
       return new FileStream(in, len);

If the content is gzipped, openInputStream decompresses it and produces
the correct content for the object. Unfortunately the Content-Length
header contains the length of the compressed stream instead of the
actual content length. Use a length of -1 instead since we don't know
the actual length.

Loose objects are already compressed, so the gzip encoding typically
produces a longer compressed payload. The value from the Content-Length
is too high, producing EOFException: Short read of block.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> oops --- this was meant to say 'dumb HTTP' (as opposed to 'smart HTTP')
