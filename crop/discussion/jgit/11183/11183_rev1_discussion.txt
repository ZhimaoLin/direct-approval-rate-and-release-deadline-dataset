DESCRIPTION

Remove cached_packs support in favor of bitmaps

The bitmap code in PackWriter knows exactly when to use a pack as
a "cached pack". It enables cached pack usage only when the pack
has a bitmap and its entire closure of objects needs to be sent.
This is a much simpler code path to maintain, and JGit actually
has a way to write the necessary index.
