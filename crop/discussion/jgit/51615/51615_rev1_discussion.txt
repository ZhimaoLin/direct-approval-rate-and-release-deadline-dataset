DESCRIPTION

Move `RepositoryTestCase.indexState` to parent class

The test helper method `indexState` in `RepositoryTestCase` is
very useful for writing tests, even in cases where we need to
do things like create more than one repository for a test and
thus we don't want to use the built-in `db` member variable that
exists in `RepositoryTestCase`.  Since the method is static,
we can move it up to the parent class `LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase`,
where it can be used by tests that aren't a great fit for inheriting
directly from `RepositoryTestCase`.

Christian,

I'm not sure what the procedure is for getting branches merged in from Gerritt.  Here's the other branch that I mentioned that changes the test method to a static and moves it to the parent class.  If the other branch ends up getting merged then I am happy to rebase this one.
