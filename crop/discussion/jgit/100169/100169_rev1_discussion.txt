DESCRIPTION

Use read ahead during copyPackThroughCache

If a block is missing from the block cache, open the pack stream,
retain the ReadableChannel, and turn on read-ahead.  This should help
to load a medium sized pack into a cold cache more quickly from a
slower IO stream, as the pack is scanned sequentially and missing
blocks are more likely to be available through the read-ahead.

Line:494, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> optional: can simplify by using try-with-resources, which knows not to close a null resource:

  try (ReadableChannel rc = null) {
    ...
  }

Line:818, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> optional: likewise. Here I think I prefer what you already have, but for completeness it would look something like

  try (ReadableChannel toClose = packChannel == null ? rc : null) {
   ...
  }

Line:494, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> No because you cannot assign to a variable declared in a try-with-resources block and I assign to it further below if we have a cache miss and decide to open the stream to fulfill that miss.

Line:818, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Your suggestion not much different from what we have now, but comes with the side effect of needing yet another variable in scope whose only purpose is to know if we close or not in the (now transparent) finally. But we still need the finally anyway for the readBlockMicros, so its really not saving us anything.

Thanks.

Line:494, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Ah, I hadn't realized those variables are implicitly final. Makes sense.
