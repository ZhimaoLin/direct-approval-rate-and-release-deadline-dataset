DESCRIPTION

Revert "Stop PathFilter after walking all matching paths"

This reverts commit 75eb6a147ffa8089e48d409f0215a16c755305e7.
Applications that want a PathFilter to abort the walk early should be
using PathFilterGroup. When a PathFilterGroup is created with exactly
one path its implementation is the same that 75eb6 tried to perform,
but has been long documented as having the behavior of breaking a
higher level OR filter graph node.
