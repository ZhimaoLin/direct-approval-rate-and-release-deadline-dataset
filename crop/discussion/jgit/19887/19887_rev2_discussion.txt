DESCRIPTION

archive: Prepend a specified prefix to all entry filenames

Common practice when distributing tarballs is to prefix all entries
with a single directory name so when the tarball is extracted it all
falls neatly into a single directory.  Add a setPrefix() method to
ArchiveCommand to support this.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Archive.java -> Since convention is for foo-bar.tar.gz to extract to foo-bar/..., would it be reasonable to do "prefix != null ? prefix : output"?

Line:391, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> What is the purpose of having two of every test method when we're not testing something format-specific? (I would be interested if one format normalized double slashes and another didn't, but that doesn't appear to be the case.)

Line:412, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> Glad you wrote a test, but when would somebody actually want this behavior?

Line:268, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> I think we should either check that prefix ends in "/" or (my preference) append one if it doesn't (and is not empty or null of course).

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Archive.java -> "git archive" defaults to an empty prefix and scripts rely on that, but maybe --output is rarely enough used that it could be changed.

For now I prefer to keep "jgit archive" matching "git archive", but this is a nice idea for improving "git archive".

Line:391, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> I didn't know what would happen when I wrote these --- it wouldn't have been terribly surprising for commons-compress to normalize in some formats behind the scenes.

The duplication is just sloppy coding on my part, though: it would be better for tests to try tar and zip in a loop instead of repeating itself so much. Something for a later change.

Line:412, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> I can't really imagine. :) I added the test to make sure it continues not to do anything crazy.

It mattered enough to somebody to report a bug in core git after the option had existed for a year or so, which got fixed by v1.6.5~3^2 (archive: do not leave out subdirectories when prefix lacks trailing "/", 2009-10-08).

Line:268, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> I'm aiming for compatibility with "git archive". Would a comment before the corresponding test explaining the context help?

Sorry for not realizing all the behavior I dislike is just matching behavior in "git archive" I dislike :)

Comments in the tests indicating such behavior is for compatibility is nice but not required.
