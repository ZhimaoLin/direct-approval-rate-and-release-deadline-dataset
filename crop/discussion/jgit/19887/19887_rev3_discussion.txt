DESCRIPTION

archive: Prepend a specified prefix to all entry filenames

Common practice when distributing tarballs is to prefix all entries
with a single directory name so when the tarball is extracted it all
falls neatly into a single directory.  Add a setPrefix() method to
ArchiveCommand to support this.
