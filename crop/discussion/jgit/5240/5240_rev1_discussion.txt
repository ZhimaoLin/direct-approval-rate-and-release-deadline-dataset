DESCRIPTION

RawText#getEOL() does the same thing as RawText#getLineDelimiter()

The duplication has been introduced when merging
I08e1369e142bb19f42a8d7bbb5a7d062cc8533fc and
I18adc63596f4657516ccc6d704a561924c79d445. The former should have been
manually rebased. It also missed a copyright update in ApplyCommandTest.
