Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> This is more than cgit does. It only checks whether .git/HEAD exists. I'm not saying that I like the cgit behavior better just pointing out that it is different. Both have advantages/disadvantages. I think the main advantage of the cgit approach is performance.
