Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> I'm a bit worried that we do too much here if `.git` doesn't exist (which is probably the most frequent case). Maybe add a short path for when we don't have a `.git`?

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> How about extracting this into its own method? Kind of hard to read with having both mode and dirMode here.
