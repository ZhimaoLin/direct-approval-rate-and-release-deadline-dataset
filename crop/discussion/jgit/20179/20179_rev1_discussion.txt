The idiomatic way to do this in JUnit xxx@xxx.xxx
https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Parameterized-tests

Not 100% xxx@xxx.xxx works with our maven test runner but I would guess it does.

Regardless, it'd be nice to include the archive format in any failed assertion messages. (I think if you xxx@xxx.xxx you get this for free in the test case name.)
