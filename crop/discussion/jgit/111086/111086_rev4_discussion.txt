DESCRIPTION

BitmapWalker: do not revisit objects in bitmap

Currently, BitmapWalker walks through every object returned by the
internal ObjectWalk, regardless of whether that object has already
been marked in the bitmap. Set an object filter to ensure that only
bitmap-unmarked objects are walked through.

Patch Set 4:

No, I do not have any benchmark. I also don't think that any benchmark can be made, since the existing code does not allow wanting non-commit unadvertised objects at all, and the new code does if the repo has a bitmap.
