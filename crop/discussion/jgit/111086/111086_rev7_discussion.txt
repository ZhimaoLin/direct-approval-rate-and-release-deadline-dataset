DESCRIPTION

BitmapWalker: do not revisit objects in bitmap

Currently, BitmapWalker walks through every object returned by the
internal ObjectWalk, regardless of whether that object has already
been marked in the bitmap. Set an object filter to ensure that only
bitmap-unmarked objects are walked through.
