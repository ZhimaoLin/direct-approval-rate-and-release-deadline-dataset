DESCRIPTION

Handle SSL handshake failures in TransportHttp

When a https connection could not be established because the SSL
handshake was unsuccessful, TransportHttp would unconditionally
throw a TransportException.

Other https clients like web browsers or also some SVN clients
handle this more gracefully. If there's a problem with the server
certificate, they inform the user and give him a possibility to
connect to the server all the same.

In git, this would correspond to dynamically setting http.sslVerify
to false for the server.

Implement this using the CredentialsProvider to inform and ask the
user. We offer three choices:

1. skip SSL verification for the current git operation, or
2. skip SSL verification for the server always from now on for
   requests originating from the current repository, or
3. always skip SSL verification for the server from now on.

For (1), we just suppress SSL verification for the current instance of
TransportHttp.

For (2), we store a http.<uri>.sslVerify = false setting for the
original URI in the repo config.

For (3), we store the http.<uri>.sslVerify setting in the git user
config.

Adapt the SmartClientSmartServerSslTest such that it uses this
mechanism instead of setting http.sslVerify up front.

Improve SimpleHttpServer to enable setting it up also with HTTPS
support in anticipation of an EGit SWTbot UI test verifying that
cloning via HTTPS from a server that has a certificate that doesn't
validate pops up the correct dialog, and that cloning subsequently
proceeds successfully if the user decides to skip SSL verification.

Line:613, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> The other currently available option is to configure the JVM running JGit to trust the certificate of the CA which issued the server's certificate. This is more secure than skipping ssl verification so maybe we should mention this here ?

Future options could be to implement support for the config options http.sslCAInfo [1], http.sslCAPath [2]

Line:613, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Originally I had used "trust" in this and the following messages as a short-hand for what the average end-user is probably thinking: "I don't care, get me connected".

The problem with more specific explanations and messages is that right now we end up with all kinds of SSL errors in this callback to the CredentialsProvider. If it's a case of a wrong hostname in the certificate, I'm not sure installing the signer's cert would even help. Also if the server's certificate has expired. So we would have to start to distinguish more detailed what kind of SSL validation failure we have, and then produce appropriate messages.

If we wanted to point the user at this possibility, we could only say something rather generic with the current implementation, like maybe

"To connect to the server, you can decide to skip SSL verification, or you can try to install the signer's certificate in your JVM and restart; see http:.... for instructions."

It's a bit long, would need additional support in the EGitCredentialsProvider for generating a link in the text, and from what I've seen, many users struggle with installing certificates in JVM.

So a good UI in EGit would need a dialog with a help page that would explain the problems and solution option in painstaking detail. Perhaps the right approach would be to give the CredentialsProvider a new CredentialItem.ConnectionFailure that would have the exception and the config. The provider then could decide itself what kind of messages and choices to display, could even update the config, and could return a boolean value for TransportHttp to set this.sslVerify afterwards. Or maybe this whole SSL failure case should not be lumped together with the CredentialProvider at all, but then we'd need something totally new.

If we can come up with a better and more correct text for this message, then by all means let's improve it. The current text is just the best I could come up with. It's certainly not set in stone.

Line:613, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> How about just asking the following question instead of discussing details :

"Do you want to skip SSL verification for this server?"
