DESCRIPTION

Move BatchRefUpdate tests to a new file

Run xxx@xxx.xxx so we don't have to duplicate test setup for
each atomic/non-atomic test. We still have to have two different sets of
asserts for the cases where the behavior is different. In fact, this is
a readability win: it emphasizes that performing the exact same setup
except for the atomic setting will have different behavior.
