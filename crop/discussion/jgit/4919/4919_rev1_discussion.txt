Line:277, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> According to native git "true" is not a valid value for the option "branch.autosetuprebase". Native git reports the error "error: Malformed value for branch.autosetuprebase
" when trying to use the value "true" for this option.

Line:277, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Oh yes, I should have better read the manual. Instead of true there is the additional value "remote" which applies here because we just have cloned the repo.
