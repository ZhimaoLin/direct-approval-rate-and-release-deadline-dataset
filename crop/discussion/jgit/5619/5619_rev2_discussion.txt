Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/HugeFileTest.java -> Ouch. I didn't realize this was going to need to mock this much of the JGit objects between the object directory and the tree iterator. Now I finally understand why you didn't want to mock the 4G test.

With this much code being mocked, its much harder to be sure the test is actually testing enough to make it worth carrying in tree.

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/HugeFileTest.java -> Yes, it's a lot and messy. It might be possible to clean it up, but the amount of code is too much.

Using JMockIt should be much cleaner, since it allows direct mocking of things like File and FileInputStream. However I did not find JMockit in orbit.
