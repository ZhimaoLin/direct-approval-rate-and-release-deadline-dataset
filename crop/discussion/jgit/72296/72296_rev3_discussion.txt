DESCRIPTION

Fix config value get to return last instead of 1st just like git

Before this fix, getting the value of 'key' below used to return
value1. This fix makes it so that value3 gets returned instead,
just like native git's get.

[section]
  key = value1
  key = value2
  key = value3

Line:637, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> style nit: since quite a while we use curly braces around single line blocks so missing braces should be added when touching old code not following this rule
