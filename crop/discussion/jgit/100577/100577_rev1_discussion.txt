DESCRIPTION

Extract BlockBasedFile base class for DfsPackFile

This new base class has the minimum set of properties and methods
necessary for DfsBlockCache to manage blocks of a file in the cache.
Subclasses can use DfsBlockCache for any content.

This refactoring opens the door for additional PackExt types other
than PACK to be stored on a block-by-block basis by the DfsBlockCache.
