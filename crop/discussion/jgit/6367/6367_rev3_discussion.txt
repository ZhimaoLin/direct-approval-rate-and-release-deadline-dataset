DESCRIPTION

Add a method to set the .gitmodules config on a SubmoduleWalk

It is not always appropriate to use the .gitmodules file from the
working tree, for example if reading the modules at a specific commit.
And sometimes it is impossible, as in a bare repository.

Read the .gitmodules automatically when using the static factory
methods.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Code looks good, but maybe updated unit tests as Kevin requests is also good? :-)

Patch Set 3:

Indeed, I noticed the existing tests failed when I ran them--previously I had only tested against my own code. Will definitely get on that tomorrow.

That will probably involve more code changes; we need to preserve the existing lazy-loading behavior for e.g. indexes where it turns out there are no submodules.
