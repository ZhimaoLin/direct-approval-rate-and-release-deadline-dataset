DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support in http://www.jets3t.org/ mode

See previous attempt: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16674/

Here we preserve as much of JetS3t mode as possible
while allowing to use new Java 8+ PBE algorithms
such as PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256

List of changes:
* change pom.xml to control long tests
* add WalkEncryptionTest.launch to run long tests
* add AmazonS3.Keys to to normalize use of constants
* change WalkEncryption to support AES in JetS3t mode
* add WalkEncryptionTest to test remote encryption pipeline
* add support for CI configuration for live Amazon S3 testing

To test locally, check out the review branch, then:
* create amazon test configuration file
* located your home dir: ${user.home}
* named jgit-s3-config.properties
* file format follows AmazonS3 connection settings file:
	accesskey = your-amazon-access-key
	secretkey = your-amazon-secret-key
	test.bucket = your-bucket-for-testing
* finally:
* run in eclipse: WalkEncryptionTest.launch
* or
* run from command line: mvn test --define test=WalkEncryptionTest

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> remove dead code

Line:648, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> strange method name, maybe "testIfAlgorithmPresent"

Line:649, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> Could we use junit assume also to skip tests if an algorithm is missing ?

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> 1) can we please enable CI amazon build?
since currently tests are useless, i.e. :
https://hudson.eclipse.org/jgit/job/jgit.gerrit/7127/consoleFull
2015-09-22 12:46:20 ERROR WalkEncryptionTest:568 - Amazon S3 test configuration is missing, tests will not run.

2) should we detect CI build via 
HUDSON_HOME or JENKINS_HOME
or some other environment settings 
in order to always force long-running tests on CI?

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> switched to slf4j/log4j
since it was already in maven dependencies

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> Done

Line:265, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> Done

Line:649, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> this is what I essentially do here,
except I want to see extra logging
when algorithm is in fact missing

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> which Amazon account do you propose to use for configuring this test on Hudson ?

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> 1) I would hope eclipse.org can afford a test s3 bucket.
That would be a permanent solution.

2) If not, I could provide eclipse.org with my private AWS setup for the few weeks during the development, to insure that code is actually tested by official eclipse.org build system, but I will disable the setup after I am done.

3) test bucket should use 1 day retention lifecycle:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html

4) test bucket should use AWS IAM account with single-bucket access policy:
http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3VRSWZ6B3SHAV/Writing-IAM-Policies-How-to-grant-access-to-an-Amazon-S3-bucket

5) test bucket policy can also limit access by ip/mask
of the CI build server or build farm only:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-3

6) with such narrow-purpose setup, both cost and risk of abuse should be minimal:
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
