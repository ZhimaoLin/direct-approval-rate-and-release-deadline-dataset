DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support in http://www.jets3t.org/ mode

See previous attempt: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16674/

Here we preserve as much of JetS3t mode as possible
while allowing to use new Java 8+ PBE algorithms
such as PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256

List of changes:
* change pom.xml to control long tests
* add WalkEncryptionTest.launch to run long tests
* add AmazonS3.Keys to to normalize use of constants
* change WalkEncryption to support AES in JetS3t mode
* add WalkEncryptionTest to test remote encryption pipeline
* add support for CI configuration for live Amazon S3 testing
* add slf4j/log4j logging for tests in both Eclipse and Maven build

To test locally, check out the review branch, then:
* create amazon test configuration file
* located your home dir: ${user.home}
* named jgit-s3-config.properties
* file format follows AmazonS3 connection settings file:
	accesskey = your-amazon-access-key
	secretkey = your-amazon-secret-key
	test.bucket = your-bucket-for-testing
* finally:
* run in eclipse: WalkEncryptionTest.launch
* or
* run from command line: mvn test --define test=WalkEncryptionTest

Line:8, org.eclipse.jgit.test/build.properties -> This isn't available in Orbit http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20150821153341/ so we'd have to add it and its dependency slf4j-simple to Orbit so that we can add it to the target platform.

We already have an approval for log4j 1.2.15 which is available in Orbit already, so could we use log4j instead of slf4j-simple ?
