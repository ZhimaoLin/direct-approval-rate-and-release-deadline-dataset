DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support in http://www.jets3t.org/ mode

See previous attempt: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16674/

Here we preserve as much of JetS3t mode as possible
while allowing to use new Java 8+ PBE algorithms
such as PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256

Summary of changes:
* change pom.xml to control long tests
* add WalkEncryptionTest.launch to run long tests
* add AmazonS3.Keys to to normalize use of constants
* change WalkEncryption to support AES in JetS3t mode
* add WalkEncryptionTest to test remote encryption pipeline
* add support for CI configuration for live Amazon S3 testing
* add log4j based logging for tests in both Eclipse and Maven build

To test locally, check out the review branch, then:
* create amazon test configuration file
* located your home dir: ${user.home}
* named jgit-s3-config.properties
* file format follows AmazonS3 connection settings file:
	accesskey = your-amazon-access-key
	secretkey = your-amazon-secret-key
	test.bucket = your-bucket-for-testing
* finally:
* run in Eclipse: WalkEncryptionTest.launch
* or
* run in Shell: mvn test --define test=WalkEncryptionTest

If I run the JGit tests locally the new tests added here are failing due to missing permissions for your S3 test bucket. Please change the default for running these tests so that they don't run by default since we can't force everybody working on JGit to pay an AWS account. I can change the job configuration on Hudson so that these tests are run on Hudson.

I filed a CQ to trigger the IP review for this change by the legal team which is required since this change has more than 1000 LoC.
