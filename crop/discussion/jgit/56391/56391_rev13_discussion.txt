DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support in http://www.jets3t.org/ mode

See previous attempt: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16674/

Here we preserve as much of JetS3t mode as possible
while allowing to use new Java 8+ PBE algorithms
such as PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256

Summary of changes:
* change pom.xml to control long tests
* add WalkEncryptionTest.launch to run long tests
* add AmazonS3.Keys to to normalize use of constants
* change WalkEncryption to support AES in JetS3t mode
* add WalkEncryptionTest to test remote encryption pipeline
* add support for CI configuration for live Amazon S3 testing
* add log4j based logging for tests in both Eclipse and Maven build

To test locally, check out the review branch, then:
* create amazon test configuration file
* located your home dir: ${user.home}
* named jgit-s3-config.properties
* file format follows AmazonS3 connection settings file:
	accesskey = your-amazon-access-key
	secretkey = your-amazon-secret-key
	test.bucket = your-bucket-for-testing
* finally:
* run in Eclipse: WalkEncryptionTest.launch
* or
* run in Shell: mvn test --define test=WalkEncryptionTest*
