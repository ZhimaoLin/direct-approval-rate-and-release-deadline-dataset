DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support in http://www.jets3t.org/ mode

See previous attempt: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16674/

Here we preserve as much of JetS3t mode as possible
while allowing to use new Java 8+ PBE algorithms
such as PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256

Summary of changes:
* change pom.xml to control long tests
* add WalkEncryptionTest.launch to run long tests
* add AmazonS3.Keys to to normalize use of constants
* change WalkEncryption to support AES in JetS3t mode
* add WalkEncryptionTest to test remote encryption pipeline
* add support for CI configuration for live Amazon S3 testing
* add log4j based logging for tests in both Eclipse and Maven build

To test locally, check out the review branch, then:
* create amazon test configuration file
* located your home dir: ${user.home}
* named jgit-s3-config.properties
* file format follows AmazonS3 connection settings file:
	accesskey = your-amazon-access-key
	secretkey = your-amazon-secret-key
	test.bucket = your-bucket-for-testing
* finally:
* run in Eclipse: WalkEncryptionTest.launch
* or
* run in Shell: mvn test --define test=WalkEncryptionTest

Patch Set 20: Code-Review+2

- CQ was approved
- added another property to disable the encryption tests locally since the checked in s3 configuration is restricted to Hudson and we can't expect that every JGit contributor has an s3 account

Are these tests supposed to run by default when invoking `mvn test`?

They're failing for me due to problems with my proxy.  Even after fixing the glitch mentioned in the inline comments, it's not able to connect.

Line:504, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> This causes the tests to fail with:

 java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: localhost

when the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables are set without a scheme.  In my case "localhost:3100".

Line:504, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> "unknown protocol" most likely means missing "http://" prefix in url; please take a look / verify:

Line:504, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> Yes, as I wrote, my proxy is "localhost:3100" intentionally without the scheme.  This is working as expected for other uses.

I can't prefix it with http:// because it's not an http proxy.  Also, even if I replace it with an http proxy, the tests are failing because my corporate proxy is blocking the outgoing requests.

Hence my question, should these tests be active by default?

Line:504, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryptionTest.java -> OK, I see you point. 
I will send a PR to make proxy setup 
dependent on CI server presence detection.
