DESCRIPTION

Adding AES Walk Encryption support in http://www.jets3t.org/ mode

See previous attempt: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16674/

Here we preserve as much of JetS3t mode as possible
while allowing to use new Java 8 PBE algorithms
such as PBEWithHmacSHA512AndAES_256

List of changes:
* change pom.xml to control long tests
* add WalkEncryptionTest.launch to run long tests
* add AmazonS3.Keys to to normalize use of constants
* change WalkEncryption to support AES in JetS3t mode
* add WalkEncryptionTest to test remote encryption pipeline
* add support for CI configuration for live Amazon S3 testing

(9 comments)

Line:2, .gitignore -> We ignored the file, but you added it anyway?

File Comment: .project -> We usually don't commit Eclipse .project files in JGit. Why are we adding this file?

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> I think you can fit this all on one line:

 /** Property names ... */

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> Override the Eclipse formatted and skip the blank lines between fields here. Its noisy seeing all this extra whitespace in what is just a dense definition of constants.

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> So when Java 9 is released this is going to fall back to Java7 behavior again? :(

Isn't Java 7 our minimum version now? So the better test is if equals("1.7") || startsWith("1.7.") assume Java7, otherwise assume Java 8 and onward?

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> I'm no crypto nerd, but this is a bad idea. We may be better off just breaking compatibility with JetS3.

Line:226, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> IIRC its spelled JetS3t, mixed case. See http://www.jets3t.org/

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit.test/pom.xml -> This is going to require a CQ to get permission to use the library for testing.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.test/pom.xml -> please remove trailing space; blank lines should be just an LF.

post comments!

Line:2, .gitignore -> no, I did commit the .project to the repo,
exactly because it was not listed here
hence I added .project to .gitignore
then removed .project from the commit

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> done

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> done

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> fixed

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> this is still better then PBEWithMD5AndDES
which most use by default, and since eclipse
does not carry BC provider, there is no way
to get a stronger encryption

so I suggest that we:
1) commit this as is
2) setup CI to run live amazon tests
3) provide new ObjectEncryptionXXX, independent of JetS3t
so both old and new can coexist

Line:226, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkEncryption.java -> done

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit.test/pom.xml -> ok.
1) so should I keep or remove the dependency?
2) if we are keeping this, can we make it scope=compile?

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.test/pom.xml -> done

File Comment: .project -> this isn't true, we have committed .project files for all JGit bundles, see e.g.
http://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tree/org.eclipse.jgit/.project
but I would not want to have a project in the root folder since support for nested projects in Eclipse is still limited

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit.test/pom.xml -> we have an approved CQ for org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on
https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9554
though it's not yet in Orbit since we need an Oracle JCE signing certificate to re-sign the bundle which we had to modify since we were asked to remove a few classes due to legal issues. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=467064
