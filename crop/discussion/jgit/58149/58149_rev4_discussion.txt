DESCRIPTION

Added closeForcibly() method to Repository

If clients want make sure that no opened resources are left after
closing Repository object, they must write a while(!isClosed()) close();
loop which looks pretty awkward.

Give clients of the Repository objects full control over the opened
resources, independently of the Repository object use count, to avoid
resource leaks on possible API usage errors (not matching
incrementOpen() and close() calls).
