DESCRIPTION

Fixed merge algorithm regarding adjacent modifications

JGit merge algorithm behaved differently from C Git when
we had adjacent modifications. If line 9 was modified by
OURS and line 10 by theirs then C Git will return a
conflict while JGit was seeing this as independent
modifications. This change is not only there to achieve
compatibility, but there where also some really wrong
merge results produced by JGit in the area of adjacent
modifications.
