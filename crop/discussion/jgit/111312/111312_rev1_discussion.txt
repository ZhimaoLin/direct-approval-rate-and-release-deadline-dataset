DESCRIPTION

Reject pack if delta exceeds array size limit

JGit's delta handling code requires the target to be a single byte
array. Any attempt to inflate a delta larger than fits in the 2GiB
limit will fail with some form of array index exceptions. Check for
this overflow early and abort pack parsing.

Line:722, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> Makes sense. In OpenJDK, this is the array size limit consistently used. I wish there were a publicly exposed constant but this is the next best thing.
