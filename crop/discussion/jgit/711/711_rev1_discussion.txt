DESCRIPTION

Refactor APIs used by PackWriter to ensure pack stays open

In the future we'll need to use a per-writer file descriptor to
protect the PackWriter from having a necessary PackFile closed
behind its back.

To work towards that goal, we need to change the copy raw data APIs
off the PackedObjectLoader and shuffle them into a reuse handle
which can be later used to store the writer specific file descriptor.

In this change we create a stateless reuse handle which tracks the
pack, but doesn't know anything about the object representation.

Unfortunately this means that during reuse we now have to parse
the object header twice; once to determine the raw size of the
object (for the new outgoing header) and again to determine how
many bytes were used for the header in the source pack.  This is
a small penalty, and I have tried to minimize the code required in
these two locations.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

This is an early draft of this change.  I've since refactored it further in my local workspace.  I'll push an updated revision probably tomorrow.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

As much as I like the idea of this code, I'm taking it back for now because its not leading to a successful resolution of bug 308945.
