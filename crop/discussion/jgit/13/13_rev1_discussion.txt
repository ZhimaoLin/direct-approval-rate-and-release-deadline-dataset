Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Code looks good to me as-is, but please squash these two
commits together, abandon this change, and upload the
new squashed commit as a replacement for I908e4c77 so we
have a cleaner project history.

now another question for the contributors guide. It is not clear to me how I would push and replace the I908e4c77. I know "commit --amend" and the "reset" commands, but together with gerrit it's not clear what to do. How to 
- push another patchset to a change
- replace a patchset

See the bottom of [1] as I just added more information.  Long story short, if you have a Change-Id line in the commit message, you just use the same push command line, and Gerrit figures out the right course of action.
