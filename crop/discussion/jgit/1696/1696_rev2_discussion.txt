DESCRIPTION

Add "Pull" command

This is the minimal implementation of a "Pull" command. It does not
have any parameters besides the generic progress monitor and timeout.
It works on the currently checked-out branch and assumes that the
configuration contains the keys "branch.<branch name>.remote" and
"branch.<branch name>.merge" to determine the remote configuration
for the fetch and the remote branch name for the merge.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

You may want to use constants for some of the configuration items...

Other than that, I think this is a good start.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Sure we can.  You just can't use branch configuration to do it.  Instead the caller must give us options like a remote name or URI, and optionally a remote branch as well.  These override the configuration defaults.

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Instead of reading the branch name twice from HEAD, read it once with getFullBranch() and trim it yourself if it starts with R_HEADS.

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Instead of this loop, you just want:

  Ref r = fetchRes.getAdvertisedRef(remoteBranchName);
  if (r == null)
    r = fetchRes.getAdvertisedRef(R_HEADS + remoteBranchName);

Then you can use r.getObjectId() to tell you what the object is.

Line:226, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> This won't quite create the correct merge message.  During a pull we want to know the URI of the remote, and the remote branch name, not the local tracking branch name.
