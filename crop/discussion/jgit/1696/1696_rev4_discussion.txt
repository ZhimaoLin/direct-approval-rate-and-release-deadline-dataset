DESCRIPTION

Add "Pull" command

This is the minimal implementation of a "Pull" command. It does not
have any parameters besides the generic progress monitor and timeout.
It works on the currently checked-out branch and assumes that the
configuration contains the keys "branch.<branch name>.remote" and
"branch.<branch name>.merge" to determine the remote configuration
for the fetch and the remote branch name for the merge.
