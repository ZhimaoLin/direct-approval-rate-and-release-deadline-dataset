DESCRIPTION

Avoid repacking unreachable garbage in DfsGarbageCollector

If a repository has significant amounts of unreachable garbage the
final phase to coalesce it can take longer than any other part of the
garbage collection phase. Provide a setting for applications to tweak
the threshold where coalescing ends and files just remain on disk.

Patch Set 1:

The test failure reported by Hudson is unrelated. Possibly a race condition in GCTest.nonReferencedObjects_onlyExpiredPruned that was triggered under load in the build farm.
