Change looks like it fixes the bug, but the surrounding context is now a bit more confusing due to a pointless null check.

Line:303, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I think this implies ref cannot be null at this point.  Which might be correct, so I wonder if we shouldn't drop the "ref != null" test above just so the code isn't reading like we are risking an NPE here.

(I'm pretty sure that symbolic.get() won't return null, and that resolve() also won't return null, and thus that the ref != null test above is wrong.)

Line:303, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Actually, there are a couple of conditions where resolve may return null, so I'm wondering now why this solution worked at all for me :(

Line:303, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I think it only returns null when the symbolic reference requires too many traversals to resolve (and we start to suspect we are in a loop). This isn't very common, but it can happen.
