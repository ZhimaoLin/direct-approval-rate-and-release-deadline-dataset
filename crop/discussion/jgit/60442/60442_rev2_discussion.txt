DESCRIPTION

Null-annotated Repository class and fixed related compiler errors

org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository class is an example of the API which
should be written with Java 8 java.util.Optional<T> type. Unfortunately
this API is already released and widely used. The good clients are
currently doing their best with checking return values for null and bad
clients do not know how bad their code is.

I've tried not to change any logic and to be as less intrusive as
possible. Most of the JGit code was well prepared to this, only few
classes needed some smaller fixes. That's not the case for EGit - we
will have 63 compiler errors there after this change, a patch follows.

This change fixes all compiler errors in JGit and replaces possible
NPE's with either appropriate exceptions, avoiding multiple "Nullable
return" method calls or early returning from the method.
