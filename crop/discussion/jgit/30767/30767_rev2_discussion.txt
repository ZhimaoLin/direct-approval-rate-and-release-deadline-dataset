DESCRIPTION

Fix API errors raised on ResolveMerger affecting API providers only

In change If45bc3d078b3d3de87b758e71d7379059d709603 a new parameter was
added to 3 protected methods of ResolveMerger. This breaks the code of
developers which have subclassed ResolveMerger. The API baseline check
in Eclipse reports this as API breakage.

Since this will break only providers but not consumers of the API this
should be allowed also in minor versions. According to OSGi semantic
versioning
http://www.osgi.org/wiki/uploads/Links/SemanticVersioning.pdf
breaking providers in a minor version update is ok.

Therefore silence these errors using API filter rules.
