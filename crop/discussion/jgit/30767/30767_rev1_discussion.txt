DESCRIPTION

Fix API Baseline checks

In change If45bc3d078b3d3de87b758e71d7379059d709603 a new parameter was
added to 3 protected methods of ResolveMerger. This breaks the code of
developers which have subclassed ResolveMerger. The API Baselinecheck in
Eclipse reports this as API breakage.

Since this will break only Providers but not Consumers of the API this
should be allowed also in minor versions. See semantic versioning doc
http://www.osgi.org/wiki/uploads/Links/SemanticVersioning.pdf

Therefore I added these modifications to the API filter rules.
