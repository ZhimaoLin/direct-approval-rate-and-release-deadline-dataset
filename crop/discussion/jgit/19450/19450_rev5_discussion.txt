DESCRIPTION

Upgrade javaewah to version 0.7.9

Package was renamed, so I had to update the imports. Also, I verified
bitmap serialization was still compatible.

Patch Set 5:

The downside of merging this change now is that currently there is no stable orbit build yet, I-builds are usually only around for a short period, see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Promotion%2C_Release%2C_and_Retention_Policies

I am working on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425660 to fix this and reach a new orbit R-build which is retained forever
