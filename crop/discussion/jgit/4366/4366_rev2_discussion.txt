DESCRIPTION

Refactor ResolveMerger

The places where ResolveMerger was doing content merges have been
refactored. The goal was to have one single method where content merge
was done and to factor out other topics (updating the index, updating
the working tree) into own methods. This was done to allow adding
pluggable content mergers in change
