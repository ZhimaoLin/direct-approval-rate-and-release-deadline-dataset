DESCRIPTION

Refactor ResolveMerger

The places where ResolveMerger was doing content-merges have been
refactored. Goal was to have one single method where content merge was
done and to factor out other topics (updating the index, updating the
working tree) into own methods. This was done to allow
adding pluggable content mergers in change 3874
