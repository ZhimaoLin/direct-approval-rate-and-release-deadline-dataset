DESCRIPTION

Fix NPE in RenameDetector

If we have two adds of the same object but no deletes the detector
threw an NPE because the entry that came back from the deleted map
was null (no matching objects).  In this case we need to put the
adds all back onto the list of left over additions since they did
not match a delete.
