Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

As I recall, this was intentional:

  $ git branch refs/heads/foo
  $ git branch
  * master
   refs/heads/foo

Patch Set 1:

I think it is a mistake. There should be a warning. C Git sometime prints a warning when you try to use it. We should have a warning right away when trying to create it, or maybe an error (-f to force creation anyway).
