DESCRIPTION

Refactor IndexPack to use InputStream for inflation

By inflating with an InputStream like API, it is possible to stream
through large objects rather than allocating the entire thing as
a byte[].  This change only refactors the inflation code within
IndexPack to use a streaming interface.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

All looks fine, and worked well on my test repos.
