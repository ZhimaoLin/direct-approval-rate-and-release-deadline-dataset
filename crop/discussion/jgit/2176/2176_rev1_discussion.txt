Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Why isn't this static?  And why is dir final, but command and encoding aren't?

Line:238, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> We also need to do:

  p.getErrorStream().close();

I think the original version forgot to do that.  :-(
