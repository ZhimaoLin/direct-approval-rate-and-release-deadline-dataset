DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediatly evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because
packfiles/references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repo from the caches until last use
of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is handled by
a terminator thread which runs periodically.

TODO: allow configuration of time to live and check interval.
TODO: name terminator thread
TODO: tests,...
