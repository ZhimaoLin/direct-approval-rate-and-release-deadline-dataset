DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediatly evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because
packfiles/references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repo from the caches until last use
of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is handled by
a terminator thread which runs periodically.

TODO: allow configuration of time to live and check interval.
TODO: name terminator thread
TODO: tests,...

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/log4j.properties -> Looks unrelated to this change as, in the end, we likely don't want to submit this?

Btw, it would be enough to set only the "org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Repository" to DEBUG level.

Line:121, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> private final

Line:875, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This line and the check in the line 885 are not atomic any more.

In the worst case this code may skip calling the doClose() from the line 888. For example, if useCnt == 1, two threads call close() at about the same time and both decrementAndGet here before any of them reaches line 885 then the useCnt will be -1 and doClose will be skipped.

Line:876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This should only be checked if useCnt reached zero?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> More precisely these are all window cache entries for each pack file of that repository that gets removed from the WindowCache.

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> This can fit into the previous line.
