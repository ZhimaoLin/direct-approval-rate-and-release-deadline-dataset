DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediatly evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because
packfiles/references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repo from the caches until last use
of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is handled by
a terminator thread which runs periodically.

TODO: allow configuration of time to live and check interval.
TODO: tests,...

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> There is still a window of vulnerability between the useCnt == 0 check and acquiring the lock in the line 273. So you may detect useCnt to be zero here and another thread could just open the same repo and increase the useCnt. After that the unregisterAndCloseRepository will unconditionally close the repo.

Proposal: the check for useCnt == 0 need to be repeated again after the lock is acquired (between the lines 273-274)
