DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediatly evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because
packfiles/references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repo from the caches until last use
of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is handled by
a terminator thread which runs periodically.

TODO: allow configuration of time to live and check interval.
TODO: name terminator thread
TODO: tests,...

Line:879, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> If the repository is not open through the cache, it will never be closed.

That's why I think we should leave the close almost as it was:

public void close() {
  lastUsed.set(System.currentTimeMillis());
  if (useCnt.decrementAndGet() == 0) {
    doClose();
  }
}

and move the eviction code in the terminator thread. IMHO, the notion of eviction belongs to the RepositoryCache object and should not exist in Repository.

Line:879, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I am working on this. I have something but I cannot upload a PS on this change so I will upload it as a new change. You can then get my change and upload it as a PS on this change if you like it or abandon it if you don't like it.
