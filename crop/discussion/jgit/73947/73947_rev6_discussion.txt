DESCRIPTION

WIP: time based eviction strategy for repository cache

When Repository.close() decrements the useCount to 0 currently the cache
immediatly evicts the repository from WindowCache and RepositoryCache.
This leads to I/O overhead on busy repositories because
packfiles/references are inserted and deleted from the cache frequently.

This commit defers the eviction of a repo from the caches until last use
of the repository is older than time to live. The eviction is handled by
a terminator thread which runs periodically.

TODO: allow configuration of time to live and check interval.
TODO: tests,...

To fix the breaking test, replace RepositoryCacheTest.testRepositoryUnregisteringWhenClosing by:

@Test
public void testRepositoryNotUnregisteringWhenClosing() throws Exception {
  FileKey loc = FileKey.exact(db.getDirectory(), db.getFS());
  Repository d2 = RepositoryCache.open(loc);
  assertEquals(1, d2.useCnt.get());
  assertThat(RepositoryCache.getRegisteredKeys(),
    hasItem(FileKey.exact(db.getDirectory(), db.getFS())));
  assertEquals(1, RepositoryCache.getRegisteredKeys().size());

  d2.close();

  assertEquals(0, d2.useCnt.get());
  assertEquals(1, RepositoryCache.getRegisteredKeys().size());
}

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> Now that this method moved to RepositoryCache, do we really need it?

We could move the content directly in terminator Runnable.

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> replace those 2 lines by (see comments on PS5):

close(repo);

Any chance we can get this one done in time for 4.4 or it's already too late?

I am asking because I would like to have this fix in Gerrit 2.13 and not have to fork JGit if possible or wait for 4.5.

I talked with Matthias about that yesterday. We both thought it's too dangerous to put this in in a hurry. We saw some very severe bugs during development (e.g. a JGit command line process which doesn't want to terminate anymore because because we failed to kill the scheduler correctly).
But producing a minor release as soon as this is accepted should be no problem.
