DESCRIPTION

Set commit time to ZipArchiveEntry

Archived zip files for a same commit have different MD5 hash because
mdate and mdate in the header of zip entries are not specified. In
this case, Commons Compress sets an archived time.

In the original git implementation, it's set a commit time:
https://github.com/git/git/blob/e2b2d6a172b76d44cb7b1ddb12ea5bfac9613a44/archive.c#L378

By this fix, archive command sets the commit time to ZipArchiveEntry
when RevCommit is given as an archiving target.

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> don't break API in minor releases, you could deprecate the old method and add a new one with the additional parameter, we could then remove the deprecated method after 4.7 was released (5.0 is planned for end of June)
