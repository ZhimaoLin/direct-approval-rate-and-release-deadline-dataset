DESCRIPTION

WIP: Run checker framework for nullability static analysis

java_nullness_test checks xxx@xxx.xxx annotations and fails if there's
a potential null dereference. By default, all variables are assumed to
be @NonNull xxx@xxx.xxx Currently most of the code is not
annotated properly, and most of the tests fail.

Fixed org.eclipse.jgit.util.
