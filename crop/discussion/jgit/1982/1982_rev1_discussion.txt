DESCRIPTION

Rebase Interoperability second part: fix handling of git-rebase-todo

If the CLI stops a rebase upon conflict, the current
step is already popped from the git-rebase-todo and appended to the
"done" file. The current implementation wrongly pops the step only
after successful cherry-pick.
