Patch Set 2:

Ok.  So I should change CheckoutCommandTest.testCheckoutWithConflict()
to assert that getConflictedFiles() is behaving correctly.

I'll also make a defensive copy of the returned files to fix the FindBugs warnings:
https://hudson.eclipse.org/jgit/job/jgit.gerrit/8185/findbugsResult/new/

Is that sufficient?  Thanks very much for the help.  I'm trying to pay close attention so I can contribute the rest without causing you a ton of headache.
