DESCRIPTION

Fix concurrent read / write issue in LockFile on Windows

LockFile.commit fails if another thread concurrently reads
the base file. The problem is fixed by retrying the rename
operation if it fails.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Aside from these inline comments, I want to submit I7c7a05e443a48d32c836173a409ee7d340c70796 first, as this has quite a few merge conflicts due to the refactoring.

Line:415, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/LockFile.java -> Style-nit: Braces aren't necessary here.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/LockFile.java -> I would rather have the InterruptedException abort the loop entirely and return false.  So instead organize it as:

  try {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    return false;
  }

This way if a worker thread is stuck waiting for a second for a lock file to release and the user hits cancel in the UI, the thread can be interrupted and abort right away rather than keep busy-waiting through the entire period.

Line:272, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCache.java -> Should be final.
