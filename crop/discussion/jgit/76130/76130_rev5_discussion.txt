DESCRIPTION

Add builtin LFS clean filter

Adds a JGit builtin implementation of the "git lfs clean" filter. This
filter should do the same as the one described in [1]. But since this
filter is written in Java and can be called by JGit without forking new
processes it should be much faster

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> Thats really by purpose. We have configured a strange setup where the clean filter converts from real content to pointer file content. But the smudge filter is just replacing 'o' by 'e'. So after one round of clean filter & smudge filter you end up with a pointer file where 'o's are replaced by 'e's resulting in "versien" instead of "version". That's an artificial setup which I guess no end user wants to have ... but it's a nice stress test.

Bu I'll add comment clarifying that.

Done
