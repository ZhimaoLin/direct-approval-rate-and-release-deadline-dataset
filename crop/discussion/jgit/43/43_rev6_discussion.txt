DESCRIPTION

Teach ReceivePack how to use an RPC style interface

If biDirectionalPipe is false ReceivePack does not start out with the
advertisement but instead assumes it should read the command set once,
process that, and write the status report out.  This means it only is
doing one read through the input followed by one write to the output,
which fits with the HTTP request processing model, and any other type
of RPC system... assuming that the payload for input can be a very big
entity like the command stream followed by the pack file.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I can't see any differences between this and patch set 5 - am I missing anything? Or does Gerrit automatically re-send out these notifications if you rebase or something?
