DESCRIPTION

Simplify development setup for JGit-only contributors (m2e)

This enables the Maven integration in Eclipse (m2e) for the non-RCP JGit
projects. With this, the jgit repo can be cloned, imported into Eclipse
and have everything compile right away due to m2e knowing about the
dependencies.

With the current setup, it's not as easy because one has to manually
install the dependencies into Eclipse or use the target platform, which
requires the RCP tooling.

The additional m2e nature does not seem to interfere with the plugin
nature, it still works when RCP and m2e is installed or RCP only.

The following Stack Overflow question motivated this change:

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

That would mean I'd HAVE to use maven all the time. It's a dog.

I also don't like to be forced to use m2e when I work with jgit. The p2f files helped me a lot to get the development setup done.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Didn't think this would be so controversial. I updated http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Tools instead (for JGit-only developers).
