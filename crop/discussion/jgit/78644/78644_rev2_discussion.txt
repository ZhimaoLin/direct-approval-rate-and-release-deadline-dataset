The changes are on top of the buggy commit they fix. That way, anyone who wants the fixes without the latest changes from head can get them. (This is relevant because e426aa8b908b528ab16107d92287050fd26ed047 makes the bug fixed by this series easier to trip, so load-balanced setups running upgrades without downtime may want to roll out this fix before rolling out e426aa8b908b528ab16107d92287050fd26ed047.)

Sadly, tests are flaky at HEAD. See https://hudson.eclipse.org/jgit/job/jgit.gerrit/.

Will fix separately.
