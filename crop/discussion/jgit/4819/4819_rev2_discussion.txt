DESCRIPTION

Support resolving integer-based reflog revisions

Revision strings such as xxx@xxx.xxx can now be resolved
by Repository.resolve by reading the reflog for the ref and
returning the commit for the entry number specified.

This still throws an exception for cases not supported
such as xxx@xxx.xxx
