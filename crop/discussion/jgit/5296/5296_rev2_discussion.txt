DESCRIPTION

Try to send HTTP error messages over sideband

When a client POSTs to /git-{upload,receive}-pack, the first line
includes their client capabilities. As soon as the C git client sends
side-band(-64k), it goes into a state where it chokes on data not sent
in a valid sideband channel.

GitSmartHttpTools.sendError() is called early in the request, likely
before a {Upload,Receive}Pack handler is assigned or, even so, before it
has read the request. In some cases we must read the first line manually
within sendError() to tell whether sideband is needed.
