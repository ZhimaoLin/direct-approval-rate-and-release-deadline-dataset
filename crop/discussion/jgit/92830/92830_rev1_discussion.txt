DESCRIPTION

Don't remove pack when FileNotFoundException is transient

The FileNotFoundException is typically raised in three conditions:
1. file doesn't exist
2. incompatible read vs. read/write open modes
3. filesystem locking
4. temporary lack of resources (e.g. too many open files)

1. is already managed, 2. would never happen as packs are not
overwritten while with 3. and 4. it is worth logging the exception and
retry to read the pack again.

Line:580, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Is there a way to "track" the number of consecutive failed attempts to open that pack file?

Should this go to one of the stable branches?

If so, maybe stable-4.5 so we can get the fix in the next Gerrit 2.13.x release?
