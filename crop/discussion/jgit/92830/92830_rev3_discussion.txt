DESCRIPTION

Don't remove pack when FileNotFoundException is transient

The FileNotFoundException is typically raised in three conditions:
1. file doesn't exist
2. incompatible read vs. read/write open modes
3. filesystem locking
4. temporary lack of resources (e.g. too many open files)

1. is already managed, 2. would never happen as packs are not
overwritten while with 3. and 4. it is worth logging the exception and
retry to read the pack again.

Log transient errors using an exponential backoff strategy to avoid
flooding the logs with the same error if consecutive retries to access
the pack fail repeatedly.
