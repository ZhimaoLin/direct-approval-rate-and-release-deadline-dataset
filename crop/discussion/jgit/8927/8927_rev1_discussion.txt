DESCRIPTION

add: Fix bad metaVar reference in <filepattern> help

Without this patch, "jgit add --help" throws two exceptions
(NoSuchFieldException: metavar_filepattern; MissingResourceException:
Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key
metavar_filepattern) instead of printing a usage message, due to a
small typo and a missing declaration.
