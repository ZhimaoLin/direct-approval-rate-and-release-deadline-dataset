DESCRIPTION

Use .addObject and .or instead of .add in AddToBitmapFilter

This is the caller that the BitmapBuilder.add method was designed
around.  Moving away from .add makes it more verbose but hopefully
clearer.

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> Inlining bitmap.getBitmapIndex() here avoids the additional lookup that isn't needed if the first conditional statement is met. Not sure how big a performance gain that is, but since this is a RevWalk filter, probably worth doing.

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> Same here.
