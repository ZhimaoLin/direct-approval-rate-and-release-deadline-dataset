DESCRIPTION

Added new Status CLI command 'jgit status'

This is a first basic implementation that displays current branch and
list of files of various status, but isn't as refined as its native
counterpart (e.g. does not say if we're ahead or behind the remote).
It's been helpful in the diagnostic of bug #347885.
Note that changes to CLIText.properties are not mingled with other
lines, as to preserve alphabetical order, but are kept together because
some padding alignment needs to be done across some of them. If later
on one needs to change a label, other labels will need to be changed
accordingly so that padding is respected.
Changes to CLIText.java are also kept together. It's less important to
keep them together in that file, but did so just because I kept them
together in the twin properties file.
