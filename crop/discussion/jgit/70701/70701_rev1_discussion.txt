DESCRIPTION

Make UploadPack observe exceptions reading refs

Now if refs are unreadable when serving an upload pack the handler
will fail due to the actual underlying failure. Previously all wants
would be rejected as invalid because Repository.getAllRefs() returned
an empty map.

Testing this required a new subclass of InMemoryRepository so that
an IOException could be injected at the correct time.
