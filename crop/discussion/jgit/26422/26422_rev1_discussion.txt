DESCRIPTION

Fix wrong Exception messages

In two places we threw an IOException and the message was build with 
JGitText.couldNotWriteFile. We specified 2 parameters, but this pattern
expects only one parameter. In both places we tried to rename a file,
that's why we wanted two parameters (src and target) for the exception
text.

I changed it to use JGitText.renameFileFailed which accepts two
parameters and fit's better.
