the OSGi manifest as the driver of the build.

I didn't intend to upload Shawn's patch again when pushing http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,161 which depends on this one.

At this point I actually quite prefer the maven-bundle-plugin approach used in If7938a86fb0cc8e25099028d832dbd38110b9124.

Unless somebody gives me a good reason not to, I'm going to abandon this change series, and switch to maven-bundle-plugin.

See If7938a86fb0cc8e25099028d832dbd38110b9124 for why.
