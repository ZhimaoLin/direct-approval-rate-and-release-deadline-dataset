DESCRIPTION

Simple dumb HTTP server for Git

This is a simple HTTP server that provides the minimum server side
support required for dumb (non-git aware) transport clients.

We produce the info/refs and objects/info/packs file on the fly
from the local repository state, but otherwise serve data as raw
files from the on-disk structure.

In the future we could better optimize the FileSender class and the
servlets that use it to take advantage of direct file to network
APIs in more advanced servlet containers like Jetty.

Our glue package borrows the idea of a micro embedded DSL from
Google Guice and uses it to configure a collection of Filters
and HttpServlets, all of which are matched against requests using
regular expressions.  If a subgroup exists in the pattern, it is
extracted and used for the path info component of the request.

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/FileResolver.java -> You can't use

  finally {
    db.close();
  }

here because that would decrement the close count no matter what, and then return to the caller a handle which would later be decremented a second time when the request completes.  Bad.

No, here we only want to decrement the close when we aren't going to complete normally, but have already incremented the open counter.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/FileResolver.java -> I think discussion on the C Git list has changed git-http-backend to use git-daemon-export-ok check here, just like git-daemon performs.  We should do the same thing by default.

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/FileResolver.java -> But such paths are absolute and thus rejected above. // is only a UNC marker at the beginning of a path.
We could possibly want to disallow double slashes anway since that's just sloppy path encodings. Change the comment to reflect what we are really doing here.
