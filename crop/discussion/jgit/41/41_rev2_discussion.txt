DESCRIPTION

Simple dumb HTTP server for Git

This is a horribly simple HTTP server which provides only the
server side support required for dumb transport clients.  We
produce the info/refs and objects/info/packs file on the fly
from the local repository state, but otherwise serve data as
raw files from disk.

We could better optimize the Sender class and those that use
it to take advantage of direct file to network APIs in more
advanced servlet containers like Jetty.  This is left for a
future improvement to the code.
