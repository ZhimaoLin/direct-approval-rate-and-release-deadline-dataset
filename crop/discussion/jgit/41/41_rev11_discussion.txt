DESCRIPTION

Simple dumb HTTP server for Git

This is a simple HTTP server that provides the minimum server side
support required for dumb (non-git aware) transport clients.

We produce the info/refs and objects/info/packs file on the fly
from the local repository state, but otherwise serve data as raw
files from the on-disk structure.

In the future we could better optimize the FileSender class and the
servlets that use it to take advantage of direct file to network
APIs in more advanced servlet containers like Jetty.

Our glue package borrows the idea of a micro embedded DSL from
Google Guice and uses it to configure a collection of Filters
and HttpServlets, all of which are matched against requests using
regular expressions.  If a subgroup exists in the pattern, it is
extracted and used for the path info component of the request.

Patch Set 11: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Gone through the code, looks OK, but haven't tested this myself.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/ObjectFileServlet.java -> Any reason not to put the parens in, as suggested last time? It can only help.
