DESCRIPTION

daemon: Add --ketch=LEADER flag

Experimental flag to turn on the KetchLeader within this daemon JVM.
This is a manually elected leader process, set from the command line.
Remote followers for each repository are configured per-repository
using remote sections with ketch-type = VOTER, e.g.:

  [remote "zone-a"]
    uri = https://zone-a.example.com/repo-name.git
    ketch-type = VOTER

  [remote "zone-b"]
    uri = https://zone-b.example.com/repo-name.git
    ketch-type = VOTER
