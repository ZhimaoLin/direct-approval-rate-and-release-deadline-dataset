DESCRIPTION

Let LockFile.unlock use FileUtils.delete()

On windows we face problems that the file .git/index.lock
sometimes can't deleted causing JGit operations to fail. Problem is
that LockFile.unlock() simply deletes the lockfile and ignores the
return value of File.delete(). This change proposes to use
FileUtils.delete() with retry option. This method will retry the
deletion of the file at most 10 times with sleeps inbetween.

Line:496, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/LockFile.java -> I think we should not hide this exception, if deleting the lock file fails, the next operation which needs the same lock will fail, hence I think we should rather fail early. I think it would also make sense to throw a checked exception to make the change in behavior explicit to all using applications though it's an API change then.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why does this file fail to delete on Windows? The calling thread is the only one that should be touching the .lock file. So what is causing the deletion to fail?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> see bug 335959, it seems that there is a good chance that an antivirus scanner would jump on the .lock file shortly after creation and cause the deletion to fail

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Bug: 335959 should be mentioned here

Line:496, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/LockFile.java -> I tried it out - but doing this API modification causes so many modifications already in JGit that it is worth his own proposal.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> There is one case inside SAP where I still investigate and where the process holding the file-handle is not from outside but from eclipse. 
Maybe some resource monitor, decorator, .... Investigations are not yet over - I'll keep you up to date.
