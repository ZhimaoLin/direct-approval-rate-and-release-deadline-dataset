DESCRIPTION

Treat RawText of binary data as file with one single line.

This avoids executing mergeAlgorithm.merge on binary data, which is
unlikely to be useful.

Arguably, binary data should not make it to
ResolveMerger#contentMerge, but this approach has the following
advantages:

* binary detection is exact, since it not only looks at the start of
  the blob.

* it is cheap, as we have to iterate over the bytes anyway to find
  '\n'.

Hi Zhen, 

Shawn thought binary data should be stopped earlier, but I thought this was a neat solution, which I wanted to show you.

I am not sure if will still runs comparisons on the bytes if all three blobs are binaries. If so, this is probably not ideal, since we would want to avoid looking at bytes of large blobs.

Line:652, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> Used ptr instead, but note that JGit has only one callsite, where ptr == 0.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
