DESCRIPTION

FetchCommand: pass on CredentialsProvider to submodule fetches

When a JGit API command is implemented in terms of other API
commands, the child command must "inherit" all relevant settings.
Calling configure() ensures that the CredentialsProvider and the
connection timeout are propagated correctly.
