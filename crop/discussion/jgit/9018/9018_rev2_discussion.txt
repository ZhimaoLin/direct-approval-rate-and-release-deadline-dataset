Patch Set 2:

I authored 100% of this patch and Google doesn't mind donating it to Eclipse under the Eclipse Distribution License (EDL, http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.html), which is a 3-clause BSD-style license. It depends on Id01146950bb9c18dae0169311e3cde2c3bfa675e, which is waiting on a contribution questionnaire.

Unlike ZIP files, tar files do not treat symlinks just as ordinary files with a different mode.  So tar supports involves  a little more code than would be ideal.
