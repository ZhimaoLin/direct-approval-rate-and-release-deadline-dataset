DESCRIPTION

Enforce max memory for DeltaWindow.

Previously, memory limits were enforced at the start of each iteration
of the delta search, based on objects that were currently loaded in
memory. However, new objects added to the window may be expanded in a
future iteration of the search and thus were not accounted for correctly
at the start of the search. To fix this, memory limits are now enforced
before each object is loaded.
