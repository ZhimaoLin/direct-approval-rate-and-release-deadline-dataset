DESCRIPTION

Fix handling of pushInsteadOf

According to [1], pushInsteadOf is

1. applied to the uris, not to the pushUris
2. ignored if a remote has an explicit pushUri

JGit applied it only to the pushUris. As a result, pushInsteadOf was
ignored for remotes having only a uri, but no pushUri.

This commit implements (1) if there are no pushUris. I did not dare
implement (2) because:

* there are explicit tests for it that expect that pushInsteadOf gets
  applied to existing pushUrls, and
* people may actually use and rely on this JGit behavior.
