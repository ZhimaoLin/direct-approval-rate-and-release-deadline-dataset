DESCRIPTION

Fix handling of pushInsteadOf

According to [1], pushInsteadOf is

1. applied to the uris, not to the pushUris
2. ignored if a remote has an explicit pushUri

JGit applied it only to the pushUris. As a result, pushInsteadOf was
ignored for remotes having only a uri, but no pushUri.

This commit implements (1) if there are no pushUris. I did not dare
implement (2) because:

* there are explicit tests for it that expect that pushInsteadOf gets
  applied to existing pushUrls, and
* people may actually use and rely on this JGit behavior.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we should also implement (2) since the current implementation doesn't comply with the documentation [1]

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> In this change or in a follow-up change? Can do either way.

It _is_ a potentially user-visible change; if some people had relied on it their pushes may suddenly fail (the uncritical case; they just have to fix their setup) or even still succeed but push to places they didn't expect (the critical case). So even if wrong, changing it may be risky. Maybe better in a follow-up change?

ok, let's do that in a followup change. We'll have to emphasize this fix in the release notes
