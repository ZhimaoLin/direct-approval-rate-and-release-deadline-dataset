DESCRIPTION

Remove unused org.apache.http.impl.client.cache requirement

The package is not used by the plugin and seems to be missing in the
platform anyway under some conditions, see bug 508321 (newer
org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient_4.5.2 does NOT include the package,
org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient_4.3.6 does).
