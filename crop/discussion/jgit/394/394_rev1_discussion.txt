Aside from the comments on the test, why not squash this into commit that fixes RawParseUtils?  I don't see a lot of code here so putting the fix in the same commit as the tests is practical.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> Please update the copyright statement to be accurate.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> Please put spaces after commas, and line-wrap closer to 80 characters.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> Would making this date a constant reduce the complexity of each of these tests?

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> What about the following cases:

 "Me xxx@xxx.xxx
 "<>"
 ""
 " <>"

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> Please use an explicit character encoding here to prevent odd platform defaults from breaking tests.  ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8 should be suitable for this test given the inputs above.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> Since this simply is about testing PersonIdent, please name this class accordingly.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils_MiscTest.java -> If you use Ecplise, use it's formatting capabilities. We have the settings for these
things in the projects.
