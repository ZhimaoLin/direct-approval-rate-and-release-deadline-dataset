DESCRIPTION

Introduce an abstraction for HTTP connections

Previously all HTTP communication was done with the help of
java.net.HttpUrlConnection. In order to make JGit usable in environments
where the direct usage of such connections is not allowed but where the
environment provides other means to get network connections an
abstraction for connections is introduced. The idea is that new
implementations of this interface will be introduced which will not use
java.net.HttpUrlConnection but use e.g.
org.apache.client.http.HttpClient to provide network connections.

One example: certain cloud infrastructures don't allow that components
in the cloud communicate directly with HttpUrlConnection. Instead they
provide services where a component can ask for a connection (given a
symbolic name for the destination) and where the infrastructure returns
a preconfigured org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. In order to allow
JGit to be running in such environments we need the abstraction
introduced in this commit.

- moved HTTP classes to their own package org.eclipse.jgit.transport.http
- moved configuration of HttpConnectionFactory up to HttpTransport to prevent that static initialization of Transport is broken

- this now works for us using an externally created Apache httpclient
- the change on top of this one still needs some improvements (though we don't need it for our internal use case). I'd like to also provide this as an option for EGit since httpclient has support for some additional authentication methods
