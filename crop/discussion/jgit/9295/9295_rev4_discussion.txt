DESCRIPTION

Make StashApplyCommand throw CheckoutConflictException

With this command we carry information about what file(s) caused
the conflict.

This changes the API somewhat into something that does not rely
on JGitInternalException. JGitInternalException is not really part
of the API, it's just an "oops, didn't think of that."
