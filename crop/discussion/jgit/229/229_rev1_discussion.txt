Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I generally don't like the fact that the JGit feature contains the tests. We generally package the tests in a separate feature.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

we don't need this anymore since we are now consuming org.eclipse.jgit.junit via Maven dependencies
