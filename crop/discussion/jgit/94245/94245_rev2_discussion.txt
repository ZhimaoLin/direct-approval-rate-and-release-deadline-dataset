DESCRIPTION

Add parseCommit(AnyObjectId) method to Repository.

It is quite common to want to parse a commit without already having a
RevWalk.  Provide a shortcut to do so to make it more convenient, and to
ensure that the RevWalk is released afterwards.

Line:1171, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I think we should also parse the commit even if it's already a RevCommit.  See [1] for use case.
