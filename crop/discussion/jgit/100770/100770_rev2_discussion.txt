DESCRIPTION

RefDirectory: Throw exception if CAS of packed ref list fails

The contents of the packedRefList AtomicReference should never differ
from what we expect prior to writing, because this segment of the code
is protected by the packed-refs lock file on disk. If it does happen,
whether due to programmer error or a rogue process not respecting the
locking protocol, it's better to let the caller know than to silently
drop the whole commit operation on the floor.

The existing concurrentOnlyOneWritesPackedRefs test is nondeterministic
as written. Fixing it is beyond the scope of this change, but I did
verify that it passes consistently with:

  bazel test --runs_per_test=200 //org.eclipse.jgit.test:org_eclipse_jgit_internal_storage_file_GcPackRefsTest
