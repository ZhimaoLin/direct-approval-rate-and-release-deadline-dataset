DESCRIPTION

RFC: RemoteConfig API change

This is not intended to be checked-in, but
intended to serve as basis for discussions on the
egit-dev mailing list!

RemoteConfig currently offers mass operations
for both the fetch- and push-URIs. However,
having more than one URI for a given set of
remote specifications does not make sense,
as the syntax of these remote specification(s) 
does only make sense for a given URI.

Since there should be at most one fetch- and
one push-URI per Remote, the API should be
changed to reflect this.

The methods to be removed are tagged as
deprecated in this change.
