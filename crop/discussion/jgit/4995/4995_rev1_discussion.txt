Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> just a comment: I thought a little bit whether it is ok to report a non-null newHead here. This merge command didn't do a new commit and also didn't touched HEAD - so why should it report something in newHead. Failing merges also report null as newHead But: in the ALREADY_UP_TO_DATE case we also report the old HEAD as newHead. Also javadocs for MergeResult.getNewHead() vote for youre proposal. So, ok for me.

Line:246, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> Don't we want to spent a new MergeStatus for this? Users of our API (e.g. EGit, jgit-pgm) may want to decide on MergeStatus what to report to the end-user. E.g. EGit can detect by MergeStatus whether the HEAD has moved or not (ALREADY_UP_TO_DATE vs. MERGED|FAST_FORWARD) and because of that other actions may be triggered (decoration,...) . But if we report MERGED as status we don't give the higher layers a chance to act properly.

Line:356, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> I would refer to either a merge man page or explain it a little bit that we prepare the next commit in index and working-tree. I guess a lot of users will missinterprete this because they know about the squash option in interactive rebase which has different results.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> please remove the trailing whitespace

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:246, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> Makes sense to me. What would that new status be: MERGED|SQUASHED or just SQUASHED?
