Patch Set 6: (2 inline comments)

Looks quite good to me. I only miss some tests for the right number of parents and for the deletion of the SQUASH_MSG file during commit.

Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> I would add a check that the resulting commit has one parent. That's an important fix.

Line:291, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> I would also add somewhere a test that the commit command will delete the SQUASH_MSG file after it has succesfully commited. If the commit command doesn't delete this file nobody will do it and every further commit will have the same prefilled commit message as listed int SQASH_MSG
