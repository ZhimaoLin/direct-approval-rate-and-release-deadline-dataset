DESCRIPTION

Add "--squash" option to MergeCommand

Return an EnumSet<MergeStatus> from
MergeResult#getMergeStatus(). In case of a squashed
merge the set is going to consist of
MergeResult.SQUASHED and the actual merge result
(MERGED or FAST_FORWARD).

Patch Set 3:

Returning a Set from MergeResult#getMergeStatus() breaks the API. This not only made the patch twice as long (with all those changes in tests) but it's going to require few lines in EGit to be updated. Of course, this is only true, if the proposed change makes any sense to you.

Line:283, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeResult.java -> On second thought, maybe I should stick to simple Set here.

Christian any comment on the latest patch set, it would really help me out.

Patch Set 3:

Sorry for the late answer. Now it's not clear to me why we would need a EnumSet here. MergeResult should either be MERGED, FAST_FORWARD or SQUASHED. We should never make a distinction between SQUASHED|MERGED and SQUASHED|FAST_FORWARD because SQUASHED_FAST_FORWARD should never occur. Whenever I call "git merge --squash" in native git in a fast-forward situation native git will tell me "(nothing to squash)Already up-to-date". In a fast-forward situation there is no difference in the result if you specify --squash or not, it's a NOP and git will do nothing.
No need for a new status or even switching from returning a status to a set of states.

I beg to differ. After executing the following set of commands:

mkdir merge-ff-squash-test;
cd merge-ff-squash-test;
git init;
echo "master" > master;
git add master;
git commit -a -m "master";
git checkout -b branch;
echo "branch" > branch;
git add branch;
git commit -a -m "branch";
git checkout master;
git merge --squash branch;

I get:

$ git merge --squash branch
Updating adfeb0a..e233dcf
Fast-forward
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
 branch |    1 +
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 branch

I even have a test for a similar scenario, see o.e.jgit.api.MergeCommandTest.testSquashFastForward()
