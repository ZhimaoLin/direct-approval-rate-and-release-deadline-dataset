DESCRIPTION

DfsFsck: refactor pack verify into its own method

This simplifies the logic about allocation of the DfsReader, and
clarifies the code considerably by using smaller scopes with less
intentation.

A few static imports from PackExt and slightly shorter variable names
make for a more understandable-at-glance implementation.
