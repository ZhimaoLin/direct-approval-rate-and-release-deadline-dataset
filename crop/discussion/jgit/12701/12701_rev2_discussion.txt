DESCRIPTION

Fix CommitCommand not to destroy repo

There was a severe bug in CommitCommand which could lead to corrupt
repos. When merging an annotated tag the JGit MergeCommand writes
correctly the ID of the tag (and not the id of the commit the tag was
pointing to) into MERGE_HEAD. Native git does the same. But
CommitCommand was reading this file and trusting blindly that it will
contain only IDs of commits. Then the CommitCommand would create a
commit which has as parent a non-commit object (the tag object). That's
so corrupt that even native git gives up when you call "git log" in
such a repo.
To reproduce that with EGit simply right-click on a tag in the
Repository View and select Merge. The result was a corrupt repo!

Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> I think it would be better not to declare the RevWalk as a member in order to make clear that it's only valid during execution of call(). So better construct it there and pass it as an explicit parameter to the methods needing it (createTemporaryIndex() and processOptions())

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/could lead to corrupt/could corrupt/

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/would create/created/

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: either add a blank line to make clear this is a new paragraph or don't break the line here
