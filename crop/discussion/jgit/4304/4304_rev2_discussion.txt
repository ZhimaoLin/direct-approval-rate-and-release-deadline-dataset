DESCRIPTION

Support providing an id for submodule entries.

Adds a method that can be overridden to WorkingTreeIterator that
allows subclasses to provide a byte array representing the id of
a submodule entry.  FileTreeIterator overrides this method and
provides the HEAD commit of the submodule repository.
