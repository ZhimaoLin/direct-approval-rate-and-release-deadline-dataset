DESCRIPTION

Disallow quotes in Ref names.

Quotes (") can be used in the command line to "continue" commands
across line breaks and such, but it is not possible to create a branch
containing a quote in it's name.
Trying to do this with the EGit UI results in a RuntimeException
anyway, but the user should be notified about this immediately.
This was found while working on bug 318249, but it doesn't directly
fix this bug.
