DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Permit flushing progress messages under smart HTTP

If UploadPack invokes flush() on the output stream we pass it, its
most likely the progress messages coming down the side band stream.
As pack generation can take a while, we want to push that down
at the client as early as we can, to keep the connection alive,
and to let the user know we are still working on their behalf.

Ensure we dump the temporary buffer whenever flush() is invoked,
otherwise the messages don't get sent in a timely fashion to the
user agent (in this case, git fetch).

We specifically don't implement flush() for ReceivePack right now,
as that protocol currently does not provide progress messages to
the user, but it does invoke flush several times, as the different
streams include '0000' type flush-pkts to denote various end points.
