DESCRIPTION

Remove empty iterator from TreeWalk

Its confusing that a new TreeWalk() needs to have reset() invoked
on it before addTree().  This is a historical accident caused by
how TreeWalk was abused within ObjectWalk.

Drop the initial empty tree from the TreeWalk and thus remove a
number of pointless reset() operations from unit tests and some of
the internal JGit code.

Existing application code which is still calling reset() will simply
be incurring a few unnecessary field assignments, but they should
consider cleaning up their code in the future.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

looks fine to me. I always wondered why we have this reset() everywhere
