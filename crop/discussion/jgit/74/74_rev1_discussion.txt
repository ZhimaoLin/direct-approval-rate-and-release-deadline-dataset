Patch Set 1: Do not submit; No score

We're unlikely to do this refactoring.  The cq-mavenize branch was started in jgit for a different refactoring of the Maven build, and then Chris pointed out we don't use Maven at Eclipse.  So I'm waiting to see what Chris comes up with using Eclipse's native releng tools before we move forward with either concept.
