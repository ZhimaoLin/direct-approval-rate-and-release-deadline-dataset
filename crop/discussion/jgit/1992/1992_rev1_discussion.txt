DESCRIPTION

Avoid unnecessary decoding of length in PackFile

If the object type is a whole object and all we want is the type,
there is no need to skip the length header.  The type is already known
and can be returned as-is.  Instead skip the length header only for
the two delta formats, where the delta base must itself be scanned.
