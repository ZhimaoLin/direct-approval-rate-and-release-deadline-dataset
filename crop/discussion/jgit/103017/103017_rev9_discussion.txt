DESCRIPTION

Support symbolic references in ReceiveCommand

Allow creating symbolic references with link, and deleting them or
switching to ObjectId with unlink.  How this happens is up to the
individual RefDatabase.

The default implementation detaches RefUpdate if a symbolic reference
is involved, supporting these command instances on RefDirectory.
Unfortunately the packed-refs file does not support storing symrefs,
so atomic transactions involving more than one symref command are
failed early.

Updating InMemoryRepository is deferred until reftable lands, as I
plan to switch InMemoryRepository to use reftable for its internal
storage representation.

Seems to be missing most of the changes marked "done" in PS8 (e.g., the code in PS8 matches PS9 and I assume that's not intended).

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is still not set to the original author. You can fix it and apply the other changes you made by running

 git commit -a --amend --author='Yoselin Hanna xxx@xxx.xxx
