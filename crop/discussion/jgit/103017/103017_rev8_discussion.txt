DESCRIPTION

Support symbolic references in ReceiveCommand

Allow creating symbolic references with link, and deleting them or
switching to ObjectId with unlink.  How this happens is up to the
individual RefDatabase.

The default implementation detaches RefUpdate if a symbolic reference
is involved, supporting these command instances on RefDirectory.
Unfortunately the packed-refs file does not support storing symrefs,
so atomic transactions involving more than one symref command are
failed early.

Updating InMemoryRepository is deferred until reftable lands, as I
plan to switch InMemoryRepository to use reftable for its internal
storage representation.

mthai: Taking over this change to address review comments.

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Other rejection reasons (e.g. lockError) are localized --- should this one be, too?

Line:215, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> ; or .?

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> nit: unnecessary "final" (and likewise for the others)

Same question for the others.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:406, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> In our experience the only need to override these is to support symbolic links, which this change is adding. So eventually we could clean up the other ctor's to be private, but that has to be done over a major release.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:406, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> Ok. Should these be private or package-private? I.e. is it intended to allow child classes to call them?
