DESCRIPTION

Consistently fail work tree methods on bare repositories

If the working tree isn't available, it doesn't make any sense to
obtain the merge heads, or the buffered commit message.  The
repository shouldn't have a partial merge state to read.  Throw back
the same exception we do when invoking getWorkDir() on a bare
repository instance.
