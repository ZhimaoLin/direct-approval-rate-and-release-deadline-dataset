DESCRIPTION

Add a method to ObjectInserter to read back inserted objects

In the DFS implementation, flushing an inserter writes a new pack to
the storage system and is potentially very slow, but was the only way
to ensure previously-inserted objects were available. For some tasks,
like performing a series of three-way merges, the total size of all
inserted objects may be small enough to avoid flushing the in-memory
buffered data. DfsOutputStream already provides a read method to read
back from the not-yet-flushed data, so use this to provide an
ObjectReader in the DFS case.

In the file-backed case, objects are written out loosely on the fly,
so the implementation can just return the existing WindowCursor.

Line:399, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> OK so we can't break the API, and we can't change the version number. Here is another version:

  public ObjectReader newReader() {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
  }

Instead of declaring it as an abstract method, tell callers its an optional method that throws UnsupportedOperationException if the implementor is unable to implement the JGit API.

My other alternative is to fork JGit and start a new project where we can actually make API changes more often than once every 12 months.

PTAL

Line:399, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> I didn't quite do this, but let me know if you'd still prefer UnsupportedOperationException to what I have now.
