DESCRIPTION

Add a method to ObjectInserter to read back inserted objects

In the DFS implementation, flushing an inserter writes a new pack to
the storage system and is potentially very slow, but was the only way
to ensure previously-inserted objects were available. For some tasks,
like performing a series of three-way merges, the total size of all
inserted objects may be small enough to avoid flushing the in-memory
buffered data. DfsOutputStream already provides a read method to read
back from the not-yet-flushed data, so use this to provide an
ObjectReader in the DFS case.

In the file-backed case, objects are written out loosely on the fly,
so the implementation can just return the existing WindowCursor.

Line:411, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> This is a very annoying signature that we are going to have to live with. *sigh*

Line:402, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> Given that we cached the block in memory here, its a shame we have to read back a partial segment below.

Line:465, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> db.newReader. Make it clear we are using the db to get the reader in case someone later writes newReader to "return new Reader()".

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> IIRC this fails on our DFS when position is not aligned to a block size and the file is still being written.

Topic set to inserter-reader

Teach ObjectInserter to read back inserted objects, and use this where possible instead of aggressively flushing.
