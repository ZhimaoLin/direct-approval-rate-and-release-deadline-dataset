DESCRIPTION

Add a method to ObjectInserter to read back inserted objects

In the DFS implementation, flushing an inserter writes a new pack to
the storage system and is potentially very slow, but was the only way
to ensure previously-inserted objects were available.  For some tasks,
like performing a series of three-way merges, the total size of all
inserted objects may be small enough to avoid flushing the in-memory
buffered data.

DfsOutputStream already provides a read method to read back from the
not-yet-flushed data, so use this to provide an ObjectReader in the
DFS case.

In the file-backed case, objects are written out loosely on the fly,
so the implementation can just return the existing WindowCursor.

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> I would have been ok with two consecutive anonymous classes in the same method, it was just the nesting I was having trouble with :)

Given that you've factored it out, it should probably be static.

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> It needs a reference to the packOut. Do you want me to explicitly add a reference to the enclosing DfsInserter? Or pass in the packOut to the constructor?

Its likely cleaner as its own named class, rather than being anonymous in the constructing method. So I am actually happier with it being hoisted out and named.

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> Ack, missed the packOut reference.
