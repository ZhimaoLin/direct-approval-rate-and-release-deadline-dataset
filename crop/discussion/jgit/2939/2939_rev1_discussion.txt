DESCRIPTION

Fix broken git prefix detection

If JGit got a cygwin path it would fail to resolve directories
relative to it.

Also add system property to debug problems with the FS utilities.
Enable debug using -Djgit.fs.debug=1

Furthermore use -Djgit.gitprefix=<path> to set the git prefix
manually.

Minor nits, the fix looks correct.

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Typo on the name? Shouldn't this be overrideGitPrefix?

Should we use SystemReader.getInstance().getProperty() rather than System.getProperty()?
