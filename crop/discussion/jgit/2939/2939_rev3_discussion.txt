DESCRIPTION

Fix broken git prefix detection

If JGit got a cygwin path it would fail to resolve directories
relative to it.

Also add system property to debug problems with the FS utilities.
Enable debug using -Djgit.fs.debug=1

Furthermore use -Djgit.gitprefix=<path> to set the git prefix
manually.
