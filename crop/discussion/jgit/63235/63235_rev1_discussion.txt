DESCRIPTION

TreeFormatter: fsck all trees before insertion

DirCacheBuilder and DirCacheEditor can be misused to create trees that
are corrupt e.g. by containing duplicate entry names differing by
only by mode (tree vs.  symlink).

Disallow these corrupt trees from entering a repository by running
fsck on every tree before insertion.

Abandoned

Can't fsck at this level as IndexDiffTest depends on corruption to pass, as does DirCacheCheckoutMaliciousPathTest.
