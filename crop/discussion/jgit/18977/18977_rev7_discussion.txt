DESCRIPTION

Do not allow non-ff-rebase if there are uncommitted changes

With this change jgit checks for uncommitted changes before a rebase is
started. This is also done by native git. One reason is that an abort
would override such changes. The check is skipped for a non-interactive
rebase when it will result in a fast-forward. In this case there can be
only checkout conflicts but no merge conflicts, so there cannot be an
abort which overrides uncommitted changes.
