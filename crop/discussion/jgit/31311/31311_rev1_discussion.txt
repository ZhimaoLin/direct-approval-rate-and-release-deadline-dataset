DESCRIPTION

RecursiveMerger: do not insert virtual commits into repository

When merging common ancestors to create a single virtual common
ancestor the commit does not need to be inserted into the Git
repository. Instead just mock it out in memory as part of the
merger's RevWalk pool.

Now watch, something in Gerrit is going to be depending on reading back the synthetic commit from a different RevWalk...

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> Document that it may exist only in the RevWalk, not the repository.

Line:240, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> Heh, I didn't know you could do this.

Line:243, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> Making the author stable is orthogonal to switching to RevCommit.parse, maybe mention it in the commit message?
