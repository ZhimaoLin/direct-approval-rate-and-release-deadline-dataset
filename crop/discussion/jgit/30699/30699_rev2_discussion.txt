DESCRIPTION

Remove overlapping submodules from repo manifest.

Apparently repo allows projects overlapping, e.g. one project's path is "foo"
and another project's path is "foo/bar". This is not supported in git submodule.
At JGit repo side we'll skip all the submodules that are in subdirectories of
other submodules, and on repo side we'll make them submodules to resolve this
problem.
