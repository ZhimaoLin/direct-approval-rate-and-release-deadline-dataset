Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks good but can you please return 'this' in the setter?

Also, in your commit message, please add 

'Change-Id: Id9713a4849c772e030fca23dd64b993264f28366'

So when you amend your commit, Gerrit knows that it's this changeset to append the change too. It's in our contributor guide :)

Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Can you return 'this' like the other setters?
