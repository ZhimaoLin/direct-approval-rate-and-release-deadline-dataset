DESCRIPTION

Improve BatchRefUpdateTest readability

* Factor out helpers for setting up and executing updates.
* Use common assert methods, with a special enum type that papers over
  the fact that there is no ReceiveCommand.Result for transaction
  aborted.
* Static import ReceiveCommand.Type constants.
* Add blank lines to separate repo setup, update execution, and asserts.
