Line:410, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Would mention this in the documentation of the params, that they can be null to mean empty tree. Same below.

Line:446, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Please, DRY. Extract this into a method and call it two times, it's quite hard to read like this.
