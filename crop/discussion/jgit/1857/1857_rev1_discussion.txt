DESCRIPTION

Implemented the git add commandline command.

Implementation delegates all work to the AddCommand class and,
therefore, supports only those options currently supported by the
AddCommand which means: --update and the filepattern... arguments.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.TextBuiltin
contains more changes than necessary. However, this is a consequence of sorting this file by the property key and the
fact that the file wasn't completely sorted before this 
change.
