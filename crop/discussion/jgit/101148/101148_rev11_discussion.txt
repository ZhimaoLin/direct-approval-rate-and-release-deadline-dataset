DESCRIPTION

reftable: scan and lookup reftable files

ReftableReader provides sequential scanning support over all
references, a range of references within a subtree (such as
"refs/heads/"), and lookup of a single reference.  Reads can be
accelerated by an index block, if it was created by the writer.

The BlockSource interface provides an abstraction to read from the
reftable's backing storage, supporting a future commit to connect
to JGit DFS and the DfsBlockCache.
