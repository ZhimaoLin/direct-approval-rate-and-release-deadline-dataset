I know the change has been merged ... but it would break backward compatibility with existing JGit applications.

The URIish basic auth credentials are broken after this change (see my comment on the point where this happens).

It would be great if we could revert that "default behaviour" that breaks backward compatibility.

Line:268, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> This is actually evil and breaks backward compatibility :-O
See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/t_yYD2IGYS0

The password in the URIish (that was used to work before as credential for HTTP BasicAuth) would not be used anymore and there's no way to use it as the credential provider would not be null anymore (as it is getting always replaced with NetRCCredentialsProvider.

Moreover the NetRCCredentialsProvider is used as well if the user has no .netrc at all :-O which is wrong IMHO.

Patch Set 8:

I introduced netrc read credentials from .netrc because it is a default behaviour of git command line.

I did not know about URIish.

I think the right choose would be having several credential providers connected at the same time, not just one. Or having a fallback adapter as .netrc.

Patch Set 8:

Hi Alexey,
I think your change is good *BUT* is breaking the existing functionality.

Specifically the existing (before your change) functionality on HttpAuthMethod was:
- when there is no credentials provider configured (null)
- then extract the password from URIish (the URI-style JGit object) 

This is as well the curl default behaviour when you don't have a ~/.netrc file.
Even if you have a ~/.netrc file the user/password passed in the URL has always the precedence over a ~/.netrc file as well ... so possibly is something you need to include in your case.

I find the ~/.netrc a "good change" but just a bit problematic when included as "default" credential provider :-(
