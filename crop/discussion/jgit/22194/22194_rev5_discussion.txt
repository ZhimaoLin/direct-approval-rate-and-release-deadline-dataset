Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/NetRC.java -> Are you sure you don't want FS.userHome()? (just asking....)

Isn't _netrc for Windows only?

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/NetRC.java -> 1) I did not know about FS.userHome. Thanks to let me know.

If it possible we can keep this file non jgit dependent, so others can use it some where else...

2) _netrc - for Windows only, you are right.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/NetRC.java -> It's more important that it is correct than re-usable as-is. Anyone can link with JGit. So the question is whether the property user.home is the correct one or if something like FS.userHome is needed to provide compatibility with msysgit/curl. FS.userHome is there for two reasons. One is to make JGit compatible with Git for Windows, the other one is to provide compatibility with cygwin.
