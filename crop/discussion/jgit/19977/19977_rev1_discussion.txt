DESCRIPTION

Revert "Fix for core.autocrlf=input resulting in modified file..."

This reverts commit 1def0a1257d32bce08e751242733cda3b2036cb8.

We found this fix uncovers problems with unsmudged DirCacheEntry's. This
surfaced because egit's ui test CreatePatchActionTest failed since jgit
computes a wrong status. JGit doesn't detect modified content in now
unsmudged entries. Hence revert this change until these problems are
fixed.
