DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: Accept shallow lines from Git >= 1.9

In Git 1.9 (5dbd767601 "support pushing from a shallow clone")
the git-core project intentionally broke the existing send-pack
protocol from shallow clients.

Shallow clients now transmit their shallow information during push,
ahead of the old-new command sequence. JGit must accept these lines
when presented.

Line:782, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> What happens when the client pushes from a branch with shallow commits that the server doesn't have? E.g., what should happen if I do

 git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base
 cd base
 ... hack hack hack, including making some commits

 cd ..
 git clone --depth=1 file://$(pwd)/base base-clone
 cd base-clone
 git push https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base HEAD:somewhere

Line:782, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Depends on the server configuration.

If the server has fsck enabled, connectivity checking will fail. The server will barf and nothing goes wrong.

If the server has fsck off (default, yay!), the server repository will be corrupted. Note this is the old behavior. We haven't really fixed the bug.
