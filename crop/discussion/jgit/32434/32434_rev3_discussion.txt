DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: Accept shallow lines from Git >= 1.9

In Git 1.9 (5dbd767601 "support pushing from a shallow clone")
the git-core project intentionally broke the existing send-pack
protocol from shallow clients.

Shallow clients now transmit their shallow information during push,
ahead of the old-new command sequence. JGit must accept these lines
when presented.

To protect the server against clients sending partial history,
require the connectivity check when pushed to by a shallow client.

Makes sense. Thanks.

Line:939, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> git receive-pack isn't this permissive, but I don't mind.

Line:939, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Heh. Right so. receive-pack says the line is 48 long. Its actually 49 long because we use readStringRaw() above which includes the undocumented LF.
