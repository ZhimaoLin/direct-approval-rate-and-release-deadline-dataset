DESCRIPTION

Fix CheckoutCommand to return updated files even on NONDELETED status

CheckoutCommand was not returning updated and removed files in case of
an overall status of NONDELETED. That's status which occurs especially
on the Windows platform when Checkout wanted to delete files but the
filesystem doesn't allow this. The situation is more seldom on linux/mac
because open filehandles don't stop a deletion attempt and checkout
succeeds more often.

Looks good to me.

But note that in order to do something about EGit bug 500106, we'd need similar information from all other callers of DirCacheCheckout (rebase, reset --hard, cherrypick, ...). Or JGit firing an event with that information. To avoid doing global refreshes of projects EGit basically would need a way to know more precisely which files were touched.

Patch Set 1:

I agree. This change only fixes a bug (in my eyes) in CheckoutCommand. CheckoutCommand was not doing what it promised (e.g. returning a list of updated files). Therefore I'll merge that now. For a complete (maybe event based mechanism) to tell upper layers about worktree modifications we need more. If you think of a rebase operation there are so many operations which could update the worktree (the initial reset to the base, each of the cherry-picks) that it would be hard to present all that in the return value of the RebaseCommand.call() method. And other complicated situations: how to differentiate between worktree file updates which jgit initiates (e.g. because jgit is merging and persisting the new merged content in the worktree; or jgit is checking out a commit and therefore updates files) or when jgit detects that files have been modified because of external modifications to worktreefiles (e.g. jgit want's to checkout but can't because it dectects of of the files is dirty). Own feature request in bugzilla?
