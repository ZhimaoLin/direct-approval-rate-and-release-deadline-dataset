DESCRIPTION

Cloning should fail when destination directory exists and is not empty

In msysgit, when I try to clone into a folder that already
contains a cloned repository it will fail with a message "fatal:
destination path 'folder' already exists and is not an empty
directory.". I would expect JGit to throw an exception with a similar
message in that case.
