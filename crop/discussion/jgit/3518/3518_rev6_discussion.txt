DESCRIPTION

Cloning should fail when destination directory exists and is not empty

In msysgit, when I try to clone into a folder that already
contains a cloned repository it will fail with a message "fatal:
destination path 'folder' already exists and is not an empty
directory.". Now JGit throws a JGitInternalException if the folder to
clone into exists and is not empty.

Test case provided by Clay Cameron.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I took out the refactoring part and put it into a new parent commit.
