DESCRIPTION

Cloning should fail when destination directory exists and is not empty

In msysgit, when I try to clone into a folder that already
contains a cloned repository it will fail with a message "fatal:
destination path 'folder' already exists and is not an empty
directory.". Now JGit throws a JGitInternalException if the folder to
clone into exists and is not empty.

Test case provided by Clay Cameron.
