DESCRIPTION

Cloning should fail when destination directory exists and is not empty

When trying to clone into a folder that already contains a cloned
repository native git will fail with a message "fatal: destination path
'folder' already exists and is not an empty directory.". Now JGit will
also fail in this situation throwing a JGitInternalException.

The test case was provided by Clay Cameron.
