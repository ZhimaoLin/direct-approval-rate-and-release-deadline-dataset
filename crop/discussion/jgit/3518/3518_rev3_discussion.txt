DESCRIPTION

Cloning should fail when destination directory exists and is not empty

In msysgit, when I try to clone into a folder that already
contains a cloned repository it will fail with a message "fatal:
destination path 'folder' already exists and is not an empty
directory.". I would expect JGit to throw an exception with a similar
message in that case.

Test case provided by Clay Cameron.

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> you could add an else statement here - the check is not necessary if the directory was newly created

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Please just throw the Exception.

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/InitCommandTest.java -> Please just throw the Exception.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please state what's in here, e.g. "Now JGit throws..."
