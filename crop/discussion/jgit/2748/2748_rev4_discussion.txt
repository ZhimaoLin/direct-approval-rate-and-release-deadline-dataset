DESCRIPTION

smart HTTP: Return errors inside payload

When the client is clearly making a smart HTTP request to our smart
HTTP server, return any errors like RepositoryNotFoundException or
ServiceNotEnabledException inside of the payload as a Git level ERR
message, rather than an HTTP error code.

This prevents the C Git command line client from retrying a failed
"$URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack" request without the smart
service URL, only to fail again with "403 Forbidden" when the dumb
as-is service has been disabled by the server configuration, or is
unavailable because the repository is not on the local filesystem.
