DESCRIPTION

Fix CommitCommand to be able to skip writing to RefLog

CommitCommand already provided a method to set the comment which should
be written into the reflog. The underlying RefUpdate class supported to
skip writing a reflog entry. But through the CommitCommand API it was
not possible to prevent writing a reflog entry. Fix this and allow
creating commits which don't occur in the reflog.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:263, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> this is the same as

 if (reflogComment != null || reflogComment == null)

so it seems you can't reach the else branch anymore which is breaking the automatic reflog

Line:462, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> this method doesn't need to be public

Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:263, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> You overlooked the 99% case where nobody calls setReflogComment() at all. Then reflogComment is null and noReflogComment false and we reach the else branch. 

"noReflogComment" is set to true only when somebody explicitly expresses not to write a reflog by calling setReflogComment(null).

I'll propose change with the the flag renamed to "useDefaultReflogMessage" to make it more clearer.

Line:462, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> Done
