DESCRIPTION

Implement git config -> .gitmodules fallback for url and update

According to [1], submodule settings in $GIT_DIR/config override
settings from .gitmodules. In the repo config, one can set url,
update, branch, fetchRecurseSubmodules, and ignore.[2] JGit currently
implements only url and update in SubmoduleWalk. For those, implement
this fallback such that the value from .gitmodules is returned if
none is defined in the repo config, and adapt tests accordingly.
