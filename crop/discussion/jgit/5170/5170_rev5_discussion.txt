DESCRIPTION

Expose an OutputStream from ReceivePack for sending client messages

Callers may want to format and flush their own output, for example in a
PreReceiveHook that creates its own TextProgressMonitor. The actual
underlying msgOut can change over the lifetime of ReceivePack, so we
implement a small wrapper.
