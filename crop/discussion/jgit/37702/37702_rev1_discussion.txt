DESCRIPTION

Fix DirCacheCheckout to set correct file length if core.autocrlf=true

To update the file length stat we need to use the length of the
temporary file since it's not yet renamed to the target file name here.
The incorrect file length stat update was introduced in
a606dc363d0f6b09e4527cca6b645d3cb1ec407d.

Line:1250, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> That's such a severe bug I am wondering why no unit test found it. We need one.
