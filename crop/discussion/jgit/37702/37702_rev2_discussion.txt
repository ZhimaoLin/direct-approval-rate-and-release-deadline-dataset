DESCRIPTION

Fix DirCacheCheckout to set correct file length if core.autocrlf=true

To update the file length stat we need to use the length of the
temporary file since it's not yet renamed to the target file name here.
The incorrect file length stat update was introduced in
a606dc363d0f6b09e4527cca6b645d3cb1ec407d.

Line:514, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommandTest.java -> on my Mac with a filesystem timestamp resolution of 1 sec it needs 610 testFiles to reach a non-smudged entry

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommandTest.java -> this test can reproduce the problem and prove that the fix works but it's hard to configure in a way so that it covers the problem on different platforms/hardware configuration, this is due to the racy git problem which may hide the problem by smudging index entries.

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommandTest.java -> I agree. I'll disable the test by removing xxx@xxx.xxx tag. When we finally found a solution how to control smudging during test we can enable it again.
