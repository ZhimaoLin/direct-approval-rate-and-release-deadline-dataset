DESCRIPTION

dfs reftable: Move BlockSource to common internal.storage.io package

This simple refactoring makes it a bit more clear to connect DFS
ReadableChannel to BlockSource for reftable.  Its also a start of what
may eventually be a cleanup of DFS to remove ReadableChannel in favor
of only BlockSource.

In the interim, build a BlockSource from(ReadableChannel) bridge.
