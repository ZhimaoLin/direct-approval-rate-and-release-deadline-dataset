DESCRIPTION

Declare internal flag accessors of ObjectToPack final

None of these methods should ever be overridden at runtime by an
extension class. Given how small they are the JIT should perform
inlining where reasonable. Hint this is possible by marking all
methods final so its clear no replacement can be loaded later on.
