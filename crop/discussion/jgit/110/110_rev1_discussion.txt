I'm confused.  What is the value of this change?  Is it a
refactoring that you are intending to build upon later so
Windows users can have ~/ssh rather than ~/.ssh?  If so,
how are we going to change the name to "ssh" on Windows
if the string is a constant?

Sorry for confusion, Shawn. Actually I didn't expect for a quick feedback ;-)

> What is the value of this change?

I've found this when investigating a bug #294619 and decided it makes sense to replace couple of new File()s with a  method in a factory. Bug #294619 was closed as invalid because it's an Eclipse's bug (or feature) and I don't see how it can be fixed properly in EGit/JGit. I agree that 'Bug: 294619' in the comment is useless, it's a leftover from the original comment in my local repository.

The bottom line: it's just a small refactoring, may be with a little or no value at.

Given that this is a tiny refactoring with fairly little value in the long term (over the code we already have), I'm inclined to suggest we don't submit it.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Consensus seems to be, this isn't a worthwhile change at this point in time.  So dropping it for now.
