DESCRIPTION

Do not rely on filemode differences in case of symbolic links

When checking whether a file in the working tree has been modified -
WorkingTreeIterator.isModified() - we should not trust the filemode
in case of symbolic links, but check the timestamp and also the
content, if requested. Without this fix symlinks will always be shown
in EGit as modified files on Windows systems.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Minor nit about how to do the compare, but otherwise this looks OK.

Line:561, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> This is more efficient:

  !FileMode.SYMLINK.equals(entry.getRawMode())

The issue is, getFileMode() has to test a number of FileMode constants to see which one it matches... after it called getRawMode() to get the integer value.  Testing the integer value against FileMode.SYMLINK only will save some compares.
