DESCRIPTION

Do not rely on filemode differences in case of symbolic links

When checking whether a file in the working tree has been modified -
WorkingTreeIterator.isModified() - we should not trust the filemode
in case of symbolic links, but check the timestamp and also the
content, if requested. Without this fix symlinks will always be shown
in EGit as modified files on Windows systems.
