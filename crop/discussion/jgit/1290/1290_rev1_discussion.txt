Looks good, but would prefer IgnoreFilter refactored out.

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Can you move this to a public class in the 'org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.filter' package? This may be useful for other clients.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> I agree with Chris, please move this to the treewalk.filter package as its own top-level class.  You'll need to add an int argument to the constructor so the caller can pass the index of the WORKDIR tree into the filter.

Also, a better name might be NotIgnoredFilter since it selects entries that are not ignored.

Line:274, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Style-nit:  I would prefer this to be:

  return !workingTreeIterator.isEntryIgnored();

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Style-nit: We don't usually put the else here.  Just end the block, fall through and return:

  if (workingTreeIterator != null) {
  ...
  }
  return true;

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:281, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> This should be false, not true.  We don't have to dive into a subtree in order to properly evaluate the ignored status of any given entry.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> This filter is immutable once created, so clone can simply return this.
