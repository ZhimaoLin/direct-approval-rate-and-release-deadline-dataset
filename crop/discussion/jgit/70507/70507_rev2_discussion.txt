DESCRIPTION

Added filter for merge and non-merges commits.

Added the option to retrieve either merges or  non-merges commits in the
LogCommand. Additionally, I added a OnlyMergersFilter inner class as a
sibling of NoMergesFilter class in the RevFilter.

You can add it to this commit, just implement the tests, git add to stage the new tests and then commit --amend to replace the current commit with the new one
