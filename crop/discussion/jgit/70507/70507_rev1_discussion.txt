please add tests

Line:150, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/RevFilter.java xxx@xxx.xxx 4.4

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> style nit: remove this unnecessary blank line you added

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> style nit: missing braces

Line:360, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> s/Returns only commit/Only log commits/

Line:367, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> wrong since tag, we are now heading for 4.4

@since 4.4

Line:384, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> I think we should use a single method for both since setting both filters on the same command instance doesn't make sense

So how about adding a single method called setRevFilter(RevFilter) ?
