DESCRIPTION

dfs: support reading reftables through DfsBlockCache

avoding copying between the DfsBlockCache and the BlockReader
instances used by ReftableReader.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReftable.java -> Can this be changed to "rc", same as the variable name for ReadableChannel in BlockBasedFile?

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReftable.java -> Should we call super.blockSize(ch) here to ensure that BlockBasedFile.blocksize field is properly set?

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReftable.java -> It could be, but I don't want to respin the entire series just for that.

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReftable.java -> No, its done automatically by the DfsBlockCache calling to readOneBlock.
