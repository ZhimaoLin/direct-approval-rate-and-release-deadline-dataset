DESCRIPTION

Make binaryFileThreshold behave as documented

The parameter binaryFileThreshold was only relevant when a file could
not fit in a byte array. Make it so that it is possible to set a
threshold smaller than the size of a byte array.

it's too late to accept this for 3.6 since the 3.6 IP log has already been approved and we can't amend it until next week, so push this change to ref/for/master
