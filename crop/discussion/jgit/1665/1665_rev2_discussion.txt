DESCRIPTION

Shut up findbugs/protect the shutdownHook in LocalDiskRepositoryTestcase

Singleton references should be protected from multiple threads. As far as we
know this cannot happen as JUnit is used today since we currently don't run
tests in parallel, but now this code will not prevent anyone.
