could you add a test demonstrating how to use the runner ?

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/EmbeddedCommandRunner.java -> missing since tag

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> move the bug number to footer

Patch Set 1:

The EmbeddedCommandRunner is mostly an example of leveraging the other commits.  I thought it was reusable so I added it, but it's quite hard/uninteresting to demo it without actually embedding it in something.
There's a single no arg constructor and a single public method, so the use should be pretty straightforward.

The only code i have is the following:
  https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=mina-sshd.git;a=blob_plain;f=sshd-git/src/main/java/org/apache/sshd/git/GitCommand.java;hb=HEAD

which translates to:
  new EmbeddedCommandRunner().execute(args, in, out, err);
