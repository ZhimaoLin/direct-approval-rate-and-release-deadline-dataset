I put it in here because that's where SubmoduleConfig was added, but I will move it as suggested.

> Where do you plan to use it ?

I'm going to add support for recursing submodules on push in the push command.  I've done this as a separate commit to make reviewing a bit easier.

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/PushConfig.java -> Hmm, yes, you're right.  Done.
