DESCRIPTION

[performance] Cache platform name in SystemReader

SystemReader.isMacOs() and SystemReader.isWindows() return values are
unlikely to change during the JVM lifetime (except tests). Don't read
system properties each time the methods are called, just use previously
calculated value.

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/SystemReader.java -> THis code doesn't need to be thread safe, since even if 2 threads will run the code in parallel, they will save exactly same value, because usually no one changes os.name on the fly :-)
