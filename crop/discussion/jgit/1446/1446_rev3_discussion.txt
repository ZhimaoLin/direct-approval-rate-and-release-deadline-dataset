Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCGitCompatabilityTest.java -> Actually the file name is "gitgit.index.v3.skipWorkTree"

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCGitCompatabilityTest.java -> Style-nit: This all fits on one line.

Line:190, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCGitCompatabilityTest.java -> Actually the count was 7.

Line:198, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCGitCompatabilityTest.java -> These last 3 files aren't in the index.

Line:207, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCGitCompatabilityTest.java -> Typically we use assertEquals(Arrays.equals(expectedBytes, indexBytes));

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCGitCompatabilityTest.java -> Style-nit: Line too long.
