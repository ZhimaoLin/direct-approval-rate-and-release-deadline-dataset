DESCRIPTION

BaseReceivePack: initialize pushOptions when we decide to use them

Initialize pushOptions when we decide to use them, instead of when we
advertise them.

In the case of Http the advertisement is in a different network request,
hence in a different instance of the BaseReceivePack.

LGTM.

Tests so we don't accidentally break this again in the future?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Probably also worth mentioning that this fixes the return value of getPushOptions() when the server supports push options but the client choses not to send them.
