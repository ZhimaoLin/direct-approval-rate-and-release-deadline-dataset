remove the empty subdirectory.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtilTest.java -> Doesn't this behavior depend on the traversal order?

Might make sense to just check that the nonempty directories are still there and leave the disposition of the empty directory undefined.
