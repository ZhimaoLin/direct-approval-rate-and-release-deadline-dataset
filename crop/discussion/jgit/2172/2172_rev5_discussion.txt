DESCRIPTION

IndexPack: Use stack-based recursion for delta resolution

Replace 'method' with 'heap'-based recursion for resolving deltas.

Git packfile delta-chain depth can exceed 50 levels in certain files
(the packfile of the JGit project itself has >800 objects with
chain-length >50). Using method-based recursion on such packfiles will
quickly throw a StackOverflowError on VMs with constrained stack.

Benefits:

* packfile delta-resolution no longer limited by the maximum number
  of stack frames permitted on the current thread.

* slight performance improvement
  (3% speed increase on the packfile of the JGit project)

Line:1134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IndexPack.java -> This constructor is only called from within the DeltaVisit class, wasn't private appropriate?

Line:1140, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IndexPack.java -> Fair enough, this method is called from outside the DeltaVisit class

Line:1134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IndexPack.java -> Whoops, you caught this one.  This constructor could have been private since its only invoked by the DeltaVisit class.  Its just habit of mine to typically avoid the private modifier on a private inner class's methods/constructors, because the enclosing class can still access them anyway via synthetic accessor methods inserted by the compiler.

Line:1140, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IndexPack.java -> Right.  I didn't want to pay the penalty for the synthetic accessor method to jump from the enclosing IndexPack class into the DeltaVisit.next() method each time we called next().  Since DeltaVisit is already private, this method is effectively private enough to IndexPack that it doesn't need to be further protected.
