DESCRIPTION

IndexPack: Use stack-based recursion for delta resolution

Replace 'method' with 'stack' -based recursion for resolving deltas.
Git packfile delta-chain depth can exceed 50 levels in certain files
(the packfile of the JGit project itself has >800 objects with
chain-length >50). Using method-based recursion on such packfiles
will quickly throw a StackOverflowError on VMs with constrained
stack.

Benefits:
* packfile delta-resolution no longer limited by the maximum number
  of stack frames permitted on the heap
* slight performance improvement
  (2.4% speed increase on the packfile of the JGit project)

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 I think does the same thing, but is a bit smaller of a change, and uses less memory.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think I have a still better way to write this, patch set 3 coming soon.
