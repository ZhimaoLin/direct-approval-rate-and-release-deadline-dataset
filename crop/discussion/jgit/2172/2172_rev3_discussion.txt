DESCRIPTION

IndexPack: Use stack-based recursion for delta resolution

Replace 'method' with 'heap'-based recursion for resolving deltas.

Git packfile delta-chain depth can exceed 50 levels in certain files
(the packfile of the JGit project itself has >800 objects with
chain-length >50). Using method-based recursion on such packfiles will
quickly throw a StackOverflowError on VMs with constrained stack.

Benefits:

* packfile delta-resolution no longer limited by the maximum number
  of stack frames permitted on the current thread.

* slight performance improvement
  (2.4% speed increase on the packfile of the JGit project)

OK, I think patch set 3 is way better.  I'd appreciate a review Roberto.

Thanks Shawn - I'd like to do a perf-test on the updated code, will do that and a code review in a few hours.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Should drop this stat from the commit message until the update has been re-perf-tested!
