DESCRIPTION

Quickfix for AutoCRLF handling

CRLF only works for small files, where small is the size of the
buffer, i.e. about 8K. This QD fix reallocates the buffer to be
large enough.

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> Its a bit late for this now... but I don't think Auto CRLF handling should be this low in the system that it has to impact the ObjectInserter.

ObjectInserter should be dealing with only raw byte sequences supplied either as a byte[] or as an InputStream, and this tempBuffer was originally meant only for copying from an InputStream through to the Deflater the inserter is using.

I'm strongly in favor of pulling this stuff out of the inserter.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> We shouldn't be using system properties to configure JGit. Configuration should come through the Config object.
