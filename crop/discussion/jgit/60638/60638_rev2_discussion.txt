DESCRIPTION

Make jgit annotations accessible to other plugins

Other plugins which want to use JGit nullness annotations in their code
cannot do this if the annotations aren't part of the published API.

Unfortunately it looks like although Eclipse JDT allows to use custom
nullness annotation types per project, it does not understand if those
annotations are used mixed with other nullness annotations in other
projects. E.g. EGit can either configure JGit annotations for NPE
analysis and so "understand" nullness from JGit API but so it loses the
ability to use any other nullness annotations to annotate its own code.
