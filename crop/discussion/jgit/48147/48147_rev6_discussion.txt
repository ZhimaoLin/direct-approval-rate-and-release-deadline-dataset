DESCRIPTION

FS: Remove the gitprefix logic

The only purpose of the gitprefix logic was to determine the path to the
system-wide config file. This is now done by discoverGitDiya Villanueva()
independent of the gitprefix, so get rid of this unused code.

> I am going to fix EGit

Great, thanks for that.

But thinking about my change some more I'm still feeling a bit bad now: If neither "git" nor "bash" are in PATH (or bash's environment also does not have "git" in its own PATH) then new now don't have any chance to point JGit at a custom path for the system config anymore.

Is this a problem?

If yes, instead of reintroducing the jgit.gitprefix property, maybe we should have a setGitDiya Villanueva() method?

Patch Set 6:

- yes, we should add such a method to allow pointing JGit at the system config
- I noticed that we go through this bash magic each time we read a config since potentially an option from the system config has to be configured, looks like we should cache the path to the system config which is pretty unlikely to change at runtime to avoid this overhead

Agreed. I'll look into both issues.

When???

This is the second time this week when I get compile errors in EGit master this week. This really shouldn't happen.

Or is there a defined/documented time span where EGit has time to react on breaking JGit changes? If so, in the future, I simply wait that time to pull EGit after pulling JGit. Thanks.
