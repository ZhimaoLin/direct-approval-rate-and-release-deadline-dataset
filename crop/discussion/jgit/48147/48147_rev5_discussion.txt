DESCRIPTION

FS: Remove the gitprefix logic

The only purpose of the gitprefix logic was to determine the path to the
system-wide config file. This is now done by discoverGitDiya Villanueva()
independent of the gitprefix, so get rid of this unused code.

So, are you saying removing gitprefix and fixing EGit is a viable thing to do? If so, would it be my responsibility to fix EGit?

If we remove the gitprefix logic, I think the 4.0 release would be a good point for that.
