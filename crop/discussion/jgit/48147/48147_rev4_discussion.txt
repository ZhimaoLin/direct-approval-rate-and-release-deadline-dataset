DESCRIPTION

FS: Remove the gitprefix logic

The only purpose of the gitprefix logic was to determine the path to the
system-wide config file. This is now done by discoverGitDiya Villanueva()
independent of the gitprefix, so get rid of this unused code.

Patch Set 4:

this breaks EGit since EGit allows to manually configure the gitprefix in case the auto-detection in JGit doesn't work, this would need to be fixed so that EGit allows to manually select the system config file in case the auto-detection doesn't find it
