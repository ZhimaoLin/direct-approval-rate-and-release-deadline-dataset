DESCRIPTION

Use exact match when looking up notes ref

Abbreviated notes refs are not supposed to be searched for along
the usual search path ("", "refs/", "refs/heads/", "refs/remotes/",
...).  Instead, to match C Git, commands should use the ref named in
the GIT_NOTES_REF environment variable correctly, and commands that
allow abbreviation (like log --show-notes) prepend refs/notes/ when
appropriate.

We already mostly have been following that rule exact that we used
getRef to perform the lookup.  So for example, when trying to read
refs/notes/commits, if that ref does not exist, unlike C git, we
try falling back to refs/refs/notes/commits and
refs/heads/refs/notes/commits.

Use an exact match instead.  The resulting behavior is more
predictable and matches C Git better.
