DESCRIPTION

RebaseCommand: detect and handle fast-forward properly

This bug was hidden by an incomplete test: the current Rebase
implementation using the "git rebase -i" pattern does not work
correctly if fast-forwarding is involved. The reason for this is that
the log command does not return any commits in this case.
In addition, a check for already merged commits was introduced to
avoid spurious conflicts.
