DESCRIPTION

Use java.nio.file consistently in FS

Since 4.0 we require Java 7 so there is no longer a need to override the
following methods in FS_POSIX and FS_Win32
- lastModified()
- setLastModified()
- length()
- isSymlink()
- exists()
- isDirectory()
- isFile()
- isHidden()
hence implement these methods in FS and remove overrides in subclasses.

Patch Set 2:

Matthias, what is about FS_Win32_Cygwin? The methods there can be removed too.

One concern I have for all this changes: unfortunately File and Files have different implementations. For sure Files is newver and *should* be better/faster/deeper etc but I can remember that some of the nio code was problematic for JGit in the past, and also I'm not sure if and how the JGit performance will be affected by the change.

Do you have some numbers how the change can affect the performance?

Please disregard this comment, since the code in FS was overridden anyway by concrete implementations.
