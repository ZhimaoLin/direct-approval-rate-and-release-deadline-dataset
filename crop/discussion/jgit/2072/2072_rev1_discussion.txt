DESCRIPTION

IndexDiff: Fix getAssumeUnchanged()

If the caller really needs the list of files that are flagged as
assume-unchanged (aka assume-valid in the DirCache), we should give
them the complete list and not just those that we wrongly identified
as being modified during diff().

This change is necessary because diff() is slightly broken and is
discovering differences on files that it shouldn't have considered.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

I was about to fix some problems with getAssumeUnchanged() by adding more params to WorkingTreeIterator#isModified(...) in my change #2066 (the performance optimized ANY_DIFF). This made the code more ugly and I guess/hope that with this change I can remove that new parameter.
