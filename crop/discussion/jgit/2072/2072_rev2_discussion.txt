DESCRIPTION

IndexDiff: Fix getAssumeUnchanged()

If the caller really needs the list of files that are flagged as
assume-unchanged (aka assume-valid in the DirCache), we should give
them the complete list and not just those that we wrongly identified
as being modified during diff().

This change is necessary because diff() is slightly broken and is
discovering differences on files that it shouldn't have considered.
