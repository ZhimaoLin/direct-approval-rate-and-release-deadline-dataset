DESCRIPTION

Disallow creating invalid DirCacheEntry records

A dircache record must not use a path string like "/a" or "a//b"
as this results in a tree entry being written with a zero length
name component in the record.  C git does not support an empty name,
and neither does any modern filesystem.

A record also must not have a stage outside of the standard 0-3
value range, as there are only 2 bits of space available in the
on-disk format of the record to store the stage information.
Any other values would be truncated into this space, storing a
different value than the caller expected.

If an application tries to create a DirCache record with either of
these wrong values, we abort with an IllegalArgumentException.
