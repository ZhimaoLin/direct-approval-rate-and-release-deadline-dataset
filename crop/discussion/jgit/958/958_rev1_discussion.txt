DESCRIPTION

Remove Repository.toFile(ObjectId)

Not every type of Repository will be able to map an ObjectId into
a local file system path that stores that object's file contents.
Heck, its not even true for the FileRepository, as an object can
be stored in a pack file and not in its loose format.

Remove this from our public API, it was a mistake to publish it.
