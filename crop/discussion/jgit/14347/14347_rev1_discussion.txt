DESCRIPTION

Fix bugs in TreeWalk#isPathSuffix used by PathSuffixFilter

* It didn't check the first character in the pattern due to a off-by-one
  error. Spotted by James Roper.
* It returned true even when pattern was longer than current path, e.g.
  it returned that ".txt" is suffix of "txt".

Amazing how old this bug is. 

I'm not a fan of rewriting existing tests when fixing bugs.

Yes, apparently there are not many users of it :).

Could you please also say what you want to be done when giving feedback like this? Should I split the refactoring into a separate change? A comment like the above just feels kind of discouraging.

Regarding the test cases: You fixed a severe bug. But it is hard to find out how your fixes relate to the test case modifications you did. Mainly because you not only added more test cases but also rewrote existing tests.

You could get around such misunderstandings if you split your stuff in two commits. One which simply refactors the old tests (adding and using of createTree(),getMatching...()) and another commit with your bugfix and the additional testscases.
