DESCRIPTION

TreeFormatter: disallow empty filenames in trees

Git barfs on these (and they don't make any sense), so we certainly
shouldn't write them.

Line:216, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/TreeFormatter.java -> please add an xxx@xxx.xxx 4.6" here (that is done for newer stuff, there might be old stuff around that doesn't follow this convention)

Line:369, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutMaliciousPathTest.java -> I think you'd want to split the line here.

Line:217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/TreeFormatter.java -> whitespace nit: there shouldn't be a space here
