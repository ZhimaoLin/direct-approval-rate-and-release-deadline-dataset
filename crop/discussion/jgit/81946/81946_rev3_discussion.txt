Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/TreeFormatter.java -> nit: use tabs

Line:220, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/TreeFormatter.java -> What if the name is something like "    "?  Does it get trimmed somewhere or is it considered a non-empty name?

Line:328, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/T0003_BasicTest.java -> Is it possible to also specify the expected message?

Line:370, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutMaliciousPathTest.java -> nit: use tabs instead of spaces.  same on the next line
