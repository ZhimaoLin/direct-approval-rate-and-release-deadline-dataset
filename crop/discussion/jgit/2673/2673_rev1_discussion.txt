DESCRIPTION

[findbugs] Avoid futile attempt to change max pool size

Javadoc for ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor says [1]:
While ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, a
few of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In
particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using corePoolSize
threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments to maximumPoolSize have no
useful effect.
