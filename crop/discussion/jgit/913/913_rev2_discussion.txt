DESCRIPTION

Rewrite resolve in terms of RevWalk

We want to eventually get rid of the mapCommit, mapTree APIs on
Repository and force everyone into the faster parsers that exist
in RevWalk.  Rewriting resolve in terms of the faster parsers is
a good first step.

It actually simplifies the code a bit, as we no longer need to
keep track of an ObjectId and an Object (the parsed form), since
all RevObjects implicitly have their ObjectId readily available.
