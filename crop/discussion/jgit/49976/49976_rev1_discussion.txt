DESCRIPTION

Add null check to CloneCommand.setURI

The function was never advertised to allow a null URI and call() throws
URISyntaxException on null, so adding this check should be safe.

Line:340, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> I like that we document that this should not be null.

But I wouldn't like that we modify all our API setterMethods and throw an explicit NullPointerException if an unexpected null was given. Do we really have to add the extra check?

Without your change when I call "cloneCommand.setUri(null).call()" I receive a URISyntaxException with the message "The uri was empty or null". With your change I get a generic NullPointerException. Don't you also find the URISyntaxException be more informative.

Line:340, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> That's reasonable. Done (and updated the commit message).
