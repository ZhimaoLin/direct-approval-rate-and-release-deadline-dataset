DESCRIPTION

RFC Store Git on any DHT

jgit.storage.dht is a storage provider implementation for JGit that
permits storing the Git repository in a distributed hashtable, NoSQL
system, or other database.  The actual underlying storage system is
undefined, and can be plugged in by implementing 7 small interfaces:

  *  Database
  *  RepositoryIndexTable
  *  RepositoryTable
  *  RefTable
  *  ChunkTable
  *  ObjectIndexTable
  *  WriteBuffer

The storage provider interface tries to assume very little about the
underlying storage system, and requires only three key features:

  *  key -> value lookup (a hashtable is suitable)
  *  atomic updates on single rows
  *  asynchronous operations (Java's ExecutorService is easy to use)

Most NoSQL database products offer all 3 of these features in their
clients, and so does any decent network based cache system like the
open source memcache product.  Relying only on key equality for data
retrevial makes it simple for the storage engine to distribute across
multiple machines.  Traditional SQL systems could also be used with a
(yet to be written) JDBC based spi implementation.

Thus far I have implemented four storage systems for the spi layer:
Apache HBase[1], Apache Cassandra[2], an in-memory implmenetation for
unit testing, and a generic cache provider that can ride on top of
memcache.  All four systems weigh in with an spi layer around 1000
lines of code to implement the above 7 interfaces.  This is a huge
reduction in size compared to prior attempts to implement a new JGit
storage layer.  As this package shows, a complete JGit storage
implementation is closer to 17,000 lines of fairly complex code.

A simple network cache is also provided in storage.dht.spi.cache,
implementers can use CacheDatabase to wrap any other type of Database
and perform fast reads against a network based cache service, such as
the open source memcached.
