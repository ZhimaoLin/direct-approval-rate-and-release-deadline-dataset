DESCRIPTION

Add a NameRevCommand for describing IDs in terms of refnames

The walk logic does not use RevWalk because it needs to walk all paths
to each of the requested commits, keeping track of each path along which
the commit was found in the RevCommit subclass. From these paths, a
single "best" path is chosen based on the total path length, with a
penalty applied for paths that traverse merges.

This functionality parallels "git name-rev".

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> OK so StringBuilder(null) NPEs. Why are we calling format on something with a null tip? Why are we formatting that string as "null~5" when we know its not a valid reference name?

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> Use FIFORevQueue? Unfortunately its not generic, but it does use RevCommit as its member type.

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> Instead of calling c.format() on a null tip value, maybe we want a merge && c.tip != null test here?

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> No curly braces.

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> For toString() to not NPE when I was debugging. Fixed to allow format() to NPE but toString to succeed regardless. toString is explicitly only for debugging anyway, right?

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> Done

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> c.tip can never be null. c is what comes out of the queue. The call to addPrefixes above ensures the initial commits in queue all have tips, and this block ensures that p.tip is set before adding p to the queue.

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NameRevCommand.java -> Done
