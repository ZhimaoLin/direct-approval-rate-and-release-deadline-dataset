DESCRIPTION

Clean up archive format registration

Add a static start() method to FormatActivator to allow outside
classes such as the Archive subcommand of the jgit program can use it
without a BundleContext.  This way, the list of formats only has to be
maintained in one place.

While at it, build a list of registered formats at start() time, so
stop() doesn't have to repeat the same list of formats.
