DESCRIPTION

Mark dependency to apache commons compress optional

The Apache Commons Compress library isn't yet available in Orbit, which
currently breaks the EGit p2 repository build. Hence as a workaround
mark org.eclipse.jgit.pgm's dependencies to this library optional until
this is available. This breaks the archive cli command for OSGi
consumers but still allows to use it in plain jgit cli.

We will revert this change as soon as apache commons compress is
available from Orbit.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I can verify that this fixes "mvn clean install" in egit.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

All the commandline tools except "jgit archive" should work fine without commons-compress, so this looks fine.
