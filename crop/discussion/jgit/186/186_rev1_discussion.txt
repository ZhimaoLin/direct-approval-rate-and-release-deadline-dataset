DESCRIPTION

Refactor common boolean string parsing

Rather than repeating this code twice, pull it into the StringUtils
class so we can reuse it inside of both Config and GitServlet.

Instead of referencing to 'a lot of other code' just use NPE's javadoc. Let it be an NPE ;-)

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/StringUtils.java -> I've never seen that style before. Furthermore, an NPE is something which usually occurs when a method is invoked against a null value, which is semantically different from a value with a bad value. So I'm with Mykola that we should probably use IAE here.

I could just omit the null check altogether, in which case we'd probably crash during equalsIgnoreCase due to one of the arguments being null, and result in the same NPE message.

My preference is for what I wrote.  :-)

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/StringUtils.java -> Does NPE make sense here and wouldn't it be better to use the same IAE?
