DESCRIPTION

RFC/WiP: Use JUnit assert methods rather than hamcrest helpers

The hamcrest library has not been updated for several years. Stop
using it explicitly, in favour of JUnit's own methods. JUnit itself
still uses it, so it's still a transitive dependency, but by not
explicitly using it in tests we don't need to keep it as an explicit
dependency.

This RFC/WiP commit changes some of the existing tests. If it's
something we want to do, a later patch set will change the remaining
usages of hamcrest and remove the dependency from manifests/targets.
