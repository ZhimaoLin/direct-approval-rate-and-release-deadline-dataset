DESCRIPTION

Rebase: Write an empty "quiet" file to make C Git happy

C git tries to read this file from the rebase state directory and
complains about it not being there for rebases started by JGit. An empty
'quiet' file represents the (verbose) default.

Hi,

I just saw that this change is not covered by a test, even though it seems an easy thing to do. Is that on purpose?

No, there is no resonn not to add a test. To me this was not important enough to be tested, as not having the file does not seem to affect functionality.

(please excuse my late response)

If you want to ensure that the new feature works now and in the future you need an automated, repeatable and reliable test. Wouldn't you agree on that?

BTW, the importance of something is mostly subjective. What you consider not important may well be important for others...

We're on the same page about testing in general, just not on this change. You are welcome to contribute a test though.
