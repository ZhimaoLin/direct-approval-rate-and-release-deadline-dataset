DESCRIPTION

Remove objects before optimization from DfsGarbageCollector

Just counting objects is not sufficient. There are some race
conditions with receive packs and delta base completion that
may confuse such a simple algorithm.

Instead always do the larger set computations, and rely on
the PackWriter having no objects pending output as the way
to avoid creating an empty pack file.
