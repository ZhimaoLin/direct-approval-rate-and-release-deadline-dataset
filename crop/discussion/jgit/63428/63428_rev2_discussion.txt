DESCRIPTION

Added CLIText.fatalError(String) API for tests

In different places (Main, TextBuiltin, CLIGitCommand) we report fatal
errors and at same time want to check for fatal errors in the tests.
Using common API simplifies the error testing and helps to navigate to
the actual error check implementation.
