DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack and BaseReceivePack merged in line with YAGNI philosophy

Four years after https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5818/ (May 2012),
there has been no visible follow-up on the conceived use case
for the original factoring out of BaseReceivePack from ReceivePack.

I like it. Hopefully someone else (or me when less tired) can look more closely.

A few quick notes, probably worth putting in the commit message:
* lots of protected methods become private
* some other APIs have methods with BaseReceivePack as arguments --- this doesn't update those yet
