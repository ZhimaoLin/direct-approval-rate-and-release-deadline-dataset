DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack and BaseReceivePack merged in line with YAGNI philosophy

Four years after https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5818/ (May 2012),
there has been no visible follow-up on the conceived use case
for the original factoring out of BaseReceivePack from ReceivePack.

I like this but it breaks API.

I don't remember what our procedure for doing that is. Probably just a mail to xxx@xxx.xxx and a version bump between deprecation and removal.

Patch Set 3:

I have re-added BaseReceivePack as a hollow class per Jonathan's recommendation to deprecate it rather than remove a part of the public API.
