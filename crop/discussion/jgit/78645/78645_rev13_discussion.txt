DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack and BaseReceivePack merged in line with YAGNI philosophy

Four years after https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5818/ (May 2012),
there has been no visible follow-up on the conceived use case
for the original factoring out of BaseReceivePack from ReceivePack.
The contents of BaseReceivePack have therefore been merged back into
ReceivePack, retaining the latter's name. Most protected methods
of BaseReceivePack have become private within ReceivePack, as they
were not and are not used outside of it. Lastly, some other APIs
have methods that take objects of type BaseReceivePack as arguments,
and this change does not update those yet, leaving a shell class
in place of BaseReceivePack.

Patch Set 13: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

all files reviewed except for the two big ones; I'll come up with an idea how to review that efficiently.

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> nit: remove extra line

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> And BaseReceivePack is staying as an abstract class?
which breaks other people at first, but they can easily replace BaseReceivePack by ReceivePack, ...  but then they may find out some methods are private?

Oh wait, they are protected methods, so nobody outside the package is using them

the big diff also looks good to me.

Line:627, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> I wonder if these need to be bumped.

Since 3.6 you could ask BaseReceivePack for this, but ReceivePack itself only understands it after 4.5 ?

I think we can keep the 3.6 though as it indicates since when JGit can understand such a helper?

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> Done

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well, BaseReceivePack becoming abstract doesn't break things to the extent that it's used in classes such as AdvertiseRefsHookChain.java. But there are other cases that I imagine will require replacement.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Right, the idea is that we're willing to break people who inherited from BaseReceivePack (even though they would have had access to the protected methods). But we're not willing to break people who did things like

  BaseReceivePack rp = ...
  rp.foo();
  rp.bar();

until they have had one release to upgrade. Hence keeping the public methods but not the protected ones.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think spelling this exact differentiation out in the commit message would be helpful?
