DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack and BaseReceivePack merged in line with YAGNI philosophy

Four years after https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5818/ (May 2012),
there has been no visible follow-up on the conceived use case
for the original factoring out of BaseReceivePack from ReceivePack.

Line:1930, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> nit: This seems to be unrelated to the intent of this change?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is YAGNI a well known acronym or do we want to reference 
e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it or other sources of that?

Do we want to mention YAGNI at all or just say "it is far easier to read and maintain this way" ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> IMO it's well known enough, and the top search results for it are correct.
