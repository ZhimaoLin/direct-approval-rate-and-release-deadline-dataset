DESCRIPTION

Attach compiled jgit executable to jgit-pgm artifact

This way the compiled script+shaded JAR is uploaded to the public
repository for easier download and distribution to end-users.

We have to use a file type that differs from the default of ".jar",
so we use ".sh" as the suffix because the script really is an
executable Bourne shell script, but with a JAR slapped on the end.
