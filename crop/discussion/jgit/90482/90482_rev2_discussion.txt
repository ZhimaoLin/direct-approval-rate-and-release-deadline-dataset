DESCRIPTION

Prefer smaller GC files during DFS garbage collection

In 8ac65d33ed7a94f77cb066271669feebf9b882fc PackWriter changed its
behavior to always prefer the last object representation presented
to it by the ObjectReuseAsIs implementation. This was a fix to avoid
delta chain cycles.

Unfortunately it can lead to suboptimal compression when concurrent
GCs are run on the same repository. One case is automatic GC running
(with default settings) in parallel to a manual GC that has disabled
delta reuse in order to generate new smaller deltas for the entire
history of the repository.

Running GC with no-reuse generally requires more CPU time, which
also translates to a longer running time.  This can lead to a race
where the automatic GC completes before the no-reuse GC, leaving
the repository in a state such as:

  no-reuse GC:   size 1 GiB, mtime = 18:45
  auto GC:       size 8 GiB, mtime = 17:30

With the default sort ordering, the smaller no-reuse GC pack is
sorted earlier in the pack list, due to its more recent mtime.

During object reuse in a future GC, these smaller representations
are considered first by PackWriter, but are all discarded when the
auto GC file from 17:30 is examined second (due to its older mtime).

Work around this in two ways.

Well formed DFS repositories should have at most 1 GC pack. If
2 or more GC packs exist, break the sorting tie by selecting the
smaller file earlier in the pack list. This allows all normal read
code paths to favor the smaller file, which places less pressure
on the DfsBlockCache. If any GC race happens, readers serving clone
requests will prefer the file that is smaller.

During object reuse, flip this ordering so that the smaller file is
last. This allows PackWriter to see smaller deltas last, replacing
larger representations that were previously considered from other
pack files.

Patch Set 2:

The approach looks sane, but is built on non-explicit knowledge of how the searching for reuse algorithms work.

Are there tests we can add to verify the intended behavior?
