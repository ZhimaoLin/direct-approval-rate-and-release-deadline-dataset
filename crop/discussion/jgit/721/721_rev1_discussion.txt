DESCRIPTION

Added merge support to CommitCommand

The CommitCommand should take care to create a merge commit if the file
$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD exists. It should then read the parents for the merge
commit out of this file. It should also take care that when commiting
a merge and no commit message was specified to read the message from
$GIT_DIR/MERGE_MSG.
Finally the CommitCommand should remove these files if the commit
succeeded.
