please rebase this change on current master and update versions in manifests as jgit version is now 4.7

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/lib/LfsPointerFilter.java -> object.isLarge() has a default threshold of 50MB. WIth a 50MB threshold we will parse almost all files a git repository typically contains (especially when using lfs to store large files ;-).

git-lfs does not consider files larger than 1024byte when looking for lfs pointers (see https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/lfs/scanner.go#L8). So we should add another check here and skip all files where ObjectLoader.getSize() returns more than 1024 to avoid wasting time on parsing larger files.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/lib/LfsPointerFilter.java -> Parsing an LFS pointer file is already implemented in LfsPointer.parseLfsPointer(InputStream)
