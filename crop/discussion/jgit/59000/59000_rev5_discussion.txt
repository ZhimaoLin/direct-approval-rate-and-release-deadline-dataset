Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/lib/LargeObjectPointerFilter.java -> according to [1] two version urls should be supported for reading (and this is the case):
https://hawser.github.com/spec/v1
https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1

[1] https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/spec.md

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/lib/LargeObjectPointerFilter.java -> this needs to be rewritten to handle 2 types of version headers

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/lib/LargeObjectPointerFilter.java -> AFAICT the algorithm here is to go over content as many times as REQUIRED_KEYS.length is? wouldn't that make more sense to walk content once and extract whatever is still to be extracted? one could break the loop if all keys were already found...

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/lib/LargeObjectPointerTest.java -> s/size id/different size/
