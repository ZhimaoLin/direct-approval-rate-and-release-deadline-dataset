Patch Set 3:

Given the nature[1] of the test wouldn't a new project[2] be a better place for this patch? This makes even more sense if you consider bug 365535[3] as an extension to this kind of JGit API testing.

[1] testing JGit API via JGit CLI
[2] org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test
[3] "Randomized tests for JGit API", randomly execute JGit CLI commands and compare results with CGit

- yeah, I think it's a good idea to move this into a new project
- this change needs a rebase and adaption of versions to 2.0
- this change will need a CQ
