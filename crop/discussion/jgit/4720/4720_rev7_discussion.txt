I only would like to see three classes being renamed. Other than that: Looks good to me

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/BranchCommandTest.java -> Every test in this package will test commands which you can enter through our CLI. Why repeat the name "Command" now in all class names. Simply call it "BranchTest" (and you avoid again that developers have two equally named classes in their workspace and potentially navigate to the wrong one).

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> We have two classes in different packages doing similar things and having the same name. Just to avoid misunderstandings I would rename this to CLIRepositoryTestCase.

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAndLogCommandTest.java -> same rename argument. Let's call it CommitAndLogTest
