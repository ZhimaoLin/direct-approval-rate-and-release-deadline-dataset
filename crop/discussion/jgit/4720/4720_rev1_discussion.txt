Good that someone looks into improving the tests.

Line:472, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BranchCommandTest.java -> \r is for Windows only. Don't do that.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> That won't handle arguments with spaces

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> If you want a function that can parse an sh style line, with quoting, we have logic for that in Gerrit Code Review. Its Apache License 2.0 but I/Google would be willing to relicense it under EDL for use in JGit since it depends on JGit's QuotedPath code to handle the sh quoting rules anyway. :-)

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> Point taken, but isn't it true for org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Main.main(String[]) as well? I would file a separate bug to fix here and there at the same time. Is it ok with you guys?

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> No. JGit doesn't care about arguement quoting. The arguments to main are already parsed according to the rules of the user's shell.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> That one we will not fix and I'll try to do what I can to prevent others from fixing it :)


I think we should go with the sh style parsing here, if we decide this will be good. 

Another option for exploring writing readable tests might be to use Groovy, but we'd need a proof-of-concept even for that one.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIGitCommand.java -> Done with a copy of com.google.gerrit.sshd.CommandFactoryProvider#split(String) from Gerrit Code Review. Thanks for the tip.
