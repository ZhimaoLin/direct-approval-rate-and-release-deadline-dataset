DESCRIPTION

Make InMemoryRepository internals public

This class is designed specifically for tests, and tests may want to
have finer control over the internals, such as validating arguments
to certain method calls. Make the internal implementation classes
public, and some methods protected, to make this possible.

For context, what I'm trying to do is validate that the arguments to the DfsRefUpdate actually exist in the repository. With the recent change to be able to read back from ObjectInserters before flushing, this serves as a check that objects are properly flushed before creating refs to them.

The Gerrit bug fixed here would have been caught sooner if we had such validation:
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/63640

Actually, now that I've written this, I think this validation could just go in InMemoryRepository directly so that all users benefit from it without having to subclass MemRefDatabase.
