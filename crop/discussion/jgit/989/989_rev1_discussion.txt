DESCRIPTION

Remove Repository.openObject(ObjectReader, AnyObjectId)

Going through ObjectReader.openObject(AnyObjectId) is faster, but
also produces cleaner application level code.  The error checking
is done inside of the openObject method, which means it can be
removed from the application code.
