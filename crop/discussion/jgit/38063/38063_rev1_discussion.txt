DESCRIPTION

Make binaryFileThreshold behave as documented

The parameter binaryFileThreshold was only relevant when a file could
not fit in a byte array. Make it so that it is possible to set a
threshold smaller than the size of a byte array.

why abandon? Just push a new rebased patchset.

Line:1022, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Is this really needed? Without your change we would directly jump into ldr.getBytes(binaryFileThreshold). And this should throw an exception if we are reading more than binaryFileThreshold. If not then we should fix ldr.getBytes(binaryFileThreshold). There may be ObjectLoaders where determining the size() in advance could be expensive. In this case it may be better to just read bytes from the stream, count the bytes and throw an exception in case we hit the limit.

I tried that but I got an error message saying that I cannot push a change on someone else behalf without being a commiter (something along those lines).

Line:1022, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> This change was done by a former colleague, I will investigate this myself to be able to answer your question.

Abandoned

I'll abandon this on Hugo's request so he can upload it again under his name.
