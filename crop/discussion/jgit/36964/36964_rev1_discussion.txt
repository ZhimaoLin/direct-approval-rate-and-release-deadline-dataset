Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

I have reviewed this one, as my last patches also touched BaseReceivePack.java

I do not have any reviewing comments, but this change rather looks good to me.

Line:556, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> This loses information: after

 setAllowDeletes(true);
 setAllowBranchDeletes(true);
 setAllowDeletes(false);
 setAllowDeletes(true);

what should isAllowBranchDeletes() say?

I'd delete the above two lines and treat them as orthogonal (validateCommands would still prevent deleting branches when allowAnyDeletes is false).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Subtle and underdocumented on the git side. :( Thanks for catching it.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/99746 is a nicer UI showing that thread (found with

 git fetch git://repo.or.cz/git/trast.git refs/heads/notes/full:refs/notes/full
 git show --show-notes=full a240de1137bd63a969c6bd56ab5186d7216e28ca

).
