DESCRIPTION

Record the estimated size of the COMPACT, GC and GC_REST pack files.

The Compacter and Garbage Collector will record the the estimated size
of the newly going to be created compact or gc packs. This is
information can be used by the clients to better make a call on how to
actually store the pack based on the approximated expected size.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Please update the commit message to capture your design decision to use DfsPackDescription.setEstimatedPackSize() rather than adding that parameter to a new ctor (reason being that Dfs classes are subclassed so making DfsObjDatabase.newPack(PackSource, long) abstract would break existing clients).

Line:406, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> same comment about the compactor subtracting 32 for the header/trailer and initializing at 32.

Line:428, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> This is basically the same method as above. Maybe combine the implementations by making a helper that takes a varags of PackSource enum, copies to an EnumSet<PackSource>, and then iterates the source packs.

The cost of that varags and EnumSet is nothing compared to the cost of the actual packing work, so there is no need to micro-optimize this filter loop.

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> There is a GC_TXN or something.

Line:480, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> I think you can ask the PackRevIdx for the offset of this object and the next object in the pack, subtract them to compute the length of this object, and accumulate that for a size estimate.

Hold the PackRevIdx up above alongside the PackIndex as its not free on a per-object basis.

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> Each input file has a 12 byte header/20 byte trailer. The output file will also have that, but only once, not for each file. I'd do this as getFileSize(PACK) - 32, and initialize size to 32.

Line:285, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> I don't think this helper is that useful. It may be easier to have the two callers just do the setEstimatedPackSize themselves. It may be shorter code by the time you remove the Javadoc for this method and its declaration.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> double the

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> trailing whitespace

Sorry, missed to publish the draft with my previous patch set (forgot about how the comments work with the old Gerrit :().

Line:406, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> Done

Line:428, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> Done

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> Are you suggesting that, we can use the the existing GC_TXN pack size as an estimate?

Line:480, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> Done

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> Done

Line:285, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> The purpose of this method is for the subclasses to override it if they need take estimatedPackSize into consideration while creating the pack description. I just added this default implementation, so that all the existing sub classes won't be forced to implement this method. I updated the javadoc to add more context.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> Done
