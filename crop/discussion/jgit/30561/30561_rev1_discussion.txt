DESCRIPTION

Fixed message for exception thrown during recursive merge

During recursive merge jgit potentially has to merge multiple
common ancestors. If this fails because there are conflicts then
the exception thrown for that should have a message which states
this clearly. Previously a wrong message was given ("More than 200
merge bases ...")

Line:314, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Shouldn't the key have an "s" at the end (mergeRecursiveConflictsWhenMergingCommonAncestors)?

Also, just a minor thing, but I think it would be better if the long IDs were at the end of the message, otherwise what happened (the conflict) is at the very end of the message. Maybe:

Multiple common ancestors were found and merging them resulted in a conflict: {0}, {1}
