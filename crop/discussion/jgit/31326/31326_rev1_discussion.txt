DESCRIPTION

ResolveMerger: push result file creation into updateIndex()

The only caller of writeMergedFile is updateIndex, and the only
user of this path object is the code within the method. This is
a no-op change that opens the door to refactoring the way temp
files are handled for inCore merges.
