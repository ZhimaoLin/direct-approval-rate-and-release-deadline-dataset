DESCRIPTION

Use more restrictive patterns for sideband progress scraping

To avoid scraping a non-progress message as though it were a progress
item for the progress monitor, use a more restrictive pattern to
watch the remote side's messages.  These two regexps should match
any message produced by C Git since 42e18fbf5f94 ("more compact
progress display", Oct 2007), and which first appeared in Git 1.5.4.

Do we have tests that already cover this?
