Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/LsFilesTest.java -> You should check for entries:
- exisiting in HEAD but missing in index (files where you already executed 'git rm' but have not comitted that)
- symbolic links
- submodules

Even if we don't support all the bells and whistles of native git's ls-files we should not silently ignore links and submodules.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe we should mention which functionalities of native git's ls-files which don't support. ls-files can give a lot of useful info for inspecting the index (-s,-k). I don't think we should support -t because it's deprecated in native git but -s would be a nice feature for a follow up change. Then we could get rid of the pgm/debug/ShowDirCache class.
