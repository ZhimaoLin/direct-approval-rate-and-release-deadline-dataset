Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/AbstractRevQueue.java -> I don't see any callers for this function. How do people tend to use it? Will making it respect the firstParent option confuse callers?

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> This should rewrite to drop all the non-first parents, I think.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PendingGenerator.java -> Is this also needed for non-first parents, too? I haven't thought it through. (The non-first parents can be encountered via RevCommit.carryFlags. I'm not how to quickly tell what code assumes that a RevCommit is parsed and what code doesn't.)

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Scary. I think I'm going to walk away and pretend I didn't see this code path.

Luckily c.has(UNSHALLOW) can only be true in the fetch --depth path, which wouldn't use setFirstParent.

Unfortunately https://git.eclipse.org/r/1320 doesn't include tests.

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/Generator.java -> (optional) This could be an outputType() flag.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> (optional) This message could be rephrased to work even in a GUI that does not expose the Java function names --- e.g.,

 Cannot find merge bases using a first-parent walk
