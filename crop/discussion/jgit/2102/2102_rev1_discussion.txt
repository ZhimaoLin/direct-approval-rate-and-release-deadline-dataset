DESCRIPTION

Rebase: abort on unknown/unsupported command in git-rebase-todo

This is needed to ensure interoperability with the command line: if
the git-rebase-todo file was created manually (by git rebase -i in the
command line), and any commands other than pick are used (reword,
edit, fixup, squash) JGit must abort as it does not understand these
commands yet.
The same is true if an unknown command is found (e.g. due to a typo);
this is the same behavior as shown by the command line.
