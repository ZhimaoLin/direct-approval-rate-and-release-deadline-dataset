DESCRIPTION

Make MyersDiff interruptible

For some specific file, MyersDiff goes into an infinite loop[1]. Since
this problem is hard to reproduce and possibly harder to fix, this
change makes the MyersDiff interruptible so the diff can be aborted at
least when such infinite loop happens.

Line:412, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> nit: JGit prefers omitting curly braces

Line:412, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> I read the contribution guide and it says that from 3.7, always use the curly braces in new code: http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Braces_for_one-line_statements
