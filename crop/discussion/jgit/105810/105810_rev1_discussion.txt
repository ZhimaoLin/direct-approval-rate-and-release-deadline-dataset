DESCRIPTION

HttpConfig: load user config before reading values from it

Same problem as in commit c227268: openUserConfig() just creates the
FileBasedConfig object, but doesn't read the file yet. An explicit
load() is needed.

As HttpConfig is read-only this omission did not cause any bad effects,
but it simply ignored values from the user config. Most uses of
HttpConfig go through the two-argument constructor, though, where
HttpConfig is given an already loaded repo config.
