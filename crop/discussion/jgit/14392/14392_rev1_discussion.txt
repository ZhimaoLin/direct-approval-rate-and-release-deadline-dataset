Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> could we disallow to add null elements instead ?

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> Both ArrayList and LinkedList (that are most appropriate here) do allow null elements.
Overriding the methods add() and addAll() would do the job. But throwing a exception when a user tries to add a null element may cause problems for the user when trying to copy elements from another collection containing null elements.
Imho I would rather handle (skip) null elements in the list then hand over responsibility to the user (note that the user can still check for null elements but is not forced to do so)

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> I think Matthias, ment the code that adds the nulls. The content of those lists are under our control and there is no legacy reason for supporting nulls. The code that construct these lists should make sure it does not add nulls.

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> I may get you wrong, but we expose the list of steps to the user in interactive mode (see line 272)

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> but why would a user want to add a null step ?
