DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Include peeled ObjectId as advertised

A RefAdvertiser writing to the network includes both the reference's
ObjectId and its peeled ObjectId in the advertised set.  In smart HTTP
negotiation requests may bypass the RefAdvertiser and quickly build
the set based on current refs; include the peeled ObjectIds to match
behavior with the normal bidirectional protocols on git:// and SSH.

Line:784, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> One implementation of Ref.getPeeledObjectId() (the one in SymbolicRef) seems to be so expensive that it would make sense to cache the result of ref.getPeeledObjectId() in a local variable. Or do you know we will never deal with symbolic refs here?
