DESCRIPTION

ObjectIdSubclassMap: Micro-optimize wrapping at end of table

During a review of the class, Josh Bloch pointed out we can use
"i = (i + 1) & mask" to wrap around at the end of the table, instead
of a conditional with a branch.  This is generally faster due to one
less branch that will be mis-predicted by the CPU.
