DESCRIPTION

reftable: optimize virtual reftable from collection of refs

One use for Reftable.from() is during a transition from a
large collection of references in a DFS system to reftable.
ByteArrayOutputStream will be inefficient for 866k refs,
but a custom block based buffer that can perform zero-copy
reads into the ReftableReader can manage large ref sets.
