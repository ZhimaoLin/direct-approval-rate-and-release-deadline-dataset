DESCRIPTION

reftable: optimize virtual reftable from collection of refs

One use for Reftable.from() is during a transition from a
large collection of references in a DFS system to reftable.
ByteArrayOutputStream will be inefficient for 866k refs,
but a custom block based buffer that can perform zero-copy
reads into the ReftableReader can manage large ref sets.

Abandoned

Turns out we aren't going to use this, and its 160 lines of unique code. Someone can revive this change if that changes in the future.
