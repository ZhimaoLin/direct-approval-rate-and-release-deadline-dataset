some content in the filesystem. This can be used by tests to prepare
commits in the working-tree and set the index in one shot.

Line:246, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> To be safe you also need an inserter.flush() and inserter.release().  I think I'm going to cherry-pick this onto master and fix it myself.
