DESCRIPTION

Remove streaming delta support from JGit

Streaming packed deltas is so slow that it never feasibly completes
(it will take hours for it to stream a few hundred megabytes on
relatively fast systems with a large amount of storage).  This
was indicated as a "failed experiment" by Shawn in the following
mailing list post:
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01674.html

Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> This test now checks for really big delta objects throwing an exception because they cannot be handled in a Java byte[].

Thanks for redoing that test, Shawn! This will certainly help improve reliability when handling large deltas -- which seems to be a favorite of some people at the day job. ;)
