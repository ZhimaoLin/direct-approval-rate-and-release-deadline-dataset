DESCRIPTION

BaseReceivePack: fix reading cert lines in command loop

Add a missing continues to prevent falling through to the command
parsing section. The first continue happens when the command list is
empty, so change the condition to see whether we have read the first
line, rather than any commands.

Fix comparison to BEGIN_SIGNATURE to use raw line with newline.
