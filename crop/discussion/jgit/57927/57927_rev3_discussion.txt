DESCRIPTION

Increment usage counter if opening pack files on closed repository

If pack files were opened after Repository.close() without calling
Repository.incrementOpen(), a close() on the repository would not free
up any resources and opened pack files will leak file descriptors.

To prevent this, increment repository use counter if pack file is opened
on closed repository.
