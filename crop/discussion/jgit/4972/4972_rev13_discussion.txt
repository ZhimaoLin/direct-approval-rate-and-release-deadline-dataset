DESCRIPTION

Adapt Status and CleanCommand to support cleaning directories

This adds the possibility to:

 * retrieve untracked directories from the status
 * instruct the CleanCommand to clean those directories.
 * retrieve ignored paths from the status
 * instruct the CleanCommand to leave those ignored paths alone
