DESCRIPTION

Adapt Status and CleanCommand to support cleaning directories

This adds the possibility to:

 * retrieve untracked directories from the status
 * instruct the CleanCommand to clean those directories.
 * retrieve ignored paths from the status
 * instruct the CleanCommand to leave those ignored paths alone

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> - Be very careful with startsWith on paths
