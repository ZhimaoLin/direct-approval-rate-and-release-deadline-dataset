Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> curlies not needed here

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> I'm not a huge fan of continuing to to a label.

How about populating filters with all the untracked entries and then remove entries that match the untracked folder prefix?

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> does that pay? it sounds more complicate (to read and to write) than this 4-liner...

i don't have strong feelings for "my" code, i'm just wondering ... :D

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> How is it more complicated?

    Set<String> filtered = new TreeSet<String>(untracked);
    for (String file : untracked)
        for (String folder: untrackedFolders)
            if (file.startsWith(folder)) {
                filtered.remove(file);
                break;
            }
