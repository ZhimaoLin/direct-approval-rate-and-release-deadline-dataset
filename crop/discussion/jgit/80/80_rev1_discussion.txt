DESCRIPTION

Add locking capability to the IO SPI based on Java Concurrency Lock API

The lock implementation for local FS has 2 layer for locking, first JVM
level using the Java Concurrency API and second level is in local FS and
its Git specific *.lock files.

This change basically replaces the LockFile implementation in JGit Lib.
