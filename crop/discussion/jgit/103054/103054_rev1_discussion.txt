DESCRIPTION

Do not apply pushInsteadOf to existing pushUris

Per the git config documentation[1], pushInsteadOf is ignored when
a remote has explicit pushUris.

Implement this, and adapt tests.

Up to now JGit mistakenly applied pushInsteadOf also to existing
pushUris. If some repositories had relied on this mis-feature,
pushes may newly suddenly fail (the uncritical case; the config
just needs to be fixed) or even still succeed but push to unexpected
places, namely to the non-rewritten pushUrls (the critical case).

The release notes should point out this change.
