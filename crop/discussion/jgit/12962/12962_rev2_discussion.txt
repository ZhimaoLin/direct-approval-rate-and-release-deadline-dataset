Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Yes, the current code base assigns plenty to parameters. If we want to consistently switch to a different style to make it easier to inspect the original values of parameters in a debugger, that might be worthwhile, but that would mean first fixing most instances of the existing idiom and then flipping the flag.

So this looks like a good change.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Should make the same change in org.eclipse.jgit.archive, too.
