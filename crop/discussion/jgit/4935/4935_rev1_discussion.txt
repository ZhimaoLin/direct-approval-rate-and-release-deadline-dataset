DESCRIPTION

Make sure checkout is not deleting folders outside the workingtree

There was a chance that jgit deletes symbolic links which point to the
folder on top of the working tree. Make sure not to touch these
resources.

That's an important bugfix since without it we may delete files outside of the git repo. Any comments? If not I'll add this fix without any other review.

Could a test case be added for this?

I try to setup a test case for this. The problem is that
I need a symbolic link in the setup. http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/m/776910/#msg_776910 describes how to reproduce the error manually. 

In short the following went wrong: whenever we deleted something during checkout we called removeEmptyParent() which should remove the parent folder of the file if the parentfolder is now empty. This is done recursively until we hit the first folder we can't delete. In 99% this will stop at least when we reach the top-level folder of the repo (the one on top of .git). The toplevel folder is never empty - deletion will always fails.
UNLESS you face this: /home/repo1 -> /home/repo2 (symbolic link). If you have a jgit repo opened on /home/repo1 then a delete on toplevel folder succeeds. It will just delete the symbolic link.

now you should be able to create a test case using FileUtil.createSymLink() available in the new java7 bundle
