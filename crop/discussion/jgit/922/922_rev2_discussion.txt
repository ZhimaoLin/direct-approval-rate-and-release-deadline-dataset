DESCRIPTION

Add MutableObjectId.copyFrom(AnyObjectId)

This simplifies the PackIndex code, which is trying to quickly copy
an existing ObjectId into a MutableObjectId.  Rather than having
the PackIndex violate the ObjectId's internals, expose a copy from
function similar to the other ones for copying from raw byte arrays
or hex formatted strings.
