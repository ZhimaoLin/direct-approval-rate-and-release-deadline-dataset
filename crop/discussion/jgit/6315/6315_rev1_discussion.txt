(3 inline comments)

I like the feature. Some fixes for error handling and a test is missing.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/errors/NoSuchParentException.java -> You should put your name here.

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> This message 'commitIsAMergeButNoMainlineWasSpecified' has no parameters. But you specify two parameters here. Thats a bug.

I suggest that you write a test in CherryPickCommandTest where you also explicitly produce these two errors and check that the exceptions are thrown. Otherwise we will overlook this kind of bugs.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> This message 'invalidCommitParentNumber' has no parameters. But you specify two parameters here.

Patch Set 1:

Just one comment: I you introduce a new feature then please try to do it in a fixed set of changes (ideally in one change). Please don't abandon a change and publish a fixed version in a new change. Reworked revision of a feature should always come in the same change as the the previous revision. Are you familiar with gerrit and know how to push reworked versions? See "Uploading a replacement patch" in source.android.com/source/submit-patches.html

@Christian
Like you have noticed I am new to the concept, but I am really desperate to get this feature into a release. I will probably have some more in the future and it takes time for me to get my head around so I'd be grateful if you could help me out with this one and contribute. Thanks.
