DESCRIPTION

Implement the no-done capability

Native Git clients may request both multi_ack_detailed and no-done
in the same request to prevent the client from needing to send a
"done" line to the server in response to a server's "ACK %s ready".

For smart HTTP, this can save 1 full HTTP RPC in the fetch exchange,
improving overall latency when incrementally updating a client that
has not diveraged very far from the remote repository.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I've also proposed this to C Git. We should wait for them to adopt the capability before committing the feature to JGit. Its likely they will accept the name, but I don't want to go through a name change if someone on the C Git mailing list rejects the name "no-done".
