DESCRIPTION

Implement the no-done capability

Native Git clients may request both multi_ack_detailed and no-done
in the same request to prevent the client from needing to send a
"done" line to the server in response to a server's "ACK %s ready".

For smart HTTP, this can save 1 full HTTP RPC in the fetch exchange,
improving overall latency when incrementally updating a client that
has not diverged very far from the remote repository.
