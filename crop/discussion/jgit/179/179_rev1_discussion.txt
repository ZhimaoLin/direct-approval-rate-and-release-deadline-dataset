Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I almost have sufficient test coverage to make me happy with this change.  The major component missing is pack file access using the dumb protocol, and some more tests around the cases where services are disabled or require authentication in order to be activated.  I'll try to knock that out tomorrow and update the change then.
