DESCRIPTION

Cleanup: message reporting for HTTP redirect handling

The addition of "tooManyRedirects" in commit 7ac1bfc ("Do
authentication re-tries on HTTP POST") was an error I didn't
catch after rebasing that change. That message had been renamed
in the earlier commit e17bfc9 ("Add support to follow HTTP
redirects") to "redirectLimitExceeded".

Also make sure we always use the TransportException(URIish, ...)
constructor; it'll prefix the message given with the sanitized URI.
Change messages to remove the explicit mention of that URI inside the
message. Adapt tests that check the expected exception message text.

For the info logging of redirects, remove a potentially present
password component in the URI to avoid leaking it into the log.

Why are we able to merge this change in less than a day and not https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/101581 in more than a month? Does anyone has an answer?
