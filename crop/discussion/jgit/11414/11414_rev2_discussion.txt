DESCRIPTION

Extend FileUtils.rename to common git semantics

Unlike the OS or Java rename this method will (on *nix) try (on Windows)
replace the target with the source provided the target does not exist,
the target does exist and is a file, or if it is a directory which only
contains directories. In the latter case the directory hierarchy will be
deleted.
If the initial rename fails and the target is an existing file the the
target file will be deleted first and then the rename is retried.

Patch Set 2:

Robin, I propose here the modifcation for FileUtils.rename() and squashed it together with your previous change 11413 (where you added rename tests). Without the modifications here one test will not succeed on windows, that's why I squashed.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> The typical case is that dst is a file. Wouldn't it therefore be faster to just attempt to delete the target first. Only if that fails, take the hit for more advanced action.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Sure, you are right. This saves a stat call. Done
