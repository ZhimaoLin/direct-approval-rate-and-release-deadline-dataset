DESCRIPTION

Extend FileUtils.rename to common git semantics

Unlike the OS or Java rename this method will (on *nix) try (on Windows)
replace the target with the source provided the target does not exist,
the target does exist and is a file, or if it is a directory which only
contains directories. In the latter case the directory hierarchy will be
deleted.
If the initial rename fails and the target is an existing file the the
target file will be deleted first and then the rename is retried.

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> We need the other delete if this is a locked file

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Sure? As far as I can see f.delete() and FileUtils.delete(f, 0) is similar besides that one returns false and the other throws and exception. And in this case I would like to use the method returning a boolean.

Or do you mean we need FileUtils.delete(f, RETRY)? Then I agree.
