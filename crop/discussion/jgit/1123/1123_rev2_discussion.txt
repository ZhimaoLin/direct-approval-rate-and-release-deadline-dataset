DESCRIPTION

Added more test cases for RenameDetector

I added test cases to cover the majority of the code. It's not 100%
coverage yet, but the remaining bits are small.

Line:344, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> We should also test what happens when you ask for it to compute here.  It should return a,b,c,d unmodified since these aren't exact renames.
