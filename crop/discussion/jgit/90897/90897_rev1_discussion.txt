DESCRIPTION

Send error messages in text/plain in /info/refs

The /info/refs endpoint doesn't support sideband. In fact, cgit client
cannot parse the response, and the error message JGit sends has been
ignored. Send the message in text/plain with the error HTTP response
code so that it is shown to the users.
