DESCRIPTION

Send error messages in text/plain in /info/refs

The /info/refs endpoint doesn't support PKT-LINE style error format. In
fact, cgit client cannot parse the response, and the error message JGit
sends has been ignored. Send the message in text/plain with the error
HTTP response code so that it is shown to the users.

Line:215, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitSmartHttpTools.java -> I think I am a little confused about the problem you are trying to fix here.

If the client sent a service parameter its a smart-HTTP client and it is supposed to accept an error message like this.

Line:216, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitSmartHttpTools.java -> /info/refs should only be accessed by GET. There should never be a body.

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitSmartHttpTools.java -> Use try-finally?
