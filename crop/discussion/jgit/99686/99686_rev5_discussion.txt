DESCRIPTION

Fix bug in multiple tag handling on DescribeCommand

In the case of multiple tags on the same commit, jgit previously
only ever looked at the last of those tags; git behaviour is to
return the first tag (or first matching one if --match is
specified).

Bug: 518377

Patch Set 5:

I couldn't get Gerrit to accept a change with multiple commits, therefore this changeset now only includes the bugfix commit.

Separate changeset 99772 includes the CLI addition.

Note that I would expect the builds for 99772 to fail until the code in this changeset has been merged.
