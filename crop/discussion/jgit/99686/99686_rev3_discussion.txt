added a couple of tests, testDescribeCommitMultiMatch shows a difference to native git's describe command

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DescribeTest.java -> Here jgit describe yields v2.1.1 but git yields v2.0.0. It seems git picks the first match if multiple patterns match on the same commit

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DescribeTest.java -> Hi Matthias - thank you for adding the tests.  I could have sworn I'd looked for a `DescribeTest` class without success, but yesterday there were many distractions - apologies for that.

I'll look into this test failure and address shortly.
