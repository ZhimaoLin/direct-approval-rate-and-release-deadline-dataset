Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/InMemoryOutputStream.java -> nit: this blank line is unnecessary. It shouldn't have appeared in the source, you can delete it here.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> Please add a note that closing the returned InputStream has no effect on the DfsOutputStream.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> It would be easier to drop the static keyword and let the compiler manage the "this" pointer to the containing class.

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> buf.capacity() would also work. And has symmetry with what you do in the constructor to make buf.hasRemaining() false.

Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> version="[3.0.0,3.1.0)"

All done, maybe a Gerrit bug where my draft comments were sent but didn't result in an email?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> Actually what we want is limit(). I agree about the symmetry, though, so I changed the constructor to use limit() (which equals capacity() on a freshly allocated buffer, of course).
