Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> You don't need this field, see below.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> I think it would be simpler to just allocate the ByteBuffer in the constructor. IIRC on a new buffer remaining() will be 0.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> off should be p here, and since len isn't adjusted during the loop this should be len - n.

This sort of bug is often why I just modify the arguments even though this is against the JGit warning policy in Eclipse. Whoever enabled that warning in our project settings is a bit too paranoid and in many functions trying to follow it actively hurts the readability of the code.

Line:150, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> I think I would implement this method as:

  public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    int cnt = 0;
    while (0 < len) {
      if (!buf.hasRemaining()) {
        buf.rewind();
        int nr = os.read(position, buf);
        if (nr < 0)
          break;
        position += nr;
        buf.flip();
      }

      int n = Math.min(len, buf.remaining());
      buf.get(b, off, n);
      off += n;
      len -= n;
      cnt += n;
    }
    if (cnt == 0 && len > 0)
      throw new EOFException();
    return cnt;
  }

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> The classical hack is to implement read() like this:

  byte[] b = new byte[1];
  int n = read(b);
  return n == 1 ? b[0] & 0xff : -1;

Its almost never used and this form is short and easy to read.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> From my reading of your comments below, this field is still needed, it can just be final.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsOutputStream.java -> Done. (Doesn't start with remaining() == 0 but easy to fix.)
