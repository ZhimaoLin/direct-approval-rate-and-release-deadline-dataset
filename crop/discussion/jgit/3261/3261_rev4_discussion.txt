DESCRIPTION

Attempt to make git prefix detection more reliable

This fix makes sure the readPipe methods drains the stderr
pipe and close the subprocess' stdin stream before reading
the process outputs.

I never managed to repeat the reported problem myself, so this
may help in diagnosing the probelm on other peoples machines.
