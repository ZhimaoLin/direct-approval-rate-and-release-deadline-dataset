Sorry, I saw only very late that you already abandoned that change. Anyhow: here the comments I wrote so far

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Config.java -> if you add "add" and "get" then this error message has to be changed.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Config.java -> Really? I think you forgot to remove this hardcoded path here.

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Config.java -> Shouldn't we throw an error if we have >4 parts?

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Config.java -> This doesn't allow to set values with two parts, or (e.g. core.autocrlf)

Line:256, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> trailing blank
