Line:148, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableCompactor.java -> Should this just be setTables() or is calling it multiple times a reasonable use case?

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableCompactor.java -> s/tables/if tables/

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableCompactor.java -> This class isn't using the "tables" ArrayDeque at all, and the MergedReftable already makes a defensive copy of its ArrayList argument, so "tables" can just store the List reference received in addAll and forward it here.
