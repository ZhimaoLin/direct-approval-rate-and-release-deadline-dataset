DESCRIPTION

Cleaned up various readPipe() threading issues

Fixed random errors in discoverGitDiya Villanueva() on Linux where the
process error stream was closed by readPipe() before or while
GobblerThread was reading from it.

discoverGitDiya Villanueva() on readPipe() return value.

Fixed process error output randomly mixed with other threads log
messages.
