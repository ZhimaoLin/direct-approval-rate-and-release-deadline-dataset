DESCRIPTION

Generate conflicts and index updates on file mode changes

Add two new special cases to DirCacheCheckout:

Case 1)

  An entry in the working tree and merge tree have different
  modes and different content.

  Prior Outcome: 
    Dirty working tree content is replaced and file mode
    changes are lost.

  New Outcome: 
    Conflict is generated.

Case 2)

  An entry in the index and merge tree have the same content
  but different modes but both modes are file type modes.

  Prior Outcome:
    File mode in working tree is not updated and the working
    directory is dirty.

  New Outcome: 
    Index is updated and the working directory is clean.

Line:755, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> nit-pick: Don't use javadoc-style comments here, one * will do

Line:982, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> wtf, isn't JGitInternalException something more serious?

Of that would be another bug, no need to fix for this commit.

Line:758, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> This code will sometimes produce a conflict if Head and Merge commit are the same. You decide on throwing a conflict without looking at the Head commit and this cannot be true. Try this:

 git init
 echo 1>a
 git add a
 git commit -m initial
 echo 2>b
 git add b
 git commit -m second
 git checkout -b side HEAD~
 echo 3>a
 chmod a+x a
 git add a
 git checkout master

Native git allows the checkout without a conflict although index and working are dirty by all means (content and mode).

What we want to achieve is that during a checkout when we touch a file in the filesystem we should not silently overwrite the files mode. You failed to detect correctly when we touch a file in the filesystem.

Line:755, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Done

Line:758, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Thanks for the thorough review.

I have updated the change to include a check of the head tree as well and added another unit test that I think captures the scenario you outlined that was failing but now passes.
