DESCRIPTION

Generate conflicts and index updates on file mode changes

Add two new special cases to DirCacheCheckout:

Case 1)

  An entry in the working tree, HEAD tree, and merge tree have
  different modes and different content.

  Prior Outcome: 
    Dirty working tree content is replaced and file mode
    changes are lost.

  New Outcome: 
    Conflict is generated.

Case 2)

  An entry in the index and merge tree have the same content
  but different modes but both modes are file type modes.

  Prior Outcome:
    File mode in working tree is not updated and the working
    directory is dirty.

  New Outcome: 
    Index is updated and the working directory is clean.
