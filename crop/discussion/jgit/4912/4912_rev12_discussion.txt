DESCRIPTION

Generate conflicts and index updates on file mode changes

Handle more cases for file mode changes. Especially make sure that the
following cases are handled correctly.

Case 1)

  An entry in the working tree, HEAD tree, and merge tree have
  different modes and different content.

  Prior Outcome:
    Dirty working tree content is replaced and file mode
    changes are lost.

  New Outcome:
    Conflict is generated.

Case 2)

  An entry in the index and merge tree have the same content
  but different modes but both modes are file type modes.

  Prior Outcome:
    File mode in working tree is not updated and the working
    directory is dirty.

  New Outcome:
    Index is updated and the working directory is clean.

Patch Set 12: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I am not sure whether we can solve proper handling of mode changes with our previous attempts to add more if-clauses to the already complicated DirCacheCheckout. So I propose this different attempt: Whenever we test for content equality during checkout we should always look at contentID and file-mode together. There is no case in the current implementation where we should decide differently whether a change is on file-mode or on content.

I also removed the dependency of this proposal to change 4958 (yes, I know, I introduced the dependency). I am not sure whether we want 4958 - but this change is definitely required.

Line:490, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I don't think you need the outer parens here.

What do you think about also changing the flow to something like this to reduce the indentation level:

  if (!mode1.equals(mode2))
    return false;

  return id1 != null ? id1.equals(id2) : id2 == null;
