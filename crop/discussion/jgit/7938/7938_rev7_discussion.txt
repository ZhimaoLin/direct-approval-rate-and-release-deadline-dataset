DESCRIPTION

Break the dependency on RevObject when creating a newObjectToPack().

Update the ObjectReuseAsIs API to support creating new
ObjectToPack with only the AnyObjectId and Git object type. This is
needed to support the future pack index bitmaps, which only contain
this information and do not want the overhead of creating a temporary
object for every ObjectId.
