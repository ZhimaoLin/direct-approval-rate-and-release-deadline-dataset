DESCRIPTION

Refactor IndexPack to not require local filesystem

By moving the logic that parses a pack stream from the network (or
a bundle) into a type that can be constructed by an ObjectInserter,
repository implementations have a chance to inject their own logic
for storing object data received into the destination repository.

The API isn't completely generic yet, there are still quite a few
assumptions that the PackParser subclass is storing the data onto
the local filesystem as a single file.  But its about the simplest
split of IndexPack I can come up with without completely ripping
the code apart.
