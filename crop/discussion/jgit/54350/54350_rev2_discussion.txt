DESCRIPTION

Handle stale file handles on packed-refs file

On a local filesystem the packed-refs file will be orphaned if it
replaced by another client while the current client is reading the old
one.  However, since NFS servers do no keep track of open files, instead
of orphaning the old packed-refs file, such a replacement will cause the
old file to be garbage collected instead.  A stale file handle exception
will be raised on NFS servers if the file is garbage collected (deleted)
on the server while it is being read.  Since we no longer have access to
the old file in these cases, the previous code would just fail.
However, in these cases, reopening the file and rereading it will
succeed (since it will reopen the new replacement file).  So retrying
the read is a viable strategy to deal with stale file handles on the
packed-refs file, implement such a strategy.

Since it is possible that the packed-refs file could be replaced again
while rereading it (multiple consecutive updates can easily occur with
ref deletions), loop on stale file handle exceptions, up to 5 extra
times, trying to read the packed-refs file again, until we either read
the new file, or find that the file no longer exists.  The limit of 5 is
arbitrary, and provides a safe upper bounds to prevent infinite loops
consuming resources in a potential unforseen persistent error condition.
