DESCRIPTION

Cleanup configuration of Maven JUnit runner

Set the plugin version in the top-level pom, not the unit test pom.
This ensures the same plugin is used for all JUnit tests within the
overall project.

Drop the include **/*Test.java definition, as its no longer necessary
with the JUnit 4 based test suite.  All of the test classes now end
with "Test" and xxx@xxx.xxx annotations on the test methods.
