DESCRIPTION

Add a grace period for packfiles during GC

For loose objects an expiration date can be set which will save too
young objects from being deleted. Add the same for packfiles. Packfiles
which are too young are not deleted.

The change looks good to me. I ran garbage collection stress test and the build including this fix looks stable to me.
