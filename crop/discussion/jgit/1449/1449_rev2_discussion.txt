DESCRIPTION

Wait for JIT optimization before measuring diff performance

On Mac OS X MyerDiffPerformanceTest was failing since during the
first few tests the JIT compiler is running in parallel slowing down
the tests. When setting the JVM option -Xbatch forcing the JIT to do
its work prior to running the code this effect can be avoided. Instead
we chose to run some tests without recording prior to the recorded
tests since relying on -X JVM parameters isn't portable across JVMs.
Also improve formatting of performance readings.
