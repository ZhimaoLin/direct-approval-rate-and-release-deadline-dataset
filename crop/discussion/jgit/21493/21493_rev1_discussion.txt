Failing to delete a directory with untracked content is actually ok

We had a test, but it was wrong.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Shouldn't we also check that file still exists? We had a successful merge operation which tried to delete a parent folder of file. We should make sure that file survived.

Other than that this fix looks good to me.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> +1.

Apart from that, I'm not sure how to add another test case that tests the problem that https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/6326/2 fixed, as we would have to make deleting the file fail somehow. The original problem from bug 354099 has a test case in MergeCommandTest.java, so I think it's ok.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Maybe write-protecting the directory containing the file could help.
