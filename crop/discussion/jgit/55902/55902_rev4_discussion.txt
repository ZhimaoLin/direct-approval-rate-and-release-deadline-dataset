DESCRIPTION

Fix RefDirectory not closing resources

When repositories are opened using the RepositoryCache, they are kept in
memory and when the repository usage counter reaches 0, the
Repository.close method is called which then calls close method on its
reference and object databases.

The problem is that RefDirectory.close method was a no-op and the
reference database was kept in memory. This problem is only happening
when opening a repository using the RepositoryCache because it never
evicts repositories, it's just calling the close method.

I fixed the different areas that suffered performance degradation because of this series of changes.
I did testing to make sure those changes would no longer have performance impacts on our production, we can proceed with them.
