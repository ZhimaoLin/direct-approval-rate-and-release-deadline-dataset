Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/AlarmQueue.java -> For me, AlarmQueue doesn't match the description of the class and its purpose.

It's sounds like a queue you must use to raise an alarm, not a queue to run task in background.

BackgroundQueue, DefaultQueue, PeriodicQueue, WorkQueue...?

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/AlarmQueue.java -> public?

If this is intended to be reused then it should be possible to use it from other packages too.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/AlarmQueue.java -> We want to ship this with 4.4.1, time is too short and risk too high to squeeze it into 4.4.0. In service release we shouldn't add new API. If needed we can make it public later.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/AlarmQueue.java -> Done

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/AlarmQueue.java -> maybe in a later release
