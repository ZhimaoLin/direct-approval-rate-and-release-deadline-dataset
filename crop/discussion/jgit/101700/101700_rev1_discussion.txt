DESCRIPTION

Make 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile used in ResolveMerger configurable

This change makes it possible for us to configure the 'inCoreLimit' of
LocalFile used in ResolveMerger#insertMergeResult. This change also
increase the default limit from 10MiB to 100MiB, which means files less
than 100MiB will be stored in Heap rather than LocalFile. This should be
relatively more efficient. Besides, LocalFile itself has some risks,
e.g. it may be left behind as garbage in case of failure.
