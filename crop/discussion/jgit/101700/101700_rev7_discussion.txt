DESCRIPTION

Make 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile used in ResolveMerger configurable

This change makes it possible to configure the 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile
used in ResolveMerger#insertMergeResult. Since LocalFile itself has some
risks, e.g. it may be left behind as garbage in case of failure. It should
be good to be able to control the size limit for using LocalFile.
