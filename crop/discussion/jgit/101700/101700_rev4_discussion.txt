DESCRIPTION

Make 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile used in ResolveMerger configurable

This change makes it possible to configure the 'inCoreLimit' of LocalFile
used in ResolveMerger#insertMergeResult. This change also increases the
default limit from 10MiB to 100MiB, which means files less than 100MiB will
be stored in Heap rather than LocalFile.

Since LocalFile itself has some risks, e.g. it may be left behind as garbage
in case of failure. It should be good to be able to control the size limit
for using LocalFile.
