DESCRIPTION

Simplify size test in PackWriter

Clip the configured limit to Integer.MAX_VALUE at the top of the
loop, saving a compare branch per object considered. This can cut
2M branches out of a repacking of the Linux kernel.

Rewrite the logic so the primary path is to match the conditional;
most objects are larger than BLKSZ (16 bytes) and less than limit.
This may help branch prediction on CPUs if the CPU tries to assume
execution takes the side of the branch and not the second.
