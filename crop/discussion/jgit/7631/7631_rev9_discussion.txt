DESCRIPTION

Check for write errors in standard out and exit with error

The underlying problem is that System.out is a PrintWriter and
as such it does not throw exceptions on error, but rather just
sets a flag and continues.

This changes replaces the use of System.out with a PrintWriter-like
writer that does not catch error, but instead throw them to the
caller.
