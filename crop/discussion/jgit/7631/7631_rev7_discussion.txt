DESCRIPTION

Check for write errors in standard out and exit with error

The underlying problem is that System.out is a PrintWriter and
as such it does not throw exceptions on error, but rather just
sets a flag and continues.

This changes replaces the use of System.out with a PrintWriter-like
writer that does not catch error, but instead throw them to the
caller.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Mostly LGTM, two nits and a suggestion on dealing with System.err failing.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> s/occurs/occurred/. But this should also be a translated string in CLIText.

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> exit(43)? At this point yea, you are stuck. You can't report anything. But we can try to use a special exit status that users who are really stuck and not getting error back can do "echo $?" after running the bad JGit command get back 43, which if we don't use anywhere else we can define to mean "yea well that means your JRE's System.err is broken, try fixing that first!".

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/ThrowingPrintWriter.java -> final

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> Done

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> That's probably either disk full or the reader exited. I'm not sure there is much point in making it different. C programs seems to return 141 if stdout or stderr is broken (same), but 1 if disk is full and we cannot tell whither error occurred.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/ThrowingPrintWriter.java -> Done
