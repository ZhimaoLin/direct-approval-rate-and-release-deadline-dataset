DESCRIPTION

Check for write errors in standard out and exit with error

The underlying problem is that System.out is a PrintWriter and
as such it does not throw exceptions on error, but rather just
sets a flag and continues.

This changes replaces the use of System.out with a PrintWriter-like
writer that does not catch error, but instead throw them to the
caller.

Line:15, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Make this public and make it available to any command type class. Actually I might just say put it in the main JAR under the io.util package.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Don't we have a test for isWindows somewhere that doesn't depend on testing "Windows" as a string in application level code?

System.getProperty("line.separator") may be more accurate here. Its what PrintWriter uses by default.

Fields should be declared before constructors, and especially before their first use.

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/JGitPrintWriter.java -> I probably would have used print(String.valueOf(value)) so that we only touch the real Writer in one place, print(String).

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Inline s and save a line of code:

  print(String.format(fmt, args));

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Does PrintWriter NPE when passed print(null), or does it use String.valueOf() which IIRC protects against null by writing "null"?
