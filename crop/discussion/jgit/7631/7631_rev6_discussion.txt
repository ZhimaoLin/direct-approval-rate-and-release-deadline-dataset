DESCRIPTION

Check for write errors in standard out and exit with error

The underlying problem is that System.out is a PrintWriter and
as such it does not throw exceptions on error, but rather just
sets a flag and continues.

This changes replaces the use of System.out with a PrintWriter-like
writer that does not catch error, but instead throw them to the
caller.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Would a more descriptive name be more appropriate, now that it's in the general JGit package? E.g. ThrowingPrintWriter or NonCatchingPrintWriter.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Vote: 
PrintWriter (same name different package)
PrintWriter2 (seems popular in Eclipse for fixing interfaces).

the other ones are too long.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/JGitPrintWriter.java -> Same name different package is dangerous if it competes against something from java.io namespace. PrintWriter2 is non-descriptive. The Eclipse practice is for extending interfaces with new functionality in a backwards-compatible way. This doesn't extend PrintWriter with new functionality, it's an alternative.

IMO, a longer descriptive name is better than a short non-descriptive one, especially for API.
