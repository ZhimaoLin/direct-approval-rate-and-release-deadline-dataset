DESCRIPTION

Add tests for racy git / Index state encoding

In order to test racy git situations we have to be able to control
the last-modification timestamps of the filesystem. Since we already
access the modification timestamps of files through an abstraction
(the WorkingTreeIterator) I add a new implementation of this iterator
which allows to map timestamp-ranges to single constant timestamps.
For users of this iterator it looks like all files in that range
have been modified at exactly the same time.
With the help of this iterator a test has been writting which
checkes for racy git handling (smudging, unsmudging, dirty-detection).

Additionally add a method to RepositoryTestCase which encodes the
current index state in one String. This should include info about
pathes, file/index modtime, smudgeState, clean-state. Make
sure timestamps are presented in a way that it is easy to
write assertions against this strings (no concrete milliseconds
but t0,t1,...).

These two topics depend circulary on each other: thats why they have
been squashed in one commit.

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Style-nit:  Remove commented out code.

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Why deleteOnExit?  If you create this file in the trash directory for this test, it will be cleaned up automatically when the test ends.  We also can delete it when the function returns.

Line:227, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Please don't use platform encoding in tests.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> Please only declare variables within the scope they are needed, like inside of the while loop.

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> This message index/file is the opposite of what the string actually is.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

(5 inline comments)



Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Done

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> I don't wanted the file to be in the working-dir (where trash files go) because I inspect the work-dir in my tests. But I choose your other proposal to delete it directly in this method.

Line:227, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Done

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> really, that's new to me. I have no problems doing so. But I personally never liked used declarations inside loops. No long discussion about style: if it's the style we use in jgit - so be it.

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> Done
