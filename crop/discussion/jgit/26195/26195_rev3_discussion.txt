Line:382, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> If retry = 0 you never try, just always fail. That is a bug.

I think retry more than once is unnecessary here. Historically we have never observed this method of temporary directory creation failing. Just write the method with at most one retry in it and call it "good enough".

Line:385, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> If you pass null to the other form, it does what you want. So you don't need the conditional here.

Line:392, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> mkdirs is overkill. The parent directory must already exist for createTempFile() to work. So you can just use:

  if (!tmp.mkdir())
    it failed :(

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> I don't think you can have a null suffix on some platforms. Use ".git" for the bare repository?

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Clone the repository bare, and then open it with FileRepository and use an ObjectReader to pull the contents out.

Line:197, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> When the InputStream here is closed, you should delete that temporary repository.

Line:553, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> src might be a shorter and more descriptive name than result.

Line:555, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> You need to close result.stream.

Line:558, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> This doesn't fit on one line? It looks like it would still be shorter than line 555 if it was one line.

Line:649, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> unnecessary

Line:649, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> That will leave the copied file dirty at super-project work tree. Since we'll commit it for bare super-projects, we should commit it here, too.

Line:649, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> No I meant the "this." part. git here is this.git. So you don't have to say "this.git". You can just write "git".
