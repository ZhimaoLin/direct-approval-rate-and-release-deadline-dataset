DESCRIPTION

Change sequence of checks in IndexDiffFilter.include()

I suggest moving the 'isSubtree' check in IndexDiffFilter.include() up
for the following reason: when an ignored folder is processed,
DirCache's rawmode is 0 (dm == 0). But running into the for-loop is
not necessary.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> This causes us to always dive into all ignored folders.

If the ignored folder is a build output directory, we may be looking at millions of file paths that are all ignored, and that we don't care about, anywhere.

By putting the check after the DirCache code below we can safely skip ignored directories, but only if there are no tracked files within the ignored directory.  (If a file is tracked, it is should always be looked at, even if it is also ignored.)

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> Okay, I did not take the 'magic' of DirCache into account. Now I understand that for an ignored folder, that does not contain any (previously) tracked files, the rawmode of the DirCache entry is 0 (which allows the original implemantation to skip the entire folder). Whereas for folders (ignored or not), that contain tracked files, the rawmode is not 0. Or to put it in other words: DirCache only contains folders, if they contain tracked files...
