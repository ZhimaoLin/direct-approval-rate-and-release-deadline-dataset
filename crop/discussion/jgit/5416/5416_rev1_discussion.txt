DESCRIPTION

RFC: RenameCallback behaves incorrectly

Adds a failing test case to show that the RenameCallback is called not
only for the rename of one commit. As soon as revWalk.next() is called
the first time, the method "renamed" is called for all the renames which
had ever happened.

Patch Set 1:

The behavior is certainly a surprise. 

There is also no reasonable way, it seems, to find out which commit resulted in a recorded diffentry.
