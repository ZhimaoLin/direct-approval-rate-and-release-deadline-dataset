Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/patch/HunkHeader.java -> I don't want to change the parser into this nasty for loop and switch.

Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/patch/HunkHeader.java -> I agree. Don't abstract things that are clear as a day already. The proposed change makes it much harder to understand the

figure it out.
