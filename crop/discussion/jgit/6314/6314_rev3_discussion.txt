DESCRIPTION

Fix patch application WRT windows line endings.

Previously the result of an application would have been \r\r\n in the
case of windows line endings, as RawText does not touch the \r, and
ApplyCommand adds "\r\n" if this is the ending of the first line in the
target file. Only always adding \n should be ok, since \r\n would be the
result if the file and the patch include windows line endings.

Also add according test.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The current implementation is definitely wrong in this particular case, the output is "a\r\r\nd\r\r\nc\r\r\n\r\r\n\r". Your fix removes the extra "\r", but when doing the same in console [1] I get "a\rd\rd\rc\r". I think what you suggested (preserving Windows line endings) is what we need, but I would like to hear a second opinion.

Patch Set 3:

Just wondering... maybe apply shouldn't try to be
so smart and use the same logic as core.autocrlf instead?

A dumb question, haven't checked that: does this option affect the way apply works?
