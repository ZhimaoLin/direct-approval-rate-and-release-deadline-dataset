DESCRIPTION

Update bitmap selection throttling to fully span active branches.

Replace the “bitmapCommitRange” parameter that was recently introduced
with two new parameters: “bitmapExcessiveBranchCount” and
“bitmapInactiveBranchAgeInDays”. If the count of branches does not
exceed “bitmapExcessiveBranchCount”, then the current algorithm is kept
for all branches.

If the branch count is excessive, then the commit time for the tip
commit for each branch is used to determine if a branch is “inactive”.
"Active" branches get full commit selection using the existing
algorithm. "Inactive" branches get fewer bitmaps near the branch tips.

Introduce a "contiguousCommitCount" parameter that always enforces that
the N most recent commits in a branch are selected for bitmaps. The
previous nextSelectionDistance() algorithm created anywhere from 1-100
contiguous bitmaps at branch tips.

For example, consider a branch with commits numbering 0-300, with 0
being the most recent commit. If the most recent 200 commits are not
merge commits and the 200th commit was the last one selected,
nextSelectionDistance() returned 100, causing commits 200-101 to be
ignored. Then a window of size 100 was evaluated, searching for merge
commits. Since no merge commits are found, the next commit (commit 0)
was selected, for a total of 1 commit in the topmost 100 commits.

If instead the 250th commit was selected, then by the same logic
commit 50 is selected. At that point nextSelectionDistance() switches to
selecting consecutive commits, so commits 0-50 in the topmost 100
commits are selected. The "contiguousCommitCount" parameter provides
more determinism by always selecting a constant number or topmost
commits.

Add an optimization to break out of the inner loop of selectCommits() if
all of the commits for the current branch have already been found.

When reusing bitmaps from an existing pack, remove unnecessary
populating and clearing of the writeBitmaps/PackBitmapIndexBuilder.

Add comments to PackWriterBitmapPreparer, rename methods and variables
for readability.

Add tests for bitmap selection with and without merge commits and with
excessive branch pruning triggered.

Note: I will follow up with an additional change that exposes the new
parameters through PackConfig.

Patch Set 2:

The test failure is again unrelated to my change:
java.io.IOException: Writing of 'tester-1445391864422.jgit/' failed: 403 Forbidden
	at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.AmazonS3.error(AmazonS3.java:527)

The original change was split into 3: 
1) https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/58526/ "Push control of time into MockSystemReader"
2) This current change
3) Follow up that exposes control of GC parameters through PackConfig.

Looks good from a quick glance. I like the tests.

I'll be more comfortable if someone (could be me later today) takes a closer look, but even in the worst case this is in much better shape for someone to make tweaks and bugfixes. Thanks for writing it.
