interested in connectivity check.

Line:72, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsFsck.java -> false is the default, so this assignment isn't needed.

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsFsck.java -> s/the fsck only check/the fsck will only check/

Or:

xxx@xxx.xxx connectivityOnly
   whether fsck should bypass object validity and integrity
   checks and only check connectivity. The default is false,
   meaning to run all checks.

It's probably also worth mentioning somewhere that this is JGit's equivalent of "git fsck --connectivity-only".
