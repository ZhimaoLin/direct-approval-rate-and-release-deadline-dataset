DESCRIPTION

Stop PathFilter after walking all matching paths

After the current path of the TreeWalk is no longer a prefix of the
PathFilter's path, there can be no more matching entries, but TreeWalk
will happily keep walking the rest of a (potentially very large and
recursive) tree unless StopWalkException is thrown. So, throw
StopWalkException from PathFilter.include() at the earliest
opportunity.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathFilter.java -> How does this work together with an OrTreeFilter? 

Just because this filter has passed the end, doesn't mean an alternative filter could not match later treewalker entries.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathFilter.java -> Good catch Robin, this breaks an OrTreeFilter. That might be why this never threw the exception before.

The alternative implementation is PathFilterGroup. If you create a PathFilterGroup with exactly 1 entry it uses the implementation that Dave tried to add to PathFilter.

I think we should revert this change and Dave should modify his calling code to use PathFilterGroup.create() with a single path.

One can argue that PathFilterGroup also breaks an OrTreeFilter, but its behavior has always been to throw and break an OrTreeFilter, and its always been documented to do that.
