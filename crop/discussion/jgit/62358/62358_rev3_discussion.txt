DESCRIPTION

Don't assume name = path in .gitmodules

While parsing .gitmodules, the name of the submodule subsection is
purely arbitrary: it frequently is the path of the submodule, but
there's no requirement for it to be. By building a map of paths to
the section name in .gitmodules, we can more accurately return
the submodule URL.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Have you rewritten this patch significantly enough from what was done in patch set 1 to justify changing the author?

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Hadn't noticed that. But I think as non-committer I cannot forge author identities on Gerrit and thus Gerrit would reject an update if I only changed the committer?

Just tried pushing with Doug set as author and apparently it gets rejected even earlier by the foundation's validation hook:

  Authored by: Skyler Fitzpatrick xxx@xxx.xxx

  The author is not a committer on the project.
  error: The author does not have a current Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA) on file.

So what now? Assume I changed enough, or drop all this, find some other way to implement this, and then push a completely new change?

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Gah, I forgot about this limitation, which I also ran into a few times before I was a committer.

One suggestion is that I pull this commit and push again with Doug as author, but remove the additional change in the tests that you added, which you could then add in a follow-up change separately so that you keep authorship of that work.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well, you can try. But I suspect the validation hook will reject your push, too, if the author is set to Doug.

I consider myself credited sufficiently by the signed-off-by line, so splitting this in two commits is IMO not necessary. Unless you'd want to have a 100% correct blame history in the repository. OTOH, by resurrecting this old change I have kind of assumed responsibility for it, so having my name show up for this change isn't that wrong either.

It won't.  Committers are allowed to forge the author.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Give it a try. I know that committers can forge identities. I was thinking more about the ECA check.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ah, now I see.  I overlooked that the error is that Doug no longer has a current ECA.

That complicates things.  I'm not sure if we can use this commit at all if the author doesn't have any ECA.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Don't know either. He evidently _did_ have one when he authored the original contribution and pushed it to Gerrit.

response from the legal team:

As Doug contributed under a valid CLA in 2015, there is no issue with accepting the contribution. Doug should be listed as an additional author by using the “Also-By” entry in the Git Commit Record.
