DESCRIPTION

Don't assume name = path in .gitmodules

While parsing .gitmodules, the name of the submodule subsection is
purely arbitrary: it frequently is the path of the submodule, but
there's no requirement for it to be.  By building a map of paths to
the section name in .gitmodules, we can more accurately return
the submodule URL.

I'm not sure this is the cleanest way to do this, but it should solve the particular case I've seen, where the name is an arbitrary string.  Perhaps it'd be a good idea to provide a function to return the subsection name, too.

Do we need a test for such a case?

(As a comment from someone who is mainly fluent in C git and is involved in the submodule code there lately), in CGit the submodules are cached by name and path, so it is easy to lookup by either. From the fundamental design it should be enough to only have a byName lookup and then a path->name mapping as you did here.

Line:612, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> Why do we need to have the null check here and at the places further down?

Would it make sense to ensure that it cannot be null before?

Thanks for the prompt reply, Stefan! I think you're right, a test case is probably warranted here, just to make sure we don't break any existing permutations, but I at least wanted to get this recorded somewhere before I forgot about it.

Line:612, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> I did this mostly out of an abundance of caution.  If we get into this case and the path -> section name mapping doesn't exist, we probably have other problems and ought to return null anyway.

I think the problem with checking null earlier is we may have changed our modulesConfig (possibly?), or the SubmoduleWalk may have moved on to a new submodule -- so we can't really check in advance (unless we did the check in next(), which would require we load the .gitmodules config at that point in time).

> Do we need a test for such a case?

I also think we need tests here. At least for cases where name!=path and for invalid module configs which should not throw NPEs.

Line:464, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> How about extracting this in a variable and reuse it in the next statement?

Line:612, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> Shouldn't the null-check also be done on pathToName itself?

And since this ternary expression is repeated in three places it might be better to put it in utility method.

Rebased, cleaned up, added test and bug number in commit message.

Line:464, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> Eliminated altogether. Setting the initial size here is probably not worth it; the default size is fine.

Line:612, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> Done
