DESCRIPTION

Don't assume name = path in .gitmodules

While parsing .gitmodules, the name of the submodule subsection is
purely arbitrary: it frequently is the path of the submodule, but
there's no requirement for it to be. By building a map of paths to
the section name in .gitmodules, we can more accurately return
the submodule URL.
