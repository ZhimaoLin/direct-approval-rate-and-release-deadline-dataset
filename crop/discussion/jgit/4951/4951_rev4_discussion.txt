Patch Set 4:

Original implementation attempt was removed as it was the wrong approach.

I started again, with the tests. Could you please review them so that I know I'll be doing the right thing in the implementation?

Patch Set 4:

I think some tests for "./" style relative URLs are needed as well.

Do you still want to look into implementing the resolution part of it? I have time today to see what the CGit code is doing and mirror the behavior.

Patch Set 4:

It would be really great if you could take over the implementation part! I already spent much more time than originally planned...
