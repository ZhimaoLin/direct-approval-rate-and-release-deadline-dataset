Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/SubmoduleInitCommand.java -> url could be null here which will throw a URISyntaxException which changes the previous behavior or ignoring null url values and still updating the update value.

I think this should be moved to after the check to url != null on line 117

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/SubmoduleInitCommand.java -> curlies not needed

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/SubmoduleInitCommand.java -> curlies not needed

Patch Set 2:

Also, I think the default remote also needs to be considered as the parent path of relative urls.
