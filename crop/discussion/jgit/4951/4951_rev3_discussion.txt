Thanks. Unfortunately, I don't understand what the remote url of the master repository has to do with the url of the submodule. Due to lack of shell scripting knowledge I haven't also been able to completely figure out what resolve_relative_path does. :-(

Maybe someone alese with more knowledge of Git submodules could follow up on this patch to make it really behave like native Git.

Furthermore, I noticed that msysgit uses '/' instead of '\' in the url on Windows, otherwise complaning about an invalid .git/config file. I think jgit should use '/' as well on Windows. Is there a preferred way to check for the platform in jgit?

Patch Set 3:

Here is what the `git help submodule` doc says:


 <repository> is the URL of the new submodule’s origin repository. This may be either an absolute URL, or (if it begins with ./ or ../), the location relative to the superproject’s origin
           repository (Please note that to specify a repository foo.git which is located right next to a superproject bar.git, you’ll have to use ../foo.git instead of ./foo.git - as one might expect
           when following the rules for relative URLs - because the evaluation of relative URLs in Git is identical to that of relative directories). If the superproject doesn’t have an origin
           configured the superproject is its own authoritative upstream and the current working directory is used instead.

org.eclipse.jgut.util.FS can detect on which filesystem type jgit is running, FS_Win32.isWin32() shows how to detect windows.

How's that relevant?

Thanks. Unfortunately, FS_Win32 is not accessible from outside org.eclipse.jgit.util...
