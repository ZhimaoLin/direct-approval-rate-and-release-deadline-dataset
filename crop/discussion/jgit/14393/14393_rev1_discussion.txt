DESCRIPTION

replaced ArrayList<Step> with LinkedList<Step> in RebaseCommand

LinkedList also implements Queue which is more suitable for a
rebase-todo. It also provides peek that can be used to lookup the step
that is probably going to be processed next. This is needed for
squash/fixup.
Reloading the list of steps after each iteration is needed since the
rebase-todo file may change (expecially in long running interactions,
e.g. in edit action calling "git rebase --edit-todo")

If you follow my comments you would also have to change RebaseCommandTest and change List<Step> by Queue<Step> and get(x) by poll().

Line:271, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> I wouldn't expose the concrete implementation (LinkedList) here. Rather I would say

  Queue<Step> steps = loadSteps()

All the methods you call on "steps" are in the Queue interface.

Line:903, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> should be 

	Queue<Step> loadSteps() throws IOException {

Line:907, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> should be 
		Queue<Step> r = new LinkedList<Step>();

Line:271, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> We need a List<Step> reference for prepareSteps(List<Step> steps) in InteractiveHandler (see line 273)

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The reloading is the important part here, should be in the subject line
