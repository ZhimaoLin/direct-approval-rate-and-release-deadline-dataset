DESCRIPTION

Parse the list of steps after each iteration as LinkedList<Step>

Reloading the list of steps after each iteration is needed since the
rebase-todo file may change (expecially in long running interactions,
e.g. in edit action calling "git rebase --edit-todo")

LinkedList also implements Queue which is more suitable for a
rebase-todo. It also provides peek that can be used to lookup the step
that is probably going to be processed next. This is needed for
squash/fixup.
