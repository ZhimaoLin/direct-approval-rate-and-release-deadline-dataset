DESCRIPTION

Throw formal CheckoutConflictException on hard reset

This will allow calling classes to have access to the
conflicts that occurred during the attempted checkout.

Even though setFailOnConflict(false) is called on the
DirCacheCheckout a CheckoutConflictException can still
be thrown if cleanup fails.
