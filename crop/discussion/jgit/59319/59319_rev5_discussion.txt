DESCRIPTION

WIP: Add support for smudge filters

If defined in .gitattributes call smudge filter during checkout.

To support checkout where current HEAD,index do not contain attributes
we need to also consider attributes from the tree we checkout. Therefore
CanonicalTreeParser has to learn how to provide attributes.

TODO: write a test which clones a repo with smudge filters
TODO: TreeWalk.getAttributes should be inspected. Decisions on whether
to search for attributes are done based on iterators which look at the
current entry. But relevant attributes could reside in the other
iterators.
