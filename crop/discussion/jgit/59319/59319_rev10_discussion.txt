DESCRIPTION

Add support for smudge filters

If defined in .gitattributes call smudge filter during checkout.

To support checkout where current HEAD,index do not contain attributes
we need to also consider attributes from the tree we checkout. Therefore
CanonicalTreeParser has to learn how to provide attributes.
