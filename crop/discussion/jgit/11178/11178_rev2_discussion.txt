DESCRIPTION

Simplfy caching of DfsPackDescription from PackWriter.Statistics

Let the pack description copy the relevant stats values. This
moves it out of the garbage collector and compactor algorithms,
co-locating with something that might care.

Remove some unnecessary code from the DfsPackCompactor, the stats
tracks the same information and can supply it.
