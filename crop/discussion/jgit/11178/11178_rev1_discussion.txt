DESCRIPTION

Simplfy caching of DfsPackDescription from PackWriter.Statistics

Let the pack description object handle copying the relevant stats
values. This moves it out of the garbage collector and compactor
algorithms, co-locating with something that might care.

Remove some unnecessary code from the DfsPackCompactor, the stats
tracks the same information and can supply it.
