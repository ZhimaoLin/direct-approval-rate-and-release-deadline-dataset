I'll cherry-pick and fix the one issue with DirCacheEditor not being used.

Line:242, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> DirCacheEditor might have been easier here:

  DirCacheEditor edit = dirc.editor();
  edit.add(new DirCacheEditor.DeletePath(path));
  edit.commit();

:-)
