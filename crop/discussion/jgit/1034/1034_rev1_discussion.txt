DESCRIPTION

Support large whole packed objects as streams

Similar to the loose object support, whole packed objects can
now be streamed back to the caller.  The streaming is less
efficient as we copy the data from the cached window array
into the InflaterInputStream's internal buffer, then inflate
it there before returning to the application.

Like with unpacked objects, there is plenty of room for some
optimization, especially for the copyTo method, where we don't
necessarily need so much buffering to exist.
