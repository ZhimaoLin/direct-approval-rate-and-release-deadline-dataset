DESCRIPTION

Added read/write support for pack index version E003.

Pack index version E003 extends version 2 by including compressed
bitmaps of the object graph. Furthermore, a logical API of the index
functionality is included, as it is expected to be used by the
PackWriter.

Compressed bitmaps are created using the javaewah library, which is a
word-aligned compressed variant of the Java bitset class based on
run-length encoding. The library only works with positive integer
values. Thus, the maximum number of ObjectIds in a pack file that
this index can currently support is limited to Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Every ObjectId is given an integer mapping. The integer is the
position of the ObjectId in the complete ObjectId list, sorted
by offset, for the pack file. That integer is what the bitmaps
use to reference the ObjectId. Currently, the new index format can
only be used with pack files that contain a complete closure of the
object graph e.g. the result of a garbage collection.

The index file includes four bitmaps for the Git object types i.e.
commits, trees, blobs, and tags. In addition, a collection of
bitmaps keyed by an ObjectId is also included. The bitmap for each entry
in the collection represents the full closure of ObjectIds reachable
from the keyed ObjectId (including the keyed ObjectId itself). The
bitmaps are further compressed by XORing the current bitmaps against
prior bitmaps in the index, and selecting the smallest representation.
The XOR'd bitmap and offset from the current entry to the position
of the bitmap to XOR against is the actual representation of the entry
in the index file.

Patch Set 2:

- please add a footer CQ: 6810
- in order to fix the packaging build we need to wait for the jawaEWAH bundle to be approved and available in orbit, update the orbit URL "orbit-site" in [1] and add the corresponding bundle to [2] in order to make it available to OSGi consumers like EGit

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/BasePackBitmapIndex.java -> There is a race condition here that can cause this to go corrupt.

If one thread enters this method and sets out = r.bitmap he now has an XOR compressed bitmap. This isn't a valid bitmap to return to the caller, but its type is correct.

That thread then goes to sleep immediately before executing the while test condition.

Another thread enters this method and also sees the bitmapContainer needs to be expanded. It does the full expansion process and stores bitmapContainer = out, the full bitmap.

The first thread wakes up. When he calls this.xorBitmap() it returns null because the 2nd thread already set bitmapContainer to the expanded bitmap.

The first thread breaks from the loop immediately, overwrites the good expanded bitmap with the XOR version (which is now garbage!), and returns the XOR version to the caller.

Until the PackIndexVE003 is replaced with a new instance (e.g. due to GC or falling out of cache) that particular bitmap will be corrupt and contain inverted results. Any attempt to use such a bitmap will result in a pack being incomplete.

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/BasePackBitmapIndex.java -> That code was brain dead. I updated the code to access bitmapContainer once, so it should be correct now.
