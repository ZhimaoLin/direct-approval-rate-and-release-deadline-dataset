DESCRIPTION

Fix getHumanishName broken for windows paths

Since d1718a the method getHumanishName was broken on windows since
the URIish is not normalized anymore. For a path like
"C:\gitRepositories\egit" the whole path was returned instead of
"egit".

Line:555, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Should we check for Windows platform before replacing "\" with "/"? "\" can be part of file and folder names on UNIX.

Line:555, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> But the only thing we are interested in is the repository name. It should have no "\" inside, because that would not work under windows. Therefore it does not matter if we split the String to often in case there is a "\" in a UNIX folder name.
