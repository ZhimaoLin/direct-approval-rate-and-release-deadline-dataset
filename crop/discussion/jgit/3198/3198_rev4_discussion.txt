DESCRIPTION

Fix getHumanishName broken for windows paths

Since d1718a the method getHumanishName was broken on windows since
the URIish is not normalized anymore. For a path like
"C:\gitRepositories\egit" the whole path was returned instead of
"egit".

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> No. This is now a platform specific test. On Mac OS X and Linux we cannot test that this works correctly for Windows paths.

Please use \\ literally in the test string.
