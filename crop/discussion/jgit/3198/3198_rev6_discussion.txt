DESCRIPTION

Fix getHumanishName broken for windows paths

Since d1718a the method getHumanishName was broken on windows since
the URIish is not normalized anymore. For a path like
"C:\gitRepositories\egit" the whole path was returned instead of
"egit".

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> No. This test will pass on Linux or Mac OS X even if getHumanishName() has been broken.

Remove the conditional and always check the function.

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> But why should a path like file:///C\a\b\c.git/ occur on Linux or Mac OS
X? I thought that this test is only relevant on Windows, and the
method getHumanishName() needs not to take into accout \ on Linux
or Mac OS X. 

For the method getHumanishName() there are many other tests
running on all platforms.

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> Hmm. The test would fail on Mac OS X or Linux because the separatorChar there is '/' and it wouldn't split correctly on '\'.

My point is, the larger the test coverage is on all platforms, the less likely we are to see a regression in any particular platform specific section. For that matter, the less platform specific sections of code we have, the better.

I would prefer being able to also run this test on Mac OS X or Linux and have it correctly test the \ splitting behavior. That means moving the selection of File.separatorChar inside getHumanishName() over to our SystemReader class, and using the MockSystemReader to set it to '\' specifically in this test function. That is perhaps too ugly for something this simple.

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> You could also treat \ as a separator on all platforms. We do that in the rest of this class. Then let someone (else) "fix" whole class (that will be messy...). 

[Deity of your choice] forbid anyone thinks \ is a good character in a name of anything on Linux.
