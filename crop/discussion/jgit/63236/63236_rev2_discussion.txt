DESCRIPTION

Assert JGit creates broken repositories

To fix bug 474973 JGit should write a broken repository by writing
two tree entries for "was_file". Ensure this is true by testing for
the corruption, ensuring JGit still writes it out to the repository,
and verifying ObjectChecker can identify it.
