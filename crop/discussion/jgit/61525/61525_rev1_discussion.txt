I must confess I'm not really happy about this patch - it just fixes the test for now.

It looks like the "repository == null" is used for proper submodules support, this is broken now and better solution would be to understand and fix submodules support in EGit without adding that extra repository field.

Line:448, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Good you found this. I was not executing EGit tests, my fault.

Somehow this looks strange. Why should we store two different repositories? Each treewalk should walk only the working tree for one repo. When we reach points where the workingtree of other repositories (submodules!) start then we should not dive into them. How could the repo of a child differ from the repo of a parent?

I'll investigate further

I found a bug in FileTreeIterator which was up to know hidden. But latest changes for attribute handling let bug pop up and let the egit tests fail. See my change 61826 which I think makes this change  obsolete.
