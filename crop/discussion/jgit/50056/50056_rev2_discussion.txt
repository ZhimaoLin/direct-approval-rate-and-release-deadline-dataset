Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> shouldn't this line be inside the try block? It's sufficient to close git2, that will do all the work ... we don't have to additionally close db2.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Alas, no. CloneCommand constructs a Git using the Git(Repository) constructor, which unlike Git.open assumes the caller is going to close the repository and so does not take responsibility for closing it itself.

It would be nice to change that, but it would be a significant enough backward-incompatible change that it would be best to introduce a new method analagous to cloneRepository and deprecate cloneRepository.

InitCommand has the same bug.
