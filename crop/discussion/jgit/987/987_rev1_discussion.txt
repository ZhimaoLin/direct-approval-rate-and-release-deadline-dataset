DESCRIPTION

Ensure ObjectReader used by PackWriter is released

The ObjectReader API demands that we release the reader when we are
done with it.  PackWriter contains a reader, which it uses for the
entire packing session.  Expose the release of the reader through
a release method on the writer.

This still doesn't address the RevWalk and TreeWalk users, who
don't correctly release their reader.  But its a small step in the
right direction.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:624, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Our caller is supposed to try/finally the PackWriter, calling PackWriter release() which will call reader.release().

Doing a release here early as soon as writing is done is just to try and kick out memory that we don't need to create an index file.  Tossing it into a try/finally here in writePack is probably pointless, if we fail here, we're heading for our caller's finally block anyway.
