DESCRIPTION

Support branches with name 'config'

JGit was not able to lookup refs which had the name of files which exist
in the .git folder. When JGit was looking up a ref named X it has a
fixed set of directories where it searched for files named X
(ignore packed refs for now). First directory to search for is .git. In
case of the ref named 'config' it searched there for this file, found it
(it's the .git/config file with the repo configuration in it), parsed
it, found it is an invalid ref and stopped searching. It never looked
for a file .git/refs/heads/config.

I changed JGit in a way that when it finds a file which corresponds to a
ref name and if this file doesn't contain a valid ref then it will
continue searching in the remaining folders for the right file. If no
further valid file is found then the originally IOException is thrown.
