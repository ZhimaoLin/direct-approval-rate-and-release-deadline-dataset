on Mac using Eclipse SDK 3.2 and EGit 2.0 from today, with this jgit change applied locally I get the error message:

"Cannot list the available branches
Reason: exception caught during execution of ls-remote command"

I'm testing it on Linux through egit 2.0 clone wizard and when I configured invalid set of ssh keys then I got "Auth fail" error message in clone wizard notification area (message in error dialog is different, you need to look at clone wizard header), with valid keys everything works fine.

I'll provide separate change for egit to improve error message in egit clone wizard

Patch Set 1:

ok, I can see the full error message in the notification area of the wizard, but the error dialog doesn't show the error details, if you do that in another change that's fine.
