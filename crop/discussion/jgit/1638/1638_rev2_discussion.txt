DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary hash cache from PatienceDiffIndex

PatienceDiff always uses a HashedSequence, which promises to provide
constant time access for hash codes during the equals method and
aborts fast if the hash codes don't match.  Therefore we don't need
to cache the hash codes inside of the index, saving us memory.
