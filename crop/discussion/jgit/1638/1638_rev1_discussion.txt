DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary hash cache from PatienceDiffIndex

PatienceDiff always uses a HashedSequence, which we know promises
to provide constant time access for hash codes during the equals
method and abort fast if the hash codes don't match.  Therefore
we don't need to cache the hash codes inside of the index, which
saves us memory.
