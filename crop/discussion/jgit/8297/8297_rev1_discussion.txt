Line:457, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryTestCase.java -> I would use getFullBranch() here. The method you use, getBranch(), will additionally shorten the refName which is a feature you don't need here. Additionally this shortening of ref names can lead to problems if you have two refs .git/xyz and .git/refs/heads/xyz and you have checked out .git/refs/heads/xyz.
