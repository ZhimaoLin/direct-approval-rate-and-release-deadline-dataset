DESCRIPTION

Suppress boxing warnings where we know they are ok

The suppression cannot be applied per warning, but
rather per declaration, so we do suppress more warnings
than strictly wanted.

Patch Set 1:

We could also explicitly box them (with Integer.valueOf, etc) where we know it is ok. This way we can make sure that no valid warning is suppressed by accident. What do you think?
