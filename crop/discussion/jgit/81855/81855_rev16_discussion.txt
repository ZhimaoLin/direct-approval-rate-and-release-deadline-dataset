DESCRIPTION

FetchCommand: Add basic support for recursing into submodules

Extend FetchCommand to expose a new method, setRecurseSubmodules(mode),
which allows to set the mode to ON, OFF or ON_DEMAND.

After fetching a repository, its submodules are recursively fetched:

- When the mode is YES, submodules are always fetched.

- When the mode is NO, submodules are not fetched.

- When the mode is ON_DEMAND, submodules are only fetched when the
  parent repository receives an update of the submodule and the new
  revision is not already in the submodule.

The mode is determined in the following order of precedence:

- Value specified in the API call using setRecurseSubmodules.

- Value specified in the repository's config under the key
  submodule.name.fetchRecurseSubmodules

- Defaults to ON_DEMAND if neither of the previous is set.

Extend FetchResult to recursively include results for submodules, as
a map of the submodule path to an instance of FetchResult.

Test setup is based on testCloneRepositoryWithNestedSubmodules.

only a minor enhancement - otherwise looks good to me

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> You force the caller to specifify a Config. Thats expensive because it forces us to check whether all three possible config locations for new data. That effort is not needed if submoduleRecurseMode is explicitly specified. I suggest a signature "getRecurseMode(String path, Repository r)". Then we can do the expensive r.getConfig() only when we need it.
