used by the pull and fetch commands.

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/SubmoduleConfig.java -> * in cgit boolean config values are case insensitive
* in cgit "yes" is equivalent to "1","true","on" and "no" is equivalent to "0","false","off", StringUtils.toBoolean(String) implements this logic

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/SubmoduleConfig.java -> looks like

 Config.getEnum(final T[] all, final String section, final String subsection, final String name, final T defaultValue)

will handle this automatically if you use "true" and "false" instead of "yes" and "no"

Are you planning to extend this to push as well?
If so, the push command also has a "check" value for recursing into submodules.

So far the intention is to add support on fetch and pull.

Thanks, I wasn't aware of that.

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/SubmoduleConfig.java -> As far as I understand from the documentation for example in git-fetch [1] this isn't a boolean on/off setting, but has specific values "yes", "no" and "on-demand" (and "check" for git-push per the comment from Stefan).

The implementation here is based on BranchConfig.BranchRebaseMode.

If case specific handing is needed, then I guess it also needs to be done in BranchRebaseMode.

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/SubmoduleConfig.java -> Hmm.  Looking at the documentation in the git source repository (rather than the online documentation) it seems that

- The setting can be boolean *or* a text value (on-demand, check)

- It's configurable globally for fetch, pull and push, but on on a submodule level only for fetch and pull.
