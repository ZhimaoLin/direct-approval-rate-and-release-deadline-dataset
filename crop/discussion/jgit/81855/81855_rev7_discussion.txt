DESCRIPTION

FetchCommand: Add basic support for recursing into submodules

Extend FetchCommand to expose two new methods:

- setRecurseSubmodules(mode) allows to set the mode to ON, OFF or
  ON_DEMAND.

- setRecurseSubmodules(boolean) allows to set the mode to ON or OFF
  using a boolean argument.

After fetching, submodules are recursively fetched:

- When the mode is YES, submodules are always fetched.

- When the mode is NO, submodules are not fetched.

- When the mode is ON_DEMAND, submodules are only fetched when the
  parent repository receives an update of the submodule.

The mode is determined in the following order of precedence:

- Value specified in the API call using one of the above methods

- Value specified in the repository's submodule.name.fetchRecurseSubmodules
  configuration setting.

- Defaults to ON_DEMAND if neither of the previous is set.

Test setup is based on testCloneRepositoryWithNestedSubmodules.

(3 comments)

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> I tried using native git and found that

 $ git fetch origin --recurse-submodules=yes

does not clone missing repositories, but only

 $ git submodule update

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> I think we should return a map of theFetchResults, and use walk.getPath() as key. And we need a way to return these FetchResults, maybe we could enhance FetchResult to enable recursion for results of nested submodules

Line:250, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> do we really need two ways to specify yes/no ?

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> Done

Line:250, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> I thought it make make it easier for callers, but I guess it's not really needed.  Removed in the latest patch set.
