DESCRIPTION

FetchCommand: Add basic support for recursing into submodules

Extend FetchCommand to expose a new method, setRecurseSubmodules(mode),
which allows to set the mode to ON, OFF or ON_DEMAND.

After fetching a repository, its submodules are recursively fetched:

- When the mode is YES, submodules are always fetched.

- When the mode is NO, submodules are not fetched.

- When the mode is ON_DEMAND, submodules are only fetched when the
  parent repository receives an update of the submodule.

The mode is determined in the following order of precedence:

- Value specified in the API call using setRecurseSubmodules.

- Value specified in the repository's config under the key
  submodule.name.fetchRecurseSubmodules

- Defaults to ON_DEMAND if neither of the previous is set.

Extend FetchResult to recursively include results for submodules, as
a map of the submodule path to an instance of FetchResult.

Test setup is based on testCloneRepositoryWithNestedSubmodules.

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchResult.java -> ugly that this needs to be public, could we push handling of submodules down to FetchProcess ?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchResult.java -> wrap with Collections.unmodifiableMap() to prevent modifications ?

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchResult.java -> That would involve pushing quite a lot of logic down into FetchProcess and/or Transport, which might end up being uglier than this.  For example at that level we don't have any reference to the Repository object, which we need in order to iterate over the submodules.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchResult.java -> Done
