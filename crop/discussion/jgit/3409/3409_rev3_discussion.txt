DESCRIPTION

Create a MergeResult for deleted/modified files

Change Ia2ab4f8dc95020f2914ff01c2bf3b1bc62a9d45d added merge
support for when OURS or THEIRS was simultaneously deleted
and modified.  That changeset however did not add create an
entry in the conflicts table so clients would see a CONFLICTING
result but getConflicts() would return null.

This change creates a MergeResult for the conflicting file.
