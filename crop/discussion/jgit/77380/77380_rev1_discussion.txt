Sorry, you probably have added m2e plugin to your Eclipse, and this one touched lot of things it shouldn't touch.

Merging this will enforce everyone to use m2e plugin or see errors.

Hmm.  I'm just using Eclipse for Java out of the box, and I guess it came with that plugin included.

How are people using Eclipse for Jgit without m2e?

I didn't expect that this will be merged. I just wanted to provoke some feedback about how to stop those files from getting modified ;)

I never needed it. What should it do for me?

You got your feedback now :-)

To stop it, uninstall m2e plugin.

Uninstalling m2e removes the Maven options from the "Import" dialog, so how do you get the project into Eclipse without that?

Running `mvn eclipse:eclipse` also results in a modified workspace:

 modified:   org.eclipse.jgit/.classpath
 modified:   org.eclipse.jgit/.project
 modified:   org.eclipse.jgit/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs

Thanks, got it working now.  I'd overlooked that document before.

Incidentally, removing m2e was futile because it somehow reinstalled itself next time I started Eclipse :-/
