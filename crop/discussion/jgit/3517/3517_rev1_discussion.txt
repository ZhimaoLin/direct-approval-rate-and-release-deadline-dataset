needs some clean up, but a great start!

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommandTest.java -> rename to testClean, also add another method: testCleanWithPaths when you call setPaths() on CleanCommand

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommandTest.java -> you don't need this

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommandTest.java -> you don't need this
