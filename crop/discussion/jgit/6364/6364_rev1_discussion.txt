DESCRIPTION

Define ObjectInserter.Filter to wrap another ObjectInserter

Filter supports wrapping another ObjectInserter. By default all
methods are delegated to the wrapped inserter. Implementors may
override methods selectively for altered behavior.

The instance that is wrapped may be determined dynamically by code,
supporting lazy allocation of the delegate, or other patterns like
object pooling.
