DESCRIPTION

Declare members of PackOutputStream final

These methods cannot be sanely overridden anywhere. Most methods
are package visible only, or are private. A few public methods do
exist but there is no useful way to override them since creation
of PackOutputStream is managed by PackWriter and cannot be delegated.
