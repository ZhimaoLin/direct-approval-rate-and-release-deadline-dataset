DESCRIPTION

Add helper methods to Edit

Exposing isEmpty, getLengthA, getLengthB make it easier to examine
the state of an edit and work with it from higher level code.

The before and after cut routines make it easy to split an edit
that contains another edit, such as to decompose a REPLACE that
contains a common sequence within it.
