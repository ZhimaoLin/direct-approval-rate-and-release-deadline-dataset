only a minor comment, otherwise looks good

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> Is that correct english? Sounds strange. Native git says something similar "Limit to only refs/heads". Something like "Show only refs starting with refs/heads" would be more clear to me.
