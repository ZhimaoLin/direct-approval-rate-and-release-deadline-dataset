DESCRIPTION

Download pack-*.idx to /tmp if not on local filesystem

If the destination repository doesn't use an ObjectDirectory to
store its objects, we can't download to the object directory.
Instead pull the pack-*.idx files down to temporary files in the
JVM's default temporary directory.

Terminology: /tmp is kind of unixish speak and the temp directory might not even be called /tmp on unix
