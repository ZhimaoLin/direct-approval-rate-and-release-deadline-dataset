DESCRIPTION

Make diff algorithm configurable

The diff algorithm which is used by Merge, Cherry-Pick, Rebase
should be configurable. A new configuration parameter "diff.algorithm"
is introduced which currently accepts the values "myers" or
"histogram". Based on this parameter for example the ResolveMerger
will choose a diff algorithm. The reason for this is bug 331078.
This bug shows that JGit is more compatible with C Git when
histogram diff is in place. But since histogram diff is quite new we
need an easy way to fall back to Myers diff.
