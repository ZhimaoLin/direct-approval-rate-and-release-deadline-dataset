DESCRIPTION

Make diff algorithm configurable

The diff algorithm which is used by Merge, Cherry-Pick, Rebase
should be configurable. A new configuration parameter "diff.algorithm"
is introduced which currently accepts the values "myers" or
"histogram". Based on this parameter for example the ResolveMerger
will choose a diff algorithm. The reason for this is bug 331078.
This bug shows that JGit is more compatible with C Git when
histogram diff is in place. But since histogram diff is quite new we
need an easy way to fall back to Myers diff.

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffAlgorithm.java -> Done

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Done

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I agree, HistogramDiff should be our default. But since I already saw 3 diff algorithms (myers, patience, histogram) up to know I think its a good idea to to give the option to configure the algorithm.

Line:273, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeAlgorithm.java -> Done

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeAlgorithm.java -> be patient. Thats in the next proposal 1958. This proposal was meant just to make the diff algorithm configurable. 1958 switches the default.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffAlgorithm.java -> Nak.  This is now public, and mutable, and a singleton.

Change the enum to be:

  public enum SupportedAlgorithm {
    MYERS, HISTOGRAM
  }

  public static DiffAlgorithm getAlgorithm(SupportedAlgorithm alg) {
    switch(alg) {
    case MYERS:
      return MyersDiff.INSTANCE;
    case HISTOGRAM:
      return new HistogramDiff();
    }
  }

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Should we also honor this variable in DiffFormatter?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> We should just be using HistogramDiff as our default algorithm now.  Its faster on source code files, and produces pretty decent results.  Its also simpler and easier to follow.

That said, I'll probably rewrite our MyersDiff implementation to be shorter and easier to understand.  But I need to find the time to do that.  :-)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:273, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeAlgorithm.java -> Why does this need to be an instance method now?  static methods are faster to dispatch to, because "this" doesn't need to be pushed onto the stack.
