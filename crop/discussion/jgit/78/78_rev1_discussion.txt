DESCRIPTION

Add JGit IO SPI and default implementation

The SPI mainly focus's in providing an API to JGit to be able to perform
similar operations to that of java.io.File. All direct I/O is based on the
java.io.Input/OutputStream classes.

Different JGit IO SPI provider is designed to be URI scheme based and thus
the default implementation is that of "file" scheme. SPI provider will be
integrated by their respective users in a manner similar to that of JDBC
driver registration. There is a SystemStorageManager that has similar
registration capabilities and the system storage providers should be
registered with the manager in one of the provided ways.

This SPI is based on the initial requirements for switching to it and thus
this SPI will change as required during full migration to it.
