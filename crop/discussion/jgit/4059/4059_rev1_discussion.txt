DESCRIPTION

Modified WindowCache to allow defaults to be set via System Properties

* The following system properties are now available:
org.eclipse.jgit.config.deltaBaseCacheLimit (in bytes)
org.eclipse.jgit.config.packedGitLimit (in bytes)
org.eclipse.jgit.config.gitOpenFiles (number of files)
org.eclipse.jgit.config.gitWindowSize (in bytes)
org.eclipse.jgit.config.streamFileThreshold (in bytes)

In particular, streamFileThreshold should be set to be larger than the
largest object in the repository (but small enough to fit in heap
memory), otherwise checkouts will be very slow due to switching to the
streaming implementation.  Clients of this library should either set
these system properties, or call WindowCache.reconfigure with
appropriate settings.

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> Style-nit: Trailing whitespace.

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> I would prefer to put this into WindowCacheConfig. We have a fromConfig() method. Lets also add fromSystemProperties(). Then this code here becomes:

  reconfigure(new WindowCacheConfig().fromSystemProperties());

Line:173, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> What if we named the system properties:

  org.eclipse.jgit.config.core.streamFileThreshold

? Then you can write the conversion code for fromSystemProperties() as:

  Config cfg = new Config();
  ... loop through system properties
  ... if name starts with "org.eclipse.jgit.config."
  ... split remainder on first dot, set string value
  fromConfig(cfg);

That way the user can set any property using the -Dorg.eclipse.jgit.config.section.name=value flag syntax. FWIW I have a special version of Config that parses JSON and converts it to a Config object so I can configure JGit via JSON. Works nicely. I'm thinking the same sort of idea here, construct a Config from a properties collection.

Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> If you use the Config approach I suggest above, users can say -Dorg.eclipse.jgit.config.core.streamFileThreshold=200m rather than 200000000. Its cleaner.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Did you consider adding a WindowCache.reconfigure() call in Main within the pgm package?

You could add a new command line flag to Main called --config-file that points to a user configuration file, then callers can set these settings in ~/.jgitconfig (for example) and call `jgit --config-file=$HOME/.jgitconfig log ...`.

We could also consider standardizing a ~/.jgitconfig file that is loaded by Main if present.

FWIW, the reason Main doesn't support a config file is there is no way to have that config file also specify memory settings for the JVM. Setting too large of a value for core.packedGitLimit without also increasing the heap may cause performance problems in the application. Not entirely a problem you need to solve, but that's why I didn't added a reconfigure() call here.
