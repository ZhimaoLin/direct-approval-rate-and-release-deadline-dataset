DESCRIPTION

Push errors back over sideband when possible

If an internal exception occurs while packing and the request
needs to abort, the HTTP response might already be committed due
to progress message having already been delivered to the client.
This prevents UploadPackServlet from resetting the response and
sending back an HTTP 500 response.

Try to catch all exceptions and report internal errors over the
sideband stream or as an ERR command during the initial ACK/NAK
negotiation phase. This allows JGit to transmit an error message
that the user will receive on their console without needing to
worry about resetting the (already gone) HTTP response.
