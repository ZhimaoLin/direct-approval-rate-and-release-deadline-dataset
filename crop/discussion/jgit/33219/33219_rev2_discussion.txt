Thanks for working on this. Some comments inline.

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeFormatterPass.java -> bol? Is the condition missing a ! (not)?

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeAlgorithmTest.java -> I think this would be a good use case for the Theories runner, instead of duplicating the methods. See GitDateParserBadlyFormattedTest.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/EolAwareOutputStream.java -> As this is not in an internal package, it's API and needs a xxx@xxx.xxx 3.6". But I'm not sure we want it to be API, consider moving it as package-private to merge.
