DESCRIPTION

Enforce the use of Java5 API:s only (with a few exceptions)

This only works with Eclipse 3.6 and newer and requires installation
of new package. Documentation is not very good, but there is a blog
about it here: http://eclipseandjazz.blogspot.com/2011/10/of-invalid-references-to-system.html

API checking is especially useful on OS X where Java5 is not readily
available.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

nice, I like this API checking :-)

but it detects two problems which should be handled so that we don't get errors reported by Eclipse right from the beginning:

Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
The method File.canExecute() referenced in org.eclipse.jgit.api.MergeCommandTest.canExecute(Git, String) is not defined in the bundle's required execution environment: J2SE-1.5 	MergeCommandTest.java	/org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api	line 1098	API Usage Problem

The method File.setExecutable(boolean) referenced in org.eclipse.jgit.api.MergeCommandTest.setExecutable(Git, String, boolean) is not defined in the bundle's required execution environment: J2SE-1.5 	MergeCommandTest.java	/org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api	line 1093	API Usage Problem

Patch Set 1:

Where are you looking?

MergeCommandTest has 1044 lines here and no executable-whatever method execution. In fact i see no invocation of File.canExecute or File.setExecutable anywhere in either JGit nor EGit.

Patch Set 1:

sorry, I missed to explain what I did: 

This change has the wrong base e11af568285525f4d16bbefef5faae5fea2ef008 "Merge branch 'stable-1.2'" which is only reachable from master but not from stable-1.2 but you pushed this change to stable-1.2. Hence to fix this I cherry-picked this change onto current stable-1.2 and then I end up with the mentioned two errors.
