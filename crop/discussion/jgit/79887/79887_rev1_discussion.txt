DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: Fix push options received over HTTP

Capabilities are not transmitted during the POST request that contains
the commands and pack data, which caused the pushOptions list to stay
initialized as null.

Refactor all of the push option support code to allocate the list
immediately before parsing the options section off the stream.

Move option support down to ReceivePack instead of BaseReceivePack.
Push options are specific to the ReceivePack protocol and are not
likely to appear in the 4 year old subscription proposal.  These
changes are OK before JGit 4.5 ships as no consumer should be relying
on these new APIs.

Both the minimal fix as well as this one, are failing testFailedAtomicPushWithOptions; I think that makes sense as well.

java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[]> but was:<null>

I had to change authorship as I cannot push on your behalf as a non committer.
