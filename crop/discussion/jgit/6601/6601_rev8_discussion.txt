Line:158, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeProcess.java -> private

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscriptionManager.java -> As talked about in person, you should restructure the relationship of the classes so there is not a circular dependency between the Transport and Subscriber.

The SubscriptionManager should be a SubscriptionExecutor or SubscriptionService.
The SubscriptionProcess should manage the Transport and Subscription state.
Try and keep the responsibilities of each class well specified and don't expose more than you need.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscriptionManager.java -> make this applyConfig as discussed

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscriptionManager.java -> if the process does not exist, create and run it, then carry forward the applyConfig.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscriptionManager.java -> Consider making this a helper class, so you don't need to set the thread on the process.
