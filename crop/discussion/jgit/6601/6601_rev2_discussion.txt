Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeProcess.java -> This class and its methods should probably just be package-private

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeProcess.java -> Huh, seems like some of these lines could be longer. Does the Eclipse auto-formatter know that tabs are 2 columns?

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> Probably could be a bit more specific about what kind of poll time.
