DESCRIPTION

Optimize attribute handling

rework of AttributesHandler by using a per-directory cache of merged
AttributesRules. The translation of rules into subfolders is done using
TranslatedAttributesRule. In an optional step this could further be
optimized to discard subtree rules that do not apply at all. However,
this change improves attribute performance by magnitudes.

Line:1214, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalk.java -> This fixes the clean/smudge filter tests that make use of the preScanTwoTrees CheckOut. This seems to be added after this method was introduced. The Checkout.prescanTwoTrees uses two WorkingTreeIterator, but this method here just returns the first found.

May it be that this if(tree.matches==currentHead) was missing ever since? 

Only attributes logic used it so far. And since the attributes logic was not caching it was reading attributes every time again, so it was magically right.

Now with attribute node and rule caching i run unto this iusse.
This fix seems to work fine. Is it correct in your opinion?
I assume
