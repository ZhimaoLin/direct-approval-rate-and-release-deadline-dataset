DESCRIPTION

Optimize attribute handling

rework of AttributesHandler by using a per-directory cache of merged
AttributesRules. The translation of rules into subfolders is done using
TranslatedAttributesRule. In an optional step this could further be
optimized to discard subtree rules that do not apply at all. However,
this change improves attribute performance by magnitudes.
