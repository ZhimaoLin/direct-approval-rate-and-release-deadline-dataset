DESCRIPTION

Teach UploadPack to support blob-max-bytes

Teach UploadPack to advertise the blob-max-bytes capability and
support a "blob-max-bytes" line in the request. This is analogous to a
patch sent to the Git mailing list [1], except that ".git*" special
files are not treated specially. (".git*" special files are not
treated specially so that bitmaps can still be used to speed up object
selection, and because the exact filtering mechanism will most likely
be changed anyway [2].)

When blob-max-bytes is set, blobs larger than the given size are not
sent to the client.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY, a Git client patched
with the patch set from the linked e-mail [1] would be able to perform
a partial clone.

Patch Set 5:

Some internal testing has shown the "counting objects" phase to be slow. I've updated this patch to re-enable the use of bitmaps to make that phase faster, made possible by no longer treating ".git*" special files specially.
