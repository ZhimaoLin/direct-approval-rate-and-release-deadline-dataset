DESCRIPTION

Teach UploadPack to support blob-max-bytes

Teach UploadPack to advertise the blob-max-bytes capability and
support a "blob-max-bytes" line in the request. This is analogous to a
patch sent to the Git mailing list [1].

When blob-max-bytes is set, blobs larger than the given size are not
sent to the client, unless they appear in a tree with a filename
starting with ".git". Bitmaps have to be disabled in this situation,
because an ordinary object walk is needed to know the filename of
every blob accessed.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY, a Git client patched
with the patch set from the linked e-mail [1] would be able to perform
a partial clone.

Line:998, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> catch NumberFormatException and throw PackProtocolException just in case?

Line:998, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done, and also made it throw PackProtocolException if it is negative.

I'm not sure if it should bubble NumberFormatException up (just like the handling of "deepen"), but at least it is more explicit this way.
