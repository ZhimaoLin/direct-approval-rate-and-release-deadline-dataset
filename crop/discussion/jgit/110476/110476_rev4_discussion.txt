DESCRIPTION

Teach UploadPack to support blob-max-bytes

Teach UploadPack to advertise the blob-max-bytes capability and
support a "blob-max-bytes" line in the request. This is analogous to a
patch sent to the Git mailing list [1].

When blob-max-bytes is set, blobs larger than the given size are not
sent to the client, unless they appear in a tree with a filename
starting with ".git". Bitmaps have to be disabled in this situation,
because an ordinary object walk is needed to know the filename of
every blob accessed.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY, a Git client patched
with the patch set from the linked e-mail [1] would be able to perform
a partial clone.
