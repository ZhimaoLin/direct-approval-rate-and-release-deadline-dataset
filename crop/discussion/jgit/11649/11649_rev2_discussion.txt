DESCRIPTION

Do not extend delta chains longer than limit

When considering an object that is already used as a delta base
for other objects, limit the maximum depth it can accept to be the
remainder of the delta chain length.

Given the situation:

  R <- S <- T

  R is not a delta, and wants to delta compress;
  S and T were already chosen for reuse as-is;
  S is a delta based on R;
  T is a delta based on S.

If the configured delta depth is 4, R can only be delta compressed
against a non-delta. Compressing on a delta would cause T to exceed
the configured chain length, resulting in longer unpacking times.
