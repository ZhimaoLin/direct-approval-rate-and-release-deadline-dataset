DESCRIPTION

Do not delta compress existing delta chain roots

If a delta is being reused into the output pack file as-is and
its base is also being included in the pack, do not try to delta
compress the base.

Delta compressing the base may append a chain of 50 objects onto
the end of an existing chain, making the length much deeper than
desired for runtime decompression. This can lead to extremely slow
and long "Resolving deltas" phases when a client parses the pack.

If the delta and its base are coming from the same pack file,
it is reasonable to assume both were already well compressed. The
base was chosen to not be delta compressed. Second guessing that
here is generally just a waste of CPU time.
