DESCRIPTION

ResetCommand: Allow reset on unborn branch when ref not specified

In C Git 1.8.2, "git reset" now also works on an unborn branch (no HEAD
yet) if no explicit ref was specified. In that case, it is treated as a
reset to an empty tree.

This can be useful for callers because "unborn branch" no longer has to
be special-cased to "git rm --cached".
