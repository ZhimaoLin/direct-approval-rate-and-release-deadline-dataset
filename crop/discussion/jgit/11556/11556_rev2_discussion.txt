Do we need to answer the 3 questions even for author being from same member company as a committer? Really? No wonder I am so excited about the 3 questions going away.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> Sure but the contents of this file came from an exiting file in jgit that was created in 2012. So its a 2012 source.

I have written this code, it is copyright Google, and Google's ok with me contributing it under the EDL, which is a 3-clause BSD-style license.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> Caught, wrapped, and rethrown. In a spare moment I'd like to tweak this to make it more obvious to the caller what went wrong (in particular to distinguish between a corrupt object db and internal errors).
