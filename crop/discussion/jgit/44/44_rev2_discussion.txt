DESCRIPTION

Expose RefAdvertiser for reuse outside of the transport package

By making this class and its methods public, and the actual writing
abstract, we can reuse this code for other formats like writing an
info/refs file for HTTP transports.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The minor comment here is for documentation, rather than code. Should be trivial to fix subsequently.
