DESCRIPTION

Expose RefAdvertiser for reuse outside of the transport package

By making this class and its methods public, and the actual writing
abstract, we can reuse this code for other formats like writing an
info/refs file for HTTP transports.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Since we're 1.5 based anyway, and we're using CharSequence, then why not make pckOut.writeString take a CharSequence instead of a String?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Both String and CharBuffer implement CharSequence; CharSequence is also random access. I'm not sure what else the encoder needs?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> This doesn't buy us much.  The charset encoder needs a random access char object, which is either String or CharBuffer, and CharSequence is neither of those.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:296, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> StringBuffer implements CharSequence, which the writeOne() method is looking for, so the toString is unnecessary here.
