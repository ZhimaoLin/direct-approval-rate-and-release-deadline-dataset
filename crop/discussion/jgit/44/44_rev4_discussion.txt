DESCRIPTION

Expose RefAdvertiser for reuse outside of the transport package

By making this class and its methods public, and the actual writing
abstract, we can reuse this code for other formats like writing an
info/refs file for HTTP transports.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Can we clarify which meaning this is:

1) The argument 'line' must end in LF
2) Regardless of what you pass in, I'm going to put LF on the end for you

I suspect from the usage the former, but I don't know why 'writeOne' needs to demand that lines must end in LF; if the protocol requires you to terminate each statement with a LF, then that's fine - but does this mean this fn can only be used to write out a complete 'sentence' each time? 

If this is just 'writing output' then it should be possible to call this multiple times (e.g. writeOne(cap) writeOne(' ') writeOne(capName)). But if the 'writeOne' is a single advertisment line (as is) then why doesn't it add the newline for you?

PS I've dealt with an API where the 'write' call automatically added a CRLF on the end for you, and it was a nightmare to maintain, esp. when writing out multiple 'lines' because you always had to remember that you only added the CRLF *between* lines rather than at the end.
