Good catch.

What are the symptoms without this patch? Is it possible to write a test illustrating the failure?

Line:1353, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This line seems like a good smell. Shouldn't whatever comes after this reset the walk defensively, instead of relying on indirect effects like this one?

Line:1353, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> "... seems like a code smell", I mean. Sorry for the sloppiness.
