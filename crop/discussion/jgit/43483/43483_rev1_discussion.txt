Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> No braces.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> This is a little crazy, String.format is very slow, so I'm loath to call it in a loop.

There are libraries that will do this for you, Apache Commons and Guava both have things I think. But neither of them is a dep of JGit, nor should you add it just for this.

Unfortunately that leaves the JGit way to do this, which is to write the conversion code manually. If you grep for '(byte|char)\[\].*hex' in the JGit source you'll see that we already do this...a number of places. Some of them are slightly different (e.g. encoding a whole 4-byte int as hex).

I wouldn't be opposed to factoring all that out into Constants.

Or maybe we just don't care about performance since this is just looping over a SHA-1 value. But "just don't care about performance" is, well, not the JGit way :)

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> Ugh.

No longer applicable.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> I couldn't find a match on that regex. I just wrote a simple toHex converter as a private method. Refactoring into a common utility class sounds worthwhile, but I'm under time pressure and prefer to put that off until later.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/HMACSHA1NonceGenerator.java -> Regex dialect escaping differences, I imagine.
