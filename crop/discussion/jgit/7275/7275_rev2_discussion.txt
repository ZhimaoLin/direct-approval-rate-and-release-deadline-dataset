DESCRIPTION

Create an input stream that transforms LF to CRLF

The transformation is the same as AutoCRLFOutputStream does, but
the direction is reversed. The tests are reused, but the implementation
derives somewhat from the EolCanonicalizingInputStream.

This stream will be used to compare blobs with LF line endings with
worktree data that has CRLF line endings.

Line:109, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/AutoCRLFInputStream.java -> style nit: no braces around single line block

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/AutoCRLFInputStreamTest.java -> I think this block is unreachable since the for loop goes from i=1 to 4
