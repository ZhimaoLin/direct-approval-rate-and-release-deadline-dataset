DESCRIPTION

Create an input stream that transforms LF to CRLF

The transformation is the same as AutoCRLFOutputStream does, but
the direction is reversed. The tests are resued, but the implementation
derives somewhat from the EolCanonicalizingInputStream.

This stream will be used to compare blobs with LF line endings with
worktree data that has CRLF line endings.
