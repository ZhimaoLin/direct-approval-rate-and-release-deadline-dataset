DESCRIPTION

Introduce a new module for IO SPI of JGit

The reason for having a separate module is quite obvious, the IO SPI
providers need not have to depend on the whole JGit but rather only on
the SPI itself. As of the initial implementation the SPI will also contain
the default implementation - local file system provider.

Extract maven POM file to a common file to encapsulate the common setting
and configuration to be used across all maven modules for JGit.
