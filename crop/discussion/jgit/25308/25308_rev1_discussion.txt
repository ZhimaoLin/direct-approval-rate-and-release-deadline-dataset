Line:285, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameResult.java -> Only tangentially related to the change: According to the implementation this is 1 past the last index to examine. Should we update the javadoc or the implementation to match?

Line:285, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameResult.java -> Documentation is incorrect; implementation is correct. So change the documentation.
