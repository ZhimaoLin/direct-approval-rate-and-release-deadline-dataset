I don't think we should re-introduce this unless there's an unfixable issue with the new approach to detect the system config path independent of gitprefix.

It would be nice to fix it *soon* in ANY way, since egit projects aren't compilable anymore after removing git prefix logic in jgit. Alone this is the reason to revert the original commit.

thanks for the fix, I will submit Andrey's removal of gitprefix code from egit and then reintroduce similar solution to allow manually selecting the system config
