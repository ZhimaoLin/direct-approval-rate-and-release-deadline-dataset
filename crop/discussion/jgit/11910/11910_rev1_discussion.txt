DESCRIPTION

Update PackBitmapIndexRemapper to handle mappings not in the new pack.

Previously, the code assumed all commits in the old pack would also
be present in the new pack. This assumption caused an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException during remapping of ids. Fix the
iterator to only return entries that may be remapped. Furthermore,
update getBitmap() to return null if commit does not exist in the
new pack.
