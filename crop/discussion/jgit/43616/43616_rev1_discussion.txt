Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalk.java -> Rewrite as try-with-resources:

  try (ObjectReader reader = db.newObjectReader()) {
    return forPath(reader, path, trees);
  }

?

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalk.java -> We don't use try-with-resources currently in JGit outside of the java7 packages. I'm not sure when this is scheduled to change, but that seemed beyond the scope of what I'm doing right here (eliminating warnings).

I think we can start using try with resource immediately

what's not yet done is getting rid of the java 7 bundle which isn't needed anymore since we moved BREE to Java 7 for all bundles

Thanks Matthias. I changed this one usage since I was touching that block anyway, but obviously there are plenty more to go.
