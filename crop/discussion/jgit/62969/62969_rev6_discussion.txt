DESCRIPTION

RefTreeDb: Ref database using refs/txn/committed

Instead of storing references in the local filesystem rely on the
RefTree rooted at refs/txn/committed.  This avoids needing to store
references in the packed-refs file by keeping all data rooted under
a single refs/txn/committed ref.

Performance to scan all references from a well packed RefTree is very
close to reading the packed-refs file from local disk.

Storing a packed RefTree is smaller due to pack file compression,
about 49.39 bytes/ref (on average) compared to packed-refs using
~65.49 bytes/ref.
