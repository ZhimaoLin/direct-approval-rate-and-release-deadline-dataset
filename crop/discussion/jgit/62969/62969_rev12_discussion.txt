DESCRIPTION

RefTreeDb: Ref database using refs/txn/committed

Instead of storing references in the local filesystem rely on the
RefTree rooted at refs/txn/committed.  This avoids needing to store
references in the packed-refs file by keeping all data rooted under
a single refs/txn/committed ref.

Performance to scan all references from a well packed RefTree is very
close to reading the packed-refs file from local disk.

Storing a packed RefTree is smaller due to pack file compression,
about 49.39 bytes/ref (on average) compared to packed-refs using
~65.49 bytes/ref.

Patch Set 12: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

The code is much more straightforward without the layering/behavior. Tests look good too.

Line:102, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftree/RefTreeDatabase.java -> Why not automatically deduce this from txnCommitted? I don't find it to be too much of a limitation to say that the committed reference path has is <namespace>/<path> where "path" needs to be a single segment.

Or is there a valid use case for leaving this null? That isn't explained here.

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftree/RefTreeDatabase.java -> Inline the variable.

Line:102, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftree/RefTreeDatabase.java -> Good point; I was thinking about a use case like txnCommitted = "REFTREE" which was discussed on the Git mailing list. In that case the only sane namespace is txnNamespace = "" or null, aka no namespace. Which can still be inferred from the txnCommitted name.

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftree/RefTreeDatabase.java -> Done
