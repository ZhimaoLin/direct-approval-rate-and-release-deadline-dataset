Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:248, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> That code doesn't compile with JDK 1.5. String.getBytes(Charset) came with 1.6.
I was wondering why Hudson was letting this through - but our hudson builds are also configured to run with 1.6

Patch Set 3:

I think this change can be made independent from the actual killing of the GitIndex. If you would rebase this change to master (instead of depending on change 4355) then we could accept this change before we have clarified whether we are allowed to kill GitIndex.

Aren't the readTreetests run for both GitIndex and DirCache, hence the reuse through inheritance?

Line:248, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> Done

Patch Set 3:

I just wanted to speed up the submission of this change by making it independent from a change which may take longer.

You are right. We would loose tests for GitIndex before we remove it. My argument is: we already today not using GitIndex for productive code. Only tests use it. So for me its no problem to loose GitIndex test coverage before we actually get rid of the class
