DESCRIPTION

Don't allow DirCacheEntry with mode of 0

A 0 file mode in a DirCacheEntry is not a valid mode.  To C git
such a value indicates the record should not be present.  We already
were catching this bad state and exceptioning out when writing tree
objects to disk, but we did not fail when writing the dircache back
to disk.  This allowed JGit applications to create a dircache file
which C git would not like to read.

Instead of checking the mode during writes, we now check during
mutation.  This allows application bugs to be detected sooner and
closer to the cause site.  It also allows us to avoid checking most
of the records which we read in from disk, as we can assume these
are formatted correctly.

Some of our unit tests were not setting the FileMode on their test
entry, so they had to be updated to use REGULAR_FILE.
