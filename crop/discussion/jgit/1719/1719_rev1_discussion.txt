DESCRIPTION

Fix infinite loop in PatienceDiff

Certain inputs caused an infinite loop because the prior match data
couldn't be used as expected.  Rather than incrementing the match
pointer before looking at an element, do it after, so the loop breaks
when we wrap around to the starting point.

Patch Set 1:

Can't we derive a test case from this? I always have problems finding good tests for the corners of diff/merge.

Patch Set 1:

We probably could build a unit test, but we're about to delete the implementation.  I don't want to waste time developing a test case for a corner condition that I don't yet understand if we're just about to drop the whole thing anyway.  :-)

(I found this bug very quickly in the debugger by pausing the JVM when I noticed the test was running for a long time... a few steps and I realized what was wrong, so I fixed it, but I haven't looked at *why* it happened.)

So I'm either offering this change as-is, or I'll drop the change from my series altogether.  Because either way I'm deleting PatienceDiff.  It runs slower than HistogramDiff does for common inputs because it winds up needing to fall back onto HistogramDiff or MyersDiff too often.
