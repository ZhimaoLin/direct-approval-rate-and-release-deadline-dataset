DESCRIPTION

Make sure when "reset --hard" detect conflicts to overwrite

Even when performing a "reset --hard" a checkout is done. The pathes are
checked for potential checkout conflicts. But in the end for all
remaining conflicts these files are simply deleted from the working
tree. That's not the right strategy to handle checkout conflicts during
"reset --hard". Instead for every conflict we should simply checkout the
mergeCommit's content.

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ResetCommandTest.java -> assert that content of a.txt after "reset --hard" is "content" otherwise we can't be sure the former content "contentnew content" of the untracked file a.txt was overwritten

Line:182, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ResetCommandTest.java -> native git yields a different result:

 (master *+)]$ git reset --hard HEAD
 warning: unable to unlink d/c.txt: Not a directory
 HEAD is now at f95f1f3 adding a.txt and dir/b.txt

it warns that it expected a directory d and leaves the file d untouched
