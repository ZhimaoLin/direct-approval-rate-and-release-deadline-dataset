DESCRIPTION

Make sure to overwrite files when "reset --hard" detects conflicts

When performing a "reset --hard" a checkout is done. The pathes are
checked for potential checkout conflicts. But in the end for all
remaining conflicts these files are simply deleted from the working
tree. That's not the right strategy to handle checkout conflicts during
"reset --hard". Instead for every conflict we should simply checkout the
merge commit's content.
