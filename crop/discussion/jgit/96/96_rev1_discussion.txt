DESCRIPTION

Move pure IO utility functions to a utility class of its own.

According the javadoc, and implied by the name of the class, NB
is about network byte order. The purpose of moving the IO only,
and non-byte order related functions to another class is to
make it easier for new contributors to understand that they
can use these functions in general and it's also makes it easier
to understand where to put new IO related utility functions
