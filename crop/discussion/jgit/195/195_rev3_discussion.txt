DESCRIPTION

Replace writeSymref with RefUpdate.link

By using RefUpdate for symbolic reference creation we can reuse
the logic related to updating the reflog with the event, without
needing to expose something such as the legacy ReflogWriter class
(which we no longer have).

Applications using writeSymref must update their code to use the
new pattern of changing the reference through the updateRef method:

    String refName = "refs/heads/master";
    RefUpdate u = repository.updateRef(Constants.HEAD);
    u.setRefLogMessage("checkout: moving to " + refName, false);
    switch (u.link(refName)) {
    case NEW:
    case FORCED:
    case NO_CHANGE:
        // A successful update of the reference
        break;
    default:
        // Handle the failure, e.g. for older behavior
        throw new IOException(u.getResult());
    }
