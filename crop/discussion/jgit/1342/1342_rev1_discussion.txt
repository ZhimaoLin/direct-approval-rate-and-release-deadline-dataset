DESCRIPTION

Make ObjectId.compareTo final

Since equals() is now final and does not permit being overridden,
we should do the same thing with compareTo() to prevent different
subclasses from having different ordering behaviors.  This could
lead to the same mess that we had with different equals() behaviors.
