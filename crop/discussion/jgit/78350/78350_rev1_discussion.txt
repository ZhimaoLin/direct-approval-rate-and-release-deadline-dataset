implements support for applying new literal binary patches in JGit.

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ApplyCommandTest.java -> below this we only have white space changes?

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/Base85.java -> This file seems to have mixed tabs and white spaces;

Please use tabs consistently.

Line:309, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ApplyCommand.java -> As it is a private method, I'd leave this out.

Otherwise please fill in some documentation.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/Base85Test.java -> Please add a copyright/license header

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/Base85Test.java -> (codingstyle) I think we avoid an empty line after last test?
