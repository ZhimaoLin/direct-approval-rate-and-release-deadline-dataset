DESCRIPTION

Allow to reuse tree index constants used by mergers

These constants are used in the same way by mergers and a number of
other classes with the public method TreeWalk.getRawMode(int index) and
were defined redundantly.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I think this is a bad idea. The actual assignments depend greatly on the code that is creating the TreeWalk and adding iterators to them.

I would prefer to keep the constants near that code. Or drop the constants and use local variables:

  int tBase = tw.addTree(...);
