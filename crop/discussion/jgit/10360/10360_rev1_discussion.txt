Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Interesting. Do you know of any servers that don't advertise a HEAD ref?

I don't think C git does this on the client side, so my first guess would be that it's not a good change, though I could easily be convinced otherwise given a use case.

Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Clone.java -> There are three cases:

 1. Remote advertises HEAD, another ref points to the same commit: use that ref.
 2. Remote advertises HEAD, but no other ref points to the same commit: detach HEAD at that commit
 3. Remote does not advertise HEAD: ??

The "if" takes care of case (2). Doesn't this "else" break case (1)?

This happened when I cloned a local archive, so actually no "server" per se.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

..which is strange, because there is a HEAD and it even matches anaother ref. Wierd.
