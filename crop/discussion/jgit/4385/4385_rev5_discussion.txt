DESCRIPTION

Add detection of untracked folders to IndexDiffFilter

Decorators need to know whether folders in the working tree contain only
untracked files. This change enhances IndexDiffFilter to report such
folders. This works only together with treewalks which operate in
default traversal mode. For treewalks which process entries  in
postorder mode (files are walked before their parent folder is walked)
this detection doesn't work.
