DESCRIPTION

Add detection of untracked folders to IndexDiffFilter

Decorators need to know whether folders in the working tree contain only
untracked files. This change enhances IndexDiffFilter to report such
folders. This works only together with treewalks which operate in
default traversal mode. For treewalks which process entries  in
postorder mode (files are walked before their parent folder is walked)
this detection doesn't work.

I tested this in combination with http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,4406
and found a case where the result is wrong:

setup the following tree in the working tree:

src
src/a/b/test/C.java  (untracked)
src/a/b/test2/D.java (committed)

this yields wrong state for folder test2
src/a/b/test2/ (untracked -> this is wrong)

when C.java is added (new file) test2 has correct decoration (committed)

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> typo: s/now/know/

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> stlye nit: could be formatted more nicely

Patch Set 4:

I could validate that the jgit implementation really reports only src/a/b/test as a untracked folder. It must be a problem of the decorator code in EGit. I'll make a comment there.
