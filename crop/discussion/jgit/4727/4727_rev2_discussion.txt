Patch Set 2: Abandoned

We should go for Tomasz' change instead, but it needs to be updated.

Patch Set 2: Restored

As my and Tomasz change are very close and trivial in nature, I'm restoring that if it helps to make it into stable-1.2

It is not critical to get this patch itself into the release.
