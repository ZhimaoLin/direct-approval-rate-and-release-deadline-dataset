DESCRIPTION

Smudge racily clean index entries by truncating length (like git.git)

To mark an entry racily clean we set its length to 0 (like native git
does). Entries which are not racily clean and have zero length can be
distinguished from racily clean entries by checking P_OBJECTID
against the SHA1 of empty content. When length is 0 and P_OBJECTID is
different from SHA1 of empty content we know the entry is marked
racily clean.

Line:296, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> Should we also delete this rule?  IIRC the only reason we had it was to ensure already smudged entries stayed smudged.  If we change our smudge logic to be length based this no longer makes any sense, and is actually a source of bugs by always selecting modified files as potentially racily clean.
