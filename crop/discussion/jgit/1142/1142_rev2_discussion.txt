DESCRIPTION

Smudge racily clean index entries by truncating length (like git.git)

To mark an entry racily clean we set its length to 0 (like native git
does). Entries which are not racily clean and have zero length can be
distinguished from racily clean entries by checking P_OBJECTID
against the SHA1 of empty content. When length is 0 and P_OBJECTID is
different from SHA1 of empty content we know the entry is marked
racily clean.
