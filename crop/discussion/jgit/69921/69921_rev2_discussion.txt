DESCRIPTION

Enable calling of smudge filters when checking out paths

When checking out commits/branches JGit was triggering correctly
configured smudge filters. But when checking out paths (either from
index or from commits) JGit was not triggering smudge filters. Fix
CheckoutCommand to properly call filters.
