DESCRIPTION

Require a DiffConfig when creating a FollowFilter

The various rename detection options are an inherent part of the
filter, similar to the path being followed.

This fixes a potential NPE when a RevWalk with a FollowFilter is
created without a Repository, since the old code path tried to get
the DiffConfig from the RevWalk's possibly-missing repository.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetector.java -> Use this form instead:

  this(repo.newObjectReader(),
    repo.getConfig().get(DiffConfig.KEY));

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FollowFilter.java -> Looks like you added trailing whitespace here. Eclipse always inserts it and has trouble removing it.
