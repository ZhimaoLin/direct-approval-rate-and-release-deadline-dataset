DESCRIPTION

Require a DiffConfig when creating a FollowFilter

The various rename detection options are an inherent part of the
filter, similar to the path being followed.

This fixes a potential NPE when a RevWalk with a FollowFilter is
created without a Repository, since the old code path tried to get
the DiffConfig from the RevWalk's possibly-missing repository.

Please revert or fix this change, it causes compile errors in EGit (bug 407253).

Patch Set 3:

Yes, this is a backwards-incompatible API change, but the next JGit release will be a new major version (3.0.0) so AIUI this is allowed.

It should be simple to fix the caller(s) in EGit, but I'm not familiar with that code.

Patch Set 3:

Even if it is allowed you should only break clients if absolutely necessary and not take it as a free lunch. Normally, one deprecates the old method with documentation on how to fix the client code.

Also, M7 is very late for API changes.
