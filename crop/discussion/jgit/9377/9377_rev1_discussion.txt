DESCRIPTION

Move FS implementation to internal package

The reason for this move is to extend the functionality in another bundle,
so we need to make these classes "public", but we only want to expose them
to our own bundles.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think this move isn't required since change I3d6580d6fa7b22f60d7e54ab236898ed44954ffd is introducing the new Java7 functionality in a fragment which could as well extend the package containing these classes by putting them into the same package

Patch Set 1:

I could not resolve the Java7FSFactory when the fragment
had the same package name.

In which scenario doesn't this work for you ? I tried change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/9379/5 and removed this package move (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/9377/1) and for me loading the Java7FSFactory works when starting EGit with this JGit version when I specified under Preferences "Java > Installed JREs > Execution Environment" that Java 7 should be used for J2SE-1.5 and J2SE-1.6 before starting a debugging workbench with this JGit version and EGit from change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/9381/1
