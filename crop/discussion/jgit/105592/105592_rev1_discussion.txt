DESCRIPTION

Checkout now reports failures through exceptions.

Checkout sometimes throws an exception, and
other times it writes an error message to outw
and returns normally, even though the command
failed.  This commit now reports all failures
through a die() exception.

Patch Set 1:

When you do `jgit checkout`, for about half of the failure modes the command will print an error message to stdout (not stderr) and return 0.  Very hard to detect these failures.  This commit fixes that, so that all failures throw an exception.
