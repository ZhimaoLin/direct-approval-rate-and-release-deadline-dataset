DESCRIPTION

Checkout now reports failures through exceptions.

Checkout sometimes throws an exception, and
other times it writes an error message to outw
and returns normally, even though the command
failed.  This commit now reports all failures
through a die() exception.

Anything I can do to help this little change along?  Without this patch, it's very difficult to detect when a checkout has failed.
