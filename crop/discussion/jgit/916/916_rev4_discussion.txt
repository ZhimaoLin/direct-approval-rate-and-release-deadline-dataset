DESCRIPTION

Replace WindowCache with ObjectReader

The WindowCache is an implementation detail of PackFile and how its
used by ObjectDirectory.  Lets start to hide it and replace the public
API with a more generic concept, ObjectReader.

Because PackedObjectLoader is also considered a private detail of
PackFile, we have to make PackWriter temporarily dependent upon the
WindowCursor and thus FileRepository and ObjectDirectory in order to
just start the refactoring.  In later changes we will clean up the
APIs more, exposing sufficient support to PackWriter without needing
the file specific implementation details.
