DESCRIPTION

Only increment mod count if packed-refs file changes

Previously if a packed-refs file was racily clean then there
was a 2.5 second window in which each call to getPackedRefs
would increment the mod count causing a RefsChangedEvent to be
fired since the FileSnapshot would report the file as modified.

If a RefsChangedListener called getRef/getRefs from the
onRefsChanged method then a StackOverflowError could occur
since the stack could be exhausted before the 2.5 second
window expired and the packed-refs file would no longer
report being modified.

Now a SHA-1 is computed of the packed-refs file and the
mod count is only incremented when the packed refs are
successfully set and the id of the new packed-refs file
does not match the id of the old packed-refs file.

Great, I was also hunting for the reason for the extra RefsChangedEvents. I think you found it!
