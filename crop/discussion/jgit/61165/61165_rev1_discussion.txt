DESCRIPTION

Fix FS.runProcess() to close the InputStream

When FS.runProcess was called and an InputStream was given the method
tried to pump the whole InputStream to the process. When the method
ended the InputStream was not giving any data anymore. Consequently
close the InputStream inside the method.
