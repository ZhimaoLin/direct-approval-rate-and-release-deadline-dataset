DESCRIPTION

[Draft] Additional conflict test for DirCacheCheckout

testFolderFileAndContentConflicts verifies that a content conflict and
a file/folder conflict cause a single CheckoutConflictException that
reports both cases as conflicting files.

This is meant as a supplement to the notes on
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75443/

Please feel free to include or discard this test case as you see fit.

Patch Set 2:

But compared to what we have in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75443/ this change doesn't bring any new tests. testFolderFileAndContentConflicts was already introduced by you in the original change in patchset 2. I think we don't need this draft, or?

I had to change committer, author and signed-off to be able to upload patchset 2. After I've done that, I realized that this might not be the correct way to amend another committers patch and tried to undo things.

Therefore, I packaged my changes into this separate patch. However, removing the patchset 2 wasn't possible either. That's how I ended up with the 'duplicates'.

Long story short, this is the same changes as in patchset 2 and we don't need this if we base further work on patchset 2.
