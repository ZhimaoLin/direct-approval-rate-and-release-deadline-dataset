DESCRIPTION

Fix two nits about DirCacheEntry constructors

Explicitly pass STAGE_0 when creating a DirCacheEntry from String.
This matches the immediate next constructor that accepts the int
stage argument better, making the code easier to read.

Fix a weird line break where the comma was orphaned by itself.
