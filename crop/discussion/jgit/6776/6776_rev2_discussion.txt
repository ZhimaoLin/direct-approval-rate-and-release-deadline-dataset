DESCRIPTION

Support parsing previous checkout in Repository.resolveExpr

Previous checkouts can be specified xxx@xxx.xxx where n is an
integer speifying the n:th previous branch. The result
is the branch name, unless the checkout was a detached head,
in which case the object id is returned. Since the result
is a branch it may be followed by a references to the reflog,
such xxx@xxx.xxx if necessary.

A simple expression like "master" is resolved to master, but
anything starting with refs gets resolved to its object id,
even if it is a branch.

A symbolic ref is resolved to its leaf ref, e.g. "HEAD" might
be resolved to "master".
