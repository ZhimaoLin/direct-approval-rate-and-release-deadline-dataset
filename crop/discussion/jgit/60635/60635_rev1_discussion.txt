DESCRIPTION

Added StreamType detection using attributes and core.config

TreeWalk implements the new interface StreamTypeProvider which yields
the StreamType enum of the current element. This new method can be used
with StreamTypeUtil in order to create a wrapped InputStream or
OutputStream when reading / writing files. The implementation is based
on the concepts of the cli git with regards to core.crlf, core.eol and
the .gitattributes keys "text", "eol" and the macro "binary"
