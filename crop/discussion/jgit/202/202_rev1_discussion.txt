DESCRIPTION

Finish removing Apache Felix maven-bundle-plugin

Since Robin reverted using the maven-bundle-plugin to produce the
OSGi manifest, there is no reason for us to reference it from our
build process anymore.

Also, when Robin reverted the to the Eclipse way of doing things,
we failed to update the ignore files to ignore our generated files
but not ignore our tracked .classpath.

Finally, we cannot delete the MANIFEST.MF file during a Maven build,
as this is once again a source file.
