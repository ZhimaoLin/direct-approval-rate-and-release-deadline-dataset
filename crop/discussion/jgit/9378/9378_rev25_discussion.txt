DESCRIPTION

Extend the FS class for Java7

The most important difference is that in Java7 we have symbolic links
and for most operations in the work tree we want to operate on the link
itself rather than the link target, which the old File methods generally
do.

We also add support for the hidden attribute, which only makes sense
on Windows and exists, just since there are claims that Files.exists
is faster the File.exists.

A new bundle is only activated when run with a Java7 execution
environment. It is implemented as a fragment.

Tycho currently has no way to conditionally include optional features
based on the java version used to run the build, this means with this
change the jgit packaging build always needs to be run using java 7.

Patch Set 25: (1 inline comment)

Hi,
not sure if comments are still accepted for merged code or if I should create a new bug for it. Please advice.
Regards,
Andrey

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtil.java -> Unfortunately if target is not normalized path, new File(target) will normalize it, so that physical link will differ on file system from the original one.
E.g. "/tmp/" target will be created as "/tmp" etc.
This is limitation of Java 7 implementation, native git does everything right.
As a result, working directory of the repository containing not normalized link targets will be *always* dirty after checkout.

It would be nice if we could report here some kind of warning if(!nioTarget.toString().equals(target)){
Sys.err.println("Failed to create expected link (target is not normalized). Link: '" + path + "', original target: '" + target + "', created target: '" + nioTarget + "'.")
}

Additionally it would be nice to have some extra javadoc for the method here and in FS class.

Patch Set 25:

Please create a bug report. Since this is quite late, send a note to the JGIt developer list. 

We should do some extra checks and report the link as unchanged in this case.
