DESCRIPTION

RFC Extend the FS class for Java7

The most important difference is that in Java7 we have symbolic links
and for most operations in the work tree we want to operate on the link
itself rather than the link target, which the old File methods generally
do.

We also add support for the hidden attribute, which only makes sense
on Windows and exists, just since there are claims that Files.exists
is faster the File.exists.

A new bundle is only activated when run with a Java7 execution
environment. It is implemented as a fragment.

Patch Set 18: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- this doesn't compile since some versions are still 2.3 instead of 2.4
- this doesn't compile with Java6 since it seems features can't include plugins optionally, I tried using additional features to optionally install the java7 fragments but this doesn't work yet, will discuss that with some local Tycho wizards and hopefully come back with a solution for this problem

I talked to Marina Baird (one of our Tycho committers) and he thinks that conditional packaging of the java7 fragments based on jdk which is used to run the build isn't supported by p2 at the moment [1]. So it seems this change requires that at least the tycho based packaging build has to be run with java7.
