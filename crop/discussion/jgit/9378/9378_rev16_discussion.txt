DESCRIPTION

RFC Extend the FS class for Java7

The most important difference is that in Java7 we have symbolic links
and for most operations in the work tree we want to operate on the link
itself rather than the link target, which the old File methods generally
do.

We also add support for the hidden attribute, which only makes sense
on Windows and exists, just since there are claims that Files.exists
is faster the File.exists.

A new bundle is only activated when run with a Java7 execution
environment. It is implemented as a fragment.

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> s/traverses/traverse/

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Thie ??

second sentence is truncated

Line:524, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I think the meaning of "or" is ambiguous in this sentence hence I'd write "otherwise we do not support symbolic links" instead

Line:545, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> s/return/returns/

Line:3, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/.gitignore -> folder trash is located under folder target so I think this isn't required

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.repository/pom.xml -> could we instead auto-activate this if java7 is available during the build ?

Line:8, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> fragments have no Activator so this header doesn't seem to make sense here

Line:3, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs -> these files don't exist in this bundle

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.junit.feature/feature.xml -> why is it required to include the jgit.java7 fragment in this feature ?

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/pom.xml -> I think we don't need all these dependencies at the moment

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/pom.xml -> iplog bundle was deleted

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtil.java -> style nit: no braces here

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.junit.feature/feature.xml -> this feature doesn't include org.eclipse.jgit so why should it then include org.eclipse.jgit.java7 ? If it requires the jgit feature (which includes java7 fragment) you could require this feature from here

not sure what's the best approach ...
