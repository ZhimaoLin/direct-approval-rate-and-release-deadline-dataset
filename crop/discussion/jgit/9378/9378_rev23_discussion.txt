DESCRIPTION

Extend the FS class for Java7

The most important difference is that in Java7 we have symbolic links
and for most operations in the work tree we want to operate on the link
itself rather than the link target, which the old File methods generally
do.

We also add support for the hidden attribute, which only makes sense
on Windows and exists, just since there are claims that Files.exists
is faster the File.exists.

A new bundle is only activated when run with a Java7 execution
environment. It is implemented as a fragment.

in order to fix the build we need to add the following dependency to both
- org.eclipse.jgit.feature
- org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.feature

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.jgit</groupId>
      <artifactId>org.eclipse.jgit.java7</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    
Tycho currently has no way to conditionally include optional features
based on the java version used to run the build, this means with this
change the jgit packaging build always needs to be run using java 7.

I'll push a fixed version in a few minutes

Line:48, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.junit.feature/feature.xml -> I think this is wrong, the java7 fragment shouldn't be included in the junit feature

Line:4, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/build.properties -> missing includes:

               about.html,\
               plugin.properties

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/pom.xml -> style nit: inconsistent whitespace, in pom.xmls we mostly use 2 spaces indents and no tabs

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/pom.xml -> this isn't needed here since we do not need to exclude this fragment from pack200 packing

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> this import isn't required since this is a fragment loaded by the same class loader as org.eclipse.jgit

Line:464, pom.xml -> style nit: inconsistent whitespace, use 2 blanks to indent in pom.xml

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx tag

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx tag, also for all other new public methods in this class

Line:48, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.feature/feature.xml -> style nit: inconsistent whitespace, so far we use blanks not tabs in these files (dictated by PDE editors)

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.feature/feature.xml -> missing

         fragment="true"
