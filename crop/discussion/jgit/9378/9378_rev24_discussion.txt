DESCRIPTION

Extend the FS class for Java7

The most important difference is that in Java7 we have symbolic links
and for most operations in the work tree we want to operate on the link
itself rather than the link target, which the old File methods generally
do.

We also add support for the hidden attribute, which only makes sense
on Windows and exists, just since there are claims that Files.exists
is faster the File.exists.

A new bundle is only activated when run with a Java7 execution
environment. It is implemented as a fragment.

Tycho currently has no way to conditionally include optional features
based on the java version used to run the build, this means with this
change the jgit packaging build always needs to be run using java 7.

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> Typo: "Constructor*e*"

Line:40, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.junit.feature/feature.xml -> The file seems to have unusual line break characters. It is not introduced by the change, but should be fixed IMHO.

Line:347, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java xxx@xxx.xxx missing?

Line:358, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java xxx@xxx.xxx missing?

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> System.out on not exceptional path? Use log.info or remove completely?

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> System.out (not err) on exceptional path? Use log.error or remove?

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> System.out (not err) on exceptional path? Use log.error or remove?

Line:426, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtilTest.java -> Shouldn't we check if the platform we are running inside *is* capable of supporting symlinks, and if so, fail if FS returns false on supportsSymLinks()?

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/.project -> .fbprefs (FindBugs preferences) is not checked in. Not sure if this is required or not, at least org.eclipse.jgit defines it's own FB preferences.
