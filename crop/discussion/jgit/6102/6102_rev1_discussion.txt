Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAllTest.java -> Replace IBM with your name.

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAllTest.java -> Remove empty line - organize imports in Eclipse.

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAllTest.java -> Move the test to CommitAndLogTest.java.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAllTest.java -> Remove empty line.

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAllTest.java -> The command would give the same result if executed without the "--all" switch, so it doesn't buy us anything.

Have a look at git commit man [1] and make sure to test what's is special about the switch.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CommitAllTest.java -> Remove empty line.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could put your full name here?

Line:4, /COMMIT_MSG -> Same here.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> From http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines: "The commit message header should fit on one line...". Feel free to remove the second sentence, no need to refer to the other change. Also, add space between "new" and "--all".

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove spaces.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove the empty line.
