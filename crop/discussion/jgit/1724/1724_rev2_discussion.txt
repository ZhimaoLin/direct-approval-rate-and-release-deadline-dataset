DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Improve reading of large deltas

Some large deltas are strictly forward references, which means they
don't need to seek backwards.  A few use back references, but keep
referencing the same handful of data segments repeatedly, for example
copying an XML element tag name from an earlier location.

For these cases try to avoid needing to materialize the entire base by
caching frequently referenced blocks of the base, up to the configured
stream threshold for the window cache.

When there is a reverse seek and the cache isn't large enough to
absorb it, cache the base of that object as a plain file in the new
$GIT_DIR/objects/delta-base-cache directory.  This permits the delta
stream to read from the base using RandomAccessFile, which should have
higher throughput than needing to close, reopen and skip through an
inflater stream.

Similar to the in-memory implementation we cache the delta base and
not the delta itself, as the base is more likely to be requested.

This is only an RFC as there is no upper limit on the size of the
delta-base-cache directory.  Files are created, but there is no method
to remove older entries when the cache gets large.
