Funny, I've just started to debug why I always see NPE if running jgit main from Eclipse...

Christian, the commit has no "signed-off" attribute - I guess this is not OK.

that's no problem, contributor changes will be rejected by the foundation's CLA check hook if they aren't signed off but sign-off is not required for committer changes

What we didn't yet understand is why sometimes calling git --version returns null despite the fact that git executable was found. When debugging the problem it most often worked, so maybe some race condition in handling the external process ?

Definitly. Running jgit from command line always caused NPE

Patch Set 1:

I was able to reproduce NPE's on RHEL7 Linux, but I can't do it on Windows 10. 

The only way to get a NPE is that the code in readPipe() throws an exception (something obscure, may be in Gobbler.run() while reading from already closed error stream). The exception is silently eaten by the LOG.debug() at line 480 or in logError(), because default slf4j level is info and logError() logs with debug level.

Because it does not happen if I run it in the debugger it must be a thread creation related timing issue on Linux. I guess "git --version" it is just too fast on Linux.

I will try to debug it later, but shouldn't we report errors in FS with LOG.error()???

Patch Set 1:

See also https://git.eclipse.org/r/59392.

What surprises me, is that if no slf4j binding is on classpath (Eclipse?), all jgit errors are logged to /dev/null, as documented in  http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html.

Shouldn't we somehow change this?

Patch Set 1:

With the https://git.eclipse.org/r/59392/ and additionally installed SLF4J simple binding I see this error on Linux:

Patch Set 1:

Even better, after enough attempts I get git execution so fast that it throws exceptions not only in "git --version" but also in "git config":

[Thread-1] ERROR org.eclipse.jgit.util.FS - Exception caught during execution of command [git, --version] in /bin
java.io.IOException: Stream closed

I have a fix.

Abandoned

Great work, Andrey. I think you found/fixed the problem in your change and we don't need this anymore.
