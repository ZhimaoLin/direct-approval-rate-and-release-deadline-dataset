DESCRIPTION

Support force writing reflog on a per-update basis

Even if a repository has core.logAllRefUpdates=true, ReflogWriter does
not create reflog files unless the refs are under a hard-coded list of
prefixes, or unless the forceWrite bit is set. Expose the forceWrite bit
on a per-update basis in RefUpdate/BatchRefUpdate/ReceiveCommand,
creating RefLogWriters as necessary.

Line:745, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> When ReceiveCommand.isForceRefLog() is annotated xxx@xxx.xxx this causes a "potential null pointer" error in Eclipse.

This is clearly a false positive since we check for null on the previous line.

Factoring it out to a variable fixes it.

Line:459, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> Done
