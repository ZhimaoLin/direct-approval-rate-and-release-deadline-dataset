DESCRIPTION

Use a bucket sort for PackReverseIndex.

Previously it took 1200ms to create a reverse index (sorted by offset).
Using a simple bucket sort algorithm, that time is reduced to 450ms.
The bucket index into the offset array is kept, in order to decrease
the binary search window.

Don't keep a copy of the offsets. Instead, use nth position
to lookup the offset in the PackIndex.

Nice.

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndex.java -> Am I understanding correctly?
/**
 * Last index in SHA-1 order among the objects in each bucket, plus 1.
 * For empty buckets, offsetIndex[bucket] == 0.
 */

No, that's only within the constructor so such a comment could be useful there. Once the object is constructed, is this roughly right?

/**
 * Index of the first index in SHA-1 order among the objects in each bucket, plus 1.
 * For empty buckets, offsetIndex[bucket] == 0.
 */

Or:

/** See xxx@xxx.xxx #binarySearch} */

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndex.java -> /** Mapping from indices in offset order to indices in SHA-1 order. */

Line:109, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndex.java -> At first it wasn't clear to me that this was an index in the list of buckets. How about "final int bucket = ..."?
