DESCRIPTION

Extract a "session" interface from ReceivePack

The eventual goal is to allow Pre/PostReceiveHooks to execute in a
separate process (still on top of the same git repository). Such hooks
need access to many parts of ReceivePack, such as the underlying
Repository and a mechanism for reporting errors to the user, but they do
not and should not have direct access to things like the actual
receiving mechanisms and underlying Input/OutputStreams.
