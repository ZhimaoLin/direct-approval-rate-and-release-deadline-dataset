DESCRIPTION

Extract a "session" interface from ReceivePack

The eventual goal is to allow Pre/PostReceiveHooks to execute in a
separate process (still on top of the same git repository). Such hooks
need access to many parts of ReceivePack, such as the underlying
Repository and a mechanism for reporting errors to the user, but they do
not and should not have direct access to things like the actual
receiving mechanisms and underlying Input/OutputStreams.

Patch Set 3:

PTAL. Removed a few interface changes that didn't really need to be generalized (e.g. UploadPackFactory).

Did leave the interface changes to *Hook, for the ease-of-implementation reasons mentioned in my latest comment, and as per our private discussion that I have more breaking API changes in the pipeline as well.

Patch Set 3:

I think I can get away without this interface in the downstream Gerrit changes I'm making, so hold off for now.

Patch Set 3: Abandoned

Figured out a way to do this without an interface change.
