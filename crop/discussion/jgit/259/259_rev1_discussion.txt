DESCRIPTION

Fix ObjectWalk corruption when skipping over empty trees

The supplied test case comes out of the example tree identified by
Robert de Wilde and Ilari on #git:

  $ git ls-tree -rt a54f1a85ebf6a7f53aa60a45a1be33f8b078fb7e
  040000 tree bfe058ad536cdb12e127cde63b01472c960ea105    A
  040000 tree 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904    A/A
  040000 tree 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904    A/B
  100644 blob abbbfafe3129f85747aba7bfac992af77134c607    B

In this tree, "B" was being skipped because "A/A" as an empty tree
was immediately followed by "A/B", also an empty tree, but the
ObjectWalk broke out too early and never visited "B".
