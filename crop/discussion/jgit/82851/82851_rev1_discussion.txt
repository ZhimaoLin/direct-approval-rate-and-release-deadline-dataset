DESCRIPTION

Introduce transfer descriptor for FileLfsServlet

Requirement:
As a gerrit administrator I want to have a possibility to configure
various file based lfs repositories so that I can group LFS data
for potential migration.

Solution:
Delegate file based repository resolution from FileLfsServlet to
FileLfsTransferDescriptor so that it may be dynamically retrieved
from request content path.

Patch contains also DefaultFileLfsTransferDescriptor that preservs
current behaviour and resolves request to the one file based
repository.
