DESCRIPTION

Expose AnyObjectId compareTo(byte[]) and compareTo(int[])

Storage systems can use these implementations to compare a passed
AnyObjectId with a stored representation of an ObjectId in the
canonical network byte order format.  This can be useful to do a
binary search, or just linear scan, over an encoded storage file.
