DESCRIPTION

Fix symlink content comparison on MacOS in tree walk

Symlinks on MacOS are written as UTF-8 NFD, but
readSymbolicLink().toString() converts to NFC with potentially fewer
bytes. May occur in particular if the link target has non-ASCII
characters for which the NFC and NFD encodings differ. This may lead
to an EOFException: Short read of block.

Fix by allowing the read to succeed even if less than the expected
number of bytes are returned by the entry's input stream.

Includes a new MacOS-only test.

Line:1049, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> This is crazy. The symlink is read as a string, encoded as a byte sequence, shoved through an InputStream which we leak above, then decoded using a different FS instance than was used to read the symlink.

I have to wonder how much of the NFC-NFD bug is just caused by all of the transitions going on here.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> If only we had a library in Java that supported creating objects in a Git repository, we wouldn't need to depend on executing git fast-import from a JUnit test.

Line:1049, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I quite agree with the stuff going on in the input stream and the back-and-forth between byte[] and String is "crazy". We could maybe shortcut this and do directly File.readSymbolicLink().toString() (this function is called only for symbolic links), but I was looking for the minimum change. Maybe I should have been bolder...

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> In this case though, I explicitly want cgit to create the repo. I was quite astonished to see cgit create an NFC-encoded link, and I want that exact behavior here. If the repo was created through Java, we'd end up with an NFD link.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> TreeFormatter will happily accept anything with its:

  append(byte[] name, FileMode mode, AnyObjectId id)
