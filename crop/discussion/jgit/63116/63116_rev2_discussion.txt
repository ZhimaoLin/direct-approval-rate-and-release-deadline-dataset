DESCRIPTION

Fix symlink content comparison on MacOS in tree walk

Symlinks on MacOS are written as UTF-8 NFD, but
readSymbolicLink().toString() converts to NFC with potentially fewer
bytes. May occur in particular if the link target has non-ASCII
characters for which the NFC and NFD encodings differ. This may lead
to an EOFException: Short read of block.

Fix by allowing the read to succeed even if less than the expected
number of bytes are returned by the entry's input stream.

Includes a new MacOS-only test.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Fails for me consistently with the expected EOFException without the fix in WorkingTreeIterator, and succeeds consistently with the fix. Perhaps someone with a newer OS X than my 10.7.5 could verify? Installed cgit version on my machine used to prepare the test repo and also for cloning during the test is git 2.2.1.

Thanks.

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> Will this continue to work with future versions of Java? Is there some other way to read the raw symlink --- e.g., does invoking "readlink" do the trick?

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/filerepo.git.zip -> I had to be extra cautious in reviewing this because the .git/config in a git repository can provide arbitrary code for git to execute.

It would have been safer and easier to review if the repo were in a bundle file (see man git-bundle) or a fast-import stream. E.g. given a fast-import stream:
 
 blob
 mark :1
 data 10
 äéü.txt
 blob
 mark :2
 data 8
 test.txt
 blob
 mark :3
 data 5
 Test
 
 blob
 mark :4
 data 7
 äéü
 
 reset refs/heads/master
 commit refs/heads/master

 M 100644 :4 "testfolder/\303\244\303\251\303\274.txt"
 
(I generated the above by running 'git fast-export master' in the test repository) I can revive the repository with

 git init filerepo
 git -C filerepo fast-import </path/to/fast-export/output
 git -C filerepo checkout -f

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> I see no way to obtain the raw bytes using readlink/stat. To make this future-proof, I could just skip the assertions on the raw path content if rawPath() returns null.

Or try to verify the length only (10 for NFC, 13 for NFD) -- if there's a way to obtain that safely. Maybe ls -l aeu.txt and extract the number from the output. Other options might be
* Java: BasicFileAttributes.size(), but the semantics of that method is undefined (implementation-specific) for links
* stat -f "%z" aeu.txt (MacOS/BSD) or stat -c "%s" aeu.txt (GNU stat) -- we don't know which one is installed

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/filerepo.git.zip -> Didn't know about that -- will change to use that. I didn't like the binary zip format either.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok, so it works not just for me :-), and 10.11 behaves still the same way regarding NFC/NFD. Thanks for checking.

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/IndexDiffWithSymlinkTest.java -> Done by not checking raw path contents if they're unavailable.

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/indexdiff/filerepo.git.zip -> Done
