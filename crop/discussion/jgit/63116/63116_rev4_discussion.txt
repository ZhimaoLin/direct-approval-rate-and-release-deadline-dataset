DESCRIPTION

Fix symlink content comparison on MacOS in tree walk

Symlinks on MacOS are written as UTF-8 NFD, but
readSymbolicLink().toString() converts to NFC with potentially fewer
bytes. May occur in particular if the link target has non-ASCII
characters for which the NFC and NFD encodings differ. This may lead
to an EOFException: Short read of block.

Fix by allowing the read to succeed even if less than the expected
number of bytes are returned by the entry's input stream.

Includes a new MacOS-only test.
