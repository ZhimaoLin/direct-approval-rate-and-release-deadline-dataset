DESCRIPTION

Fix symlink content comparison on MacOS in tree walk

Symlinks on MacOS are written as UTF-8 NFD, but
readSymbolicLink().toString() converts to NFC with potentially fewer
bytes. May occur in particular if the link target has non-ASCII
characters for which the NFC and NFD encodings differ. This may lead
to an EOFException: Short read of block.

Fix by allowing the read to succeed even if less than the expected
number of bytes are returned by the entry's input stream.

You can use Assume.isTrue(isMac()) to ignore Mac specific tests on other platforms. Some developers have Macs (not me).

We have developers that run tests whenever they upload a change, so if a test has an assumption that makes it only run on MacOS then it can still be useful.

All right, I'll add a test. May take a little while, though.
