DESCRIPTION

Add option to delay check for objects

In PackParser, we check non-blob and non-delta objects during the pack
stream. Sometimes, this check can be slow due to local reasons. Add a
flag to configure whether to defer this step until the end of pack
stream.

Line:1110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> Alternatively, we can just defer this collision check since this is the place we need read from local.

Line:913, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> This is confusing. The 4 was easier to understand.

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> same

Line:1110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> Yup, this is the part that is slow. We can still do the objCheck above on every object as it goes through.

Line:913, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> Should we change Constants.PACK_SIGNATURE.length to 4 in line 906 and 908 too? 

Anyway, I will revert this change since it is not related.

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> Done

Line:1110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> I can defer the collision check instead.
I am not sure whether to make this delay optional for non-blob objects?

Currently, blob is always deferred since it may be big.
