DESCRIPTION

Defer object collision check until pack stream is done

Object collision check requires read from local storage which may be
slow. We already delay this check for blobs, this change will also delay
other objects until the pack stream is closed. In this way, there is no
readCurs call until the pack stream is closed.

Line:1095, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> I think you mean:

  if (readCurs.has(obj)) {
    checkObjectCollision(obj);
  }

As coded we skip checking any object as soon as the first object doesn't exist locally.

Line:1127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> This is in the wrong place. You need to catch it throwing from readCurs.open().

Line:1095, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PackParser.java -> Oops! I was about to say 

if (!readCurs.has(obj)) {
  continue;
}

Thanks!
