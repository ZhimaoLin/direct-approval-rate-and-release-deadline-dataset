DESCRIPTION

Use heap based stack for PackFile deltas

Instead of using the current thread's stack to recurse through the
delta chain, use a linked list that is stored in the heap.  This
permits the current thread to load a deep delta chain without running
out of thread stack space.

Despite needing to allocate a stack entry object for each delta
visited along the chain being loaded, the object allocation count is
kept the same as in the prior version by removing the transient
ObjectLoaders from the intermediate objects accessed in the chain.

Each Delta frame on the stack is slightly larger than the SmallObject
type that was typically used before, but the Delta frames should be
smaller than the old method stack frames, so overall memory usage
actually be lower.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I think I'm happy with patch set 3.  The object allocation count is the same as before, but we should be faster if your testing on IndexPack works out the same on PackFile, and we can load deep chains without overflowing the thread stack.
