DESCRIPTION

Mark fields of BaseReceivePack private

None of these should have been exposed to base classes. The majority
of them are private implementation details that are not required by a
subclass in order to interact with the base protocol definition. The
few that are needed should be visible as accessor methods, so the
internals can be modified without breaking the public JGit API.
