Patch Set 16: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(6 inline comments)



Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> comment that this clears all the subscribe specs on all of the SubscribedRepository

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> this method is strange to me, since you are mucking with the SubscribedRepository SubscribeSpecs, even though you  make no other reference to them in this file.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> why would this be null? Is this a valid value to put in the map? If not, explicitly check in putRepository() that
if (repository == null)
  throw new NullPointerException();

Line:121, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> comment that the repositories are closed.

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> same as above

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeCommand.java -> Alternatively you can do:
Arrays.hashCode(new Object[]{command, spec});

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> can we rename pack-number to pack-id in the protocol?  since you are supposed to treat it as an opaque string.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> I think this should be called SubscriptionState, since it is just a data holder now.
