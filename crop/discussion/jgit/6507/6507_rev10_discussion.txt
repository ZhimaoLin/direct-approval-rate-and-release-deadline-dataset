Patch Set 10: (2 inline comments)

Mostly LGTM, just a few small things on the reflog stuff.

Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> Needs JGitText entry, I think

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> I think you probably want false here. true appends one of "created", "fast forward", or "forced-update" to the message. Considering this is basically an unconditional copy, I don't think this information is useful to the user.

Also, it kinda feels like this should come from JGitText, but inspecting existing usages of setRefLogMessage shows that many aren't. I'll defer to Shawn.

Line:1221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Probably should go into a text properties file.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeCommand.java -> .toString() isn't necessary. + will call it for you.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> This isn't really the local ref, its the name of the remote ref from the tracking ref.

We call the things in refs/remotes/* tracking refs, to disambiguate them a bit from the local refs like our own refs/heads/foo and the remote server's refs/heads/master.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> Don't assume this refs/remotes/origin thing applies. Use the RemoteConfig and the fetch RefSpecs it contains.

Line:148, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> Don't assume this refs/remotes/origin/ thing applies. You need to do the translation using the RemoteConfig and the fetch RefSpecs that are declared within it.

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> This name is confusingly wrong. We are unlikely to be copying the remote's refs/heads/master to our refs/heads/master. So why is this method called local ref from pubsub?

Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> Yes please move to a translation file.

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> I agree with Dave, false here.

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> I think you want to forceUpdate().

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> You need perform the deletes before you can create/update.

Consider the case of a remote deleting "refs/heads/foo" and later creating "refs/heads/foo/bar". If you don't clear out the (now gone) refs/pubsub/origin/heads/foo first, you can't create refs/pubsub/origin/foo/bar because foo is a file and not a directory.

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> refdb

Line:278, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> This is somewhat costly, given the amount of refs you need you are better off grabbing all local references once and passing that Map around.

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> It gets the remote ref from a pubsub ref so it can send the correct ref name (refs/heads/master) to the server, but with the pubsub ref's ObjectId.
