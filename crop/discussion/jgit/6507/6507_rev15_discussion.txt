Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> what is your plan for closing these?

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> units?

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> most of this class should be immutable and just manage the logical state of the protocol.

Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Subscriber.java -> this method is not needed, since the Subscribe Executor should know the key when the process is created.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeConnection.java -> Subscribe connections send --> SubscribeConnection sends

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeConnection.java -> missing docs

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeConnection.java -> nit: sendSubscribeAdvertisement

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeConnection.java -> comment is useless.  What does a subscribe actually do?  something about informing the server of references you wish to be pushed to you

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeConnection.java -> nit: subscribe

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeCommand.java -> make these final

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribeCommand.java -> You must override hashCode() too.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SubscribedRepository.java -> move all the refspec munging out of this class and into a common utility class like PubSubRefSpecs.
