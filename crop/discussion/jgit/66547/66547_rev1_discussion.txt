DESCRIPTION

Buck: Make buck build api in gerrit tree work

Building the Gerrit plugin API using
  $ buck build api
didn't work against current JGit tree. That's because
 xxx@xxx.xxx and
 xxx@xxx.xxx
in JGit Buck driven build were implemented as java_library with
exported_deps only, and as such, they don't have output file associated
with them, so that $(location :foo) macro used in javadoc api rule can't
work and is failing.

Fix this, following Keenan Rosario's proposal B. in [1] by using
prebuilt_jar() instead of java_library() that only references exported
dependencies.

I suggested another two solutions for the problem, this change is trying to solve. An intrusive: [1] and non-intrusive one: [2]. In both cases, this change is not needed.

Abandoned

I think we'll go for one of these two options instead of this one

Given that Shawn approved Buck build simplification change in JGit: [1], the only option is: [2].
