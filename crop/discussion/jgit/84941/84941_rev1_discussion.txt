DESCRIPTION

Extract insecure Cipher factory

Bazel runs ErrorProne by default and ErrorProne rightly
complains allowing the user to specify any Cipher can
lead to insecure code. Unfortuantely this is required to
support existing repostiories insecurely stored on S3.

Extract the insecure factory code to its own class so
this can be built as a java_library() with this check
disabled.
