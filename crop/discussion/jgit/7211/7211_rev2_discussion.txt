DESCRIPTION

Do not delta compress objects that have already tried to compress.

If an object is in a pack file already, delta compression will not
attempt to re-compress it. This assumes that the previous
packing already performed the optimal compression attempt, however,
the subclasses of StoredObjectRepresentation may use other heuristics
to determine if the stored format is optimal.
