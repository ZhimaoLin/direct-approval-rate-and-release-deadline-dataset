Line:295, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> This means that the output of preCommitHook and postCommitHook go into the same outputstream. Imagine you have a postCommitHook which emits error messages when it runs into an error. And maybe an application using JGit can react to such errors (retry, warning to the end user??). But with this solution the application has no chance to parse only the postCommitHook output. It would be nice to have the chance to seperate the outputs. E.g. by adding setHookOutputStream(PrintStream precommit, PrintStream postcommit). And the existing setHookOutputStream(hookStdOut) would continue to set the outputstream for all hooks

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/Hooks.java -> s/pre/post/

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HookTest.java -> shouldn't it be post-commit?

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HookTest.java -> you are adding code to CommitCommand which is not tested here, or? Maybe we should add at least one test which has preCommitHook and postCommitHook and which uses CommitCommand.
