Line:295, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> * according to [1] the post-commit hook doesn't respect the --no-verify option
* style nit: bad indentation

[1] https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/Hooks.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx annotation to mark new API

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> that's ok but this sentence doesn't add value to the history

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/PostCommitHook.java -> wrong version, we are now aiming for 4.5
