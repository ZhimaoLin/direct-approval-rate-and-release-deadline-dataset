DESCRIPTION

Fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in CreateBranchCommand

If remote name contains / or there was a branch directly under the
refs/remotes namespace (wrong) the compution of remote name and sugested
local branch name would fail. Fix this by looking at the configured
remotes. A ref under refs/remotes that does not match a remote
configuration is not considered a remote tracking branch anymore.

This patch does not fix all similar errors in EGit/JGit.

I think we should better throw an exception for a broken remote tracking branch missing a valid remote

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> move the bug links to the last paragraph
