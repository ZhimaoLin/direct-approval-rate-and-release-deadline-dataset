DESCRIPTION

ObjectWalk: Use RawTreeIterator for markTreeUninteresting

The loop here is basically identical, but was encoding knowledge of
tree format inside of ObjectWalk. Delegate this to RawTreeIterator
now that there is an implementation lightweight enough to run inside
of this method.

Its only 1 object allocation above the byte[] used by the tree itself,
and this is a small object at 1 reference and 3 ints. With all methods
marked final the JIT should be able to stack allocate and inline much
of the implementation, getting it very close to the hand coded version.

Abandoned

Unproven that RawTreeIterator is faster than the older version. I'm going to just drop this.
