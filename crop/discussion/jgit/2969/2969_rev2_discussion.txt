DESCRIPTION

Add open(File) and wrap(Repository) to Git

When a new Git instance for an exisiting git repository should be
created there are two use-cases: either the application has already a
Repository instance in hand or the application knows where the
repository resides in the filesystem. Two methods are added to
explicitly support these use-cases: wrap(Repository db) and open(File
gitDir)
