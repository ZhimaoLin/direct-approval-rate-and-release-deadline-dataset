Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/HugeFileTest.java -> I would still prefer a mocked version of this test that run <= 1 second and gave us better confidence on the rounding logic.

Ignoring the real file version by default is OK if we have a mock that tests the bulk of the logic on every test run.
