DESCRIPTION

Suppress resource warnings with Java 7

For streams that should not be closed, i.e. don't own an underlying
stream, and in-memory streams that do not need to be closed we just
suppress the warning. This mostly apply to test cases. GC is enough.

For streams with external resources (i.e. files) we add the necessary
call to close().
