DESCRIPTION

Ignore submodule on checkout instead of deleting itt

The purpose of this commit is to prevent destruction of
submodules on checkout from a tree with a submodule to
another. For consistency we handle the reverse case too,
when we checkout a branch that has a submodule and the
submodule directory exists. And finally we ignore the
case where the submodule changes.

We do not update the submodules, we just try to ignore
them harder.
