DESCRIPTION

Ignore submodule on checkout instead of deleting it

The purpose of this commit is to prevent destruction of
submodules on checkout from a tree with a submodule to
another. For consistency we handle the reverse case too,
when we checkout a branch that has a submodule and the
submodule directory exists. And finally we ignore the
case where the submodule changes.

We do not update the submodules, we just try to ignore
them harder.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

this change is heading for stable-1.1 but it is based on I107713ad which is heading for master, so either include the latter also in stable-1.1 or rebase the other two commits onto stable-1.1
