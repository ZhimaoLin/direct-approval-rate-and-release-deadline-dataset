DESCRIPTION

Fix for Bug 371725 - Support binary patches.

Added support for binary patches.
JUnit test is included.
Several minor fixes were also made to properly handle non ASCII
characters (like UTF-8) in text patches.
New method setBinary() has been added on DiffCommand in order to
support backward compatibility. Invoking setBinary(false) on DiffCommand
switches it to mode when binary diff is not generated.
License agreement was properly updated.
