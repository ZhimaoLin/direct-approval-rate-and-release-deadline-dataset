DESCRIPTION

Show submodule difference as a hunk

Current DiffFormat behavior regarding submodules (aka git links) is
incorrect. The "Subproject commit <sha1>" appears as part of the diff
header, rather than as its own hunk.

The current way of processing submodules results in no hunk header and
includes the contents of the hunk as part of the headers. To fix this, we
can't just have our writeGitLinkDiffText output the hunk header. We have
to change the flow so that the raw text gets parsed as a diff. The easiest
way to do this is to fake the RawText in the FormatResult when we have a
GITLINK.

It should be noted that it seems possible for there to be a difference
between a GITLINK and a non-GITLINK, but I don't think this can happen in
practice, so I don't think we need to worry too much about it.

This patch also fixes up the test for GitLink headers, as the test was
for the old behavior. My setup has 3 other failing tests which may or
may not be the result of environmental changes. However, the same tests
fail without this commit, so I do not believe they are related.
