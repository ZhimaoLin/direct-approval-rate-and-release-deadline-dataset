DESCRIPTION

DHT: Use a proper HashMap for RecentChunk lookups

A linear search is somewhat acceptable for only 4 recent chunks, but
a HashMap based lookup would be better. The table will have 16 slots
by default and given the hashCode() of ChunkKey is derived from the
SHA-1 of the chunk, each chunk will fall into its own bucket within
the table and thus evaluate only 1 entry during lookup instead of 4.

Some users may also want to devote more memory to the recent chunks,
in which case expanding this list to a longer length will help to
reduce chunk faults, but would increase search time. Using a HashMap
will help this code to scale to larger sizes better.
