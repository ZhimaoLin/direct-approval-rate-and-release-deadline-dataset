DESCRIPTION

Format merge commit messages like C Git

The automatically generated commit message of a merge should have the
same structure as in C Git for consistency (as per git fmt-merge-msg).

Before this change:

  merging refs/heads/a into refs/heads/master

After:

  Merge branch 'a'

Plurals, "into" and joining by "," and "and" also work.

Patch Set 2:

This patch set addresses most of Shawn's comments. The case with the pull command is handled by adding another list of refs.

The TODO about shortenRefName is still open though. Shawn, can you decide what we should do there?

Actually looks good, the only issue is reusing Repository.shortenRefName instead of duplicating the code.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeMessageFormatter.java -> Lets just make Repository.shortenRefName static, and use that instead of getShortName above.
