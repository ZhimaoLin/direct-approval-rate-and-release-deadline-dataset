DESCRIPTION

Format merge commit messages like C Git

The automatically generated commit message of a merge should have the
same structure as in C Git for consistency (as per git fmt-merge-msg).

Before this change:

  merging refs/heads/a into refs/heads/master

After:

  Merge branch 'a'

Plurals, "into" and joining by "," and "and" also work.
