DESCRIPTION

Move AWT UI components to the jgit-awtui module

This way applications based on SWT/JFace, like the EGit team provider,
don't need to build or install AWT based UI components.  Instead only
applications which need the AWT based UI will depend upon the module.

Since jgit-pgm builds a standalone JAR that is meant to run on any
stock JRE which contains AWT as part of the J2SE runtime library we
need to depend on jgit-awtui there.
