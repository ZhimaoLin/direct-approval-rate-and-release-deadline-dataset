OK, fetched the last patch from Matthias and did some changes on top.

Christian,
I think I've applied now all your comments on the test but I had to revert Matthias change on FS.readPipe code, see comment below. I can see that if I'm running the FS.readPipe code in debugger it works fine, but running this without debugger it fails almost always. Might be FS.readPipe has a bug, I haven't analyzed it yet.

Line:241, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX_Java7.java -> In fact I had now to revert FS.readPipe() change from Matthias as this made the test to fail almost always and to pass randomly. 

Looking at the code of the FS.readPipe I'm a little bit scared if this all needed to read one line output.
