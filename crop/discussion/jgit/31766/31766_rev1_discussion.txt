Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX_Java7.java -> State the problem right here and/or the commit message, rather than forcing the reader to read all comments in the bug report.

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX_Java7.java -> I think readers are well versed in the concept of bitmasks, so use that in the comment and  !(val&2) would be fine in code, with a note that the umask is the inverse mask so we are checking for "execute not turned off" actually

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> Shouldn't you close some streams here?

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> hmm. We do care and should test this case below.

I have no good idea on how to test both cases without using JNI/JNA though.

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit.java7/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX_Java7.java -> Sorry, I can't understand what do you mean by !(val&2). We have characters here.

We check (by character comparison) if we see *either* '0', '2', '4' and '6' as a permission bit for the "others". We can't "and 2" bit-wise here, or I didn't get what do you mean by !(val&2).

I could also write (val % 2) == 0 but I will restrict the code to the explicit character values of '0', '2', '4' and '6'.

So I would like to keep the code as is, especially as it helps to understand "expected" bit values by just looking at chars and without doing char to bit conversions in head.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> I also don't know how one can spawn a process with a different umask from Java and run test inside it. I will add second branch for the case the umask is wrong and let the test fail.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> Done
