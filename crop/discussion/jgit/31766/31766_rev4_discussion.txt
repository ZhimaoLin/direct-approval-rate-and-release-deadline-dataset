Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> I think this is wrong, when umask is 027 permissions don't contain OTHERS_EXECUTE but the test fails here, why should it fail if my system happens to use umask 027 ?

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> So the proposal is ...?
Should we skip the "badUmask" case completely?

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> why is umask 027 bad ? The test itself can't change umask so it should live with what is set on OS level. Of course this means the test can't cover all cases. Or do I miss something?

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> It is correct, we can't do anything with umask if it doesn't "fit". Therefore the question again: should we remove the if(badUmask) case? 

My motivation to add this check was that if a developer wants to develop jgit on Linux the developer must run all the tests and therefore the developer has to use "default" umask which allows to have full test coverage.

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSJava7Test.java -> I discussed this with Christian and we came to the conclusion that the best way to handle badUmask is to ignore the test and print a warning on the error stream to signal the problem to the developer, this way we don't enforce changing umask but the problem doesn't go unnoticed.

I'll upload a new patchset doing that in a minute
