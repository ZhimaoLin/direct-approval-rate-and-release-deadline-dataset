DESCRIPTION

Fix rebase > continue when nothing left to commit.

If after resolving all conflicts nothing is left to commit, behave like
cgit, and display a nice message informing the user.

Currently, EGit displays a "HEAD advanced fast forward" message, which
is absolutely not helpful at all.

This is the basic API revamping required to get that state communicated
to the outside world (EGit). Another possibility would be to "abuse"
some other state (I didn't see a cleaner way to do it).

I know this breaks public APIs, but still this is the best way i saw.

i also took a look at the failing test, but my jgit-fu is not strong enough to decide which one is the correct behaviour; the one before, or the new one. actually it feels like the test does something weird (it commits instead of just staging the resolution, and after that continues although there is nothing left to rebase).
