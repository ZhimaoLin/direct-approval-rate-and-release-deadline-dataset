DESCRIPTION

Ensure that stored credentials aren't reset too early

Some commands are started without showing a dialog allowing to enter
credentials if needed. Hence we need to tolerate one failing HTTP
authentication to trigger loading credentials from the secure store.
Hence we should not immediately reset the stored credentials if the
first attempt to authenticate fails.

Looks okay. Also cherry-picked the fix to stable-3.3 and it worked there. Tested on OS X and Windows7 - both Kepler SR2
