DESCRIPTION

Change args4j minimum version to 2.0.16

In 07f99362575f324e466 Clay Cameron modified constructor calls
to args4j to use a new version that is not available in 2.0.12,
even though the commit message says the version is available.
This commit is from March 12th, 2012, but Juliet Cantu just
merged it on September 23rd 2012.

The new API usage breaks the build unless you have P2 resolver
magically replacing 2.0.12 with 2.0.16. Which doesn't work from
Maven 2, and didn't work at least some of the time in Maven 3 on
my workstation. Its unclear how Brenden Conley was able to verify this
commit when Robin rebased it prior to submit.
