DESCRIPTION

ObjectCheckerTest: Factor duplicate instances out to constants

The tests:

- testCheckBlobNotCorrupt
- testCheckBlobCorrupt

create instances of ObjectChecker that are the same.

The tests:

- testCheckBlobWithBlobObjectCheckerNotCorrupt
- testCheckBlobWithBlobObjectCheckerCorrupt

also create instances of ObjectChecker that are the same.

Factor these instances out to constants instead of creating them
in the tests.

The `checker` member is still created anew in each test, since some
of the tests change its state.
