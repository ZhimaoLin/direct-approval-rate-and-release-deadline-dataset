DESCRIPTION

The constructor CmdLineException(String) is deprecated

Use CmdLineException(CmdLineParser, String) instead. The new constructor
has been added in args4j 2.0.12, so in pom.xml that would be the minimum
version. Set the upper boundary in pom.xml to 2.1.0 (exclusive), just
like in the MANIFEST.MF.
