DESCRIPTION

dfs: Try to avoid searching UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE during packing

If an object can be found in a non-garbage pack, favor that pack over
paging in the garbage pack's idx and pack content.

Only fall back to garbage packs if an object cannot be found and there
are garbage packs present in the repository.  This is fallback is
required to correct race conditions during GC.
