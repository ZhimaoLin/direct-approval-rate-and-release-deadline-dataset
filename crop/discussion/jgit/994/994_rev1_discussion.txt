DESCRIPTION

Remove volatile keyword from RepositoryEvent

We don't need this field to be volatile.  Events are delivered by
the same thread that created the RepositoryEvent object, and thus
any cross-thread operations would need to be handled by some other
type of synchronization in the listener, and that would protect
both the repository field and any other per-event data.
