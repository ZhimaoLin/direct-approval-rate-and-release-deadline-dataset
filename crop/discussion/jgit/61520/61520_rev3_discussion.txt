DESCRIPTION

DirCache: Add helper to read from a tree

Application code sometimes wants to read a DirCache from an ObjectId,
but its confusing how to do this because its buried inside the
DirCacheBuilder.

Use this utility in a few places within JGit that also want to read
a DirCache from a tree's ObjectId.
