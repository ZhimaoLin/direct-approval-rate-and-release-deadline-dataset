DESCRIPTION

stages field for GitIndex entry introduced

Currently, if the Index contains a file in more than one stage, only
the last entry (containing the highest stage) will be registered in
GitIndex. For applications it can be useful to not only know about the
highest stage, but also which other stages are present, e.g. to detect
the type of conflict the file is in.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:762, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GitIndex.java -> You added this method also as a separate change: http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,629
It looks like getMtime has nothing to do with stages hence it should come as separate change.
