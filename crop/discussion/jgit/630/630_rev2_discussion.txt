DESCRIPTION

stages field and getter for GitIndex entry introduced

Currently, if the Index contains a file in more than one stage, only
the last entry (containing the highest stage) will be registered in
GitIndex. For applications it can be useful to not only know about the
highest stage, but also which other stages are present, e.g. to detect
the type of conflict the file is in.
