DESCRIPTION

Fix LockFile semantics when running on NFS

When running on NFS there was a chance that JGits LockFile
semantic is broken because File#createNewFile() may allow
multiple clients to create the same file in parallel. This
change provides a fix which is only used when the new config
option core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile is set to false. The
default for this option is true.

If the config option core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile is true
then File#createNewFile() is trusted and the behaviour doesn't
change.

But if core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile is set to false then after
successful creation of the lock file a hardlink to that lock file is
created and the attribute nlink of the lock file is checked to be 2. If
multiple clients manage to create the same lock file nlink would be
greater than 2 showing the error.

This expensive workaround is described in
 https://www.time-travellers.org/shane/papers/NFS_considered_harmful.html
section III.d) "Exclusive File Creation"

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> I think this also needs to be volatile

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> add a TODO that we should enhance SystemReader to enable this without copying some of its code ?

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> unnecessary initialization.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> rewrite as:

  supportsAtomicCreateNewFile = ret == null || ret

?
