DESCRIPTION

Define a tree filter for user-visible changes between two indexes

The primary purpose of the filter is to detect an index change that
could possibly lead to a change in what files are visible in the staging
view and decorations. Besides what TreeFilter.ALL does for trees in
general, this filter also looks at the assume-valid (CE_VALID) flag to
see whether changes should be ignored or not.
