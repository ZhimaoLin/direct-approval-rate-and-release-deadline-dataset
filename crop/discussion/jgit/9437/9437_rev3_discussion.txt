DESCRIPTION

Define a tree filter for user-visible changes between two indexes

The primary purpose of the filter is to detect an index change that
could possibly lead to a change in what files are visible in the staging
view and decorations. Besides what TreeFilter.ANY_DIFF does for trees in
general, this filter also looks at the assume-valid (CE_VALID) flag to
see whether changes should be ignored or not.

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/InterIndexDiffFilter.java -> wouldn't
  
  if (baseDci.isAssumeValid())

be sufficient in the previous line? We know already baseDci.isAssumeValid() is equal to newDci.isAssumeValid(). No need to check both values.
