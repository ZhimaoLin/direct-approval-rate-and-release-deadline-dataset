DESCRIPTION

Add getBaseCommit() to Merger

The Merger was was only exposing the merge base as an
AbstractTreeIterator. Since we need the merge base as
RevCommit to generate the merge result I expose it here.

Patch Set 2:

If you want to submit this change, you need to also submit its parent ("Implement a Dircache checkout (needed for merge)") or cherry-pick it directly onto current master so it doesn't have that dependency.
