DESCRIPTION

Allow trailing newlines in receive-pack

C git's receive-pack.c strips trailing newlines in command lists when
present[1], although send-pack.c does not send them, at least in the
case of command lists[2]. Change JGit to match this behavior.
Add tests.

This also fixes parsing of commands in the push cert, which, unlike
commands sent in the non-push case, always have trailing newlines.

where packet_read_line chomps newlines:

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Line:1094, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> consider being paranoid and prefix with "line.length() > 0"?

Line:1101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> final isn't necessary in new code; i would call this new code.

Line:1104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> pointless to have a cmd variable here before return. just join the return to the new.
