DESCRIPTION

Allow trailing newlines when parsing ReceiveCommand

C git's receive-pack.c strips trailing newlines in command lists when
present[1], although send-pack.c does not send them[2]. Change JGit to
match this behavior. Add tests.

This also fixes parsing of commands in the push cert, which, unlike
commands sent in the non-push case, always have trailing newlines.

where packet_read_line above chomps newlines:

Line:1042, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Why isn't this changed to readString() which strips the LF?

Line:1042, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> In order to reconstruct the signed push certificate payload we need to keep track of whether there was a trailing newline.

Reworked so we still use readStringRaw, but the line variable used in parsing other commands has its newline chomped.
