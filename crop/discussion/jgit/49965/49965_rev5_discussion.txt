DESCRIPTION

Allow trailing newlines in receive-pack

C git's receive-pack.c strips trailing newlines in command lists when
present[1], although send-pack.c does not send them, at least in the
case of command lists[2]. Change JGit to match this behavior.
Add tests.

This also fixes parsing of commands in the push cert, which, unlike
commands sent in the non-push case, always have trailing newlines.

where packet_read_line chomps newlines:
