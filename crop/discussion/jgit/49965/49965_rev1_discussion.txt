DESCRIPTION

Allow trailing newlines when parsing ReceiveCommand

C git's receive-pack.c strips trailing newlines in command lists when
present[1], although send-pack.c does not send them[2]. Change JGit to
match this behavior. Add tests.

This also fixes parsing of commands in the push cert, which, unlike
commands sent in the non-push case, always have trailing newlines.

where packet_read_line above chomps newlines:
