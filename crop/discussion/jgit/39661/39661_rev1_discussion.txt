Line:563, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> why is the newline needed at the beginning?

If this line will stay then move it down between 565 and 566

Line:563, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Looks ok to me. In line 560-562 the buffer is filled with an initial text. To have a newline between that text and the following stacktrace we need this \n here.

Line:567, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Whe should a xxx@xxx.xxx that we want to do logging instead of writing to stderr.
