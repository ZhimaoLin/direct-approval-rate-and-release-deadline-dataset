DESCRIPTION

Config: Preserve existing case of names in sections

When an application asks for the names in a section, it may want to
see the existing case that was stored by the user.  For example,
Gerrit Code Review wants to store a configuration block like:

  [access "refs/heads/master"]
    label-Code-Review = group Developers

and although the name label-Code-Review is case-insensitive, it wants
to display the case as it appeared in the configuration file.

When enumerating section names or variable names (both of which are
case-insensitive), Config now keeps track of the string that first
appeared, and presents them in file order, permitting applications to
use this information.  To maintain case-insensitive behavior, the
contains() method of the returned Set<String> still performs a
case-insensitive compare.

This is a behavior change if the caller enumerates the returned
Set<String> and copies it to his own Set<String>, and then performs
contains() tests against that, as the strings are now the original
case from the configuration block.  But I don't think anyone actually
does this, as the returned sets are immutable and are cached.
