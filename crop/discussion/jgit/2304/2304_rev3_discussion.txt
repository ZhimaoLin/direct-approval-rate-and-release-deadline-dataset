DESCRIPTION

Exposed the constructor of Note class

Additionally, defined the NoteMap.getNote method which returns a Note
instance.  These changes were necessary to enable implementation of
the NoteMerger interface (the merge method needs to instantiate a
Note) and to enable direct use of NoteMerger which expects instances
of Note class as its paramters.  Implementing creation of code review
summary notes in Gerrit [1] will make use of both of these features.
