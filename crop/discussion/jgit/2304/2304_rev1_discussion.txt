DESCRIPTION

Exposed the constructor of Note class as public.

Additionally, defined the NoteMap.getNote method which returns a Note
instance.  These changes were necessary to enable implementation of
the NoteMerger interface (the merge method needs to instantiate a
Note) and to enable direct use of NoteMerger which expects instances
of Note class as its paramters.  Implementing creation of code review
summary notes in Gerrit [1] will make use of both of these features.

Looks ok, will wait for Shawn's comments.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteBucket.java -> Looks ok... but given that we have get(...)... shouldn't we just use getNote(...) now and drop the generic get(...)?

Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteMap.java -> Lets leave this get() however as its part of the public NoteMap API and some callers may prefer this variant.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteBucket.java -> My thoughts exactly Chris.  Lets drop get(...) at the same time and just replace it with getNote().  The delta may actually be smaller because we aren't duplicating the method bodies.

Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteMap.java -> Done

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteBucket.java -> Done.
The delta for this class is smaller but the delta for LeafBucketTest is larger because it now must to use getNote().getData() instead of the get() method above.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteBucket.java -> Done
