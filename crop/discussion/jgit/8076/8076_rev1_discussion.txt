Line:180, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> I think this should be a GitAPIException since it's not an internal error but an operation which is illegal in the current repository state (e.g. see NoHeadException thrown above), maybe WrongRepositoryStateException would fit here ?
