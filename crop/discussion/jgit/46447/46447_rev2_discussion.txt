DESCRIPTION

Revert "Let ObjectWalk.markUninteresting also mark the root tree as"

The Iff2de881 tried to fix missing tree ..." but introduced severe
performance degradation (>10x in some cases) when acting as server
(git push) and as client (replication). IOW cure is worse than the
disease.

This reverts commit c4797fe98655b3d52d0a90ba44fce6e053db3b8b.

Don't know. After upgrade to Gerrit 2.10.3.1 (from 2.8) we had severe performance degradation on our huge repositories during git push and CPU consumption explosion during replication. Applying this change solved all problems.

I don't know, but Google has been running with this revert in our Git and Gerrit servers since I commented on Iff2de881 in Sept of 2014. The performance regression was too much for us to take and we have never really tripped over the original bug report in our environment.
