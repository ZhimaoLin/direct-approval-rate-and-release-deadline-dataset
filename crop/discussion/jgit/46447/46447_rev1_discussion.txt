DESCRIPTION

Revert "Let ObjectWalk.markUninteresting also mark the root tree as"

The Iff2de881 tried to fix missing tree ..." but introduced severe
performance degradation (>10x in some cases) when acting as server
(git push) and as client (replication). IOW cure is worse than the
disease.

This reverts commit c4797fe98655b3d52d0a90ba44fce6e053db3b8b.
