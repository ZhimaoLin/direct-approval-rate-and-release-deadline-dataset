DESCRIPTION

Skip cleaning inner repositories by default in CleanCommand

Previously jgit would attempt to clean git repositories that had not
been committed by calling a non-recursive delete on them, which would
fail as they are directories. This commit addresses that issue in the
following ways.
Repositories are skipped in a default clean, similarly to cgit and only
cleaned when the force flag is applied. When the force flag is applied
repositories are deleted using a recursive delete call. The force flag
and setForce method are added here to CleanCommand to support this
change.
