DESCRIPTION

Skip cleaning inner repositories by default in CleanCommand

Previously jgit would list git repositories that had not been committed
as untracked files, which would result in a non-recursive delete being
called on them, which would fail as they are directories. This commit
addresses that issue in the following ways.
First, repositories are now listed with untrackedFolders so that a
recursive delete will be used, which is appropriate. Second,
repositories are skipped in a default clean, similarly to cgit and only
cleaned when the force flag is applied.
