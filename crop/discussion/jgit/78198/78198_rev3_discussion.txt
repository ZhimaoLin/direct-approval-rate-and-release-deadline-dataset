DESCRIPTION

Skip cleaning inner repositories by default in CleanCommand

Previously jgit would attempt to clean git repositories that had not
been committed by calling a non-recursive delete on them, which would
fail as they are directories. This commit addresses that issue in the
following ways.
Repositories are skipped in a default clean, similarly to cgit and only
cleaned when the force flag is applied. When the force flag is applied
repositories are deleted using a recursive delete call. The force flag
and setForce method are added here to CleanCommand to support this
change.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> style nit: we use tabs for indention. That's also true for the other lines you added/modified.

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> What should happen if recurse==false but curFile.isDirectory() is true? I would guess that if you have specified recurse==false we should never go into folders, or? Maybe a test for that would be good. And if recurse==true and curFile.isDirectory()==false do we really want to add a "/"? Adding a slash behind a path we know that he is no folder? A javadoc explaining the semantics of this method is needed.

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> we need xxx@xxx.xxx tag here since this a a new method

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CleanCommand.java -> I've pushed a change that I think should resolve these concerns. I added javadoc that explains the method and moved some directory checking into the method.

The recurse parameter was removed, as it basically mirrored the directories field on the class. An isDirectory() call was added to the method to gate recursively deleting.

In the new version of the method, we will only recursively delete if the directories field is true and if the path is a directory (or a git repository). The same conditions are used to add a trailing "/" to the path.
