DESCRIPTION

Add lookup to remote config if the refSpec is not explicitly set

If no refSpec is explicitly set, the PushCommand should first check the
remote config and then as a fallback use the current behavior.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommandTest.java -> This isn't really what we are testing; we are checking that HEAD is pushed if nothing else was given.

Given that I wonder if we should set the local HEAD name to something other than "master" and verify that is on the remote side, and and also have a "not-pushed" branch on the local side that we observe is not sent to the remote.
