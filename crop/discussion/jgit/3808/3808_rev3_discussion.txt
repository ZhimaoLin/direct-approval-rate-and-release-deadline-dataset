DESCRIPTION

Add lookup to remote config if the refSpec is not explicitly set

If no refSpec is explicitly set, the PushCommand should first check the
remote config and then as a fallback use the current behavior.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)



Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommandTest.java -> Now we still have a Push command which potentially creates new branches on the remote although there is no explicit refspec. Local branch names are taken to create branches on the remote repo although the user has not explicitly requested that.

Is this really what we want? Native git also doesn't do that and when I look at the bad names which I give to my local branches I can guess why. It should be an explicit operation to publish my local branch names.

Since this behaviour is not introduced or touched by this change (but strangely it's tested here) I suggest to accept this change and to create a bug for the old behaviour.
