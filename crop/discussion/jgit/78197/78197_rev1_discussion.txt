DESCRIPTION

Add force parameter to CleanCommand

For certain clean operations, such as deleting inner repositories, cgit
leverages a force flag to decide if they should be skipped or not. This
commit adds such a flag to the CleanCommand, so that future work can
use this flag to decide whether a repository should be deleted or not.

adding just the field without anywhere using it doesn't bring any value. Just squash this and the next commit together
