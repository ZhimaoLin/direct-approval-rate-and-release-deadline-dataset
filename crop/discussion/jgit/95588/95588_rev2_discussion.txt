DESCRIPTION

Checkout should not use too long filenames

DirCacheCheckout is generating names for temporary files. It was not checking
the length of this filenames. It may happen that a generated filename is
longer than 255 chars which causes problems on certain platforms. Make sure
that filenames for temporary files do not exceed 255 chars.
