DESCRIPTION

ObjectIdSubclassMap: Change initial size to 2048

32 is way to small for the map. Most applications using the map
will need to load more than 16 objects just from the root refs
being read from the Repository.

Default the initial size to 2048. This cuts out 6 expansions in
the early life of the table, reducing garbage and rehashing time.
