DESCRIPTION

Throw BinaryBlobException from RawParseUtils#lineMap.

This makes detection of binaries exact for ResolveMerger and
DiffFormatter: they will classify files as binary regardless of where
the '\0' occurs in the text.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:635, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> Unused

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> Missing javadoc for arguments.

Also, it reads weirdly that only one argument is final

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> I'm just going by the warnings Eclipse shows me.

Presumably the rule is, if there's a Javadoc at all, it must xxx@xxx.xxx
