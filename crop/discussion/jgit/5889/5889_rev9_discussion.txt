DESCRIPTION

Update smudged entries when writing index

Overload DirCache.lock to take a repository that is
used for updating smudged index entries with information
from the repository's working tree.

New unit tests are also added for updating smudged index
entries on reset, checkout, and commit.

Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> Done

Line:874, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> This is needed in the case where this method is called to obtain a DirCache that is then written after a subsequent call to DirCache.lock so that the DirCache has a handle to the repository to update smudged index entries with data from the working tree.
