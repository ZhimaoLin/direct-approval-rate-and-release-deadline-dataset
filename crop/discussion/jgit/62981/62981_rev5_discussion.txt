DESCRIPTION

DirCache: Do not create duplicate tree entries

If a file (e.g.  "A") and a subtree file (e.g.  "A/foo.c") both appear
in the DirCache this cache cannot be written out as a tree object. The
"A" file and "A" subtree conflict with each other in the same tree and
will fail fsck.

Detect this condition during DirCacheBuilder and DirCacheEditor finish()
so the application can be halted early before it updates a DirCache that
might later write an invalid tree structure.

Add a new test case for this.
