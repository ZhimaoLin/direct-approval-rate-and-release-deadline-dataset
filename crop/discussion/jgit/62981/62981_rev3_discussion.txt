DESCRIPTION

DirCache: Do not create duplicate tree entries

If a file (e.g.  "A") and a subtree file (e.g.  "A/foo.c") both appear
in the DirCache this cache cannot be written out as a tree object. The
"A" file and "A" subtree conflict with each other in the same tree and
will fail fsck.

Detect this condition during DirCacheBuilder and DirCacheEditor finish()
so the application can be halted early before it updates a DirCache that
might later write an invalid tree structure.

Add a new test case for this.

Line:243, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/BaseDirCacheEditor.java -> Just about the naming:
That name confused me. The name let me think there are two independent buffers of arbitrary length and you want to check whether they have the same prefix on the first x bytes. Then I would have expected a parameter prefixLen (which is not tied to buffer a) and that you check both buffers whether they at least have that length.
From the implementation I would have expected a name like "startsWith" where you specifiy two buffers (the first one with length) and you want to know whether the second starts with the first.
