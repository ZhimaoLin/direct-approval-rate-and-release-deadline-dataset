DESCRIPTION

DirCache: Optionally do not create duplicate tree entries

If a file (e.g.  "A") and a subtree file (e.g.  "A/foo.c") both appear
in the DirCache this cache should not be written out as a tree object.
The "A" file and "A" subtree conflict with each other in the same tree
and will fail fsck.

Optionally allow application code to detect this condition during
DirCacheBuilder and DirCacheEditor finish() so the application can be
halted early before it updates a DirCache that might later write an
invalid tree structure.

Leave this check off by default as existing JGit code is otherwise
broken by the additional safety checks. Some unit tests write out
these overlapping path entries, and should not be fixed.
