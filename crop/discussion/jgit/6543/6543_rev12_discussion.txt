Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> Subscribe --> SubscribeConnection

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> this seems short, given some connections can be very slow. Why did you choose 4 and not 10 or 30?

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> private

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> nice, much clearer!

Line:240, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> i think i would change this as follows to make it more readable:

if (RefSpec.isWildcard(spec) && !refName.startsWith(
spec.substring(0, spec.length() - 1)) {
  continue;
} else if (!refName.equals(spec)) {
  continue;
}
String objId = ref.getValue().getLeaf().getObjectId().getName();
write("have " + objId + " " + refName);

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> default:
throw new IllegalArgumentException...
