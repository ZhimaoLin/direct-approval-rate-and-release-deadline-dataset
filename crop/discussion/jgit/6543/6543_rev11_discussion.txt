Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> private static. everything used within this file should be private.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> unlock twice... see 86

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> long method. break up the logic into smaller functions or classes.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> might as well use a case statement

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> this check looks familar, maybe in RefSpec.  Consider reusing the functionality.

Line:344, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> setRefName

Line:445, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> i understand the words individually, but not together in this fashion.
