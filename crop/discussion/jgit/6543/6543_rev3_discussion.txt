Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> volatile?

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> Unnecessary, booleans default to false.

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> Hm, I'm not sure I would expect a method called validateFoo to have this kind of side effect.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> It's not clear from context why you can't use a bidirectional pipe for this, especially considering the class javadoc.

Line:444, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> I suppose this wording will require some bikeshedding.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> Done

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> Done

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> Not sure I would either, but I'm at a slight loss as to where to do the ref translation and this seemed like the best point. Renaming after ReceivePack finishes won't work because the local refs will be touched and the old IDs won't match up. The pre-receive hook is called after validation takes place, and only contains valid refs (which will be none of them if not translated first).

I could drop down to repo.newObjectInserter().newPackParser(in) and re-implement the command reading portion. Would that be better?

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackSubscribeConnection.java -> The javadoc (wrongly) uses bi-directional in the HTTP sense of send then receive, so I will change that wording. The protocol is designed to not need to talk back to the server, and with the bidirectional pipe setting on ReceivePack will send back status messages.

Line:444, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Yeah, I'm not entirely sure how much logging detail to output when a new update comes in.
