Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> I think that the block is covering all cases. If the file doesn't exist the update flag is set and the file is in the index then the file is not added to the newly created index (this is the else if ).

I added a new test method testAddWithoutParameterUpdate and commented the existing one testAddWithParameterUpdate. They handle the six interesting cases. I do not test the case of "file exists neither in workdir nor inindex".

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> Why do we add another iterator over the Dircache? We already have one in the Walk and we can reuse him.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> I think this block here is not covering all cases. E.g. if the file doesn't exist, the update flag is set and the file is in the index: that's happening when you just delete a tracked file in the work-dir and call "add -u". 
You expect the file to be deleted. But we just add it again.

Check your if's against all possible combinations of "update flag set", "file exists in workdir", "file exists in index" -- these are just 8 cases.
