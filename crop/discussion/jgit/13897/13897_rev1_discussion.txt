DESCRIPTION

Add RequestPolicy.TIP to allow fetching non-advertised ref tips

Users of UploadPack may set a custom RefFilter or AdvertisedRefsHook
that limits which refs are advertised, but clients may learn of a
SHA-1 that the server should have as a ref tip through some
alternative means.  Support serving such objects from the server side
with a new RequestPolicy.

Line:376, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done. I didn't test on HTTP but I did test by setting the RequestPolicy explicitly to REACHABLE_COMMIT_TIP.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:376, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> On HTTP TIP doesn't work. You need two different types of REACHABLE_COMMIT.
