DESCRIPTION

Add RequestPolicy.TIP to allow fetching non-advertised ref tips

Users of UploadPack may set a custom RefFilter or AdvertisedRefsHook
that limits which refs are advertised, but clients may learn of a
SHA-1 that the server should have as a ref tip through some
alternative means. Support serving such objects from the server side
with a new RequestPolicy.

As with ADVERTISED, we need a special relaxed RequestPolicy to allow
commits reachable from the set of valid tips for unidirectional
connections.
