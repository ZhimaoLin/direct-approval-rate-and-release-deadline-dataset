DESCRIPTION

[342372] Ident attribute implementation


The implementation follow the specification defined by the git-attribute
page [1] and some investigation made with CGit. One of the major
difference with CGit implementation is that on checkin it only converts
the pattern $Id: BLOB_NAME $ to $Id$ if only the blob name is exactly 40
charactere long.
