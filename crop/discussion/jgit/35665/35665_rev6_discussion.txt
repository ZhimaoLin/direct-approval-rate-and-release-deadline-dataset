DESCRIPTION

[342372] Ident attribute implementation

The implementation follow the specification defined by the git-attribute
page [1] and some investigation made with CGit. One of the major
difference with CGit implementation is that on checkin it only converts
the pattern $Id: BLOB_NAME $ to $Id$ if only the blob name is smaller
than 4096
charactere long. This is a limitation of the current implementation.

Patch Set 6:

My last patch set corrects the problem of the modified file on the git status command. My first implementation of the IdentInputStream only convert "$Id:CONTENT$" to "$Id$" if content was 43 characters long (blob id name length + 2 extra spaces). However, in the linux repository some file (for example[1]) have the ident pattern with some odd content (see [2] which is not a blob id). In this use case, my previous implementation of the IdentInputStream did not match the pattern so the content in the index and in the working tree file were different. I have also rebased my worked to use the performances improvement of the previous revisions. Moreover I have also improved the number of opened files. I will publish the result of my last test in next comment and I will summarize it in the linked bug.

Hello,

No I do not think so for the same reasons mentioned in my previous comment [1].

Patch Set 6:

Could you split this commit? There are a lot of changes here which are ident independent. Most of the work in DirCacheCheckout is only there that attributes are read at all and handed over to checkoutEntry(). Or everything in ResolveMerger. If you would have one commit which triggers reading attributes and forwarding them to methods which are very likely to use that data. And another commit just for ident specific stuff.

I came to that because I wanted to write a provider reading a dummy property "foo" and found that a lot of code I need is hidden in this big commit.

I think your comment on the previous review might impact this code. So I will gladly split this commit once we have found a proper way to integrate the previous review.
