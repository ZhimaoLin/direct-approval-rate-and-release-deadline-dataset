DESCRIPTION

Expose pack fetch/push connections for subclassing

These classes need to be visible if an application wants to define
its own native pack based protocol embedded within another layer,
much like we already support for smart HTTP.

LGTM, these classes have some more public methods without javadoc, maybe this could be fixed also

Patch Set 2:

The missing javadoc you are talking about on public or protected methods is inherited from the defining interface or base class.  Our coding style doesn't call to repeat docs in the implementation or override of such methods.
