DESCRIPTION

Fix diff bug on inserted line

JGit produced an incorrect diff, attempting to add a new "}" instead
of the new "#endif" at the end of the hunk. This was caused by a prior
fix for bug 328895 where we wanted to "slide" a diff down in the file
when adding a new method/function and want to show the closing curly
brace as being added after the new method, rather than added onto the
end of the prior function or method just before the insertion point.
