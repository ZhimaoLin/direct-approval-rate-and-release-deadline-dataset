DESCRIPTION

Fully implement Logger interface

On April 27, 2010 the Logger interface was upgraded with a number of new methods
to make it consistent with the implementations it was meant to support.

This patch makes RecordingLogger consistent with the Logger interface and allows to
also use Jetty 7.1.5 released with Helios which can be installed from the p2 repository
at http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/7.1.5.v20100705/repository
