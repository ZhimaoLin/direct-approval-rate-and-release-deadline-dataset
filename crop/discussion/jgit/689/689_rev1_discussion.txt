Fully implement Logger interface

On April 27, 2010 the Logger interface was upgraded with a number of new methods to make it
consistent with the implementations it was meant to support.

This patch makes RecordingLogger consistent with the Logger interface.

- looks like an incompatible change in the jetty Logger interface
- which version of jetty are you using here ? 
- currently we build against jetty 7.0.1.
- which helios package or feature includes org.eclipse.jetty.util.log ? I use PDE and there is no such problem so far

There really isn't a problem with this change, we can include it.  But it seems odd that we need to update our implementation of this interface without also changing the version of Jetty we reference in our build and our manifests.  

Did Jetty make an incompatible API change in a service release?

I get the compile errors when using Eclipse 3.6M7 Helios - the RCP distribution. I then added Jetty from the Eclipse RT project. In 3.6M7, Jetty is at 7.1 but in M6 it was at 7.02 and did not have the new Logger interface. The problem we face is that any potential contributor who has a fully up to date Helios environment will encounter this problem when they build under Eclipse. The Maven builds will not be affected because you reference specific versions in them.
