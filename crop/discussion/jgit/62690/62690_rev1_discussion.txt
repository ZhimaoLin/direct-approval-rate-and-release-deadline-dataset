DESCRIPTION

Add tests for PathFilterGroup.Single

Expand the existing PathFilterGroup tests to check which paths the
tree entry matches.  This expands test coverage by ensuring that
PathFilterGroup's simpler code path to match against a single
PathFilter works correctly.

While at it, move the check on tree entry d/e/f/g.y into two separate
tests: one to check that it doesn't match any of the configured paths,
and another to check that it does not throw StopWalkException to end
the walk early.
