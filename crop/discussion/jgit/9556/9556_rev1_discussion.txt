DESCRIPTION

Delete the iplog generator

It stopped working when we moved to the Eclipse foundation's Gerrit
server since it doesn't use the Gerrit internal user store but LDAP.
Instead, since 2.0, we use the Eclipse foundation's automatic IP log
generator [1] to generate IP logs for releasing jgit and egit.
