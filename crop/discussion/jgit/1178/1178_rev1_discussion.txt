that it has a persistent configuration of some kind which can be
accessed by the application, without needing to know exact details
of how its stored .

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/StoredConfig.java -> Not really, no, we shouldn't use IOException.  But that is the current root of our Exception type hierarchy elsewhere in JGit.  So its what we export here.  :-(
