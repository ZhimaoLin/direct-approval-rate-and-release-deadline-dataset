DESCRIPTION

Compare timestamps in a second precision

java.io.File and Java7 java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFileAttributes return
timestamps in milliseconds, but they have a second precision. Java8
PosixFileAttributes uses a nanosecond precision.

Because of this difference, FileTreeIteratorTest only have second precision
values for comparison. This makes the test fail in Java8. Make an assertion
based on a second precision for compatibility.

Backup facts:

java.io.File#lastModified() calls FileSystem#getLastModifiedTime().
UnixFileSystem is a FileSystem used in Linux and it uses a second precision
value internally.

PosixFileAttributes is backed by sun.nio.fs.UnixNativeDispatcher. In Java7, it's
reading only second precision values. In Java8, it's reading nanosecond
precision values too.

Thanks for the contribution!

The fix would be to change the setup code and use there the new construct:
instead of 
mtime[i] = new File(trash, s).lastModified();
it should be:
mtime[i] = FS.DETECTED.lastModified(new File(trash, s));

Can you please add this change to the https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79407/?

If I combine those two commits I see no fails anymore on Java 8 in FileTreeIteratorTest

Line:661, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> But this can make test think that the time stamps are equal even if they aren't and should not be equal.
