Line:493, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> include a folder with the name sr anc one called srcs

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> abcde starts with abc. ignoredPaths does dot end with / for directories, I think, so you need a bit more logic here

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> you are right, now using WorkingTreeIterator.isEntryIgnored()
