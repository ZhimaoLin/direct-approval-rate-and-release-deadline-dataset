DESCRIPTION

Support core.autocrlf = input

The core.autocrlf variable can take on three values: false, true,
and input.  Parsing it as a boolean is wrong, we instead need to
parse a tri-state enumeration.

Add support for parsing and setting enum values from Java from and
to the text based configuration file, and use that to handle the
autocrlf variable.
