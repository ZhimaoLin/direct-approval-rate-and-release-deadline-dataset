DESCRIPTION

Send a detailed event on working tree modifications

Currently there is no way to determine the precise changes done
to the working tree by a JGit command. Only the CheckoutCommand
actually provides access to the lists of modified, deleted, and
to-be-deleted files, but those lists may be inaccurate (since they
are determined up-front before the working tree is modified) if
the actual checkout then fails halfway through. Moreover, other
JGit commands that modify the working tree do not offer any way to
figure out which files were changed.

This poses problems for EGit, which may need to refresh parts of the
Eclipse workspace when JGit has done java.io file operations.

Provide the foundations for better file change tracking: the working
tree is modified exclusively in DirCacheCheckout. Make it emit a new
type of RepositoryEvent that lists all files that were modified or
deleted, even if the checkout failed halfway through. We update the
'updated' and 'removed' lists determined up-front in case of file
system problems to reflect the actual state of changes made.

EGit thus can register a listener for these events and then knows
exactly which parts of the Eclipse workspace may need to be refreshed.

Two commands manage checking out individual DirCacheEntries themselves:
checkout specific paths, and applying a stash with untracked files.
Make those two also emit such a new WorkingTreeModifiedEvent.

Furthermore, merges may modify files, and clean, rm, and stash create
may delete files.

Test failure appears to be unrelated; somewhere in LFS tests.

Hmmm. Actually, it's caused by

  [INFO] Compiling 22 source files to /jobs/genie.jgit/jgit.gerrit/workspace/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/target/test-classes
/jobs/genie.jgit/jgit.gerrit/workspace/org.eclipse.jgit.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/events/ChangeRecorder.java:46: error: package org.junit does not exist
  import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

I have _no_ clue why this occurs. Doesn't occur in Eclipse. Maven problem? (org.junit and org.hamcrest are dependencies with scope "test" in pom.xml. Could that be the reason??)
