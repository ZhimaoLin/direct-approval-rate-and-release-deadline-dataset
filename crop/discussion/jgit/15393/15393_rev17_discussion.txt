DESCRIPTION

Add special case to WorkingTreeIterator for matching unnormalized symlinks

If there is an unnormalized symbolic link in the index, lie that it
matches a normalized link in the working tree. This does not make the
case completely invisible everywhere though, but it helps to some
degree.
