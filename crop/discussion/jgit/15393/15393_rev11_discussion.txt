DESCRIPTION

Add special case to WorkingTreeIterator for matching unormalized symlinks

If there is a unnormalized symbolic link in the index, lie that it matches
a normalized link in the working tree. This does not make the case
completely invisible everywhere though, but it helps to some degree.

Line:921, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I would put a note that File constructor always normalizes it's argument, so that we doing a check of links in normalized form, independently of their original state.
