Line:848, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Braces are still missing here per the comment on the previous patch set.

Line:850, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> This line wrapping seems a bit odd to me, although maybe I'm just not familiar with this project's conventions.
