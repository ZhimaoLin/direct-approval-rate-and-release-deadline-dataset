how about adding a test ?

Line:848, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> style nit: missing braces

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think your name is Saniya Hill not David Puresehouse

Line:848, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I've been wondering what the preferred style is in cases like this.  Many other places in the code do not have braces for one-line blocks.

Line:848, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> We changed the formatting guideline to use braces for 1 line blocks some time back, that's mentioned in the EGit contributor guide (can't access it currently due to network issues). Since then we use braces for oneline blocks for newly added or modified code. We don't want to apply the new rule globally in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts
