DESCRIPTION

Fix possible InvalidObjectIdException in ObjectDirectory

ObjectDirectory.getShallowCommits should throw an IOException
instead of an InvalidArgumentException if invalid SHAs are present
in .git/shallow (as this file is usually edited by a human).

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectoryTest.java -> I would put the expected fail case in a separate test method.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectoryTest.java -> This would be cleaner with ExpectedException, i.e. declare at class scope:

 public ExpectedException expectedEx = ExpectedException.none();

and in the test method:

 expectedEx.expect(IOException.class);
 dir.getShallowCommits();

it would also be possible to assert on the exception message:

 expectedEx.expect(IOException.class);
 expectedEx.expectMessage("Bad shallow line: X3148f9410b071edd4a4c85d2a43d1fa2574b0d2");
 dir.getShallowCommits();

the test will then fail if the exception is not raised with the correct message, and the call to Assert.fail() is not needed.

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectoryTest.java -> Done

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectoryTest.java -> I didn't know ExpectedException -- nice. I'm using JGitText.get().badShallowLine so we won't test for possible textual changes.
