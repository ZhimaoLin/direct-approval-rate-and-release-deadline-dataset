DESCRIPTION

Fix possible InvalidObjectIdException in ObjectDirectory

ObjectDirectory.getShallowCommits should throw an IOException
instead of an InvalidArgumentException if invalid SHAs are present
in .git/shallow (as this file is usually edited by a human).

Line:697, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> At least, it's a non-localizable String in shallow.c as well.

What are jgit rules on external string resources?

Line:257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Here.

Line:697, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Results of

  git grep "new IOException"

show that the majority of them are externalised (including one in this file, see above).

Those that are not are in test files or are passing in a variable, for example

  u.toString() + ": "

So I would say that this one should also be externalized.
