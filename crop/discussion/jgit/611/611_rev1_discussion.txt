DESCRIPTION

Favor earlier PackFile instances over later duplicates

There is a potential race condition during insertPack that can lead
to us having the same pack file open twice in the same directory.

A different thread can miss an object on disk, and trigger a scan
of the directory, and notice the pack that was put in by IndexPack.
So the pack winds up in the newly created PackList.

The IndexPack thread then wakes up and finishes its insertPack by
creating a new PackFile and inserting it into position 0 of the list.
We now have the same pack listed twice.

Readers will favor the earlier PackFile instance, because its the
first one they come across as they iterate through the list.

Keep that earlier one when we scan the pack directory again, as
this will avoid needing to purge out all of the windows that may
have been cached.

Of course we should also fix that race condition, but this block
was taking the wrong resolution if this error ever shows up, so
lets first fix the block to use a more sane resolution.
