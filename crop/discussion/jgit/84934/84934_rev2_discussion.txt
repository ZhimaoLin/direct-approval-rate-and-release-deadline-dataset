DESCRIPTION

Switch JSchSession to simple isolated OutputStream

Work around issues with JSch not handling interrupts by
isolating the JSch interactions onto another thread. Use
a simple lock to negotiate which thread is able to update
the buffer:  either application thread or the copier thread.

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/IsolatedOutputStream.java -> I don't understand this. Wouldn't it cause operations like IsolatedOutputStream#write to hang instead of doing anything because the lock is already held?

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/IsolatedOutputStream.java -> nit: should be package-private instead of private to avoid synthetic accessor.

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/IsolatedOutputStream.java -> Ah, the condvar releases lock. Sorry for the confusion.

Line:172, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/IsolatedOutputStream.java -> What happens to dst and copier in this case? try-with-resources style wouldn't try the close() again, so should we retry the close to prevent them from leaking?
