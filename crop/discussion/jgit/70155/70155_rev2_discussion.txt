Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/GarbageCollectCommandTest.java -> This is a much smaller test which should ideally succeed. But this test shows some bugs/limitations in JGit. 
1) It is not possible prevent a reflog message to be written; I'll propose a fix in CommitCommand
2) When garbage collection is done and the reflogs are inspected then both newid and oldid are taken into account. I am no sure whether this is correct or whether only newid should be taken. I'll inspect CGit for that and upload a change.
