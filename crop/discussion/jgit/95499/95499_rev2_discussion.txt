DESCRIPTION

Delete expired garbage even when there is no GC pack present.

Delete the condition to check whether the garbage pack creation time
is older than the last GC operation, because it's not possible to
find the last GC operation when there is no GC pack.

Added additional tests to make sure the contents of expired garbage
packs are considered during the GC operation and any actively
referenced objects from the garbage packs are claimed succefully
into the GC pack before deling the garbage pack.

I think this is a safe change. Looks like the prior condition of checking the age of the garbage pack predating the prior GC isn't necessary.
