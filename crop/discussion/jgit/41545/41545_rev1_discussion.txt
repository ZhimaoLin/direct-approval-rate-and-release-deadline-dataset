Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Not related to this change, but wouldn't it be better to throw a PackInvalidException here?
...
} catch (IOException e) {
    invalid = true;
    throw new PackInvalidException(String.format("Unable to open index for packfile {}", packFile.getPath()), e);
...
or something...

As it is now the PackInvalidException is only delayed until doOpen() is called or idx() is called again.

Don't know what good it would do though. Haven't followed where this Exception ends up.
To me it feels like it's swallowed somewhere down the line.

Line:391, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> done for the first two, in the other two places there's no pack file name available so I introduced another text

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> I think when catching a generic IOException we can't be sure this is caused by an invalid pack

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> I agree.
But then we shouldn't set the packfile as invalid.
Which will later result in an exception claiming that this packfile is invalid.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> sounds reasonable, this method is called from many places so we need to be careful changing it, I don't know the reason why it was done the way it is now
