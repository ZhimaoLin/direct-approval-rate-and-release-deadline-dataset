DESCRIPTION

Introduce hook support into the FS implementations

This introduces the background plumbing necessary to call for the git
hooks from JGit. This implementation will be OS-dependent as it aims to
be compatible with existing hooks, mostly written in Shell. It is
compatible with unix systems and windows as long as an unix emulator
such as Cygwin is in its PATH.

looks like I was wrong and the API tooling doesn't consistently react on new API methods overridden in subclasses, I'll re-add the since tags there, sorry for the noise, I will add a test
