DESCRIPTION

Introduce hook support into the FS implementations

This introduces the background plumbing necessary to call for the git
hooks from JGit. This implementation will be OS-dependent as it aims to
be compatible with existing hooks, mostly written in Shell. It is
compatible with unix systems and windows as long as an unix emulator
such as Cygwin is in its PATH.

Line:426, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> No, this time it's not only Windows. Also Mac's (with HFS+) have specific behavior here which differs from e.g. standard linux filesystems. Instead just ask our FS class: FS.isCaseSensitive(). (Do the same in the tests, don't rely on windows)

Line:426, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Didn't know about Mac specificities, sorry about that. Though from the tests, I don't know if I can easily "mock" the case insensitivity with this. Changing the system property to "windows" allowed me to check both behaviors from the same machine, but with the FS, I don't think I can easily do that (and I don't really want to add a boolean parameter to relativize only to enable case insensitivity...).

I'll upload a new patch set as soon as I find a way for this in the tests.
