DESCRIPTION

Make PackReverseIndex a public structure

Repository inspection tools may find building a reverse index on a
pack useful, as they can then locate an object by offset. As both
C Git and JGit sometimes produce error messages with the offset
rather than the SHA-1, it may be useful to expose this type.
