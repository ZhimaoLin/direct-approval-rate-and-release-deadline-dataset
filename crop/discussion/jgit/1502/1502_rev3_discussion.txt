DESCRIPTION

Refactor diff sequence API

Instead of making the sequence itself responsible for the equivalence
function, use an external function that is supplied by the caller.
This cleans up the code because we now say cmp.equals(a, ai, b, bi)
instead of a.equals(ai, b, bi).

This refactoring also removes the odd concept of creating different
types of sequences to have different behaviors for whitespace
ignoring.  Instead DiffComparator now supports singleton functions
that apply a particular equivalence algorithm to a type of sequence.
