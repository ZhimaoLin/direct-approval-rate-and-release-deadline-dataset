DESCRIPTION

Allow a @ without branch in revision syntax

No branch before @ is interpreted as the currently checked out branch.
For detached heads it would be HEAD, but normally it is the branch
that HEAD refers to.

Patch Set 1:

Where is the implementation? This change only modifies tests. Or did some predecessor change already brought the implementation?

Patch Set 1:

Seems I did that in the previous commit. Maybe I should just squash these changes together as the refactoring is not meaningful in its own right.

Patch Set 1: Fails

yes, I would suggest squashing this into 6773. Also good because 6773 has no tests yet.
