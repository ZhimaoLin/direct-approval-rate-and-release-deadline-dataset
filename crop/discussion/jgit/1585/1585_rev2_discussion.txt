DESCRIPTION

Move cached element hash codes to HashedSequence

Most diff implementations really want to use cached hash codes for
elements, rather than element equality, as they need to perform many
compares and unique hash codes for elements can really speed that
process up.

To make it easier to define element hash functions, move the caching
of hash codes into a wrapper sequence type, so that individual
sequence types like RawText don't need to do this themselves.  This
has a nice property of also allowing the sequence to no longer care
about the specific SequenceComparator that is going to be used, and
permits the caching to only examine the middle region that isn't
common to the two inputs.
