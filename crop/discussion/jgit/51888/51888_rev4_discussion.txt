DESCRIPTION

Consider only escaping backslash for regular expressions in ignore rules

While checking if we should consider an ignore rule without '[]'
brackets as a regular expression, check if the backslash escapes one of
the glob special characters '?', '*', '[', '\\'. If not, backslash is
not a part of a regex and should be treated literally.
