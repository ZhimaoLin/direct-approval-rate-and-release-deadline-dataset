DESCRIPTION

Fix history rendering not to occupy to many lanes

There was a bug in history rendering which caused jgit to use too
many lanes in case lanes get repositioned. Looking at commit
90c11cbaeb83ee9b02238cbd2c0e5bcf68068772 in JGit was one example. Vadim
Dmitriev found the problem and the solution.
