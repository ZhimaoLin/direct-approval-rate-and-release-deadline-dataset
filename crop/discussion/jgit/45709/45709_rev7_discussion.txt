Patch Set 7:

This change broke Gerrit's PatchListLoader code.

PatchListLoader calls jgit's ResolveMerger.getMergeResults() to retrieve a Map<String, MergeResult<? extends Sequence>> and passes values from that map through to MergeFormatter.formatMerge() (line 384), which now fails to compile.

ResolveMerger only ever inserts MergeResult<RawText> into its results, so it could be updated to state that, but ResolveMerger is public API intended for subclassing, and it is pretty late to make that change for the upcoming Eclipse release cycle.

ResolveMerger could be hacky and cast the values before calling into MergeFormatter, but that feels terrible.

Suggestions for getting this fixed?

Patch Set 7:

This should probably be reverted. Its an API breaking change that is sold as a warning fix.

My preference would be for Gerrit to cast MergeResult<? extends Sequence> to MergeResult<RawText>. It looks like we always wanted RawText and just hadn't declared it before.

It might make sense to also revert this JGit change to make the upgrade easier, though.

Other callers found by web search:

* MergeAlgorithmTest passes in MergeResult. It is a MergeResult<RawText> but isn't declared so.
* ResolveMerger.writeMergedFile and ResolveMerger.insertMergeResult pass in a MergeResult<RawText>.
* org.apache.torque.generator.merge.ThreeWayMerger passes in a MergeResult<RawText>.
* netbeans CheckoutRevisionCommand.checkoutFile passes in a MergeResult<RawText>.

yeah, I should have earmarked it as API breaking
