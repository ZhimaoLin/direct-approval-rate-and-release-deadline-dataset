DESCRIPTION

Add server side support for authenticating clients by certificates

The JGit components used on server side (e.g. ReceivePack related code,
test servers for unit tests) should be enhanced to accept clients
authenticating by client certificates. The server knows about the
certificate of a CA he trusts by the configuration parameter http.CAInfo.
If the client certificate is signed by the CA in http.CAInfo the server
should accept the request and read user-info out of the certificate.

This change is mainly done to allow writing tests for client-certificate
authentication. In productive usage JGit will run inside containers which
do authentication prior to calling JGit.

Line:396, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HttpClientTests.java -> The password is stored in static attribute "sslKeyPassword", so we do not need to hard-code it here.

Line:416, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HttpClientTests.java -> This property is not required anymore.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HttpClientTests.java -> See above. We should use "sslKeyPassword" here.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/KeyStoreHelper.java -> The license header is missing. I know - it's my fault...

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java -> You shouldn't hard-code the port, but instead let it be assigned by the OS and pick up the port after-the-fact like we do with the non-SSL connection.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/KeyStoreHelper.java -> Why aren't these huge base64 thinks resource files in the test suite? Then they can be loaded as files from the source directory, rather than writing them out to temporary files during the test and needing to delete them after.
