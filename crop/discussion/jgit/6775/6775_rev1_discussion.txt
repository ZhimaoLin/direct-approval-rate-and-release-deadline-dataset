DESCRIPTION

Refactor Repository.resolve to be able to return a branch

Add a new resolveExpr method when the caller expects a name.
The old interface resolves to ObjectId. Also report syntax
error if @ is not followed by an {x} expression. This will
be needed by followup changes.

Line:397, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Perhaps another name would be better This method should
be a able to return a ref name, thus it doesn't "resolve" the
expression, merely simplifies it.
