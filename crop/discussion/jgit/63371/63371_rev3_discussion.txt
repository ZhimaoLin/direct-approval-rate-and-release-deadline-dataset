DESCRIPTION

ObjectChecker: honor some git-core fsck.* options

Accept some of the same section keys that fsck does in git-core,
allowing repositories to skip over specific kinds of acceptable
broken objects, e.g.:

  [fsck]
    duplicateEntries = ignore
    zeroPaddedFilemode = ignore

The zeroPaddedFilemode = ignore is a synonym for the JGit specific
allowLeadingZeroFileMode = true. Only accept the JGit key if git-core
key was not specified.
