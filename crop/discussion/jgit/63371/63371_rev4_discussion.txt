DESCRIPTION

ObjectChecker: honor some git-core fsck.* options

Accept some of the same section keys that fsck does in git-core,
allowing repositories to skip over specific kinds of acceptable
broken objects, e.g.:

  [fsck]
    duplicateEntries = ignore
    zeroPaddedFilemode = ignore

The zeroPaddedFilemode = ignore is a synonym for the JGit specific
allowLeadingZeroFileMode = true. Only accept the JGit key if git-core
key was not specified.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> Could be, but no. We've been pretty heavily penalized for synthetic accessors created by the compiler when you use private around things that are private but can't really be private at runtime.

Package visible is good enough. I trust folks in the package to not go mucking around too badly with other parts of the package.
