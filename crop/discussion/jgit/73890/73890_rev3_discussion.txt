Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

This was introduced end of 2011 [1] to ensure we no longer have to look for problems caused by developers using a newer Java class library than defined by JGit's BREE. 

I think we should not relax this to warning. I think if we want to make it easier for newcomers we should fix the EGit Oomph setup and install execution environment definitions automatically.

Gerrit will catch all these. As Egit and JGit committers uses in most cases Gerrit I think this error setting is outdated.

With the "bree-libs" profile in your Hudson build. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build#Using_BREE_Libs and https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.runtime-Gerrit/configure

Do you use this profile only on Hudson ?
Is it enforcing usage of toolchains.xml ?

I think Releng is activating this also for the normal build, but I'm not sure. 

Is it enforcing usage of toolchains.xml ?

Yes.
