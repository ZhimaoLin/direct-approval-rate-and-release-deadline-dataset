Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> It should make it faster for bare repos, but slower for non-bare.

Maybe put a conditional in the code and only revert when the working tree iterator is added?

Patch Set 3:

pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45718/ implementing Shawn's proposal. 

Though testing this with linux kernel repo using the test setup described by Chris on Mac doesn't show a speedup when simulating merge on bare repository by not adding the working tree in ResolveMerger.mergeTrees()

Patch Set 3:

let's merge this revert to get back the performance we lost, it's not yet clear if  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45718/ improves performance for bare repositories with the current ResolveMerger implementation hence we should continue further discussion on that change
