DESCRIPTION

Config: Introduce get(section, subsection, name) that distinguishes absent keys

Config.getString returns null in three cases:

 1. if the requested key is not part of the configuration, as
    documented in the Javadoc

 2. if the value for that key is empty

 3. if someone has explicitly inserted a null in the in-memory
    Config object using setString or setStringList

It returns an empty string in only one case: if someone has inserted an
empty string using setString or setStringList.

Meanwhile the Javadoc says that you can check for an absent key by
checking if the return value is null.

In practice, this means the only reliable way to read a config value
that is allowed to be empty from file is using getStringList (which
returns an empty array for an absent key and 'new String[]{null}' for
present-but-empty).

Introduce a new Config.get that only returns null when a key is absent,
so that callers can read a single value reliably again, and deprecate
Config.getString to prepare for its removal.

After ensuring that they do not use setString to set in-memory
configuration values to null, callers should switch to using Config.set.
A later change will provide a replacement for setString that rejects
null values to help with that.

So now you can read a single value from config, such as

	format.signature
		The default for format-patch is to output a signature
		containing the Git version number. Use this variable to change
		that default.  Set this variable to the empty string ("") to
		suppress signature generation.

without worrying about confusing an absent value for an empty one.
