DESCRIPTION

Introduce Config.get that distinguishes absent keys

Config.getString returns null in three cases:

 1. if the requested key is not part of the configuration, as
    documented in the Javadoc

 2. if the value for that key is empty

 3. if someone has explicitly inserted a null in the in-memory
    Config object using setString or setStringList

It returns an empty string in only one case: if someone has inserted an
empty string using setString or setStringList.

Meanwhile the Javadoc says that you can check for an absent key by
checking if the return value is null.

In practice, this means the only reliable way to read a config value
that is allowed to be empty from file is using getStringList (which
returns an empty array for an absent key and 'new String[]{null}' for
present-but-empty).

Introduce a new Config.get(section, subsection, name) that only returns
null when the key is absent, so that callers can read a single value
reliably again.

Deprecate Config.getString to prepare for its removal.  After ensuring
that they do not use setString to set in-memory configuration values to
null, callers should switch to using Config.get.  A later change will
provide a replacement for setString that rejects null values to help
with that.

So now you can read a single value from config, such as

	format.signature
		The default for format-patch is to output a signature
		containing the Git version number. Use this variable to
		change that default.  Set this variable to the empty
		string ("") to suppress signature generation.

without risking confusing an absent value for an empty one.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2

Line:714, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> oy. This is going to be confusing semantics.

get() returns "" but getStringList returns a {null} for this "y=\n" config line. Get the WTF-o-meter out. I can't say this is sane.

I wonder if we want to consider replacing getStringList too to never return null inside the array elements.

Line:714, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> Yes, I want to introduce getStrings (or getStringArray) that does that and deprecate getStringList, too.

I'll put off submitting this until that's written and working.

Line:714, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> +1, newly added methods only need be consistent with other newly added methods. The fact that old methods are WTFy is the exact problem we're trying to fix here :)
