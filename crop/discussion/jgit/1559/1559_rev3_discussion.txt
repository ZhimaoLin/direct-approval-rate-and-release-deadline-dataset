DESCRIPTION

Fix PlotCommitList to set lanes on child-less commits

In PlotCommitList.enter() commits are positioned on lanes for visual
presentation. This implementation was buggy: commits without
children (often the starting points for the RevWalk) are not positioned
on separate lanes.

I added code that every commit which has no child is put on a
dedicated exclusive lane. It can't share a lane with any child (since
there is none) and therefore must be rendered on a separate lane.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Finally I added test for PlotCommitList to test positioning on lanes. I added some tests which succeed. But there are still
some bugs in bug:300282 which have to checked.
