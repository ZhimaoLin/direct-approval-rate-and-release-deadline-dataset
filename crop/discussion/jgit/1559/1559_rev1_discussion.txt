DESCRIPTION

Fix PlotCommitList to set lanes on childless commits

In PlotCommitList.enter() all the work is done to position
commits on lanes for visual presentation. But this
implementation was buggy: commits which don't have children
(often the starting points for the RevWalk) are not
positioned on their exclusive lanes. I added code that
every commit which has no child should be on this own exclusive
lane. He can't share a lane with his child (because he
has no) and therefore must bu on his own lane.
