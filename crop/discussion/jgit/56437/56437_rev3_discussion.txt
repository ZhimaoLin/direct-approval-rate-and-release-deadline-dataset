DESCRIPTION

Properly support special regex characters in ignore rules

Ignore rules should escape $^(){}+ chars if using regular expressions,
because they should be treated literally if they aren't part of a
character group.

Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/Strings.java -> We may also want to escape |.
Even if using pipes in file names is probably a bad idea it is still possible

Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/Strings.java -> Patterns using other special regex usingÂ \ are not escaped correctly and do not match the correct thing.
For instance adding assertMatch("a*\\dbidule", "a\\dbidule", true) in IgnoreRuleSpecialCasesTest will fail;

But that may be covered by bug 478065
