Patch Set 15: Code-Review+1

A good starting point for symlink tests regarding checkout. +1 from me.

An idea for more tests: All the tests here work mainly with two different states. What's in the current commit and what's in the commit I want to checkout. During checkout there are two more states which could differ from these two states. The index and the working tree. So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.
