DESCRIPTION

DirCache: Fix bad code formatting

Line breaking before , is ugly to read.  Most formatters and humans
expect line break after , so update a few offensive locations.

Use String.format() for the construction of the error message when
a bad DirCachEntry is being failed on. This simplifies the code and
its not a performance critical section.
