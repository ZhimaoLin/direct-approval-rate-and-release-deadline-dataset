DESCRIPTION

Remove dependency by ArchiveCommand on archive formats

Provide static registerFormat and unregisterFormat methods to allow
formats to register themselves without the ArchiveCommand code being
aware of them.

Register the basic "zip" and "tar" support at bundle activation time
(and deregister them when unloading the bundle).  For anyone using
this code as an OSGi plugin it should continue to just work.

The jgit program does not load org.eclipse.jgit.pgm as an OSGi bundle,
so let the Archive command register the formats it uses explicitly
with registerFormat.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Archive.java -> Eh, I would have put these in a static {} block and just left them registered for the life of the program. The memory usage is trivial.

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> unfortunately we still string translate these. :-(

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> Ah, they can appear in a dialog box. Maybe it should be an InvalidArgumentException or similar.
