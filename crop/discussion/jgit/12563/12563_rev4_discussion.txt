DESCRIPTION

Remove dependency by ArchiveCommand on archive formats

Provide static registerFormat and unregisterFormat methods to allow
formats to register themselves without the ArchiveCommand code being
aware of them.

Register the basic "zip" and "tar" support at bundle activation time
(and deregister them when unloading the bundle).  For anyone using
this code as an OSGi plugin it should continue to just work.

The jgit program does not load org.eclipse.jgit.pgm as an OSGi bundle,
so let the Archive command register the formats it uses explicitly
with registerFormat.
