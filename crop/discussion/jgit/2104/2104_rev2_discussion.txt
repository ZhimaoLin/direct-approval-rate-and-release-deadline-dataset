I didn't reviewed the whole change but I detected one place where I didn't like it.

Line:386, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I am not completely sure about that. I intentionally didn't checked the return code from mkdirs. If mkdirs fails and a directory is not created then the subsequent createNewFile will fail. Therefore I'll detect an error situation and don't want to spend extra stats() to check for file-existance and file-type which is done in FileUtils.

Line:386, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> ok, understood that you want to avoid the extra stats, hence now checking return value in a different way here

mkdirs() fails if the directory is already existing so this will not fail the subsequent createNewFile() call.
