Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PathCheckoutCommandTest.java -> I like this test -- but how does it relate to the commit message? From the commit message I was expecting something different than a test which succeeds and where no checkout is failing.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PathCheckoutCommandTest.java -> Have you rebased it? IIRC it failed at the time it was submitted, nearly year ago.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PathCheckoutCommandTest.java -> Ah, now I understand. The current commit message just tells about a problem you see, right? Not about something you fixed or added. We'll fix the commit message when we have a fix for the failing test.

Patch Set 1:

autocrlf and mixed line endings are not compatible. This seem JGit does what one could expect. You may want the safecrlf option and patches supprting it. Also in Gerrit.

Robin, the test passes now, you mean it should in fact fail? By "does what one could expect" you're referring to the commit message indicating a failure or the passing test (fixed in the meantime)? They are opposite, that's why I'm asking.
