DESCRIPTION

Let Jsch know about ~/.ssh/config

Ensure the Jsch instance used knows about ~/.ssh/config. This
enables Jsch to honor more user configurations (see
com.jcraft.jsch.Session.applyConfig()), in particular also the
UserKnownHostsFile configuration, or additional identities given
via multiple IdentityFile entries.

Turn JGit's OpenSshConfig into a full parser that can be a
Jsch-compliant ConfigRepository. This avoids a few bugs
in Jsch's OpenSSHConfig and keeps the JGit-facing interface
unchanged. At the same time we can supply a JGit OpenSshConfig
instance as a ConfigRepository to Jsch. And since they'll both
work from the same object, we can also be sure that the parsing
behavior is identical.

The parser does not handle the "Match" and "Include" keys, and it
doesn't do %-token substitutions (yet).

Note that Jsch doesn't handle multi-valued UserKnownHostFile
entries as known by modern OpenSSH.[1]

Additional tests for new features are provided in OpenSshConfigTest.
