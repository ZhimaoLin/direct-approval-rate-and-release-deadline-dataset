DESCRIPTION

Define NoteMap, a simple note tree reader

The NoteMap makes it easy to read a small notes tree as created by
the `git notes` command in C Git.  To make the initial implementation
simple a notes tree is read recursively into a map in memory.
This is reasonable if the application will need to access all notes,
or if there are less than 256 notes in the tree, but doesn't behave
well when the number of notes exceeds 256 and the application
doesn't need to access all of them.

We can later add support for lazily loading different subpaths,
thus fixing the large note tree problem described above.

Currently the implementation only supports reading.  Writing notes
is more complex because trees need to be expanded or collapsed at
the exact 256 entry cut-off in order to retain the same tree SHA-1
that C Git would use for the same content.  It also needs to retain
non-note tree entries such as ".gitignore" or ".gitattribute" files
that might randomly appear within a notes tree.  We can also add
writing support later.
