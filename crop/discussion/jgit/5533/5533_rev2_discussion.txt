DESCRIPTION

RevWalk should use core.streamFileThreshold when parsing commit.

RevWalk should not put its own limit on ObjectLoader.getCachedBytes():
the ObjectLoader implementation is such that getCachedBytes() will work
for anything that is < streamFileThreshold as configured for the
ObjectReader implementation. In either case this defaults to
CoreConfig.defaultStreamFileThreshold.
