Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> This should be unnecessary. The ObjectLoader implementation is such that getCachedBytes() will work for anything that is < streamFileThreshold as configured for the ObjectReader implementation.

In the storage.file case, this is derived from the WindowCacheConfig, which defaults to the new static default you added.

In the storage.dfs, this is derived from the ReaderOptions, which defaults to the new static default you added.

Line:865, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I think you can just drop this parameter, and the MiB constant and that is the entire commit.
