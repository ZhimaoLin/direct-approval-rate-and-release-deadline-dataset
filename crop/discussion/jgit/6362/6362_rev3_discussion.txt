DESCRIPTION

Commands for publish-subscribe config editing

A daemon process will consume the config file and subscribe to all
repositories and remote sections listed under each publisher section.
Each subscriber line is built using the remote name and the local
repository metadata directory. The "fetch" spec in each remote config
section will be used to subscribe to remote updates.

Example:

[publisher "https://android.googlesource.com/"]
	subscriber = origin /home/.../android/.git
	subscriber = origin /home/.../android-copy/.git
