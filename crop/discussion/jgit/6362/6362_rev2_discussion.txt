DESCRIPTION

Commands for publish-subscribe config editing

A daemon process will consume the config file and subscribe to all
repositories and remote sections listed under each publisher section.
Each subscriber line is built using the remote name and the local
repository metadata directory. The "fetch" spec in each remote config
section will be used to subscribe to remote updates.

Example:

[publisher "https://android.googlesource.com/"]
	subscriber = origin /home/.../android/.git
	subscriber = origin /home/.../android-copy/.git

Patch Set 2:

Matthias, is this contributor assertion text from Ian really necessary when an existing project committer (me) is sponsoring Ian's work? Ian works for me here at Google, he can contribute this code, and I planned on marking his IP Clean +1 bit when it was ready to submit.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/PubSubTest.java -> you need to import package org.eclipse.jgit.transport in the MANIFEST.MF of this bundle, otherwise you'll get class loading errors in Eclipse

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/PubSubTest.java -> compiler warning: Potential null pointer access: The variable pub may be null at this location

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/PubSubTest.java -> this section is copied in several tests, maybe it would make sense to factor it out into a helper method

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Unsubscribe.java -> throw die(msg, e) instead

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Unsubscribe.java -> throw die(msg) instead

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Unsubscribe.java -> throw die(msg, e) instead

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Subscribe.java -> throw die(msg) instead, this will care for error exit codes and use error stream for error output

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Subscribe.java -> throw die(msg, e) instead

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/SubscribeDaemon.java -> so this is going to be part of the API ? Or do you only need that for testing, then package visibility would be sufficient.

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/SubscribeDaemon.java -> would it make sense to also allow for a system wide configuration ?

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/PubSubTest.java -> Done

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/PubSubTest.java -> Fixed with SuppressWarnings, the assert above takes care of the actual check.

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/SubscribeDaemon.java -> All callers will go through getConfigFile() so it can be made package-visible. This is just the constant config name, the same as ".gitconfig".

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/SubscribeDaemon.java -> The options in this file will cause writes into the listed repositories, so I don't think it would make much sense unless you have multiple users working out of a single directory instead of each with their own git copy. This doesn't hold any common config options that could be shared across all users, such as the flags for symlinks or coloring.
