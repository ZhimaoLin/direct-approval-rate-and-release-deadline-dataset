DESCRIPTION

Commands for publish-subscribe config editing

A daemon process will consume the config file and subscribe to all
repositories and remote sections listed under each publisher section.
Each subscriber line is built using the remote name and the local
repository metadata directory. The "fetch" spec in each remote config
section will be used to subscribe to remote updates.

Example:

[publisher "https://android.googlesource.com/"]
	subscriber = origin /home/.../android/.git
	subscriber = origin /home/.../android-copy/.git

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Subscribe.java -> you also need to check that there is exactly one subscriber line in the config that has the same uri path on the host, since you do not support writing to the same repository in multiple local directories.

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubConfig.java -> nit: make this final

Line:121, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubConfig.java -> private?

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubConfig.java -> this entire class should be immutable.  Make all the fields final. You'll need to refactor load() to return RemoteConfig and then set the fields.

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubConfig.java -> do you really want to do this here? While it may be convenient to be here, it doesn't really have anything to do with the Subscriber class, since a Subscriber should not care about the format of a configLine. Perhaps a utility method would be better to split the remote and directory?

Line:255, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubConfig.java -> should this be public? It seems like an implementation detail of the config file format.

Line:256, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PubSubConfig.java -> this is listed 3 times in the file. perhaps make a private static method to generate the subscriber key?
