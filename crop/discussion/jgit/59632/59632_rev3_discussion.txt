DESCRIPTION

Convert remaining callers of BitmapBuilder.add to use .addObject

When setupTipCommitBitmaps is called, writeBitmaps does not have any
bitmaps saved, so these calls to .add always add a single commit and
do not OR in a bitmap.

The objects returned by nextObject after a commit walk is finished
are trees and blobs.  Non-commit objects do not have bitmaps
associated so the call to .add also can only add a single object.
