DESCRIPTION

Fix resolving expression with ~ and ^ than extends beyond history

resolve("foo~X") where X is greater than the distance from foo to the
root should return null, but 2a2362fb introduced a bug causing it to
either return resolve("foo") or NPE. Add a test for the correct
behavior.

Also add an analogous test for foo^X where X is greater than the
number of parents (which was not broken by that commit).

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Dave. I pushed a change for stable-2.1 with my name on it in order to make it into this release. I guess this is a gray zone, since technically you wrote more code than I did. I cannot abandon this change though.

Patch Set 3:

You're welcome to take over the change, I'm not offended or anything :)

But I don't know if there are IP issues, I'll let the maintainers comment on that. If they'd rather leave this commit separate we can just rebase it on your change.
