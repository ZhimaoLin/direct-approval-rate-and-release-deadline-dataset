DESCRIPTION

Add tests for invalid values in resolve() with ~ and ^

resolve("foo~X") where X is greater than the distance from foo to the
root should return null, but 2a2362fb introduced a bug causing it to
either return resolve("foo") or NPE. Add a test for the correct
behavior.

Also add an analogous test for foo^X where X is greater than the
number of parents (which was not broken by that commit).
