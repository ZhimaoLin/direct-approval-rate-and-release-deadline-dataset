Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(12 comments)

only minor comments. The core algorithm looks good to me.

One idea: when reviewing the code one complicated aspect seems to be to calculate the right depth. I know that the test do assertions on the describe output which contains also the depth. Still I am not sure whether the depth is correct when we have more complicated topologies. Multiple roots, a lot of dead branches. Have you tried this on a real world repo where you remove so many tags that high numbers for depth should occur.

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> This  gives a warning in eclipse with our settings because there is no javadoc for a protected declaration.

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> we'll nee a javadoc tag for the return value,the parameter and the thrown exception

Line:102, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> we'll nee a javadoc tag for the return value and the thrown exception

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> The text has to be externalized. Please look at CheckoutCommand.java and how we throw RefNotFoundException there. You would have to enter your text in JGitText.java and JGitText.properties.

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> The text has to be externalized. Please look at CheckoutCommand.java and how we throw RefNotFoundException there. You would have to enter your text in JGitText.java and JGitText.properties.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> why do you need to store this attribute "commit"? You don't make use of it.

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> Do we really have to call carry on the walk AND on the commit? I am not sure.

Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> please add add a comment "// $NON-NLS-1" to mark the String literal as non-translateable.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommandTest.java -> ObjectId c4 = git.merge().include(c2).call().getNewHead();
and skip the call to head();

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommandTest.java -> see comment above

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommandTest.java -> you could return git.commit()......call().getID() instead of calling head().

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommandTest.java -> I don't think you need this method.

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> We don't xxx@xxx.xxx tags (that's what the Git history is for), please remove.

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DescribeCommand.java -> Please xxx@xxx.xxx 3.1 to Javadoc.
