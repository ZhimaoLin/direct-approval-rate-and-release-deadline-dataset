Patch Set 8:

Rebased, release revwalk, use Collections.min instead of sort, fixed xxx@xxx.xxx tags, some formatting and warnings.

Kohsuke, could you add a test which shows that the right candidate is chosen when there are multiple at the end? I commented out the sort part (before changing it to min), and all tests still passed.

After that, IMO this is good to go.
