DESCRIPTION

RFC Git API does not declare GitAPIException call()

All Commands should throw a GitAPIException so new exceptions can be
added without breaking the builds of old code, i.e. anyone that calls
a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just the currently known
exceptions.

Unfortunately this change breaks the API.

Bug: 366914

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> following OSGi API rules [1] and Eclipse versioning rules [2] this would require that we bump the major version as this breaks compatibility for consumers of the API

[1] http://www.osgi.org/wiki/uploads/Links/SemanticVersioning.pdf

[2] http://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_major_segment

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> remove this blank line so that all footers are in the last paragraph

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> don't declare the same exception twice

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, I know this breaks the API. On the other hand we have been breaking the API all the time. This is one of the very few
commits thats *says* it breaks the API.

I think this is a serious API bug, but maybe we should really clean up and call it 2.0. This is just one of many serious issues with the API.
