DESCRIPTION

Git API does not declare GitAPIException call()

All Commands should throw a GitAPIException so new exceptions can be
added without breaking the builds of old code, i.e. anyone that calls
a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just the currently known
exceptions.

Unfortunately this change breaks the API.

Bug: 366914
