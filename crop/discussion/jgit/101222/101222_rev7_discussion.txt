DESCRIPTION

reftable: merge-join reftables

MergedReftable combines multiple reference tables together in a stack,
allowing higher/later tables to shadow earlier/lower tables.  This
forms the basis of a transaction system, where each transaction writes
a new reftable containing only the modified references, and readers
perform a merge on the fly to get the latest value.
