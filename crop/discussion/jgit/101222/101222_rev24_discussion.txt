DESCRIPTION

reftable: merge-join reftables

MergedReftable combines multiple reference tables together in a stack,
allowing higher/later tables to shadow earlier/lower tables.  This
forms the basis of a transaction system, where each transaction writes
a new reftable containing only the modified references, and readers
perform a merge on the fly to get the latest value.

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> I think this method is easier to understand if guarantees the following properties:
A) Adding an entry whose cursor is at EOF closes its cursor and does not add the entry to the priority queue 
B) Otherwise 'head' is always set and always points at the next RefQueueEntry to return, which means either pushing the previous head on the queue if the new 't' entry is earlier or pushing 't' on the queue if it is later than 'head'.

if (!t.rc.next()) {
  t.rc.close();
  return;
}
if (head == null) {
  if (queue.isEmpty() || RefQueueEntry.compare(t, queue.peek()) < 0) {
    head = t;
  } else {
    head = queue.poll();
    queue.add(t);
  }
  return;
}
if (RefQueueEntry.compare(t, head) > 0) {
  queue.add(t);
} else {
  queue.add(head);
  head = t;
}

The O(log N) insertion comment is useful and can get moved to the top of the method.
