DESCRIPTION

Better report on client side if push failed due to too large object

JGits PushCommand and BasePackPushConnection were throwing a generic
exception when the pushed pack-file was rejected by the server since it
contained too large objects. Teach JGit to better analyze the server's
response to detect this situation and throw a more specific exception.

Detect this situation by parsing the status line sent by the server.
This change only recognizes the response sent by a JGit based server.
All other servers which report such problems in a different way still
lead to a generic TransportExceptions.
