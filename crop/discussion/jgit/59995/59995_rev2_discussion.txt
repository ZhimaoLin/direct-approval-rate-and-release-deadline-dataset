DESCRIPTION

Update dependencies to use the xxx@xxx.xxx

Update the project-specific Eclipse settings to replace the use of the
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable class the new JGit-specific
@Nullable annotation. I verified that Eclipse reports errors when the
return value of a method annotated with
@org.eclipse.jgit.annotations.Nullable is dereferenced without a null
check.

Also remove the Maven and MANIFEST.MF dependencies on
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.

Eclipse null analysis uses three xxx@xxx.xxx @NonNull and
@NonNullByDefault. All three are updated in this patch because it is
invalid to set the Eclipse preferences to empty values. So far only
@Nullable has been introduced in org.eclipse.jgit.annotations.

My personal preference is to follow the advice in Effective Java and
avoid the null-return idiom, and to avoid passing null values in
general. This sets the expectation is that arguments and return types
are assumed non-null unless otherwise documented. If that is the
expectation, then consistent application xxx@xxx.xxx is redundant and
hurts readability by cluttering the code, obscuring the occasional
@Nullable annotation that really requires attention.

If the JGit community decides there is value in using xxx@xxx.xxx and
@NonNullByDefault annotations we can add them--this change configures
Eclipse to use them.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Should mention the motivation:

This allows building without a copy of org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable present (e.g., when using alternate build systems).
