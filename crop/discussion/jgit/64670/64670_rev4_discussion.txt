DESCRIPTION

ChangeIdUtil: Don't throw IOException

This could have only happened during the getBytes call. Instead, use
Constants.encode, which is a non-throwing implementation.

This change is binary compatible with existing code compiled against
older versions of JGit, although it might break compilation of
previously compiling code due to dead catch blocks.
