DESCRIPTION

ChangeIdUtil: Don't throw IOException

This could have only happened during the getBytes call. Instead, use
Constants.encode, which is a non-throwing implementation.

Not to be submitted until the next major version bump, as this method
change could break compilation of existing code.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Except for the commit message, looks good to me.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> From https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.4.21:

 Changes to the throws clause of methods or constructors do
 not break compatibility with pre-existing binaries; these
 clauses are checked only at compile time.

What would this break?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> You're talking about dead code detection in a try-catch block?

https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs#API_Prime_Directive says it's okay not to care. But I also don't mind waiting.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I was more thinking of "API changes must not invalidate formerly legal Client code" just below that.

But really I just want this change, so I'm going to rewrite the commit description and submit.
