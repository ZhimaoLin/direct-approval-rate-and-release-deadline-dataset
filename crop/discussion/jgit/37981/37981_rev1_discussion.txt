File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> You could also test the error situations like in the InitCommandTest

Line:361, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> This is not implemented. The exception is only thrown by the call method. Either also implement the check here or document the Exception in the call method.

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Thought that this would be overkill. CloneCommand is using InitCommand and I am relying on the exceptions thrown by InitCommand. And that these are thrown I already tested.

Line:361, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Done
