DESCRIPTION

Fix bug regarding handling of unversioned files during merge

There was a bug introduced by commit 0e815fe. For unversioned files
the merge algorithm detected a incoming deletion from THEIRS.
Consequently that file was deleted. That's a severe bug fixed by
better detecting incoming deletions.
