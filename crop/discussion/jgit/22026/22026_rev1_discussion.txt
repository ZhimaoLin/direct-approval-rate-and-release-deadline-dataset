DESCRIPTION

Fix diff header on renamed or copied files

When git-core renames or copies a file and the mode differs the
header shows the mode change first, then the rename or copy data:

  diff --git a/COPYING b/LICENSE
  old mode 100644
  new mode 100755
  similarity index 92%
  rename from COPYING
  rename to LICENSE
  index d645695..54863be
  --- a/COPYING
  +++ b/LICENSE
  @@ -56,20 xxx@xxx.xxx

JGit relies on this ordering inside of FileHeader. Parsing "new file
mode NNN" after "copy from/to" or "rename from/to" resets the change
type to be ADD, losing the COPIED or RENAMED status and old path.

This fixes a 4 year old bug in Gerrit Code Review that prevents
opening a file for review if the file was copied from another file,
modified in this change, and the mode was updated (e.g. execute
bit was added).

Our Gerrit user reported this fixed the bug that prevented him from reviewing a file that was copied, modified, and made executable all in the same commit.
