This method was extracted from org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.clone.CloneDestinationPage (Change If3c61a2a) because org.eclipse.egit.core.GitProjectSetCapability needs this feature too (Change I800dd9f2). It also may be used by org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Clone.run() method (if (localName == null)...).

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> We don't have any official recommendations here, buit so far we have not
listed copyright holders like this:

The header would be pretty crowded and unreadable. Just add your name to
the list like the rest. 

We use blame and history for figuring out what you did.

Line:393, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Style-nit: Use xxx@xxx.xxx null} instead and then the . ending the sentence won't line wrap onto the next line by itself.

Line:403, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> What happens when you pass D:\x\x.git here?

You bypass the URIish parsing completely and miss all logic encoded in this class. By using the constructor logic you could make sure this method
is consistent with the rest or the class.

Doing so would mean you could do with fewer tests since all the illegall formats have already been taken care of.

Line:409, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Style-nit: Be consistent with yourself, elsewhere in the same method you use "".equals(result) instead.

Line:410, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Isn't this case only relevant if lastSegment equals ".git" ?

Could we write this instead as:

  String result = elements[elements.length - 1];
  if (DOT_GIT.equals(result))
    result = elements[elements.length - 2];
  else if (result.endsWith(DOT_GIT))
    result = result.substring(0, result.length() - DOT_GIT.length());
  return result;

as it shouldn't be possible for result to be an empty string at this point?

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Could we have a more humanish name for this? like getDisplayNameI(). 

The reason I used the -ish in this class is becuase it is like an URI, but not quite. The -ish means "like" in Git context. 

The name returned from this method is not like a "human". It is not a human at all.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> :-) No, it's from the 'man git-clone', the directory option: The "humanish" part of the source repository is used if no directory is explicitly given (repo for /path/to/repo.git and foo for host.xz:foo/.git).
