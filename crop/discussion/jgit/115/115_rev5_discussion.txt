IMHO, what's blocking this change is lack of javadoc for getHumanish, and I think an instance method would be useful, in addition to the static method.

Given further considerations. Who, besides the clone dialog needs this method, which is clearly UI oriented?  How to display something is a UI issue and we don't even have a clear pattern as to what UI's in want  methods like this and how they want to display information from the URI.

Most display purposes will probably want the full URI anyway.

Drop this.

jgit clone (in our *.pgm package) wants this to decide on the default name for the local working directory if the argument wasn't supplied.  Its supposed to guess off the URL.

I could see any other GUI based on top of JGit wanting the same feature, that is, given a URIish obtain the default name for the local working directory off that URI just as git clone would do.  The UI probably should then use that to pre-populate a text field that the user can modify.

It makes sense to make this algorithm common, and part of URIish.  But anytime one would want to do this, you probably have a URIish on hand, which is why I lobbied for the instance method rather than the static variant.  I'm still not sure about the static variant.

And I changed my mind. Introducing this method as a static was a bad idea and I inclined to drop it in favor of an instance method.

I still don't like that name, but given the reference I can accept that.
