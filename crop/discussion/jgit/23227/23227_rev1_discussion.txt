DESCRIPTION

Allow an ObjectChecker to reject special characters for Windows

Repositories that are frequently checked out on Windows platforms
may need to ensure trees do not contain strange names that cause
problems on those systems. Follow the MSDN guidelines and refuse
to accept a tree containing a special character, or names that end
with " " (space) or "." (dot).

One nit but otherwise looks good.

Line:446, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectChecker.java -> Not needed, since windows implies ignoreCase (unless someone has explicitly chosen to setIgnoreCase(false) after setSafeForWindows(true)).

Line:446, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectChecker.java -> That was exactly what I was defensively coding against.

Line:446, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectChecker.java -> Ah.

Isn't the simplest behavior to do what the caller asked and not ignore case?

Alternatively, setIgnoreCase could check the windows flag:

  if (windows && !ignore)
    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);

Or a helper function could make it easier to remember to consistently ignore case on windows as other checks are introduced, too:

  private byte toLowerIfIgnoringCase(byte b) {
    // Always ignore case in repositories meant to be used on Windows.
    if (!ignoreCase && !windows)
      return b;

    if ('A' <= b && b <= 'Z')
      return (byte) (b + ('a' - 'A'));
    return b;
  }

Since ignoreCase is only used in one place, what you currently have seems fine, too. Comments in isDotGit and where ignoreCase is declared could save confused people like me some head-scratching.
