DESCRIPTION

Git API does not declare GitAPIException call() and related cleanups

All commands should throw a GitAPIException so new exceptions can be
added without breaking the builds of old code, i.e. anyone that calls
a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just the currently known
exceptions.

Now the only checked exceptions on Git API calls are GitException and
subclasses of it. New checked exceptions that are subclasses of
GitException may be added without breaking the API.

Unfortunately this change itself breaks the API.
