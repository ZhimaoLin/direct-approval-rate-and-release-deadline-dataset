DESCRIPTION

Do not categorize merge failures as 'abnormal'

This change contains a simple renaming. Instead of using the
expression 'abnormal failure', we just treat this kind of situation
as 'failure'. This is specific enough as conflicts are already handled
separately.

I like that. 'Failed' is much better than 'Abnormal'.
