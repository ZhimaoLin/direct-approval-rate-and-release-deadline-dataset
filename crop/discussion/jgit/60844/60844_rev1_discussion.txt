DESCRIPTION

RepositoryTestCase: Make branch existence check in commitFile more precise

The check 'repo.getRef(branch) != null' can return true even if the
branch in question does not exist yet if a ref named
refs/tags/<branchname> or refs/remotes/<branchname> exists, for
example.

Check directly for refs/heads/<branchname> to make this test helper
more predictable.
