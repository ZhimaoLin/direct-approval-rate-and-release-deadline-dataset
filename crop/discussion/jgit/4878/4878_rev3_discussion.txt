Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> What server is emitting a Content-Type of "application/x-git-upload-pack-advertisement; charset=..."?

The server is wrong.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> https://appharbor.com/ returns such header. Native git is able to clone from appharbor. As I understand, it decides what protocol to use inside process_connect_service of transport-helper.c, and it doesn't check headers of response. That why I thought I can fix it like that.

Line:524, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> I don't like the idea of checking the content type with startsWith, its still a fuzzy check.... and that server is still wrong. This MIME type doesn't take a charset because the character encoding of branch names is uhm, unspecified by Git.

C Git does the is smart check by slurping the entire response body into a buffer and then reading the start of the buffer. If we changed this code to do the same thing, I would be more comfortable with the idea of dropping the content type check altogether and ignoring it like C Git does. But that is pretty stupid to not check the content type.

A better way to check this MIME type is something like:

  String actType = c.getContentType();
  if (actType == null)
    return false;
  int s = actType.indexOf(';');
  if (s > 0)
    actType = actType.substring(0, s);
  return expType.equals(actType);
