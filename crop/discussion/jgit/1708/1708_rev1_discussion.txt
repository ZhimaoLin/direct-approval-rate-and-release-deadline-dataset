DESCRIPTION

Call ProgressMonitor.update() from main thread.

This fix IOException("Write end dead") during local repository fetch.
The exception was thrown because we write to ProgressMonitor's
PipedOutputStream from several threads. When we read from a connected
PipedInputStream a writing thread could already be dead.
