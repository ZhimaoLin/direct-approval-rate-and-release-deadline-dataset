DESCRIPTION

Change FS not to throw NPE when facing InMemory databases

The FS class and the subclasses FS_POSIX assumed in the findHook()
method that every repository has a valid gitDir. But in tests when using
in-memory-repositories this is not true and this method was generating
NPEs. Change the method to return null if no repository directory can be
determined.
