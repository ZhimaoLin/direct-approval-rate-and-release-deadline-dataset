DESCRIPTION

server side: smart push over HTTP

Clients can request smart push support by examining the info/refs URL
with the service parameter set to the magic git-receive-pack string:

  GET /$GIT_DIR/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack HTTP/1.1

The response is formatted with the receive pack capabilities, using
the standard packet line formatter.  A special header block is put
in front of the standard receive-pack advertisement to let clients
know the service was recognized and is supported.

If the requested service is disabled an authorization status code is
returned, allowing the user agent to retry once they have obtained
credentials from a human, in case authentication is required by
the configured ReceivePackFactory implementation.
