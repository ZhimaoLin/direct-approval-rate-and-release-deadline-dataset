DESCRIPTION

Smart push over HTTP: server side

Clients can request smart push support by examining the info/refs URL
with the service parameter set to the magic git-receive-pack string:

  GET /$GIT_DIR/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack HTTP/1.1

The response is formatted with the receive pack capabilities,
using the standard packet line formatter.  A special header line
is put in front of the standard receive-pack advertisement to let
clients know the service was recognized and is supported.

If the requested service is disabled an authorization status code is
returned, allowing the user agent to retry once they have obtained
credentials from a human, in case authentication is required by
the configured ReceivePackFactory implementation.

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/ReceivePackFactory.java -> Good practice to put 'public' on interface methods, even though it's not necessary? Argument for: if you put 'public' you can just copy/paste the line into an implementing class, which would otherwise be an error. Argument against: it's the default for interfaces (but not for classes that you might paste it into). A suitable decision probably should be recorded on the EGit contributor code guidelines.

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/ReceivePackServlet.java -> The general contract of close doesn't enforce this, and there have been cases where the close doesn't in fact do this (and just drops the connection). I don't think it's wrong to do it as well inside the try, but in the general bug-free case, you're right.

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/ReceivePackServlet.java -> Not necessary, our final block calls close, which has to flush any buffered data before the close completes.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/InfoRefsServlet.java -> See other comment - 'Constants' feels like the wrong named class for a utility method to perform encoding, even if it does define the UTF-8 string.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/RepositoryRouter.java -> Personally, I'd put this dummy implementation inside the ReceivePackFactory as a static named inner class, like:
public class ReceivePackFactory {
  public static final Empty = new Empty();
  public static class Empty extends ReceivePackFactory {
    ... // methods throwing exception
  }
}

You can then use receivePackFactory = ReceivePackFactory.EMTPY (or substitute favourite name of choice). Possibly doesn't add much to reuse, but if you ever add a new method that you need to override in the ReceivePackFactory, you can add a dummy (exception-throwing) impl to the Empty class in the same file without having to change 2 source files (the client will still work in exactly the same way).

I appreciate this is a minor, almost stylistic comment, and I'd be OK with you ignoring it; but should we need to change the dummy methods in the future, it'd be my preference to only have to do that in one source file instead of two (as well as permitting other callers to re-use the Empty one should they have the same requirements).

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/DefaultReceivePackFactory.java -> Is there the danger that the 'user' will in fact be an e-mail address in the future, like alex.blewitt@gmail.com is my bugzilla login ID? If so, and you're using a @ to separate out the two, won't this end up in xxx@xxx.xxx Maybe pass in the (default) host and user separately,and then let PersonIdent append the default host if needed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/DefaultReceivePackFactory.java -> I only mentioned it in case we had something post-processing later on which does something like xxx@xxx.xxx to split the string up. It's not a big deal, if you think we won't see that kind of bug.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/DefaultReceivePackFactory.java -> There isn't really anything wrong with the "email" field in the reflog holding xxx@xxx.xxx  And we are passing in the *remote* host here, which should be the hostname or IP address of the client (or proxy) which has connected.  That may be useful in the reflog to help track down where the connection originated from, which is why we are storing it at all.
