Line:639, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Not sure if this is sufficient. I agree that an empty dir in the working tree should not prevent a merge. But have you thought about the case where

- base&ours contain nothing for path p/x
- worktree contains folder p/x
- theirs contains a file p/x

After/during a succesful merge we want to update the working tree with the file p/x from theirs. This will fail if in the same location a folder p/x exists, or? Maybe we need a test for this.

Line:639, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I think you are right, but then what do we do?

If the directory is empty or only contains empty folders (recursively), I think we should be able to just delete the directories.

Line:639, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> deleting empty directories in that case sounds reasonable to me
