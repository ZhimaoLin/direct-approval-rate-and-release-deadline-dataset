DESCRIPTION

Fix Severe Bug in Merge Algorithm

As described in Bug 328551 there was a bug that the merge algorithm
was not always reporting conflicts when the same line was deleted
and modified. This problem was introduced during commit
0c017188b4d41cc80c297e35097095026734b3d4 when reported conflicts have
been checked for common pre- and suffixes.

This was fixed here by better determining whether after stripping
off common prefixes and suffixes from a conflicting region there
is still some conflicting part left.
I also added a unit test to test this situation.
