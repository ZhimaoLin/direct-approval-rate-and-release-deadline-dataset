DESCRIPTION

Fix Severe Bug in Merge Algorithm

As described in Bug 328551 there was a bug that the merge algorithm
was not always reporting conflicts when the same line was deleted
and modified. This problem was introduced during commit
017188b4d41cc80c297e35097095026734b3d4 when reported conflicts have
been checked for common pre- and suffixes.
This was fixed here by better determining whether after stripping
off common prefixes and suffixes from a conflicting region there
is still some conflicting part left.
I also added a unit test to test this situation.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think the code looks fine, my major issue is the unknown commit SHA-1 in the message trying to use it to explain the problem.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style-nit: You should add:

  Bug: 328551

to the footer before the Change-Id line.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> What commit is this?  I can't find it in the JGit project.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style-nit:  I would put a blank line before here to separate the two paragraphs (what the issue is, and then what the fix is).

I think Chris meant
0c017188b4d41cc80c297e35097095026734b3d4
the commit in the message isn't legal since it's only 38 digits, so he probably missed the first 2 digits when copying
