DESCRIPTION

Git Porcelain API: Add Command

The new Add command adds files to the Git Index. 
It  uses the DirCache to access the git index. It 
works also in case of an existing conflict. 

Fileglobs (e.g. *.c) are not yet supported. 

The new Add command does add ignored files because
there is no gitignore support in jgit yet.
