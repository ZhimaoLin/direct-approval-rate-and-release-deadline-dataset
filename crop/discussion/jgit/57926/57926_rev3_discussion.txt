DESCRIPTION

Do not decrement repository usage counter if it is already at zero

If close() was executed more times as incrementOpen(), next pairs of
calls to incrementOpen() and close() will not close repository as
expected, leaving repository "closed" state undefined (below zero).

To prevent this, do not further decrement usage counter if it is already
at zero.
