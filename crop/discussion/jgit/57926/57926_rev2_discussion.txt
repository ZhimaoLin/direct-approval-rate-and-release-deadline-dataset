DESCRIPTION

Do not decrement repository usage counter if it is already at zero

If close() was executed more times as incrementOpen(), next pairs of
calls to incrementOpen() and close() will not close repository as
expected, leaving repository "closed" state undefined (below zero).

To prevent this, do not further decrement usage counter if it is already
at zero.

Yep, thanks, I must confess I have not expected the code is multi-thread safe. Last patch set should address your concern.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Synchronizing on an AtomicInteger looks ... funny, but considering the alternatives, I guess this is as good as anything.
