Yay.  Three nits.  I'll cherry-pick and fix, thanks.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/SkipWorkTreeFilter.java -> Google owns me^Hmy work on JGit.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/SkipWorkTreeFilter.java -> We should also have a toString so printing a filter graph is semi-useful:

 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public String toString() {
    return "SkipWorkTree(" + treeIdx + ")";
  }

Today I wished we had it in the NotIgnoredFilter.  (I'm writing up a change to add a toString() there right now...)

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> I have to say I find this line amusing.  At least the class is deprecated and should die...  :-)

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> s/1/INDEX/ ?

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Also we really should apply the skipping / not ignored logic before ANY_DIFF, not after.  That way we don't look at paths that we aren't supposed to even care about.
