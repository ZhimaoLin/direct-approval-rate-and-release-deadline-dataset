DESCRIPTION

TreeWalk optionally honors Index entries' "skipWorkTree" flag.

DirCacheIterator can be configured to signal to skip entries
for which 'skipWorkTree' flag has been set. This will only
affect Index format version "3".

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

As I mentioned on the prior patch set, I still don't think we want this.  But if we do, we probably need to also expose the skip flag on DirCacheBuildIterator's constructor, and we need unit tests for the skipping behavior.

Line:525, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/AbstractTreeIterator.java -> Style-nit: Trailing space.

Line:536, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalk.java -> I wouldn't rename this variable as part of this change.  You don't reference it any new code.  So as bad as the name might be, I don't see a compelling motivation to change these lines as part of this commit.

We really try to avoid editing lines we don't have to.  If you were actually using t as a parameter to isSkipCurrentEntry() then I might be willing to accept a rename of it as part of the same commit.  But since you don't need it, it doesn't make sense.
