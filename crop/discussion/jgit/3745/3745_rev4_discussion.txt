DESCRIPTION

Add server-side support for shallow revision and object walkers.

Add subclasses of RevWalk and ObjectWalk which only traverse the
tree down to a given depth, and correctly treat "shallow" commits
(those whose parents are not known to the client due to limited
history).

Patch Set 4: Abandoned

There isn't much point in rebasing this change; its functionally equivalent to Matt's change that was just merged by Chris.
