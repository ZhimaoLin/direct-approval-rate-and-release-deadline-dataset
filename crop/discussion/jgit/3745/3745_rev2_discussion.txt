DESCRIPTION

Add server-side support for shallow revision and object walkers.

Add subclasses of RevWalk and ObjectWalk which only traverse the
tree down to a given depth, and correctly treat "shallow" commits
(those whose parents are not known to the client due to limited
history).

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Use static import rather than copying the field.

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Style-nit: We prefer one-line Javadoc when possible /** ... */.

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Style-nit: We use tabs for indentation.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Style-nit: Blank line between fields that have Javadoc.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> These flags should be allocated only inside of the walker, and must not be part of the public API.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Same as above, the flag should not be part of the public API.

Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> The only reason you had to override next(), expose pendingObjects, and duplicate all of this code was for this r.has(BOUNDARY) test?

Any way we can skip that flag test on the commit?

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Javadoc isn't necessary on a package method.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthRevWalk.java -> Style-nit: I prefer to write short Javadoc all as one line:

  /** The number of commits to walk down. */

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthRevWalk.java -> Style-nit: Please use tabs to indent, not spaces.

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthRevWalk.java -> Please wrap lines longer than 80 characters when possible.

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthRevWalk.java -> I'm still fairly certain we don't want to allow the caller to supply the SHALLOW flag to our public constructor. This needs to be built by the RevWalk instance itself to ensure the flags are allocated right.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthRevWalk.java -> I'm still fairly certain we don't want to allow the caller to supply the SHALLOW flag to our public constructor. This needs to be built by the RevWalk instance itself to ensure the flags are allocated right.

Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthRevWalk.java -> This Javadoc is not connected to any code.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/StartGenerator.java -> Style-nit: We put the else on the line with the closing curly brace:

  } else {

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/StartGenerator.java -> Style-nit: We put the else on the line with the closing curly brace:

  } else {

Line:177, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Instead of exposing these fields as protected, lets make a different variant of toObjectWalkWithSameObjects available:

  public ObjectWalk toObjectWalkWithSameObjects() {
    return toObjectWalkWithSameObjects(new ObjectWalk(reader));
  }

  protected <T extends ObjectWalk> toObjectWalkWithSameObjects(T dst) {
    RevWalk rw = dst;
    rw.objects = objects;
    rw.freeFlags = freeFlags;
    return rw;
  }

This way DepthRevWalk doesn't have to know what to copy over, or get to see these private state fields of the RevWalk.

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Use a static import rather than copying the field.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Style-nit: Blank line between fields that have Javadoc, and try to use single line Javadoc when possible.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Style-nit: This Javadoc is not formatted properly. All lines in the block should use a * lined up in the same column, and to the right of the * the Javadoc should use spaces to indent the description of the parameter.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> This line is still over 80 characters, please line wrap.

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Style-nit: Parens here around !p.has(BOUNDARY) are not necessary.

Doesn't this NPE when BOUNDARY wasn't allocated by DepthRevWalk? I guess you assume it cannot since DepthRevWalk overrides markUninteresting() to do nothing and therefore you assume UNINTERESTING can never be set on a RevCommit?

I'm a little skeptical of using that as the method to determine if BOUNDARY is null or not.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthCommit.java -> Style-nit: I prefer single line Javadoc when possible:

  /** Depth of this commit in the graph. */
  int depth;

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthCommit.java -> Please supply valid Javadoc, not empty placeholders.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthObjectWalk.java -> Okay. I would still like a DepthRevWalk to pass its SHALLOW on to a DepthObjectWalk so I am keeping around a package level constructor.

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> DepthRevWalk is supposed to be too simple to deal with UNINTERESTING or BOUNDARY so yes, the check is never supposed to get that far. It's not pretty, but I'll add a defensive (BOUNDARY != null) condition.
