DESCRIPTION

Add support for computing a Change-Id Ã  la Gerrit

A Change-Id helps tools like Gerrit Code Review to keeps
different versions of a patch together. The Change-Id is computed
as a SHA-1 hash of some of the same basic information as a commit
id on the first commit intended to solve a particular problem and then
reused for updated solutions.

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectWriter.java -> s/am/an/

Line:308, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectWriter.java -> Not necessarily a blob.

Line:309, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectWriter.java -> This isn't necessarily a blob, is it?

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> Its spelled "Gerrit Code Review".

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> Clean shouldn't be necessary in JGit.  Its required in the C hook script because we are presented with the *original* buffer from the user, before its been cleaned up by the commit creation routine.  So there we need to drop lines leading with #, etc.  But within JGit that should all happen in the higher level UI before that UI invokes the ChangeIdUtil class.  (Or simply not need to happen at all.)

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> I think I would prefer the treeId to come first.  It comes first in the commit formatting, and in the change-id string computation.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> This temporary file is not necessary.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> I wouldn't bother with the temporary sha1 variable here.  Also, b.length() is not the same size as the number of bytes available for hashing.  If the name contains a multi-byte character for example, with UTF-8 encoding we won't consider everything in the hash.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/ChangeIdUtil.java -> I would prefer running this through the parser that RevCommit uses when parsing footer lines.  Unfortunately that code is part of RevCommit.  So we would need to pull it out into a utility class, or find a way to construct a RevCommit from the buffered message so we can reuse that parser.  But even if we don't do that, you can search backwards from the end of the string to find the paragraph break that denotes the "footer" and then insert there.  But at that point, we're mostly replicating that parsing code.

In particular one of the rules we do in the shell hook is, we try to insert the Change-Id line after the Bug line, if one is present, but before any other lines.  That's hard to do with a simple regex replaceAll like you are doing here to insert the item into the string.
