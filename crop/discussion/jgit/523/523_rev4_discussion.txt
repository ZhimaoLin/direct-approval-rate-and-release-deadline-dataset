DESCRIPTION

Add support for computing a Change-Id Ã  la Gerrit

A Change-Id helps tools like Gerrit Code Review to keeps
different versions of a patch together. The Change-Id is computed
as a SHA-1 hash of some of the same basic information as a commit
id on the first commit intended to solve a particular problem and then
reused for updated solutions.
