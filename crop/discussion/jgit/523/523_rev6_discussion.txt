DESCRIPTION

Add support for computing a Change-Id Ã  la Gerrit

A Change-Id helps tools like Gerrit Code Review to keeps
different versions of a patch together. The Change-Id is computed
as a SHA-1 hash of some of the same basic information as a commit
id on the first commit intended to solve a particular problem and then
reused for updated solutions.

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

Aside from the JVM .classpath change, this looks good to me.  I'm glad you decided to reuse the tests, and the code looks a lot cleaner now.

Line:7, org.eclipse.jgit.test/.classpath -> Why are we updating our JVM standard to 1.6 for the unit tests?
