DESCRIPTION

Fix exception handling for opening bitmap index files

When creating a new PackFile instance it is specified whether this pack
has an associated bitmap index file or not. This information is cached
and the public method getBitmapIndex() will always assume a bitmap index
file must exist if the cached data tells so. But it may happen that the
packfiles are repacked during a gc in a different process causing the
packfile, bitmap-index and index file to be deleted. Since JGit still
has
an open FileHandle on the packfile this file is not really deleted and
can still be accessed. But index and bitmap index file are deleted.
Fix getBitmapIndex() to invalidate invalidate the packfile instance if
such
a situation occurs.

This problem showed up when a gerrit server was serving repositories
which where garbage collected with native git regularly. Fetches and
clones for certain repositories failed permanently after a native git gc
was deleting old bitmap index files.
