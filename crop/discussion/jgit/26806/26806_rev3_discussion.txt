DESCRIPTION

PlotCommitList: Remove handling of children that have no lane yet

Child commits always have a lane assigned when their parents are
processed, so this code is no longer necessary.

Children only assign themselves to parents in
PlotCommitList.setupChildren(), which is called from enter(), when the
child is processed. If the child leaves enter() it should always have a
lane assigned. As a result of this, when processing a parent, all its
known children already have lanes assigned. If the underlying RevWalk
emits a parent before one of its children (which it should not do), the
parent does not know of the child emitted later, because setupChildren()
has not been called for the child yet. So even in this case, no child
without a lane is encountered when processing a (parent) commit.
