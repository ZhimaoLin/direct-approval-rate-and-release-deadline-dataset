DESCRIPTION

RefDirectory: remove ref lock file for following ref dir removal

Before this fix, ref directory removal did not work. That was because
the ref lock file was still in the leaf directory at deletion time.
Hence no deep ref directories were ever deleted, which negatively
impacted performance under large directory structure circumstances.

This fix removes the ref lock file before attempting to delete the ref
directory (which includes it); applies to the leaf directory solely.
The other deep parent directories are therefore now successfully
deleted in turn, since leaf's content (lock file) gets removed first.

So, given a structure such as refs/any/directory[/**], this fix now
deletes all empty directories up to -and including- 'directory'. The
'any' directory (e.g.) does not get deleted even if empty, as before.

The ref lock file is still also removed in the calling block's finally
clause, just in case, as before. Such double-unlock brought by this
fix is harmless (a no-op).

A new (private) RefDirectory#delete method is introduced to support
this #pack-specific case; other RefDirectory#delete callers remain
untouched.

Patch Set 3:

I already tagged the final 4.4.0 so technically it already exists but I can only publicly announce it when Neon is released on June 22

Ok, I was confused because I commented on the other open change against stable-4.4 about xxx@xxx.xxx that should be 4.4.1 and Sasa put it to 4.4.

in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/74904/4/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCacheConfig.java

it should xxx@xxx.xxx 4.4.1 and not 4.4?

Patch Set 3:

all 4.4.x releases will be done on stable-4.4 branch since we have no need to prepare 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 in parallel
