DESCRIPTION

Refactor amazon-s3:// property file loading to support no directory

In the future getDirectory() can return null.  Avoid an NPE here by
refactoring the code to support conditionally skipping a check for
the properties file in the repository directory, falling to only
the user's ~/ file location.
