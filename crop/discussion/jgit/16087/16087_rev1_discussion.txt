DESCRIPTION

Fix for stack overflow exception when there is a cycle in alternates.

There are clearly a couple of ways to handle this problem: one would be for myAlternates to load all
possible alternates, but that didn't seem to be in the spirit of how the current implementation does
thingsâ€”doing as little work as possible and returning as soon as possible. So this fix has methods
that iterate over alternates keep a reference to the FileObjectDatabase instance that called them.
Those methods both check their alternates against the primary's list and add new alternates to it as
they are encountered. Alternates the primary knows about are not traversed.

Some high-level comments:

* Please add a line "Bug: 416457" before the Change-Id.
* The commit message should be wrapped at 72 characters, see contributor guide[1]

I don't know the alternate implementation, so I'm not really the right one to comment on the content.

Almost. Robin identified a couple of issues with the comments and a bit of mis-formatting in the code. The new upload was my attempt to fix those. It's my first time submitting a patch here, so apologies if I'm not doing things right!
