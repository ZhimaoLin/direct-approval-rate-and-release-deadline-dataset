DESCRIPTION

Extende FileUtils.delete with option to delete empty directories only

See inline comments, looks good overall.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Maybe EMPTY_DIRECTORY_ONLY or ONLY_EMPTY_DIRECTORY would be better because they're more explicit?

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Could you add braces here and for the below if? It's kind of hard to read in this case.
