DESCRIPTION

Extend FileUtils.delete with option to delete empty directories only

The new option EMPTY_DIRECTORIES_ONLY will make delete() only delete
empty directories. Any attempt to delete files will fail. Can be
combined with RECURSIVE to wipe out entire tree structures and
IGNORE_ERRORS to silently ignore any files or non-empty directories.
