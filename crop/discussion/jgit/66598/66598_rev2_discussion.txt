DESCRIPTION

HugeFileTest: Make Git a class member and open in try-with-resource

There's only one test method in this module and it's quite long, so
rather than using a try-with-resource and having to indent a huge
block of existing code, make the Git a member variable that gets
initialised and closed in @Before xxx@xxx.xxx annotated methods.

The methods are named 'before' and 'after' rather than the conventional
'setUp' and 'tearDown' so as not to conflict with the names of the
existing methods in LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase.
