DESCRIPTION

Search heavier for objects that are referenced

In some cases git push from a client returned with a missing blob or
a missing tree.  This is caused by a pack that contains a
reference to a tree or blob that in fact is reachable through one
of the advertised references but not directly in the tree of the
advertised reference but in one of its parents / grandparents trees.

This fix starts a new ObjectWalk at the advertised references and
tries to incrementally find objects that are not found otherwise.
When the object is found the ObjectWalk is suspended and resumed
if needed for another object. Before an object is searched via
the ObjectWalk a db.hasObject() triggers fast fail when an object
is not in the repository at all, However this alone is not sufficient
as this could break Gerrit access control policies.

Patch Set 2:

This seems to be related to a currently heavily discussed topic in JGit. We even reverted previous solutions because of performance problems. I just want to know: are you aware about 
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/31081/
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/46447/
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45530/
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465509

Your change looks a little bit like a alternative solution. Right?

Patch Set 2:

I was actually not aware about the revert. Thanks for the hint.
My change actually is related to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/31081/, and may result in even more work on the server-side. As not only the root-trees, as mentioned in 31081, must be scanned for existing object but possibly all commits up to the root.
However, my change uses the expensive operations only in the case of a possibly missing object that is found in the repository using db.hasObject(obj). So using this change and reverting 31081 should work perfectly and avoid the overhead of 31081 unless there would be a missing object exception.
