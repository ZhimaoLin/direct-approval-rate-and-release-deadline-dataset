Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.feature/pom.xml -> I would use more descriptive name here e.g. "JGit Command Line Interface Feature" or  "JGit Command Line Feature".

Line:18, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.feature/feature.properties -> The description should be replaced with something more accurate. Currently, the update manager displays the same description for this one and Eclipse JGit feature.
