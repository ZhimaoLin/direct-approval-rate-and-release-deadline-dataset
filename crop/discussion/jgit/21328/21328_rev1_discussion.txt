Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/TooLargePackException.java -> We need a xxx@xxx.xxx 3.3" annotation here. We annotate which new public classes/methods/.. get introduced and Eclipse gives warnings here.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> There is no description what this class will do. I think we should add a link to original description or even copy also the description here. If it was modified then you could explain what was modified.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> We need a xxx@xxx.xxx 3.3" annotation here. We annotate which new public classes/methods/.. get introduced. Eclipse complains about the missing since tag.

Line:632, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> that sentence is not correct. Please rephrase

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/TooLargePackException.java -> mention the unit for this size (I guess it's byte)

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> I think you copied from Guava 16.0, see your CQ 7896

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> this class doesn't need to be public, it's only used within the transport package, if it's not public we also don't need xxx@xxx.xxx annotation

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> style nit: we usually put annotations in the line before the one being annotated

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> style nit: we don't use curly braces around single line blocks, more below

Line:635, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> mention unit for this size

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> From the class name it is more a util class than a transport specific class. Therefore, I would move it to the util.io package.

A bigger problem here was that this (util) class throws the TooLargePackException which is transport specific. To solve this problem, this class will provide an abstract raiseError method.

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/LimitedInputStream.java -> I knew that but thought to keep the code as similar as possible with the original.

Done, as you suggested.
