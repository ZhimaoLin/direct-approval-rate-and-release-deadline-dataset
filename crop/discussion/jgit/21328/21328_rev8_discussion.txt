DESCRIPTION

Possibility to limit the max pack size on receive-pack

The maxPackSizeLimit, when set, will reject a pack if it exceeds
that limit.

This feature is intended to provide a mechanism to control disk space
quota on Git repositories.

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/LimitedInputStream.java -> It is not clear to me what a limit of 0 means. Not a single byte can be received through this stream without an exception? Or does 0 mean "there is no limit"?
I guess the first.

Line:148, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/LimitedInputStream.java -> Missing javadoc for the IOException. In Eclipse you see this. I wouldn't complain (because I don't expect something useful from this javadoc) if this would not cause red error markers for all those JGit developers who choose to develop with Eclipse.

Line:241, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> why is this field initialized with -1 and not with 0. The javadoc of  setsetMaxPackSizeLimit() says a 0 means "there is no limit". And by default we want no limit.

Line:645, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Optional: Here you are using implicit boxing of long to Long. MessageFormat.format() expects Objects as trailing parameters but you give a primitive 'long'. For Eclipse that's at least worth a warning. A 'Long.valueOf(limit)' would remove the warning. But your code is less complex and easier to read. You decide

Line:768, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> According to the javadoc of setMaxObjectSizeLimi() a value of 0 means "there should not be a limit"

If maxPackSizeLimit is 0 (means: we don't want a limit) then I would simply avoid the overhead to create a LimitedInputStream. This can be achieved by s/>=/>/

Or is that javadoc of setMaxObjectSizeLimit() wrong and setting the limit to 0 means we don't want to receive a single byte?

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/LimitedInputStream.java -> 0 means really zero (not a single byte can be read). This is changed from the previous patch set where 0 meant "no limit".

Line:148, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/LimitedInputStream.java -> Done

Line:241, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> The 0 == no limit was valid in the PS7 but this was changed in this patch set and the javadoc of the setMaxPackSizeLimit was  updated. The zero means really zero, and the -1 means that a limit was not set (i.e. no limit).

Line:645, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Done as you proposed to keep the style compatible with the rest of the JGit code.

Line:768, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> The maxPackSizeLimit has nothing to do with the setMaxObjectSizeLimit, they are two different properties :-)

Line:407, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Done
