Looks sane. Is this under .transport because it's mainly for use in e.g. PreReceiveHooks? I ask because it seems similar to ProgressMonitor so it could make sense to go in .lib with an explanation that unlike ProgressMonitor, this can be used to show we're still alive when performing a slow task that is not easily divided into work units (e.g. a single slow request to another machine).

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ProgressSpinner.java -> optional: MIN_REFRESH_MILLIS?

Yes. And it uses an OutputStream, not the ProgressMonitor interface. So its more similar to SideBandProgressMonitor, which is in transport.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ProgressSpinner.java -> Done
