DESCRIPTION

ReflogConfigTest: refactor commit method to avoid variable hiding

The author and committer parameters were hiding class members of
the same name.

Since the passed in PersonIdent instances were being created from
the class members anyway, remove the parameters and instead create
the PersonIdent instances inline in the method.
