DESCRIPTION

ReceiveCommand: Explicitly check constructor preconditions

Some downstream code checks whether a ReceiveCommand is a create or an
update based on the type field. Other downstream code (in particular a
good chunk of Gerrit code I wrote) checks the same thing by comparing
oldId/newId to zeroId. Unfortunately, there were no strict checks in the
constructor that ensures that zeroId is only set for oldId/newId if the
type argument corresponds, so a caller that passed mismatched IDs and
types would observe completely undefined behavior as a result. This is
and always has been a misuse of the API; throw IllegalArgumentException
so the caller knows that it is a misuse.

Similarly, throw from the constructor if oldId/newId are null. The
non-nullness requirement was already documented. Fix RefDirectoryTest to
not do the wrong thing.
