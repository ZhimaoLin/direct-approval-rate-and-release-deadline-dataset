Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> Shouldn't this have been included in the preceding change?

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.target/jgit-4.7.target -> Unrelated to this change, but this reminded me to ask: why don't we have these .target files for 4.8 and 4.9?

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.target/jgit-4.7.target -> The number refers to the Eclipse version, not the Jgit version. 4.7 == Oxygen. 4.8 would be Photon, and 4.9 doesn't exist yet :-)

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.target/jgit-4.7.target -> yes, it's pure coincidence that Eclipse platform and JGit are currently in a similar version range

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.target/jgit-4.7.target -> OK, thanks.  The reason I asked was because I've been getting strange errors and warnings in Eclipse related to API versions.

Turns out my environment was a bit messed up.  It's working now.
