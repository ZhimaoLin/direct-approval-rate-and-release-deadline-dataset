DESCRIPTION

Add progress monitor to Merger

Monitoring progress of merges can be useful for users for large
repositories or complex merge processes that take some time.

This enables setting a monitor. Existing merge implementations in jgit
do not yet report progress if a monitor is set. This will be added in a
later change.
