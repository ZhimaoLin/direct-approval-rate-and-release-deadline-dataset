Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

Good idea to add more tests to the CloneCommandTest class.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Test methods should start with "test".

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> In order to create a bare repository, you have to perform the following: Git.init().setDirectory(directory).setBare(true).call();

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> This setting is wrong. The original repository is not bare.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The first line of the commit message should be short and precise, e.g. "Add testcase for CloneCommand".

The subsequent lines should then provide detailed information about the change, e.g. "A test method for cloning to a bare repository is added to class CloneCommandTest."
