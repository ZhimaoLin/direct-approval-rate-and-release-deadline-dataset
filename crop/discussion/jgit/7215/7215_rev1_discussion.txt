DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Force update of tag ref on fetch instead of rejecting

The C Git behavior when a tag ref is updated on fetch is to write the
new ref. JGit rejected the update. This change makes JGit follow the C
Git behavior.

Line:626, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefUpdate.java -> I think this is wrong, git reference manual for git-tag [1] says:
"Unless -f is given, the tag to be created must not yet exist in the .git/refs/tags/ directory."

Line:626, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefUpdate.java -> Hm, you're right, RefUpdate is also used for "git tag". Changed.
