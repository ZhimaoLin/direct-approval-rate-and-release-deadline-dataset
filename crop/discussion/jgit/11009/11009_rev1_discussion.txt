DESCRIPTION

Simplify Eclipse setup for JGit developers

This provides a quick way to install the tools and JGit dependencies
typically used by JGit contributors. In addition it provides an
alternative to using a target platform for provisioning 3rd party
dependencies required to compile and test JGit. A similar file with the
additional EGit dependencies is available in the EGit repository.

Using a target platform is more accurate as it allows to separate the
dependencies of the workbench used for development from the one used for
testing. But using a target platform is typically slower since PDE tries
to communicate with p2 repositories listed in the target platform.

In order to install dependencies and plugins typically used by JGit
developers click "Import... > Install > Install Software Items from
File" and select this p2f file, then select the bundles you want to
install and click OK.

it seems there is no interest to have another p2f file in addition to the one for egit
