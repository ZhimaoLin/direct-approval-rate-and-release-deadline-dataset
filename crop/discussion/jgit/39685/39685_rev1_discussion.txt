DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Don't remove pack if accessing a pack throws IOException 

If the IOException is caused by a transient problem that's maybe the
better strategy to avoid the problem reported on the Gerrit list [1].
It looks like in the reported case the pack was removed from the pack
list causing MissingObjectExceptions which disappear when the server is
restarted.

Besides the trailing whitespace this looks ok to me

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> trailing whitespace
