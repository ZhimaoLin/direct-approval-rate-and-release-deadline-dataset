DESCRIPTION

Fix NullPointer when pulling from a deleted local branch

A checked Exception is thrown instead.

The reason for throwing an Exception is that the state of the
repository is inconsistent in this case: There is a merge
configuration containing a non-existing local branch. Ideally the
deletion of a local branch should also delete the corresponding
merge configuration.
