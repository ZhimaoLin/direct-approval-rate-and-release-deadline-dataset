DESCRIPTION

Show resolving deltas progress to push clients

CGit push clients 1.6.6 and later support progress messages on the
side-band-64k channel during push, as this was introduced to handle
server side hook errors reported over smart HTTP.

Since JGit's delta resolution isn't always as fast as CGit's is,
a user may think the server has crashed and failed to report
status if the user pushed a lot of content and sees no feedback.
Exposing the progress monitor during the resolving deltas phase
will let the user know the server is still making forward progress.

This also helps BasePackPushConnection, which has a bounded timeout
on how long it will wait before assuming the remote server is dead.
Progress messages pushed down the side-band channel will reset the
read timer, helping the connection to stay alive and avoid timing
out before the remote side's work is complete.
