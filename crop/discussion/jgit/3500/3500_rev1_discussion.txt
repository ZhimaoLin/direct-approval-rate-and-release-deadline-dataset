Line:247, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/Git.java -> please remove the trailing blank

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ListTagCommand.java -> Branches? This command will return tags.

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ListTagCommand.java -> I think we need some unit tests. Please check what happens on repos without any tags, that the sort order is as expected, ... . That's our official API and it should not contain code not covered by tests.
