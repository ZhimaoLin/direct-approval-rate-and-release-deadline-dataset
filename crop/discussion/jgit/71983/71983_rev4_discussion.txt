DESCRIPTION

Add support for builtin smudge filters

JGit supports smudge filters defined in repository configuration. The
filters are implemented as external programs filtering content by
accepting the original content (as seen in git's object database) on
stdin and which emit the filtered content on stdout. This content is
then written to the file in the working tree. To run such a filter JGit
has start a external process and pump data into/from this process.

This commit adds support for builtin smudge filters which are
implemented in java and which are executed by jgit's main thread. When a
filter is defined in the configuration as
"jgit://builtin/<filterDriverName>/smudge" then JGit will lookup in a
static map whether a builtin filter is registered under this name. If
found such a filter is called to do the filtering.

The functionality in this commit requires that a program using JGit
explicitly calls the JGit API to register builtin implementations for
specific smudge filters. In follow-up commits configuration parameters
will be added which trigger such registrations.
