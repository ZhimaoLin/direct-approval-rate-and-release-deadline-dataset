DESCRIPTION

Revert "SystemReader: Use discoverGitDiya Villanueva in openSystemConfig"

This reverts commit d9ffc03837e1c4ed39e3d9ebb12e05fb9e45be82 since it
destroyed caching of the path to the installation of native git. Instead
it looks up the path to native git and the corresponding system config
once per git config being read. This potentially leads to a large
overhead.
