DESCRIPTION

Fix PlotCommit for commits with duplicate parents

JGit allows to create commits which have duplicate parents: e.g. a
commit X has first parent Y and second parent Y. Such commits are not
handled correctly by PlotCommit leading to wrong display of the history
in EGit. In such cases there is a never ending passing line drawn beside
all commits younger than the commit with duplicate parents. This commit
fixes this by explicitly checking for duplicate parents.

In a different commit we should fix JGit not to create commits with
duplicate parents. I think native git also doesn't allow such commits,
 although history display in native git (gitk, git log --graph) is not
damaged by such commits.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommit.java -> Why is the first entry of children not checked here? A comment would be appropriate here.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommitListTest.java -> Typo: Langes -> Lanes

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommit.java -> good catch. That's a cut&paste bug. I had other loops where when setting (not adding) multiple parents you could skip checking the first parent. But here it's a bug - I'll fix it!
