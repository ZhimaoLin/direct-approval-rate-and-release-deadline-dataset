DESCRIPTION

Add remaining parts of the bazel build

Add bazel build for ui and junit.http, and the test packages.

A number of different test labels are supported:

  api
  attributes
  dfs
  diff
  http
  lfs
  lfs-server
  nls
  notes
  pack
  patch
  pgm
  reftree
  revplot
  revwalk
  storage
  submodule
  symlinks
  transport
  treewalk
  util

To run all tests:

  bazel test //...

To run specific tests, using labels:

  bazel test --test_tag_filters=api,dfs,revplot,treewalk //...

2 tests are still failing: [1]. It seems to be related to UTF-8 char in
file names: [2]. The same tests do not have any issues in buck.

Indeed. I removed this section above. We could merge the series then.
