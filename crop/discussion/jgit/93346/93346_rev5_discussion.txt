DESCRIPTION

Add bazel tests

Number of different labels are supported:

  api
  attributes
  dfs
  diff
  http
  lfs
  lfs-server
  nls
  notes
  pack
  patch
  pgm
  reftree
  revplot
  revwalk
  storage
  submodule
  symlinks
  transport
  treewalk
  util

To run all tests:

  bazel test //...

To run specific tests, using labels:

  bazel test --test_tag_filters=api,dfs,revplot,treewalk //...

2 tests are still failing: [1]. It seems to be related to UTF-8 char in
file names: [2]. The same tests do not have any issues in buck.

Line:40, WORKSPACE -> I don't understand how Buck tests work without that dep. Bazel is failing here, as expected with NCDFE org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base64: [1].

* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/603289

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Without this annotation Bazel is failing on this test class with no test methods found.

Line:135, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> This statement is failing with: FNFE: [1].

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Looks like these tests are not being executed when building with Maven, even after adding xxx@xxx.xxx annotation.
