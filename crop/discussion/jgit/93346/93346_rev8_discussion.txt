Line:37, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/BUILD -> this works, but only due to sandboxing. If somebody adds a subpackage under this tree, I think you may end up zipping too much.

it's probably better to use $(SRCS) to drive the input of the zip process. See eg. 

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/93442/1/org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD

line 89.

Line:38, org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD -> I think we could fix it the samy way Shawn fixed the sources using InsecureCipherFactory that was built with enabled EP bug pattern http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InsecureCryptoUsage.
