Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/BUILD -> Why does this require commons-codec in the bazel build but not the maven build? I don't see any instances of org.apache.commons.codec in the source.

Is this an undeclared transitive dependency via another library?

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/BUILD -> It wasn't required in the buck build either, so something seems wrong.

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/BUILD -> See David's comment on the earlier patch set.  Tests fail with NoClassDefFoundError for org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base64
