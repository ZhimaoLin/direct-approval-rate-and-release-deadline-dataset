same remark like for the other change: change the default so that the new tests aren't run by default since not every JGit contributor has an AWS account. I'll change the configuration of the Hudson job so that it will run the tests.

Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/jgit-s3-connection-v-2.properties -> style it: remove trailing whitespace throughout this file
