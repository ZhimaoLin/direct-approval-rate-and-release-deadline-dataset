DESCRIPTION

RevCommit.getShortMessage: remove \r from returned message

It happened that commit messages contain a \r character.
getShortMessage now removes these characters to prevent problems in
client code (clients expect a single line to be returned).

I am not sure if this is a good solution.
But we should somehow guarantee that getShortMessage returns a single line even for commits with a "corrupted" commit message. Otherwise clients of getShortMessage get problems (see related bug).

Another solution could look like follows:

1. Replace all "\r\n" with "\n"
2. Replace remaining "\r" with "\n"
3. Now the "first line" of the commit message can be found by looking for the first "\n\n"

Patch Set 1:

Can you make a proposal which fixes getShortMessage() (to replace not only \n but \r?\n by spaces) and also RawParseUtils.endOfParagraph() (to detect first \r?\n\r?\n)

Chris: why? If we need to fix anything for broken commit
message I think wy can stay with this unless we find out that the whole message must be cleaned.

Line:413, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This method might be called a lot and \r only occurs very rarely,
so check whether it contains a \r before invoking the whole regexp machinery.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Because I thought that RevCommit.getShortMessage() and RawParseUtils.endOfParagraph() are so closely tied that if we fix one we should also fix the other. But for me it's also ok if this is seperated. I don't care so much.
