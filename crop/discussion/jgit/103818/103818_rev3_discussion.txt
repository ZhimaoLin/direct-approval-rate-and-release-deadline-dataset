DESCRIPTION

Use Config.getEnum() to read the IgnoreSubmoduleMode

Doing so goes through the TypedConfigGetter and thus allows library
clients (for instance EGit) to warn about invalid configurations.

Note that the handling of submodule.*.ignore appears to be broken
in JGit in several respects:

1. According to [1], the value in .gitmodules can be overridden
   in $GIT_DIR/config, which in turn can be overridden on the command
   line. These overrides are not implemented in JGit.
   
2. IndexDiff appears to handle the setting incorrectly. See lines
   IndexDiff.java, lines 526ff. First, it overrides the command-line
   setting (field IndexDiff.ignoreSubmoduleMode) with the per-submodule
   setting from .gitmodules iff it is "ALL". Second, it loads that
   config value only on the first submodule, but then applies it to
   all remaining submodules encountered.

These bugs are _not_ fixed by this commit.
