Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> don't you want to add a/b?

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> Do I miss something? In moment the index contains a file 'a' with content "New Hello world a".  The workingtree contains the same. And now you checkout a branch with also contains file 'a' with exactly that content. Why should it fail?

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> if I run

 git checkout branch_1 

here using native git it says:

 already on 'branch_1'

so it looks like this test case is wrong

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> It doesn't change anything in this case, but it is more understandable with the pattern "a/b", so I will change this.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> It is not the same content, because the first file 'a' contains "Hello world a" and the second file 'a' contains "New Hello world a"

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> At line 119, I only do a create branch, not a checkout, so before the execute("git checkout branch_1"), I'm on the master branch
