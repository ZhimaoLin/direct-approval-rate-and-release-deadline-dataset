DESCRIPTION

Expose bitmap selection parameters via PackConfig

Expose the following bitmap selection parameters via PackConfig:
"bitmapContiguousCommitCount", "bitmapRecentCommitCount",
"bitmapRecentCommitSpan", "bitmapDistantCommitSpan",
"bitmapExcessiveBranchCount", and "bitmapInactiveBranchAge".

The value of bitmapContiguousCommitCount, whereby bitmaps are
created for the most recent N commits in a branch, has never
been verified. If experiments show that they are not valuable,
then we can simplify the implementation so that there is only
a concept of recent and distant commit history (defined by
"bitmapRecentCommitCount"), and the only controls we need are
"bitmapRecentCommitSpan" and "bitmapDistantCommitSpan".

Line:784, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> (style) recent jgit code prefers to leave out unnecessary 'final'

Line:957, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> the rest of these use all-lowercase, which makes them easier to search for (since case is not significant).
