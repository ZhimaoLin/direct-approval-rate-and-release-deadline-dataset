DESCRIPTION

Expose bitmap selection parameters via PackConfig

Expose the following bitmap selection parameters via PackConfig:
"bitmapContiguousCommitCount", "bitmapRecentCommitCount",
"bitmapRecentCommitSpan", "bitmapDistantCommitSpan",
"bitmapExcessiveBranchCount", and "bitmapInactiveBranchAge".

The value of bitmapContiguousCommitCount, whereby bitmaps are
created for the most recent N commits in a branch, has never
been verified. If experiments show that they are not valuable,
then we can simplify the implementation so that there is only
a concept of recent and distant commit history (defined by
"bitmapRecentCommitCount"), and the only controls we need are
"bitmapRecentCommitSpan" and "bitmapDistantCommitSpan".
