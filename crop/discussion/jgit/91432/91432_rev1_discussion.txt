DESCRIPTION

Correct the boolean logic for filtering paths

The TreeWalk filtering classes need to support the tenary
state that the path comparison generates.
A new path comparison method (isPathMatch) is created with
three distinct return values (isPathPrefix use value '0' to
encode two of these) which will makes it possible for the logical
operatiors (especially NOT) to aggregate a correct verdict.

A filter like: AND(Path("path", NOT(Path("path/to/other"))))
Should filter out 'path/to/other/file', but not 'path/to/my/file'.

The path-limiting feature when testing path/to/my/file, would
result to run test for the following paths:

    path
    path/to
    path/to/my
    path/to/my/file

isPathPrefix('path/to/other') will return '0' for the first two
and since there is no way for NOT to distinguish between a exact
match and a match indicating that the tested path is a 'parent',
it will incorrectly return false and thus remove everything below
'path' immediately.
isPathMatch has a distingushed value for 'parent' matches that
will be preserved throught the logic operators and should not
cause an overeager removal of paths.

The functionality of isPathPrefix is required by other parts
and is untouched.

Unit test are included to ensure that the logical functionality
is correct and can be preserved.
