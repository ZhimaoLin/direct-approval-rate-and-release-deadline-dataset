DESCRIPTION

Modify refs in UploadPack/ReceivePack using a hook interface

This replaces the RefFilter interface. That interface required lots of
extra scanning and copying in filter cases such as only advertising a
subtree of the refs directory. Instead, execute the hook right before
ref advertisement, using the public methods on UploadPack/ReceivePack to
explicitly set the map of advertised refs.
