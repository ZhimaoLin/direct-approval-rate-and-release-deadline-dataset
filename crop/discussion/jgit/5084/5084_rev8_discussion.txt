DESCRIPTION

Modify refs in UploadPack/ReceivePack using a hook interface

This is intended to replace the RefFilter interface (but does not yet,
for backwards compatibility). That interface required lots of extra
scanning and copying in filter cases such as only advertising a subtree
of the refs directory. Instead, provide a hook that can be executed
right before ref advertisement, using the public methods on
UploadPack/ReceivePack to explicitly set the map of advertised refs.
