DESCRIPTION

Modify refs in UploadPack/ReceivePack using a hook interface

This is intended to replace the RefFilter interface (but does not yet,
for backwards compatibility). That interface required lots of extra
scanning and copying in filter cases such as only advertising a subtree
of the refs directory. Instead, provide a hook that can be executed
right before ref advertisement, using the public methods on
UploadPack/ReceivePack to explicitly set the map of advertised refs.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AdvertiseRefsHook.java -> I'm sort of inclined to say a hook has to call the setAdvertisedRefs method. If it doesn't, then no refs are advertised at all. That means the default hook implementation has to make sure the set call is made by running:

  uploadPack.setAdvertisedRefs(
      uploadPack.getRepository().getAllRefs());

Line:262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> If we are called before the hook runs, should we still be defaulting to all refs? Or should we run the hook? I think the hook should fire here, not rely on db.getAllRefs().

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I'm starting to think if null, no refs are advertised.

Line:265, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Please drop the {} since you have simplified the block.

Line:280, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> like with the upload case, i think if null assume no refs at all.

Line:282, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> again, if null assume empty. yes this means all well behaved hooks should use db.getAdditionalHaves() to seed this collection. document it.

Line:294, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> ack, I agree this needs to be done after the hook and after the filter to protect the clients.

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePackAdvertiseRefsHookTest.java -> unnecessary whitespace change

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> This particular refactoring is fairly big. It maybe could have been done as its own commit, making the ref advertise hook easier to review on its own as a follow-up commit.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AdvertiseRefsHook.java -> Hm, I'm not sure. We have some AdvertiseRefsHooks downstream that don't really have anything to do with ref advertisement, and do things like set up some logging state.

It so happens that we run those hooks in a chain such that the hook at the end of the chain actually does call setAdvertiseRefs, so that would be safe. But it feels a little weird to say that if one of the constituent hooks stood alone, we would have to change it to call setAdvertiseRefs.

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePackAdvertiseRefsHookTest.java -> Done
