DESCRIPTION

Added merge strategy RESOLVE

This adds the first merge strategy to JGit which does real
content-merges if necessary. The new merge strategy "resolve" takes as
input three commits: a common base, ours and theirs. It will simply takeover
changes on files which are only touched in ours or theirs. For files
touched in ours and theirs it will try to merge the two contents
knowing taking into account the specified common base.

Rename detection has not been introduced for now.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I am not fully happy with the state of the merge, but basic
tests work and I want to share early how the merge is intendet
to look like.
The main work is done in ResolveMerger and MergeCommand. I would be thankful for comments on these classes.

Missing are still a lot of tests, especially for error situations. Rename detection is also missing yet.
