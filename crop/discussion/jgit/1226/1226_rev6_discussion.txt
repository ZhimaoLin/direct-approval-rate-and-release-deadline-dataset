DESCRIPTION

Added merge strategy RESOLVE

This adds the first merge strategy to JGit which does real
content-merges if necessary. The new merge strategy "resolve" takes as
input three commits: a common base, ours and theirs. It will simply takeover
changes on files which are only touched in ours or theirs. For files
touched in ours and theirs it will try to merge the two contents
knowing taking into account the specified common base.

Rename detection has not been introduced for now.

- removed GitIndex usage in MergeCommandTest
- allow to inject DirCache and WorkingTreeIterator
- added missing license headers

Line:548, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Here we accept only locked DirCaches (that's a requirement from DirCacheBuilder.commit()). Shawn commented that he would like to use not locked DirCache instances. Not sure how to do that.

Please rebase to resolve the conflicts.

This is ready to go imho.

Line:548, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Regarding locked DirCache instances, please file a bug for this so we can track it and get to it. Things are good enough at the moment.
