Patch Set 5:

Woo hoo, I managed to sneak away to work on this for a little bit! :)

This should fix all of the style issues Shawn mentioned in the previous one.  I'm still relatively confident that the basic algorithm in this version will work right, but I'd really appreciate some review on that--there are a lot of weird edge cases.

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Failed

This actually looks pretty good. I'm going to try and combine it with the unit tests written by Alex and see if we can get a final patch together that is rebased on master and works correctly. Then we can run it through the IP process. Yay.

(NB: My -1 build failed is actually a note that I know this needs to be rebased.)
