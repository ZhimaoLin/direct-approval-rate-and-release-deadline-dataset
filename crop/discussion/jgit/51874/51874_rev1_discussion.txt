DESCRIPTION

RFC: Save push certs in batch only if commands match

Consider a BatchRefUpdate produced by Gerrit Code Review, where the
original command pushed over the wire might refer to
"refs/for/master", but that command is ignored and replaced with some
additional commands like creating "refs/changes/34/1234/1". We do not
want to store the cert in xxx@xxx.xxx since that may
lead someone looking to the ref to the incorrect conclusion that that
ref exists.

Add a separate method, saveMatching, that filters which files are
actually stored by looking at the existing command list in the passed
in BatchRefUpdate.

Line:461, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateStore.java -> There can't be two commands with the same refname, right?

On first reading I was confused about that. Might be worth a comment or run-time sanity check.

Line:461, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateStore.java -> Done.

Line:501, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateStore.java -> If it did, it would presumably check the type, result, and ref, so that wouldn't be appropriate here.

Arguably we could change PushCertificate to produce some other immutable command-ish type rather than ReceiveCommand, but *shrug*.

Line:461, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificateStore.java -> So, I think we need to actually fix BatchRefUpdate to disallow this at a higher level.

IIRC having two updates for a single ref causes our custom atomic ref storage backend to choke. But it works just fine with a FileRepository, since it just executes them in sequence.
