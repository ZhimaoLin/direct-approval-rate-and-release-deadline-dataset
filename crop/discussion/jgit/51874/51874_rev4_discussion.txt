DESCRIPTION

Allow saving push certs on a subset of refs

Consider a BatchRefUpdate produced by Gerrit Code Review, where the
original command pushed over the wire might refer to
"refs/for/master", but that command is ignored and replaced with some
additional commands like creating "refs/changes/34/1234/1". We do not
want to store the cert in xxx@xxx.xxx since that may
lead someone looking to the ref to the incorrect conclusion that that
ref exists.

Add a separate put method that takes a collection of commands, and
only stores certs on those refs that have a matching command in the
cert.
