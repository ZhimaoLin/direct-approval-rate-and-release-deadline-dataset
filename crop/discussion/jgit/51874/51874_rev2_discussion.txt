DESCRIPTION

Save push certs in batch only if commands match

Consider a BatchRefUpdate produced by Gerrit Code Review, where the
original command pushed over the wire might refer to
"refs/for/master", but that command is ignored and replaced with some
additional commands like creating "refs/changes/34/1234/1". We do not
want to store the cert in xxx@xxx.xxx since that may
lead someone looking to the ref to the incorrect conclusion that that
ref exists.

Add a separate method, saveMatching, that filters which files are
actually stored by looking at the existing command list in the passed
in BatchRefUpdate.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

This is not quite what I want. It's odd that we're comparing the matching list from the final batch update with every single push cert. My use case is I want to batch up several certs' worth of updates and apply them all in the last batch of the batch of batches.

Will rewrite.
