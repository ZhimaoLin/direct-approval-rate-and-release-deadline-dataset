Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_Win32_Cygwin.java -> I would put the getAbsolutePath() part here since we want it as a String.

Line:203, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Why not return java.io.File here?

I think searchPath is probably the more common name for this method.  Its searching the path for one of the lookFor arguments.
