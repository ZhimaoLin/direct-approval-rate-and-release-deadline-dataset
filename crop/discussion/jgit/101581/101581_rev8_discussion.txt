@Douglas Trujillo @Elise xxx@xxx.xxx Orozco Can anybody review this?
I thought the state bureaucracy was the top of the slowest administration in the world but now I think I found a better candidate.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> this pollutes the current directory with test data, when running this test from Eclipse or Maven this trash ends up in org.eclipse.jgit.test

Line:237, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> silence non-externalized String warning in Eclipse by appending  //$NON-NLS-1$ after the semicolon

the same fix is needed in org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Clone line 103

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> What do you recommend to do? I see only the solution of removing the test.

Line:237, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Why do we need this on Clone L103: `localName = uri.getHumanishName();` ?

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Maybe it's time for a white-box unit test that doesn't actually clone but that just verifies that the directory gets set as expected.

Something like this:

* add a package visibility method getDirectory() to CloneCommand.

* make verifyDirectories(URIish uri) have package visibility instead of private.

Do the test as

  CloneCommand command = Git.cloneRepository();
  command.setURI(fileUri());
  command.verifyDirectories(new URIish(fileUri());
  File directory = command.getDirectory();
  // Then assert that 'directory' is as expected

This exploits knowledge about the implementation of CloneCommand.call(): it does a verifyDirectories(...) first, after which the directory should be set. But it doesn't actually create anything in the file system.

Caveat: it's just an idea; I didn't actually try this.

Otherwise, if you really want to test that CloneCommand.call() does the right thing overall, you'd have to run the test in a separate process, which requires quite a bit of setup (separate test class with main method, then calling it with the correct class path and the correct initial directory, somehow getting the result, then doing an appropriate assertion here).

Also, there should be two tests: one with setBare(true) and one without. For a bare repo, I think directory should be ".../<reponame>.git", for a non-bare repo it should be ".../<reponame>".

Line:237, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Because it'll call setDirectory on line 122, and we'll eventually end up in InitCommand line 89 with directory not having the ".git" suffix.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> I see, but `verifyDirectories` is private, should I do reflection to access it?

Line:237, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> Ok I see

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> No, don't use reflection. I _did_ write above "make verifyDirectories(URIish uri) have package visibility instead of private", didn't I?
