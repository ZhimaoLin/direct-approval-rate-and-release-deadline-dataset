Line:26, .eclipse_iplog -> This delta was already applied by me earlier today.  Update your working copy.

Line:38, .eclipse_iplog -> I chose not to include this in our IP log since we aren't actually using it yet.  We're still waiting on the IP team to approve the use before we start to code against it.

This is the draft for 0.8 (not tagged yet hence not final).
I will send the corresponding generated iplog to the mailing list.

Unfortunately running the jgit-cli command eclipse-ipzilla on the egit project currently fails with a parsing error (created Bug 314964 for that).

I am too tired to look into that now, I first need some sleep ...
