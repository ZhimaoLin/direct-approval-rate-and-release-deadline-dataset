Patch Set 1:

Markus, sounds interesting. I havent had chance to review this, but I will do this next week.
Until then:
1 Have you tried if all existing ignore tests work with this patch?
2 Could you please add a new test example to existing test (there is a huge one) which will show the current bug and proof of the fix.

Patch Set 1:

Most likely the change should be done like this:

if (dirOnly && !assumeDirectory)
    // Directory expectations not met
    return false;

But I have to understand why we don't have any test failure due the change. Either tests are not sufficient or there is    a bug in the tests itself.

Patch Set 1:

OK, tests were not sufficient, because there were no tests for wildcards together with trailing slash.

IgnoreMatcherTest.testTrailingSlash must be improved to cover this case too.

*/bin/
**/bin/
[a-b]/bin/
rules must be added to the test.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Not that the existing tests were not sufficient, they were also not testing the code with *real* arguments (paths are passed by without trailing slashes in real code but with slashes in the test code!)...

I've created another review request with fixed code AND fixed tests, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/38202

There is also explanation what was wrong...

Markus, you can "abandon" this review now ("abandon change" button below patch set), many thanks for spotting this subtle problem.
