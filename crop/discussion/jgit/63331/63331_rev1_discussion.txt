[--mixed] [--soft]
 name        : Reset current HEAD to the specified state
 [...]

to this:

jgit reset [commit-ish] [path ... ...] [-- path ... ...] [--hard]

Patch Set 1:

This is definitly an improvement, so +1 from me.

But the help message is for me still misleading. For me the whole idea of '--' is  to express that after '--' no further options will follow. Only arguments. If you have a file named '-h' and you want a "git reset" on the path "-h" then you can say  'git reset -- -h' and git will not interprete -h as the an option. But our help tells something different. It can be interpreted in a way that "jgit reset HEAD -- a.java --hard" would be a hard reset, which is wrong. It should be a default reset on the pathes "a.java" and "--hard". Funnily JGit interpretes it correctly (--hard is seen as a path but not as an option) but the help message doesn't clarify that. Andrey, do you know about a way to force the "[-- path ... ...]" comes at the end of the text?

I'm working on the patch. This is a bit tricky but it seems to work in debugger. I will push it today.
