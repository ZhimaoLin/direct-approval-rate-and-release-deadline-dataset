that isn't compatible with our needs.

Chris, can you double check these specifications?  Is this sane?

Looks fine. I noticed that we're scoping 0.6.0 to 0.7.0 which may be a bit too aggressive. Since we're still kind of incubating and not at 1.0.0 yet, this is fine. When we hit 1.0.0, we should scope 1.0.0-2.0.0

Yup.   My opinion is, we're not freezing any APIs until we release 1.0.0.  Until then we may rip up APIs during a 0.x to 0.(x+1) release, so we should scope that way, and anyone linking to us should assume that same risk.

Part of the problem I have though is the foundation encourages a 2 year commitment to supporting published APIs.  I really don't want to make a 2 year commitment to supporting some of the crap we still have in the library...
