DESCRIPTION

More helpful InvalidPathException messages (include reason)

Instead of just a generic "Invalid path: $path", add a reason for the
cases where it's not obvious what the problem is (e.g. "aux" being
reserved on Windows).

Just a minor comment.

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> There are only two, so we could be more clear here since " " is somewhat strange looking.

E.g Invalid path (space and period at end is ignored by Windows): {1}

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> You're right. We could split it into two, so that it's even clearer (and because the space at the end of the path is not easily visible). Second patch set coming up.
