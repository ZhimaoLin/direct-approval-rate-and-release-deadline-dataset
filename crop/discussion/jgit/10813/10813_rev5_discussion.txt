DESCRIPTION

LogCommand.all(), peel references before using them

Problem:
LogCommand.all() throws an IncorrectObjectTypeException when
there are tag references, and the repository does not contain
the file "packed-refs". It seems that the references were not properly
peeled before being added to the markStart() method.

Solution:
Call getRepository().peel() on every Ref that has isPeeled()==false
in LogCommand.all() .

Added test case for LogCommand.all() on repo with a tag.
