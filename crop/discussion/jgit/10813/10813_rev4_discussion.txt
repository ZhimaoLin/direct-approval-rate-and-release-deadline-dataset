DESCRIPTION

LogCommand.all(), peel references before using them

Problem:
LogCommand.all() throws an IncorrectObjectTypeException when
there are tag references, and the repository does not contain
the file "packed-refs". It seems that the references were not properly
peeled before being added to the markStart() method.

Solution:
Call getRepository().peel() on every Ref that has isPeeled()==false
in LogCommand.all() .

Added test case for LogCommand.all() on repo with a tag.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommandTest.java -> What happens if the tag points to a tree or a blob?

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommandTest.java -> That is impossible in this code, because the tag is created to point to a commit in line 104.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommandTest.java -> My point: There is no test case for that. A tag can reference any object type, not just commits, so a fix should take care of that.
