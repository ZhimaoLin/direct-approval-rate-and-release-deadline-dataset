DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Skip RemoteReader when encountering a full SHA-1

There is no point in calling back to the RemoteReader to resolve a
40-digit hex SHA-1 to itself.  We already skip that call when not
ignoring remote failures; skip it when ignoring remote failures, too.

This should simplify RemoteReader implementations.

I thought about doing this too, but was worried I'd have to write a test.

The current test setup for RepoCommand makes writing a test less straightforward than I'd like. I may write one later today anyway if I find time for it.
