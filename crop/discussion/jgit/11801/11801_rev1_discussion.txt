DESCRIPTION

Micro-optimize DeltaWindow maxMemory test to be != 0

Instead of using a compare-with-0 use a does not equal 0.
javac bytecode has a special instruction for this, as it
is very common in software. We can assume the JIT knows
how to efficiently translate the opcode to machine code,
and processors can do != 0 very quickly.
