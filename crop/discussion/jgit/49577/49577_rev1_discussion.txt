DESCRIPTION

Allow lookup of multiple exact refs in one shot

exactRef(ref1, ref2, ref3) requests multiple specific refs in a single
lookup, which may be faster in some backends than looking them up one by
one.

firstExactRef generalizes getRef by finding the first existing ref from
the list of refs named.  Its main purpose is for the default
implementation of getRef (finding the first existing ref in a search
path).  Hopefully it can be useful for other operations that look for
refs in a search path (e.g., git log --notes=<name>), too.
