DESCRIPTION

Fix adding files in a network share

We cannot always rename read-only files on network shares,
so rename the temp file for a new loose object first, and
then rename it.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> "rename the temp file ... and then rename it" - there is a typo here, or? Shouldn't it be called: rename the temp file ... and the set it readonly?
