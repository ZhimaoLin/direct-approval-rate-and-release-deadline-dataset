Patch Set 1:

With this patch I've fixed matching of .gitattributes :

a/b/* should match a/b/c but not a/b/c/d
a/b? should match a/bc but not a/bc/d

I'm aware of failing .gitignore tests, I'm using this patch as a beginning of a dialog.

In .gitattributes the attributes are applied if the path matches the pattern.
In .gitignore the path is ignored if the path *or any of its parents* matches the pattern.

Instead currently the same code is used to match sometimes path only, sometimes path and parents, so the current behaviour is a mix of both behaviours that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.

What I would propose is to introduce boolean matchAnyParent parameter/option to PathMatcher and set it to true for ignores and false for attributes and use it inside PathMatcher.iterate().
