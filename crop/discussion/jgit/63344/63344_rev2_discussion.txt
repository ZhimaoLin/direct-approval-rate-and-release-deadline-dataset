DESCRIPTION

Sort "eager" path-like options to the end of the help

The "--" path option (and all other similar options consuming all
remaining arguments) should be placed at the end of the command line
help.

Currently jgit reset -h shows this:

jgit reset [commit-ish] [path ... ...] [-- path ... ...] [--hard]
[--help (-h)] [--mixed] [--soft]

After the patch the help shows this:

jgit reset [commit-ish] [path ... ...] [--hard] [--help (-h)] [--mixed]
[--soft] [-- path ... ...]
