Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> s/RevTag/FetchResult/ and s/tag/fetch/

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> Style-nit: Trailing whitespace.

FWIW, this is caused by setting Eclipse to format automatically during save.  The formatter seems to run sometimes after the remove trailing whitespace stuff, which causes the two to fight over how this line should be formatted.  Its been driving me crazy since you configured Eclipse to format modified lines on save.
