Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Minor nits.  I think the core FetchCommand is ready.

Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/Git.java -> Style-nit: Trailing whitespace.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommandTest.java -> Don't just assertNotNull here.  You have the proper commit and tag objects above (well, you threw away the tag).  Assert that the values read from db are equal to the values you created in db2.  That covers both the not-null did-it-create and also the did it copy as expected tests in one statement.
