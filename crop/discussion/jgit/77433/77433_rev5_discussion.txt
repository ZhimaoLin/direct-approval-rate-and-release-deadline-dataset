DESCRIPTION

Clarify the semantics of DfsRefDatabase#compareAndPut

DfsRefDatabase#compareAndPut had a vague semantics for reference
matching. Because of this, an operation to make a symbolic
reference had been broken for some DFS implementations even if they
followed the contract of compareAndPut. The clarified semantics
requires the implementations to satisfy the followings:

* Matching references should be both symbolic references or both
  object ID references.
* If both are symbolic references, both should have the same target
  name.
* If both are object ID references, both should have the same object
  ID.

This semantics is defined based on
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77416/. Before this commit,
DfsRefDatabase couldn't see the target of symbolic references.

InMemoryRepository is changed to comply with the new semantics. This
semantics change can affect the existing DFS implementations that only
checks object IDs. This commit adds two tests that the previous
InMemoryRepository couldn't pass.
