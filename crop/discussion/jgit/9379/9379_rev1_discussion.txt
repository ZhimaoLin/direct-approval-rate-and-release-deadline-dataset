DESCRIPTION

RFC Add symlink support to JGit

The change includes comparing symbolic links between disk and index,
adding symbolic links to the index, creating/modifying links on
checkout. The behavior is controlled by the core.symlinks setting, just
as C Git does. When a new repository is created core.symlinks will be
set depending on the capabilities of the operating system and Java
runtime.

If core.symlinks is set to true, the assumption is that
symlinks are supported, which may result in runtime errors if this
turs out not to be the case.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

One of the issues is to verify that the automatic
detection always works. For that reason the text "Found Java7" or "Java7 not found" is printed in the version. 

The launch configuration could not make use of the OSGi manifest, so I added the Java7 bundle as a project instead. Maybe someone can figure it out. I tried to make the code
compilable using three versions of Java. Set -Dskip.java7=true to build with Java 6, which skips the
support for symbolic links.

Dynamic loading of Java7 support assumes  theJava7 class format is used for the Java7 support bundle.
