DESCRIPTION

RFC Add symlink support to JGit

The change includes comparing symbolic links between disk and index,
adding symbolic links to the index, creating/modifying links on
checkout. The behavior is controlled by the core.symlinks setting, just
as C Git does. When a new repository is created core.symlinks will be
set depending on the capabilities of the operating system and Java
runtime.

If core.symlinks is set to true, the assumption is that
symlinks are supported, which may result in runtime errors if this
turs out not to be the case.

Patch Set 13:

There is a small ~10% cost to symlink support, that I assume
comes from File.toPath().

Some timing info for jgit status

With Java 6 (No symlink support) real	0m2.235s

With Java 7 (Symlink support real)	0m2.424s
