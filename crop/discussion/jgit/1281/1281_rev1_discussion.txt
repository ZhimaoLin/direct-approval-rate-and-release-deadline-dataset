Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Please use our ListenerList instead.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> If subclasses are supposed to override this, maybe a method whose default implementation returns true is better.  Then the subclass can override with false if it doesn't want to do this, and we're not declaring a field.

Line:492, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> This is better named fireConfigChangedEvent().

Line:1357, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> This should be our existing ConfigChangedListener.
