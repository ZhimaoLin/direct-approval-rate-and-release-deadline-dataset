Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/events/ConfigChangeEventTest.java -> Missing EDL copyright header.

Line:7, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/events/ConfigChangeEventTest.java -> s/testChangeEventsOnlyOnSave/testFileRepository_ChangeEventsOnlyOnSave/

Line:18, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/events/ConfigChangeEventTest.java -> Style-nit: I would put a blank line between the various "sections" of this test, just to make it easier to visually see "oh, this is the setup, the run, and the verify.  and here's the next setup, run, verify."

Line:154, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Style-nit: Unnecessary blank line.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> IMHO this is pointless to remove.  There's no resource leakage resulting from not removing the forwarding handle from the config listener list.  Just drop the field and don't worry about deregistering.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Well, if I do configChangeListenerHandle = null, I'll have to remove the final from the field, and then I get a compiler error saying that the field is never read. If I do nothing here, I still get the compiler warning (even if the final is there)... But I will have to keep a reference of the handle, right?

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> No.  Right now a listener stays registered even if you don't hang onto the ListenerHandle.  You only need the handle if you want to later remove the listener.

My point here is, we don't ever need to worry about removing the listener.  The FileRepository always wants to know when the Config changes.  So it should just keep the listener registered so long as it itself exists in the JVM.  There's no danger of a cycle or anything, the GC will correctly release everything.
