DESCRIPTION

Fix insertion of big files (>tempBufSize)

Currently, if a file with size >= tempBufSize is inserted, a zero sized
buffer is created, which then is also used during temp file creation.
This leads to zero byte reads from the stream, which in turn makes the
add.call() fail.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> Perhaps a reasonable fix, but this whole buffer(long) method should be torn out.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> if you tell me what to do .... maybe i can give it a try :)

in the meantime, maybe we should still get this fix in, as otherwise processing of large files is simply not possible.
