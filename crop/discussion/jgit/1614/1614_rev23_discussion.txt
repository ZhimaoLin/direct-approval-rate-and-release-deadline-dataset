DESCRIPTION

Add basic support for attributes

Core classes to parse and process .gitattributes files including
support for reading attributes in WorkingTreeIterator and the
dirCacheIterator.

The implementation follows the git ignore implementation. It supports
lazy reading attributes while walking the working tree.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Aside: Doesn't seem like a very collision-resistant hash: could cover as little as 1.5% of some text files (64/4096), but perhaps that's a speed-tradeoff for large files?

However given the pre-existing possible flaws in the algorithm, the CRLF fix looks like it should work OK (As the read-stride is 4k, but the scan-length is up-to 64 bytes within that + 1 for CRLF check).
