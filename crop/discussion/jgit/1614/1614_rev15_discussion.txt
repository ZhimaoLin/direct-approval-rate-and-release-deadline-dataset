Add basic support for attributes.

Core classes to parse and process .gitattributes files including
support for reading attributes in WorkingTreeIterator and the
dirCacheIterator.

The implementation follows the git ignore implementation. It supports
lazy reading attributes while walking the working tree.

Patch Set 15:

Andrey, I'm doing the change right now. I did not want to make the change in the same review since a rebased was required (it easier for you to follow my modification this way I guess). It's taking me some time since I do not really know this part of the code. I have inherited it from the work of Marc. I have just changed the implementation using your PathMatcher and all the test are still green. I want to test it a bit more but I think I will push the other patch set soon.

Sorry I thought I had published my comments in the same time I have pushed the patch set. My mistake.
