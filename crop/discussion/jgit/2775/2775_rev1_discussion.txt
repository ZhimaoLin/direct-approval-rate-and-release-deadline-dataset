DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Collect stats by object type

Frequently enough I'm wondering how much of a pack is commits vs.
trees, and the total line doesn't really tell us this because its
a gross total from the pack. Computing the counts per object type
is simple during packing, as PackWriter already has everything in
memory broken up by object type.  Its virtually free to get these
values and track them.
