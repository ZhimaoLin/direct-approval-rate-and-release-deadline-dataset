DESCRIPTION

[ignore rules] fix for handling unmatched '[' brackets

This patch makes JGit parsing of ignore rules containing unmatched '['
bracket compatible to the Git CLI.

Since '[' starts character group, Git tries to parse the ignore rule as
a shell glob pattern and if the character group is not closed, the glob
pattern is invalid and so the ignore rule never matches anything.

Matthias, can you please check the last patch set: I've added the patterns you've reported as an extra test but as you can see they do not fail. Any idea why?

I don't understand this discrepancy. As these cases are pretty academic I lean towards submitting this patch as it surely improves compliance with cgit's behavior. What do you think ?
