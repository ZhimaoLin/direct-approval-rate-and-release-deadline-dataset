DESCRIPTION

[ignore rules] fix for handling unmatched '[' brackets

This patch makes JGit parsing of ignore rules containing unmatched '['
bracket compatible to the Git CLI.

Since '[' starts character group, Git tries to parse the ignore rule as
a shell glob pattern and if the character group is not closed, the glob
pattern is invalid and so the ignore rule never matches anything.
