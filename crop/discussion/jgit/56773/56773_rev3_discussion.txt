Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

First answer I've got on http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/278699 is a hint that ] is not a special character by itself in a glob.

So given this, the inconsistency in git can be explained by the assumption that git stops to parse the rule on a broken character group and simply don't match anymore.

I will change the code accordingly and post updated fix later.
