DESCRIPTION

Fix PlotCommitList to set lanes on child-less commits

In PlotCommitList.enter() commits are positioned on lanes for visual
presentation. This implementation was buggy: commits without
children (often the starting points for the RevWalk) are not positioned
on separate lanes.

The problem was that when handling commits with multiple children (thats
where branches fork out) it was not handled that some of the children
may not have been positioned on a lane yet. I fixed that and added a number
of tests which specifically test the layout of commits on lanes.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I fixed some bugs for layouting complicated histories. Now I am quite happy with it. We have good tests, I tried it with linux and git-git histories and at least it doesn't show wrong topologies.
When looking at big, complicated repos (like linux) our history is using substantially more lanes than e.g. gitk. There are some tricks in gitk which don't have in yet - but at least the display is correct now.
