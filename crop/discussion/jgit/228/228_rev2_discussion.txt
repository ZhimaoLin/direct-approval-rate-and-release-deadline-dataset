DESCRIPTION

Added caching for loose object lookup during pack indexing

On Windows systems, file system lookup is a slow operation, so
checking each object if it exists during indexing (after receiving
the pack) could take a siginificant time. This patch introduces
CachedObjectDirectory that pre-caches lookup results.
