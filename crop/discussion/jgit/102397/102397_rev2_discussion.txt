DESCRIPTION

ReflogWriter: Align auto-creation defaults with C git

Per git-config(1), core.logAllRefUpdates auto-creates reflogs for HEAD
and for refs under heads, notes, tags, and for HEAD. Add notes and
remove stash from ReflogWriter#shouldAutoCreateLog. Explicitly force
writing reflogs for refs/stash at call sites, now that this is
supported.

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ReflogWriter.java -> After fixing a bunch more tests that broke because of this, I'm not 100% sure this is the right thing to do. More like 90%.

On the one hand, the documentation of core.refLogUpdates clearly does not mention refs/stash. And "git update-ref refs/stash $sha" in a non-bare repo definitely does not write the reflog, whereas "git update-ref refs/heads/foo $sha" does.

On the other hand, it's hard to imagine a use case where you are using the JGit RefUpdate API to update refs/stash and you do *not* want to update the reflog, so it sorta makes sense to have the default behavior be to write the reflog.

On the other other hand, you really should probably not be using RefUpdate directly if you want to manipulate the stash; there should be some higher-level API in JGit that does this. (Just like in C git, you should not be using "git update-ref" to interact with the stash, you should use "git stash".) And indeed there are the Stash*Command APIs.

So like I said, I think this is right, but not 100% sure.
