DESCRIPTION

ReflogWriter: Align auto-creation defaults with C git

Per git-config(1), core.logAllRefUpdates auto-creates reflogs for HEAD
and for refs under heads, notes, tags, and for HEAD. Add notes and
remove stash from ReflogWriter#shouldAutoCreateLog. Explicitly force
writing reflogs for refs/stash at call sites, now that this is
supported.
