DESCRIPTION

Fix MissingObjectException race in ObjectDirectory

Johannes Carlsson identified a race condition[1] that can lead to
spurious MissingObjectExceptions at read time. If two threads are
active inside of ObjectDirectory looking for a packed object and the
packList is currently the empty NO_PACKS list, thread A will find
no object and eventually consider tryAgain1(). If thread A is put
to sleep and this point and thread B also does not find the object,
loads the packs, when thread A wakes up its tryAgain1 would return
false and the thread never considers the packs.

Rework the internal API of ObjectDirectory to keep a handle on the
exact PackList that was iterated by thread A, allowing it to always
retry walking through the packs if the new PackList is different.

This had some ripple effect into the CachedObjectDirectory and
the shared FileObjectDatabase interface. The new code should be
slightly easier to follow, especially from the perspective of the
CachedObjectDirectory trying to minimize the number of open system
calls it makes to files matching "$GIT_DIR/objects/??/?x{38}".
