DESCRIPTION

fix PackWriter excluded objects handling

PackWriter supports excluding objects from being written to the pack.
You may specify a PackIndex which lists all those objects which should
not go into the new pack. This feature was broken because not all
commits have been checked whether they should be excluded or not. For
other object types the exclude algorithm worked. This commit adds the
missing check.
