DESCRIPTION

Switch from Tycho based build to Apache Felix's maven-bundle-plugin

JUnit tests fail under Tycho's manifest-first build, because I
don't know why.

Rather than maintain OSGi bundle data by hand, use the same plugin
that Jetty is using to produce their OSGi bundles.

We're still compatible-enough with Eclipse to allow importing these
projects using the m2eclipse plugin as standard Maven projects, but
the PDE will think they are vaild plugins and make them available
for plugin builds, or test executions in the workbench.

A nice side-effect is we can continue to run with Maven 2.x, and
not require the 3.0 alpha builds needed to run Tycho.

A not-so-nice side-effect is our JSch dependency version number
is not embedded correctly into the bundle's MANIFEST.MF, which
means we could pick up any random version of JSch from our runtime
environment.  That's not the most stable way to execute.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score

This is an alternative to I5828502ff12bbcecfe50036e681ca2fba1e099ef, which tried to convert the entire build process to use manifest-first definitions through Tycho.
