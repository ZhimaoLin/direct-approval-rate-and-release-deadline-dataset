DESCRIPTION

Switch build to Apache Felix maven-bundle-plugin

Rather than maintain OSGi bundle data by hand, use the same plugin
that Jetty is using to produce their OSGi bundles.  We get fully
automatic MANIFEST.MF files based on reasonably sane default rules,
which reduces the amount of things we have to maintain in them.

Our output build is fully compatible with Maven 2.x, so any
downstream consumers are still able to use our build products,
without stepping up to Maven 3.0-a5 right now.

We're still compatible with Eclipse, allowing these projects to be
imported using the m2eclipse plugin as standard Maven projects, but
the PDE will think they are vaild plugins and make them available
for plugin builds, or test executions in the workbench.

By default the build process still requires Maven 3 and Tycho 0.6
to create the Eclipse feature and P2 update site.  These can be
optionally disabled by adding `-Djgit.p2.skip=true` to the build
command line, allowing the build to run with only Maven 2.x.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I'm really happy with this build now.  Most of the ugly bits of OSGi compliance seem to be taken care of automatically by maven-bundle-plugin.  We do have to use some special magic to ensure the JUnit version number gets embedded, but this isn't too difficult and is a lot easier than manging the MANIFEST.MF files completely by hand.

Unless somebody complains, I want to switch our build to what we have here in patch set 2.
