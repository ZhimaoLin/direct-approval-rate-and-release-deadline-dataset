DESCRIPTION

a note of this in gc.log.  This will block automatic GC runs for the
next (by default) one day.

Line:225, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Actually, I'm totally confused about how this gerrit revision exists in the first place.  I had been working on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/90675 and I added another commit and re-pushed.  I understand that I screwed up by not editing the change-id item.  But the commit I added wasn't this one.  Anyway, I'm going to close this one and try to make 90675 update.

Restored

Oh, wait, it's supposed to be multiple review, one per commit. Still not sure why this one is wrong tho.
