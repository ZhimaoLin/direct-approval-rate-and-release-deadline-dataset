DESCRIPTION

Let FS_Win32_Cygwin detect symlink support by creating temporary symlink

The class FS_Win32 was always trying out to create a temporary symlink
in order to find out whether symlinks are supported. FS_Win32_Cygwin was
overwriting this method and always returned true. But when the user
running JGit does not have administrative rights then the creation of
symlinks is forbidden even he is  running on FS_Win32_Cygwin. A lot of
tests failed only on the Windows platform because of this. It was
detected that FS_Win32_Cygwin the correct Filesystemabstraction but
creation of symlinks always failed because of lacking privileges of the
user running the tests.
This fix tells FS_Win32_Cygwin to behave like FS_Win32 and to try out
whether symlinks can be created in order to find out whether symlinks
are supported.
