DESCRIPTION

Add status command to GIT api

Allow users of the GIT api to get to know the state of their
workingtree and index by adding a status command. The implementation
is mainly a wrapper around IndexDiff class. Better support for multiple
stages in the index (conflict situations) is still missing. An
appropriate change to IndexDiff and StatusCommand will come in a
subsequent commit.
