DESCRIPTION

Merge FileTreeIteratorJava7Test into FileTreeIteratorTest

JGit now requires Java 8, so it is no longer necessary to have a
separate class for Java 7 specific tests. Remove it and merge its
tests into the existing FileTreeIteratorTest.

FileTreeIteratorTest has xxx@xxx.xxx annotated method that sets up
some files in the git, which breaks the tests which have assumptions
on the file names. Add adjustments.
