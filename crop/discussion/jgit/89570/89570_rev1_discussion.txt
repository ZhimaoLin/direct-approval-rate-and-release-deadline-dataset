DESCRIPTION

Merge FileTreeIteratorJava7Test into FileTreeIteratorTest

JGit now requires Java 8, so it is no longer necessary to have a
separate class for Java 7 specific tests. Remove it and merge its
tests into the existing FileTreeIteratorTest.

FileTreeIteratorTest has xxx@xxx.xxx annotated method that sets up
some files in the git, which breaks the tests which have assumptions
on the file names. Add adjustments.

Line:669, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> This was added here, and in the subsequent tests, to ensure that we're looking at the correct file.  In the other class there was xxx@xxx.xxx method creating other content.

There are ways to prevent xxx@xxx.xxx method from running (aside from just leaving the tests in a separate class) as described here [1] but I thought that might just add unnecessary complexity.
