DESCRIPTION

Add "aggressive" option to GC

JGit should offer the possibility to do a garbage collection in
"aggressive" mode. In this mode garbage collection more aggressively
optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time.
Technically a aggressive mode garbage collection differs from a
non-aggressive one by:
- not reusing packed objects found in old packs. Recompress every object
- the configuration pack.window is set to 250 (the default is 10)
- the configuration pack.depths is set to 250 (the default is 50)

The associated classes in org.eclipse.jgit.api and the command line
command in org.eclipse.jgit.pgm expose this new option.

The configuration parameters gc.aggressiveDepth and gc.aggressiveWindow
have been introduced to configure this feature.

I think we should allow to pass a PackConfig to specify the configuration of GC in order to allow fine-tuning. In addition you could provide a pre-defined PackConfig matching the --aggressive option in native git.

Line:989, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> missing since tag for new API

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> can we use the standard pack config option names instead ?

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: trailing whitespace

Moving the knowledge about what --aggressive means to upper layers is a good idea. Done. GC takes PackConfig and GarbageCollectCommand knows about --aggressive.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> that's why I named them like that - that are the standard names. See http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can't fix it. In my commit message locally there is no whitespace here.
