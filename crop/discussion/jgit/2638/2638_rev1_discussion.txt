DESCRIPTION

resolve(): Fix wrong parsing of branch "foo-gbed2-dev"

When parsing a string such as "foo-gbed2" resolve() was assuming the
suffix was from git describe output.  This lead to JGit trying to find
the completion for the object abbreviation "bed2", rather than using
the current value of the reference.  If there was only one such object
in the repository, JGit might actually use the wrong value here, as
resolve() would return the completion of the abbreviation "bed2"
rather than the current value of the reference "refs/heads/foo-gbed2".

Move the parsing of git describe abbreviations out of the operator
portion of the resolve() method and into the simple portion that is
supposed to handle only object ids or reference names, and only do the
describe parsing after all other approaches have already failed to
provide a resolution.

Add new unit tests to verify the behavior is as expected by users.
