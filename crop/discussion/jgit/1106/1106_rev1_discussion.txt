DESCRIPTION

Configure core.bigFileThreshold into PackWriter

C Git's fast-import uses this to determine the maximum file size
that it tries to delta compress, anything equal to or above this
setting is stored with as a whole object with simple deflate.

Define the configuration so we can use it later.
