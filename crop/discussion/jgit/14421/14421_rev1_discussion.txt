DESCRIPTION

DirCacheCheckout: Don't try to delete parent of working directory

In the first iteration of the remove loop, removeEmptyParents could be
called with last == "". This resulted in removeEmptyParents trying to
delete parent directories of the working directory, which normally would
not succeed (because non-empty directories can not be deleted). But when
the working directory is inside a symlink, that symlink would be
deleted.

Fix this by making sure that there is no deletion in the first
iteration.

Reported by Ondrej Vrabec.

I think that is a duplicate of my change 4935 (more than One Year Old). Have you looked at that Change? Maybe you could vote on my Old change.
