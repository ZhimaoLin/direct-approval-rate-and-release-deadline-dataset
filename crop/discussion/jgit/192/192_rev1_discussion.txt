DESCRIPTION

improved basic authentication

instead of doing
   Authenticator.setDefault (authinstance);
now I use 
  urlConnection.setRequestProperty ("Authorization", "Basic " + base64(user + ":" + pass));

this to avoid to alter the default behavior of urlconnections

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> That's better than the prior patch.  You should squash these two together into a single commit.

Also, I think you can avoid using the toPrivateString() method on URIish when you do that and instead get the password data directly from the URIish.  This reduces the chances that we'll publish the password as part of an error messages when things fail.
