DESCRIPTION

RevWalk: Avoid unnecessary re-parsing of commit bodies

If the RevFilter doesn't actually require the commit body,
we shouldn't reparse it if the body was disposed.  This happens
often inside of UploadPack during common ancestor negotation, the
RevWalk is reset and re-run over roughly the same commit space,
but the bodies are discarded because the commit message is not
relevant to the process.
