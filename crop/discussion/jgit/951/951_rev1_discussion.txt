DESCRIPTION

Rename Repository 'config' as 'repoConfig'

This better matches with the other configuration variable,
'userConfig', and helps to make it clear what config object
we are dealing with.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Would seem to be independent of other changes if you wanted to push earlier
