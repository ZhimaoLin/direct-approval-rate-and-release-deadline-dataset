DESCRIPTION

Refactor Repository.openObject to be Repository.open

We drop the "Object" suffix, because its pretty clear here that
we want to open an object, given that we pass in AnyObjectId as
the main parameter.  We also fix the calling convention to throw
a MissingObjectException or IncorrectObjectTypeException, so that
callers don't have to do this error checking themselves.
