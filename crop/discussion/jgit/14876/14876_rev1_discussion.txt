besides three extra newlines this looks good to me.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StatusCommand.java -> Please keep the diff small and avoid adding extra newlines. I guess Eclipse was adding the extra lines for you, right?

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StatusCommand.java -> again, skip the newline here.

Please fix the issues in inline comments, then amend the commit and push again. Looks good otherwise.

Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StatusCommand.java -> Please xxx@xxx.xxx 3.1 here, which documents that this method is only available in JGit >= 3.1.
