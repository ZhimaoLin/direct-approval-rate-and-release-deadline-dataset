Patch Set 1:

Even though this change is not mandatory on 4.4 branch, I would prefer to keep it here because it align a feature with native git and it make the tests more reliable in Hudson which is sometimes failing with stackoverflow: https://hudson.eclipse.org/jgit/job/jgit.gerrit/8513/

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> if (depth > MAX_DEPTH), then we throw an exception. Should we prefer ignoring that case instead, or log some warning, while not throwing that exception anymore?

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> We can keep the exception, native Git does not silently ignore exceeded max depth.
