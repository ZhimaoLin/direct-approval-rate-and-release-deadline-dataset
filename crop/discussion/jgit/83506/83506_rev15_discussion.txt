DESCRIPTION

Add remote download to SmudgeFilter

Transfer data in chunks of 8k Transferring data byte per byte is slow,
running checkout with CleanFilter on a 2.9MB file takes 20 seconds.
Using a buffer of 8k shrinks this time to 70ms.

Also register the filter commands in a way that the native GIT LFS can
be used alongside with JGit.

Implements auto-discovery of LFS server URL when cloning from a Gerrit
LFS server.
