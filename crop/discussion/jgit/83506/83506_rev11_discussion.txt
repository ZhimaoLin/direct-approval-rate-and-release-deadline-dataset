DESCRIPTION

Add remote download to SmudgeFilter

Transfer data in chunks of 8k Transferring data byte per byte is slow,
running checkout with CleanFilter on a 2.9MB file takes 20 seconds.
Using a buffer of 8k shrinks this time to 70ms.

Also register the filter commands in a way that the native GIT LFS can
be used alongside with JGit.

Implements auto-discovery of LFS server URL when cloning from a Gerrit
LFS server.

Patch Set 11:

@Christian: could you maybe have a quick look at the test failures and tell me what could be the problem? Since I did not write most of the code, I'm pretty sure you can figure out much faster.

Also maybe you find some time to look at the diff to patchset 10. It is kind of an API breaking change, but other than this, I had no idea how to transparently register the hooks in a way that it does not interfere with CGit-LFS
