DESCRIPTION

Add remote download to SmudgeFilter

Transfer data in chunks of 8k Transferring data byte per byte is slow,
running checkout with CleanFilter on a 2.9MB file takes 20 seconds.
Using a buffer of 8k shrinks this time to 70ms.

Patch Set 9:

I rebased and tuned this change a little bit, but since I'm not a committer, I am not allowed to push a new patchset on behalf of others (Christian in this case). Is there a process how to deal with this?

I like that you take over this work. And I think it should be possible that you upload new patchsets for this change. You should make sure that you are now the committer of the commit you are trying to upload as a new patchset. Just before you upload the new commit you should do a 'git show --format=full' to see Author and Commit attribute of your commit. Am I still the committer?

On git.eclipse.org/r contributors who don't have the committer bit lack the forge author permission. So you cannot upload changes where author doesn't match your own email address registered with your Eclipse account. You can workaround this by setting the author and committer to your own identity and give credit to the original author by adding an Also-by footer:

 Also-by: Zachary Orozco xxx@xxx.xxx

Great, then let's do this. I have no problem with you resetting committer and author and mentioning me in also-by

Thanks for the info. I will prepare something. Unfortunately I rebased to "our" stable-4.8 build, so I will do it again on top of master :)
