DESCRIPTION

Introduce FileModeStrategy to FileTreeIterator

This commit introduces a FileModeStrategy to
the FileTreeIterator class.  This provides a way to
allow different modes of traversing a file tree;
for example, to control whether or not a nested
.git directory should be treated as a gitlink.

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> Eclipse is complaining that this is an API change in a minor release. From now on there is no

  FileTreeIterator(final WorkingTreeIterator p, final File root, FS fs)

anymore. You changed it to

  FileTreeIterator(final FileTreeIterator p, final File root, FS fs)

Subclasses of FileTreeIterator in other projects may be broken now. Maybe you could leave an implementation for FileTreeIterator(final WorkingTreeIterator p, final File root, FS fs) which passes a DefaultFileModeStrategy.INSTANCE

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> Ah, know I remember this line looks so familiar to me. In Renee Levy change 51483 we already talked about this line and I uploaded a fix.

Christian,

Sorry about that. I pulled these changes down from a branch on github rather than directly from the Gerrit change, so it's possible it doesn't have the most recent changes. I'll go ahead and see if I can get the latest version of those changes in here instead of what I originally pushed.
