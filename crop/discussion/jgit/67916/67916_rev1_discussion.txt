DESCRIPTION

Introduce FileModeStrategy to FileTreeIterator

This commit introduces a FileModeStrategy to
the FileTreeIterator class.  This provides a way to
allow different modes of traversing a file tree;
for example, to control whether or not a nested
.git directory should be treated as a gitlink.

Line:543, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> missing braces

Line:566, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> use writeTrashFile to shorten this code

Line:611, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> too long lines

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> new public API should be marked xxx@xxx.xxx 4.3 to document the version the API was added

Line:242, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> style nit: missing braces, the style guide was changed a while back since then we use braces around single line blocks

Line:566, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> From what I can tell (I didn't actually author this commit, but I had to change the author to myself so I could push it to Gerrit since I'm not a committer) writeTrashFile writes into the repo stored in the db instance variable. However, createNestedRepo creates and returns its own repo to have greater control over what goes into it, and the tests that exercise that function use that repo instead of db, so writeTrashFile will end up writing into the wrong place.

for this case you can use JGitTestUtil.writeTrashFile() which allows to specify the repository

Line:566, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorTest.java -> I can definitely go ahead and refactor this though to use db instead of creating its own repo.

Oh, sorry, I totally missed this comment. I'll go ahead and use JGitTestUtil.writeTrashFile().
