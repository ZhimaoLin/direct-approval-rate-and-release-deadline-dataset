DESCRIPTION

Remove ambiguous CheckoutConflictException

Checkout command should throw o.e.j.api.errors.CheckoutConflictException
which is a GitAPIException not o.e.j.errors.CheckoutConflictException.
PullCommand should rethrow the API exception as a JGitInternalException.

The change is technically ok for me. It only has to be decided if we want a incompatible API change now or if we have to put it on hold for 2.0. I vote for 2.0 - so we don't break the jgit-users build inbetween minor releases.

Patch Set 6:

We plan to release 1.3 on Wednesday, next planned release is then 2.0 for Juno, so I will switch the master branch to 2.0-SNAPSHOT after 1.3 is out.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved

now, since our next release is 2.0, we can cleanup the API.
