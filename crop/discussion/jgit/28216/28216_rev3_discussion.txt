Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RepoTest.java -> Maybe this could say fetch=\" + defaultDb.getWorkTree().getName() + \". Except that has a hidden assumption about File.createTempFile not using any special characters. Is there an easy way to escape a filename for xml?

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RepoTest.java -> specify defaultUri to fetch will work for the single project cases, but won't work for multiple projects cases, so I'm not very sure why should we do that.

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RepoTest.java -> Yeah, my suggestion was probably half-baked. More precisely, my thought is

The normal use case is that --base-uri represents that URL for the repository that contained the manifest.

fetch="." in a manifest means that paths are relative to the parent directory to the repository.

I was thinking that we wanted paths relative to the manifest repo instead, which would be fetch="$(basename manifestrepo)". But now that I look more closely, I think the base-uri here was pointing to a common parent to all the subprojects, so my suggestion didn't make a lot of sense.

I think you made the right change. Thinking now about how to rephrase the comment to save the next reader from having to think this through again.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RepoTest.java -> How about something like

  // Pretend the manifest came from an immediate subdirectory
  // of rootUri so relative URLs resolve correctly.
  rootUri = defaultUri.substring(0, start) + "manifest";

? Otherwise it sounds like stripping the trailing / is a bug that this test is working around.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RepoTest.java -> This doesn't feel technically right. Yes in this case (File.createTempFile) the manifest comes from an immediate subdirectory of rootUri, but that's not the cause.
Maybe just change "deadbeef" to "manifest" and removing the comments to avoid confusing people?
