DESCRIPTION

Allow inaccessible user configurations under $HOME

Treat user configuration files that are inaccessible due to permissions
as though no user configuration was provided at all. This does not change
behavior when /etc/gitconfig or .git/config is unreadable, nor when
user configurations under $HOME are unreadable for problems other than
permissions.

See git.git commit 4698c8feb1bb
(config: allow inaccessible configuration under $HOME, 2013-04-12)
for a detailed explanation of the reasons behind the change

Line:1216, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> how is this related to ignoring non-accessiblility of ~/.gitconfig ?

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/SystemReader.java -> we should log a warning here so that users who have wrong permissions on ~/.gitconfig by mistake have a chance to detect the problem
