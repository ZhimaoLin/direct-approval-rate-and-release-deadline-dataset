Add compatibility filters to hide the breakage.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

I assume this is from making the archive formats "final", which IIUC doesn't break binary compatibility as long as no one tried to 'extend' them: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.4.2

Suppressing the warning seems sane, but cc-ing Shawn just in case.
