DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Fix want-is-satisfied test

okToGiveUpImp() has been missing a ! for a long time.  This loop over
wantAll() is looking for an object where wantSatisfied() returns
false, because there is no common merge base present.  Unfortunately
it was missing a !, causing the loop to break and return false after
at least one want was satisified.
