Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ResetTest.java -> I would add a test with path but without the explicit '--'. Just to check that first path and commitId are not exchanged.

Have you noticed that help page is strange. I always expected that after -- only pathes are allowed. No more options after --. But our help page doesn't show this. And even the program works correctly if --hard comes after --. That may be a problem in args4j

xxx@xxx.xxx jgit reset --help

  jgit reset name [VAL ...] [-- path ... ...] [--hard] [--help (-h)] [--mixed] [--soft]
  
   name        : Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   --hard      : Resets the index and working tree
   --help (-h) : display this help text
   --mixed     : Resets the index but not the working tree
   --soft      : Resets without touching the index file nor   the working tree

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ResetTest.java -> I added the additional test.

I introduced the "-- path" argument in the same way like in the checkout command. The latter has the same issue.
