DESCRIPTION

RFC, see http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,4345

This illustrates how bug 350880 can be demonstrated. The catch is that
this test on top of the references patch set yields another error where
the old things are not deleted. This is, I think the problem in Bug 347574

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

Reorderd the change not to depend anymore on change #4345. If the commit message is updated (and maybe the testmethod is renamed) then we can accept it.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I like this change. If you would change the commit message (remove RFC, better description) we can accept it.
