DESCRIPTION

RFC, see http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,4345

This illustrates how bug 350880 can be demonstrated. The catch is that
this test on top of the references patch set yields another error where
the old things are not deleted. This is, I think the problem in Bug 347574

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> why testXXX...?  I would remove the 3 X.

Line:176, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I fully agree - if we reset hard to a commit which don't contains something for a path which was in index - then we should remove the index entry.
