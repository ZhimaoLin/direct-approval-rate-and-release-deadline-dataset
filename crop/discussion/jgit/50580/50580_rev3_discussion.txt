> I guess we need to add a maven dependency to org.eclipse.jdt.annotation

Done.

As long as it uses Maven, the library should be available at compile time, so there should be at least no compiler errors because missing annotations. NPE analysis from JDT will be available outside of Eclipse only if the "custom" build knows how to use JDT compiler. But his is same story as with API analysis, which I can see permanently broken even if the people are using Eclipse but don't have API baselines or switch them off.

Patch Set 3:

BTW I had to switch the NPE compiler *errors* to warnings on JGit project because there is some code with xxx@xxx.xxx and this works only for "warnings" level. See for example DfsPackFile.copyAsIs().
