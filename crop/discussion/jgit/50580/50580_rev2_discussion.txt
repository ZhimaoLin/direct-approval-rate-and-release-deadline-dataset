Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I guess we need to add a maven dependency to org.eclipse.jdt.annotation otherwise the compiler probably fails since it can't find the jdt annotations. The basic jgit maven build does not use Tycho hence it doesn't load dependencies defined in OSGi manifests.

This Maven artifact seems to be available on Maven central:
http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.jdt%22%20AND%20a%3A%22org.eclipse.jdt.annotation%22

What if a developer wants to work on JGit using a different IDE than Eclipse ?
