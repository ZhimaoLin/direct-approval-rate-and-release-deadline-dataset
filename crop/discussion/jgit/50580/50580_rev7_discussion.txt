Patch Set 7:

I'm a big fan xxx@xxx.xxx annotations for documentation purposes and think it would be great to get the codebase to the point where null analysis can fix and prevent bugs, but this this dependency on an org.eclipse.jdt package is strange. 

I'm pretty sure Null analysis in Eclipse can be accomplished by xxx@xxx.xxx etc. annotations in an internal JGit package and then configuring the project-specific settings to use it. Is there any reason that wouldn't work?

according to [1] this should work, though I didn't try so I am not sure about the implications
