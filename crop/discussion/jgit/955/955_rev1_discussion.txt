DESCRIPTION

Use FileRepository where we assume other file semantics

When the surrounding code is already heavily based upon the
assumption that we have a FileRepository (e.g. because it
created that type of repository) keep the type around and
use it directly.  This permits us to continue to do things
like save the configuration file.
