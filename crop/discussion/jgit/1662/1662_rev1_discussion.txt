DESCRIPTION

Define LowLevelDiffAlgorithm to bypass re-hashing

When passing to a fallback algorithm, we can avoid creating a
new copy of the hash codes for each sequence by passing in the
hashed sequences directly.  This makes it cheaper to switch from
PatienceDiff to HistogramDiff to MyersDiff in a single pass.
