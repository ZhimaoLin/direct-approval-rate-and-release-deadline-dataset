DESCRIPTION

Define LowLevelDiffAlgorithm to bypass re-hashing

When passing to a fallback algorithm, we can avoid creating a new copy
of the hash codes for each sequence by passing in the hashed sequences
directly.  This makes it cheaper to switch from HistogramDiff down to
MyersDiff in a single pass.
