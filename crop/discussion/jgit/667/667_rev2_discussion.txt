DESCRIPTION

Added MERGING_RESOLVED repository state

The repository state tells in which state the repo is and also which actions
are currently allowed. The state MERGING is telling that a commit is not
possible. But this is only true in the case of unmerged paths in the index.
When we are merging but have resolved all conflicts then we are in a special
state: We are still merging (means the next commit should have multiple
parents) but a commit is now allowed.

Since the MERGING state "canCommit()" cannot be enhanced to return true/false
based on the index state (MERGING is an enum value which does not have a
reference to the repository its state it is representing) I had to introduce a new
state MERGING_RESOLVED. This new state will report that a commit is possible.

CAUTION: there might be the chance that users of jgit previously blindly did a
plain commit (with only one parent) when the RepositoryState allowed them to
do so. With this change these users will now be confronted with a RepositoryState
which says a commit is possible but before they can commit they'll have to
check the MERGE_MESSAGE and MERGE_HEAD files and use the info from these
files.
