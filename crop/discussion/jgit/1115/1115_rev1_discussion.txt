DESCRIPTION

Honor pack.threads and perform delta search in parallel

If we have multiple CPUs available, packing usually goes faster
when each CPU is assigned a slice of the available search space.
The number of threads to use is guessed from the runtime if it
wasn't set by the caller, or wasn't set in the configuration.
