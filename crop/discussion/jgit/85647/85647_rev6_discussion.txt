DESCRIPTION

Properly set accept-encoding header for http request

1. Do not set accept-encoding header by default in httpOpen(). Instead,
take an option for that.
2. Http connection use openReader() for all uncompressed content
i.e. info/refs, info/alternates, info/http-alternates, info/packs,
../packed-refs, ../{ref}. Override this method to set to accept-encoding
header.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> nit: missing space around initializer list (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.1-enum-classes)

Since this is new API, needs a javadoc comment with xxx@xxx.xxx tag.

The name AcceptEncoding.NONE is a little confusing --- if I don't specify the Accept-Encoding header, that means the data is transferred raw, not that there is no encoding (that it is not transferred at all). Would a name like RAW make sense?

Line:335, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> nit: can break at the higher syntactic level (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.5.1-line-wrapping-where-to-break):

 HttpConnection conn =
   httpOpen(METHOD_GET, new URL(baseUrl, HEAD), AcceptEncoding.GZIP);

Line:541, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Please add some brief documentation of the new acceptEncoding parameter.

Line:543, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> This is an API change, so it needs an xxx@xxx.xxx value.

What should happen to the existing httpOpen method? Would we need to keep it for one point release as xxx@xxx.xxx and unused method or is it okay to remove it without that?

Line:556, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> nit: simpler to require that the parameter not be null:

 protected HttpConnection httpOpen(...) throws IOException {
   if (method == null || u == null || acceptEncoding == null) {
     throw new NullPointerException();
   }
   ...

Line:665, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> unnecessary 'final'

Line:666, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> likewise

Also probably worth a comment about why this uses GZIP encoding:

 // Line-oriented content is likely to compress well. Request gzip encoding.

Line:694, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> This means defaulting to no compression. Is that needed? Since WalkRemoteObjectDatabase is package-private, we know there are only internal callers, so we could update them all to pass an explicit AcceptEncoding parameter.

Alternatively, should the javadoc for open and openReader be clarified to specify that openReader should always be used for text files and open should only be used for binary, already-compressed files?

Line:694, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> 1. Do you mean change the open(String) interface to open(String, AcceptEncoding)? This will affecting other implementation, theb acceptEncoding does not make any sense in AmazonS3 and Ftp.

2. Updating the interface javadoc affect other implementations. 

This is why I use the path whitelist in the first implementation.
