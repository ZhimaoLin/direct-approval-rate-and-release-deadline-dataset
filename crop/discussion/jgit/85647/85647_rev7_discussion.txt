DESCRIPTION

Properly set accept-encoding header for http request

1. Do not set accept-encoding header by default in httpOpen(). Instead,
take an option for that.
2. Http connection use openReader() for all uncompressed content
i.e. info/refs, info/alternates, info/http-alternates, info/packs,
../packed-refs, ../{ref}. Override this method to set to accept-encoding
header.

LGTM except for the xxx@xxx.xxx tag.

The javadoc for open and openReader are misleading now --- they say they are the same except for return value, but their new implementations use different Accept-Encoding. I would prefer if the javadocs were updated to explain the difference in semantics.
