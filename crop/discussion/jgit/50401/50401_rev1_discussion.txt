Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> I'm somewhat on the fence about this behavior, since the DFS implementation creates a new pack per inserter. But I don't know if it's possible to reuse the inserter from ReceiveCommits, which is already used to parse a packfile. I will investigate tomorrow.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> Don't write the object here. Punt on it and make the caller do it.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> Easy enough. For compatibility with C git we should still do this from within receive-pack, which would be the caller in this context.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushCertificate.java -> Turns out you definitely cannot use a DfsInserter for both parsing a pack and inserting individual objects, so we can't do this within a single packfile in ReceivePack. Will just abandon this; my current plans don't really need it anyway.
