DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Implement linkfile using symlinks

Instead of copying the files, use symlinks for linkfile to match Repo.
Some scripts look up where they're actually located in order to find
related files, so they need the link back to their project.

Also externalizes the exception string to reply to the review comments
from Stefan's original change.
