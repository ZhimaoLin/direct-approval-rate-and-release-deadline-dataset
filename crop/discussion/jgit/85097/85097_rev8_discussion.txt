DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Add linkfile support.

Android wants them to work, and we're only interested in them for bare
repos, so add them just for that.

Make sure to use symlinks instead of just using the copyfile
implementation. Some scripts look up where they're actually located in
order to find related files, so they need the link back to their
project.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah, I was surprised too. Dan had had this on the back burner for a while and when I expressed interest in it he encouraged me to take it over to address any remaining peer-review feedback
