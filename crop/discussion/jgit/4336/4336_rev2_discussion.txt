Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Still an issue. The checkout command succeed now (fixed in the meantime), but the newly created branch has wrong name. At least it doesn't match with the result from native git.

I wanted to create a pgm (command-line like) test, but would need https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5764/ to be fixed first.

> thie is not a fnctional change

I hope to eventually add a fix as well... when I find some free cycles. The failing test is supposed to be a starter.
