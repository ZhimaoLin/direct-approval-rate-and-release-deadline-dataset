DESCRIPTION

Make push certificate related classes non-public in 4.0

These classes are untested and have some flaws that may require
otherwise breaking API changes to clean up. They were of extremely
limited utility in their current form, as there were no public methods
to create or populate instances containing anything other than null
values for all their fields. In particular, note that
BaseReceivePack#getPushCertificate() is not a public method.

Back this support out of 4.0; it will be revamped in 4.1.

These interfaces were all introduced in 4.0, so LGTM.

Lowering my confidence, since there is already a -r tag with these. I'll ask around to see how eclipse usually deals with that.

Patch Set 2:

Having now made the changes I want to make to PushCertificate, I _think_ I could do this in a backwards compatible (if ugly) way.

The only thing you can do with the old public interface PushCertificate and PushCertificateParser is create an instance such that all the methods return null. To preserve that behavior, we would just have to:

* Leave PushCertificateParser implementing PushCertificate, with a deprecated no-arg constructor, and deprecated getters that return a hard-coded null.
* Leave the deprecated no-arg constructor in PushCertificate. It will assign all now-final fields to null.
* Rename the new PushCertificate.getSigner() to getSignerIdent()

I'd still rather not if we can avoid it.
