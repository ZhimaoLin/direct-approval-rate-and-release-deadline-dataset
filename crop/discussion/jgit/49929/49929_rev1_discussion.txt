DESCRIPTION

Make PushCertificate{,Parser} non-public in 4.0

These classes are untested and have some flaws that may require
otherwise breaking API changes to clean up. They were of extremely
limited utility in their current form, as there were no public methods
to create or populate instances containing anything other than null
values for all their fields. In particular, note that
BaseReceivePack#getPushCertificate() is not a public method.

Back this support out of 4.0; it will be revamped in 4.1.
