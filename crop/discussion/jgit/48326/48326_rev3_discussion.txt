Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> (optional) In the preimage the walk is released here --- there could be a '}' and de-indent here to do the same.

I guess I prefer what you wrote, though.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/TreeWalkBasicDiffTest.java -> (optional) I think it's clearer with the inserter also released at this point, as in the preimage. (That is, there could be a '}' and un-indent here.)

LGTM except for the indentation in org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIteratorJava7Test.java.

I tried to publish a new patch set with that fixed and got

 remote: The author is a committer on the project.
 remote: 
 remote: error: You are not a project committer.
 remote: error: Only project committers can push on behalf of others.

Habits from gerrit-review die hard. :)

I couldn't yet convince the Eclipse foundation to allow contributors to amend changes owned by another user. Committers are allowed to do that.

This way I noticed you are not yet a committer despite the large number of patches you contributed, fixed that by nominating you :-)
