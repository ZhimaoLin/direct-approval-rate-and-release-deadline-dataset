DESCRIPTION

Add null check to CloneCommand.setRemote

A non-bare clone command with null remote produces a
NullPointerException when trying to produce a refspec to fetch against.

In a bare repository, a null remote name is accepted by mistake,
producing a configuration with items like 'remote.url' instead of
'remote.<remote>.url'.  This was never meant to work --- forbid it.

While we're here, add tests for setRemote working normally.

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> since nowadays Git is autocloseable we could make use of that when we write new tests. Like in:

  try { Git git2 = Git.cloneRepository().setDirectory..... ) {
    ...
  }

Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> You can get rid of the try catch block and say 

xxx@xxx.xxx

Then the test will only succeed of a Nullpointerexception is thrown.

Line:412, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> shouldn't we document in javadoc that null is not allowed?

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Will do in a followup change. (This way, the style stays consistent within the file.)
