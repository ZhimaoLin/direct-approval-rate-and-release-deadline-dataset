Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Why are we peeling the ref if it exists?  Shouldn't we be using the exact ObjectId it currently points at and not the peeled identity?

Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Even if HEAD is currently pointing at an annotated tag's ref (e.g. HEAD = "ref: refs/tags/v1.0" and v1.0 is an annotated tag) peeling here when we prepare the updateRef is wrong.  We want to know what the ref currently points at during the update, which is the tag, not the commit under the tag.

Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> I was thinking about tags, but maybe that does not make sense...
For HEAD it most surely doesn't, but this routine allow us to detach any symbolic ref. Through peeling that would work even if the symref refers to a tag.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> yep, the intent was to have a one-argument function in Repository, not here.
