DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack, UploadPack: Detect missbehavior of sending side.

According to the protocol definition the selection of capabilities by
the sending side must be a subset of the advertised capabilities[1].

If it is not a subset, the sending side violates the protocol and
the process of shoveling data is aborted immediately.

Comment out the changes for UploadPack

I haven't figured out yet how to effectively debug and run tests for
jgit locally for this problem. I'll just offload it to jenkins at eclipse.

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> A smaller (and less API breaking) change would be to leave this alone and add an accessor that returns the capabilities collection to the caller on demand.

Callers then can keep their current code to advertise capabilities, then use the new getter to copy the set back from the RefAdvertiser.

Line:406, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.java -> nonAdvertised

Line:669, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This block is a bit of a problem for you.

When biDirectionalPipe == false we are in smart HTTP and the capability list is not built. So we can't verify against it.

Line:347, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> nonAdvertised

Line:347, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> client
