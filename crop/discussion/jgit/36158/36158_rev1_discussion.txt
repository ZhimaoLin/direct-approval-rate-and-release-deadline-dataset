DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack, UploadPack: Detect missbehavior of sending side.

According to the protocol definition the selection of capabilities by
the sending side must be a subset of the advertised capabilities[1].

If it is not a subset, the sending side violates the protocol and
the process of shoveling data is aborted immediately.
