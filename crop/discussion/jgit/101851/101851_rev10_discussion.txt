DESCRIPTION

dfs: expose DfsReftable from DfsObjDatabase

Reftable storage in DFS is related to pack storage.  Reftables are
stored in the same namespace, but with PackExt.REFTABLE.  Include
the set of DfsReftable instances in the PackList and export some
helpers to access the tables.

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> Please comment why close() is no longer needed, thanks!

Line:542, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> Moving the comparator to DfsReftable class?

Line:559, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> Should DfsReftables be sorted by minUpdateIndex too?

Line:336, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> Returning DfsPackDescription, just like setPackStats()?

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> Close is dead. :)

Line:542, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> I wanted to allow DfsObjDatabase implementations to override the comparator. If I move it to DfsReftable they have to subclass DfsReftable and I have to declare them a factory method to make a DfsReftable that they can override to use their subclass. This is simpler.

Line:559, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> No, I'm only going to sort them by maxUpdateIndex.

Line:336, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> Nah. The builder pattern is overused. We probably should return void from setPackStats().
