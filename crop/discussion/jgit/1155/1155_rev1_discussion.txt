DESCRIPTION

Use proper constants for .gitignore and .git directory

We have a constant for .gitignore, so use it.  While we are in
the same method, correct the reference of ".git" to be the actual
GIT_DIR given.  This might not be within the work tree if the
GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE environment variables were used.
