DESCRIPTION

blame: Format commit and author only once per range

When a commit is blamed for multiple lines of the result file the
command line interface prints the same text before each line in that
span.  Format these strings once and reuse them as the line prefix.

For long files (e.g. 2425 lines of ReceiveCommits.java in Gerrit)
this can save as much as 20ms during the output phase of the command
line blame program.

Aside from running slightly faster, removing the map simplifies the
logic and may improve maintainability of the formatting logic.

Patch Set 1:

Looks good in the sense of maintaining the old behavior. Regarding performance I'm not fully convinced. Reusing the formatted strings speeds things up, but removing the map may reduce performance when there are commits that contribute lines in an alternating fashion.
