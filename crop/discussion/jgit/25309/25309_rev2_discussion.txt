DESCRIPTION

blame: Format commit and author only once per range

When a commit is blamed for multiple lines of the result file the
command line interface prints the same text before each line in that
span.  Format these strings once and reuse them as the line prefix.

For long files (e.g. 2425 lines of ReceiveCommits.java in Gerrit)
this can save as much as 20ms during the output phase of the command
line blame program.

I wonder how much the flushing of outw costs?

Patch Set 2:

Currently we have no choice to flush outw at each line, as outw writes to outs and the output in outw has to be interleaved with the raw data being written to outs, per line.

outw flushing should be about the same cost as building the annotation prefix in a StringBuilder and calling .toString().getBytes("UTF-8"), but may avoid the full intermediate char[] and String object.
