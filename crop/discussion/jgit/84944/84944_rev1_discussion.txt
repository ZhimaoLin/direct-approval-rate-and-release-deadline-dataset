DESCRIPTION

StreamCopyThread: Remove unnecessary flushCount

StreamCopyThread#run consistently interrupts itself whenever it
discovers it has been interrupted by StreamCopyThread#flush while not
reading.  The flushCount is not needed to avoid lost flushes.

All in-tree users of StreamCopyThread never flush.  As a nice side
benefit, this avoids the expense of atomic operations that have no
purpose for those users.
