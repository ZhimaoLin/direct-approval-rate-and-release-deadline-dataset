DESCRIPTION

Harmonize the JDT settings within JGit

Note the the settings are slightly less restrictive for test bundles.
-Also cleanup a couple of malformed javadocs
-Update compiler warnings/errors to include default values from Juno
-We now flag diagnosed null dereference as error. We didn't do that
 earlier because of some false positives.

Patch Set 2:

Forget my last comment. The profile is for formatting only. Updated to enable the formatter:off javadoc. We want that in CLIText.java and similar files. Also changed how annotated parameters are formatter (my Eclipse wanted it and I'm not sure which is the "best").

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good. Few comments, though:

* What about increasing the line length? I find the JGit/EGit code hard to read because of the many line wraps within method declarations and calls. Most screens are wider than 80 chars. FWIW, I usually set a very wide line length (eg., 800) and use the horizontal scroll bar occasionally.

* Still no clean-up profile? Even if clean-up is broken in some cases, there should be a bare minimum profile to avoid accidental cleanups with the "default" profile a user configured in the IDE.

* Why not Organize Imports on save? The current setting already declare unnecessary as errors. That's very inconvenient. Whenever I save a file I still have to manually invoke the organize imports operation.

Patch Set 2:

-1 for using wider lines since I often open more than one class side by side on my 27'' display. Also on 15'' laptop screen (even with Retina display) wider lines would be inconvenient
