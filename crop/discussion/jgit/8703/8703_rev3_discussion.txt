DESCRIPTION

Harmonize the JDT settings within JGit

Note the the settings are slightly less restrictive for test bundles.
-Also cleanup a couple of malformed javadocs
-Update compiler warnings/errors to include default values from Juno
-We now flag diagnosed null dereference as error. We didn't do that
 earlier because of some false positives.
