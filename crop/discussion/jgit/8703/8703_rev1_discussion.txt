DESCRIPTION

Harmonize the JDT settings within JGit

Note the the settings are slightly less restrictive for test bundles.
-Also cleanup a couple of malformed javadocs
-Update compiler warnings/errors to include default values from Juno
-We now flag diagnosed null dereference as error. We didn't do that
 earlier because of some false positives.

Patch Set 1:

Inspired by Ibe9afc252adfb8adfd29218e9f35e0f5345c3a50, but less ambitious, in particular wrt to auto-format, but we get the same settings across all non-test bundles as well as across all test bundles. The settings are also more similar between test and non-test bundles.
