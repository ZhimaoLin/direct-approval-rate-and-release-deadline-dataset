Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

except a few tests failing due to file locking problems on Windows which existed earlier all tests in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380302 were successful

will sort out the remaining problems before 2.0 since we need to create the IP logs and the platform team desperately wants the EclipseSourceReference feature which needs this Jetty update to enable running HTTP stuff in Juno
