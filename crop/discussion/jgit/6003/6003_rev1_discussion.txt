Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommandWithRebaseTest.java -> style nit: we don't use wildcards in import statements

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommandWithRebaseTest.java -> style nit: avoid comments which repeat what should be obvious from the code, first try to make the code itself more readable, if this is too hard add a comment

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> style nit: we don't use curly braces around single line statements

Line:198, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> I think this comment isn't necessary

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> I think this comment isn't necessary

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> you don't need to explain that you added a new method and test as this is obvious from the commit's diff

Patch Set 1:

"With every contribution, you will have to explicitly assert on the corresponding bug or as a comment on the Gerrit push record:

1.that you are the author 100% of the content you are contributing.
2. that you own the copyright of the contributed content (this is typically your employer.)
3. that you have the right to contribute the content to Eclipse. (You need to confirm this with the copyright owner.)"

The answer to these 3 questions is Yes.
