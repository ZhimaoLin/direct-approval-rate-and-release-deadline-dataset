DESCRIPTION

WiP: LfsProtocolServlet: Another attempt at sending error message

The fix done in change Ic718d23cf doesn't seem to have been entirely
successful. The logs in [1] are from running git push against Gerrit
with the LFS plugin, which rejects the request with HTTP 422 and an
error message. As can be seen in the log, there is no message shown.

It's not clear why it's not working, but this change is an attempt to
fix it.

Firstly, having looked again into the problem that was being fixed in
Ic718d23cf, it turns out that the exception was caused by attempting to
get the response's writer after already calling getOutputStream.

When the code is changed so that getOutputStream is only called in the
success case, calling getWriter when sending the error message works as
expected.

Secondly, based on [2], sending the error message in the response via
getWriter should work as expected. However as can be seen in the new
logs [3] there is still no body, although the Content-Length header is
now set and matches the length of the expected error message (rather
than chunked transfer encoding as in [1]).

This problem wasn't caught before because the tests are passing, and I
made the false assumption that the client is simply not using the error
message from the response. As we see in [4], this is not the case.
