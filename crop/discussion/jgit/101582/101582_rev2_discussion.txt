Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> this method is unrelated to the default of git configuration option core.filemode

this is set in FileRepository.create() line 327 which should yield true on posix filesystems, see [1]

[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/jgit/jgit/+/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java#316

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> this seems to contradict what you stated in bug 519887

"The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified in the config file)."

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> replace this by

 Bug: 519887

in the last paragraph of the commit message (immediately above Change-Id)

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> The issue is that on some systems we are not owner of the temporarily created file, so setExecutable with ownerOnly to true by default will not set off to false in your link [1]

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> So it should be true on POSIX OS and this is currently set to false on Alpine Linux.
