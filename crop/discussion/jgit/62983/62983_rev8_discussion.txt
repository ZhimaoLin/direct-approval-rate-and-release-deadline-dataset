Line:383, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/ManifestParser.java -> That's subtle. Thanks for explaining.

It's too bad we can't use Guava's Ordering.isOrdered to enforce it at the top of removeNestedCopyfiles(). I suppose it could do a sort (which is O(n) for already-sorted lists in Java 7 and newer) but I don't mind either way.
