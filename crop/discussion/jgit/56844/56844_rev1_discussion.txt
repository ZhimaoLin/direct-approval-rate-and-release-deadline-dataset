A love this toy.

Line:156, org.eclipse.jgit.test/exttst/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/CGitVsJGitRandomIgnorePatternTest.java -> Also "+", "-", "^", "$", ".", ":", "=", "[[:", ":]]"  and might be alternate the special characters randomly with "usual" characters and numbers to make it more "real".

I *love* random pseudo-code generators :-)
I could watch them running for hours.
