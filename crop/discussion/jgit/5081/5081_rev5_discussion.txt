DESCRIPTION

Execute ReceiveCommands via a method rather than in ReceivePack

This allows a PreReceiveHook to easily "take over" all of the
ReceiveCommands passed to it, preventing any of them from being handled
within the ReceivePack core.

Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> This check precludes the "We can only do CAS" comment on line 267. There are some older Git clients that send zeroId in the old id field when deleting a branch. type != create, and oldId cannot be zeroId with this constructor, so it fails.

I'm not really sure why you need to enforce these two checks at all on the constructor. Just take the type as supplied.

Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> Will do. This hunk used to be in Iae483594 and accidentally got squashed; shall I un-squash it?
