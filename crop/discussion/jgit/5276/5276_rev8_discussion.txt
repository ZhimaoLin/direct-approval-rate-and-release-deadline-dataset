DESCRIPTION

Don't use java.nio channel for file size determination

Java NIO has some problems (like files closing unexpectedly because the
thread was interrupted). To avoid those problems, don't use a NIO
channel to determine the size of a file, but rather ask the File itself.

We have to be prepared to handle wrong/outdated information in this case
too, as the inode of the File may change between opening and determining
file size.
