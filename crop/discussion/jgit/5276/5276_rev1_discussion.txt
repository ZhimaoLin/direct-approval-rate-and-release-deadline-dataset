DESCRIPTION

don't use java.nio channel for file site determination

java NIO has some problems (like files closing unexpectedly because the
thread was interrupted). to avoid those problems, don't use a NIO
channel to determine the size of a file, but rather ask the File itself.

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IO.java -> See my comment in email, the problem here is the inode may have changed between the open and the length test, resulting in the buffer not being sized correctly.
