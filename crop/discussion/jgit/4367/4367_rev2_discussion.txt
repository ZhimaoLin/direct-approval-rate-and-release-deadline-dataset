DESCRIPTION

Fix typo: add to "entries", not to "entriesToAdd"

It was probably meant to add the copied/renamed diffs to the
member "entries" instead of the parameter "entriesToAdd" where they
actually come from

Patch Set 2:

I cannot prove that it fixes anything. I merely wanted to point out that this line of code is probably not as intended.

Jaycee Hickman or Eliezer Sellers would probably know more.
