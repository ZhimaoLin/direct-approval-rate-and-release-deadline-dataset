DESCRIPTION

Implement HistogramDiff

HistogramDiff is an alternative implementation of patience diff,
performing a search over all matching locations and picking the
longest common subsequence that has the lowest occurrence count.
If there are unique common elements, its behavior is identical to
that of patience diff.

Actual performance on real-world source files usually beats
MyersDiff, sometimes by a factor of 3, especially for complex
comparators that ignore whitespace.

Patch Set 4: Do not submit

This isn't ready.  The fallback is always used, even if we can prove that its not necessary.  Which means its slower than it should be because its always invoking MyersDiff at the bottom of the recursion stack.
