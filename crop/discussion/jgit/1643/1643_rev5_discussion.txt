DESCRIPTION

Implement HistogramDiff

HistogramDiff is an alternative implementation of patience diff,
performing a search over all matching locations and picking the
longest common subsequence that has the lowest occurrence count.
If there are unique common elements, its behavior is identical to
that of patience diff.

Actual performance on real-world source files usually beats
MyersDiff, sometimes by a factor of 3, especially for complex
comparators that ignore whitespace.
