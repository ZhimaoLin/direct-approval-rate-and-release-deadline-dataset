DESCRIPTION

Upgrade buck to 7b7817c48f30687781040b2b82ac9218d5c4eaa4

Upgrade to match the version used on Gerrit's master branch.

Requires a couple of modifications to make the tests work:

- Remove source_under_test parameters from java_test calls.

- Add vm_args with explicit setting of tmpdir location for http
  tests. This is needed due to upstream changes in temporary
  directory handling [1].
