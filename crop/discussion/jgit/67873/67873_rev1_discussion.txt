DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Git 2.5 worktree support

This change adds full worktree support to JGit. 

Documentation sources:
[1] The repository layout was verified from documentation at:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout/2.5.0"
[2] The worktree command should work like described here:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

WIP status:
* added general support for $GIT_COMMON_DIR; related to change
"Ie6235a503591ab42b2eb55142ad3932394b40b71", but made decision to return
GIT_DIR with method getGitDir() without checking GIT_COMMON_DIR first,
because from my point of view it's better to work without flag and
getGitCommonDir() should fallback to getGitDir() instead. If the other
change will be merged, i will rebase and decide again for this or other
solution. Refactoring should be easy in both ways.
* added some more constants for worktree and related, but also for other
general directories and files, see [1]
* replaced the now deprecated getDirectory() to getGitDir() or
getGitCommonDir()
* like described at [1]: "This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR
is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/[directory]" will be used instead", the
getGitCommonDir() is called for these folders or files: objects, refs,
packed-refs, config, branches, hooks, info, remotes, logs, shallow
* added $GIT_COMMON_DIR to environment in all places where $GIT_DIR is
added

Next steps:
* review more getDirectory() calls and change them to getGitDir() or
getGitCommonDir()
* add API and parameter handling (pgm) for:
  * worktree add
  * worktree prune
  * worktree list
* add tests for worktree commands and check GIT_DIR and GIT_COMMON_DIR
handling
* if possible do more refactoring about the actual repository layout
handling in JGit, because some of parameters are evaluated more then one
and in similar ways (duplicates), so it's not that easy to add a new one
like $GIT_COMMON_DIR at one place

Problems or Questions:
* RepositoryCache+isGitRepository() now creates and builds full
FileRepository, because then GIT_DIR and GIT_COMMON_DIR are evaluated
completely. But all other repository parameters are evaluated too. I
expect performance issues and have to think about refactoring in this
area to have lightweight method that just evaluates the two parameters.
* General: because this feature needs also refactorings of actual code
base it's waste for me to make small changes and wait i have to do them
together. Is it still possible to have it reviewed? I'm open for
discussions if all this is to big for one change.

This supercedes my work at change 54404 ($GIT_COMMON_DIR support) and works fine for me.

we need good unit test coverage for these changes

Line:413, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> style nit: missing braces

Line:697, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> style nit: missing braces

Line:785, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> what is the .git folder of a worktree ? That's defined in commondir, right ? Do you mean .git/worktrees/<worktree-name>/gitdir ?

Line:791, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> where did you find that ? I couldn't find a version of https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout/ saying path in .git/worktrees/<worktree-name>/gitdir can be relative

Line:204, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I don't get why we need to change this method's name, I'd stick to this name and change the new one for GIT_COMMONT_DIR to getCommonDirectory()

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> -1

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> getCommonDirectory()

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> hasCommonDirectory()

Line:425, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> this is not a getter but creating a new FileRepository instance

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: trailing whitespace

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> why not the latest version ?

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we don't yet have a worktree command

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we should not rename getDirectory() but instead name the new method getCommonDirectory() to avoid unnecessary API changes

Line:39, /COMMIT_MSG -> do this in a separate change on top of this one

Line:43, /COMMIT_MSG -> we need unit tests of all this GIT_COMMON_DIR business to prevent any regression

Line:54, /COMMIT_MSG -> performance is key, we should not sacrifice it for a new feature, at least in use cases not using the new feature

Line:58, /COMMIT_MSG -> try to do refactorings in a (small) series of changes and put this one on top of the refactoring changes, this will require a rebase now and then but probably simplifies code review

Line:332, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> s/The environment variable that tells us which directory is the common ".git" directory/The common .git directory which is different from GIT_DIR when multiple working trees are attached (git worktree).

Line:434, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> .git/worktrees/<worktree-name>

use forward slash, avoid ... in the beginning, some more occurrences below

Thanks for fast review! I'v added my notes and will address all comments with PS2.

Line:413, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> agreed, done like other places in this method, should i change the others too -> refactoring?

Line:697, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> Done

Line:785, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> The GIT_DIR folder of the worktree was readed from working tree (checkout) link file e.g. "repos/<worktree-name>/.git" and is then e.g. "repos/main/.git/worktrees/<worktree-name>" and here we have two files:
* the "commondir" file that points to the "repos/main/.git" folder with relative path "../.." and the "gitdir" file that points to the working tree's .git file (reverse or double link) e.g. "repos/<worktree-name>/.git".

Line:791, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> We have used worktree with Git 2.5 and 2.6 and here in the file ".git/worktrees/<worktree-name>/gitdir" had allways the content ".git". As we found at mailing list it should have the link to the working tree's ".git" file. This was fixed together with list command in Git 2.7. Because "commondir" can be relative i've added the same handing here too. But you are rigth the path in absolute im my environment and we may not expect it would be relative in future. So can change to handle absolute only.

The wrong link gitdir = .git here is not that trivial to fix, because we have only this file and hav to find the right worktree's checkout...

Line:204, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> First approach from Marc had introduced this and made fallback to getGitCommonDir(), but now i've the fallback from common to this --> Agreed, i will change it!

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Done

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Done

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Done

Line:425, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> removed

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The major change with worktree and GIT_COMMON_DIR  was added in Git 2.5.0, but yes the latest version is better.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:39, /COMMIT_MSG -> Agreed, i will create new change for it and describe the plans here.

Line:43, /COMMIT_MSG -> Agreed, i will add tests after learning about test environment in JGit

Line:54, /COMMIT_MSG -> yes, i'm aware of this and will first verify lightweight solution without performance impact to actual repository evaluation.

Line:58, /COMMIT_MSG -> ok, i will try to split the tasks and make smaller changes.
