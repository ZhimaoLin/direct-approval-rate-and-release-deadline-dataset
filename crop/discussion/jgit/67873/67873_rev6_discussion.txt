DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Git 2.5 worktree support

This change adds full worktree support to JGit.

Documentation sources:
[1] The repository layout was verified from documentation at:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout/2.7.2
[2] Implemented the worktree command like described here:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

WIP status:
* added general support for $GIT_COMMON_DIR; related to change
"Ie6235a503591ab42b2eb55142ad3932394b40b71", but made decision to return
$GIT_DIR with method getDirectory() without checking $GIT_COMMON_DIR
first, because from my point of view it's better to work without flag
and getCommonDir() should fallback to getDirectory() instead.
* added some more constants for worktree and related, but also for other
general directories and files, see [1]
* like described at [1]: "This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR
is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/[directory]" will be used instead", the
getCommonDir() is called for these folders or files: objects, refs,
packed-refs, config, branches, hooks, info, remotes, logs, shallow
* added $GIT_COMMON_DIR to environment in all places where $GIT_DIR is
added
* added FileUtils+getCommonDir() to evaluate commondir file if available
* adapted RepositoryCache+isGitRepository() and resolve() and
BaseRepositoryBuilder+setup() to handle gitdir and commondir links
* moved BaseRepositoryBuilder#getSymRef() and isSymRef() to FileUtils,
because needed in RepositoryCache too

Next steps for this change:
* review more getDirectory() calls and change them to getCommonDir() if
needed
* add tests for worktree commands and check GIT_DIR and GIT_COMMON_DIR
handling

Future steps to be addressed in later changes:
* add API and parameter handling (pgm) for:
  * worktree add
  * worktree prune
  * worktree list
* if possible do more refactoring about the actual repository layout
handling in JGit, because some of parameters are evaluated more then one
and in similar ways (duplicates), so it's not that easy to add a new one
like $GIT_COMMON_DIR at one place
