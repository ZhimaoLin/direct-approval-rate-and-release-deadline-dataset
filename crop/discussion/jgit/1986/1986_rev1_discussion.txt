Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

tried the following scenario with egit (using egit change Ie694e09b) in a test repository:
- checkout "master"
- create branch "other" based on "master"
- on branch "master" create two commits in a row each changing the same line in file Test.java
- on branch "other" create again two commits changing the same line in Test.java as the commits on branch master to create conflicts on both changes
-  click "Rebase" on branch "master" to rebase "other" to "master"
- this stops in egit with conflict
- erraneously the second commit from the "other" branch is applied first on top of "master"
- use egit merge tool to resolve the conflict and "Add" it to mark the conflict as resolved
- in native git run "git --continue"
- this brings up the commit message of the first commit on "other" in vi
- save the commit message, native git complains:
xxx@xxx.xxx HelloWorld (other +|REBASE-i)]$ git rebase --continue
[detached HEAD dc8272d] other 1
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
cat: /Users/d029788/src/tmp/HelloWorld/.git/rebase-merge/stopped-sha: No such file or directory
Finished one cherry-pick.
# Not currently on any branch.
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
Could not apply 4dd6e05... other 2

- 4dd6e05 is the second commit on "other"
- .git/rebase-merge/stopped-sha contains the abbreviated commitId of the second commit on "other" : 4dd6e05
- replaced this with the full commitId 4dd6e05e0943f280d0907fbf464ff97944ca39f3 for the same commit
- rerun "git rebase --continue" from native git
- this time the command succeeds 
- result: only one commit was created on top of "master", it has the commit message from the first commit on "other" and the content from the second commit on "other"

So it looks like rebasing more than one conflicting change to another branch doesn't work yet properly and also the file "stopped-sha" isn't handled properly

Patch Set 1:

I don't seem to be able to reproduce this. First of all, I can't find the egit change you are referring to. I tried to search with both "change:Ie694e09b" and "Ie694e09b" with no result.
I tried a few combinations with parallel changes on the same line of the same file in two branches but didn't see the behavior you are describing.

Patch Set 1:

I am not refering to an egit change here, I'll try to pack my sample repository and send it across.
