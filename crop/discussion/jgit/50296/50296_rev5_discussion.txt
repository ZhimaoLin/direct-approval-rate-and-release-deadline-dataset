DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: include begin/end lines in signature

The signature is intended to be passed to a verification library such
as Bouncy Castle, which expects these lines to be present in order to
parse the signature.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

a few weeks ago I filed CQs for 1.52 bouncycastle libraries:
* bcpkix-jdk15on 1.52 [1]
* bcpg-jdk15on 1.52 [2]
* bcprov-jdk15on 1.52 [3]
as soon as they are approved we can add them to Orbit and use them to implement signing and signature verification

We already have an older approval to use 1.47 but this version doesn't include OSGi manifests and it turned out that repackaging to add the OSGi manifests and signing these libraries with the eclipse signing certificate invalidates the JCE signature required to use bouncycastle as a JCE provider. 1.52 already contains OSGi manifests so with this version we shouldn't face this problem

Cool, thanks for filing the CQs.

Fortunately the SignedPushPreReceiveHook that I wrote for Gerrit has very little Gerrit-specific stuff in it, so it should be easy to extract almost all of it into JGit.
