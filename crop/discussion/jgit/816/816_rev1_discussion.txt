DESCRIPTION

Added the standard SULA for JGit

The Eclipse Foundation requires the standard SULA be present
in every feature. We had the license present via edl-v10.html
but we were missing the SULA via the license.html file. The
fix is to simply add the SULA.

Hrmm... it's on master when I also need it on stable-0.8... what's the magic for me to get me to push to stable-0.8?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Shouldn't this be on the 'maint' branch if you want it for 0.8.x series?

I also love the mention everywhere of the EPL, yet the EPL doesn't apply here at all.  Yay for applying a blanket legal document in a context in which it was not really designed for?

Patch Set 1:

Actually, notice.html should be license.html
