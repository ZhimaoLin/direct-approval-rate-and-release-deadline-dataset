DESCRIPTION

Added the standard SULA for JGit

The Eclipse Foundation requires the standard SULA be present
in every feature. We had the license present via edl-v10.html
but we were missing the SULA via the license.html file. The
fix is to simply add the SULA.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

This is still slated to 'master' and the 0.9 series.  Shouldn't it really be on 'maint'?

Patch Set 2:

I've never pushed to Gerrit not on master.

What's the magic when doing a 'git push review' ?

Patch Set 2:

To push to another branch, e.g. maint:

  git push URL HEAD:refs/for/maint

But you can't make Gerrit change the branch for an existing change.  So to switch branches you need to abandon this change, and create a new change (so delete your Change-Id and amend again to get a new Change-Id).
