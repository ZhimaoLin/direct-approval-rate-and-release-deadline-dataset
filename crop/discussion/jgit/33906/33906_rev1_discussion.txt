DESCRIPTION

Fix PackWriterBitmapWalker handling non-existing uninteresting objects

When writing new packs it should be allowed to specify objects as "have"
(objects which should not be included in the pack) which do not exist in
the local repo. This works find with traditional PackWriter, but when
PackWriter was working on a repo with bitmap indexes and used
PackWriterBitmapWalker then this feature was broken. Non-existing "have"
objects lead to MissingObjectExceptions. That broke e.g. gerrit
replication. When the replication target had branches unknown to the
replication source then the source repository wants to build pack files
where "have" included these branch-tips which where unknown in the
source repository.
