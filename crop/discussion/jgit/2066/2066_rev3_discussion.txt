DESCRIPTION

Add a performance optimized variant of the ANY_DIFF filter

If a treewalk walks also over index and the workingtree then the
IndexDiffFitler filter can be used which works much faster then
the semantically equivalent ANY_DIFF filter. This is because this
filter can better avoid computing SHA-1 ids over the content of
working-tree files which is very costly.

This fix will significantly improve the performance of e.g.
EGit's commit dialog.

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilterTest.java -> But why have you removed the test-case fro NonRecursive? Specifically because of a comment from you about possible NPEs with non-recursive treewalks we added this test. Since we don't disallow usage of this filter with non-recursive treewalks we should test it, or?

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilterTest.java -> I have been working most of the day on improving this test class. I wanted to achive a 100% code coverage for the IndexDiffFilter.include() method. By doing so I actually learned a lot about TreeWalks and TreeFilters ;-)

As I am not allowed to upload a patch for this change, I would suggest that we keep this class for now as it is and afterwards enhance it with my version in a separate change.

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilterTest.java -> Originally I removed the testNonRecursiveTreeWalk() because I don't think you want to use IndexDiffFilter when isRecursive() is false.  Its just not very useful to see the subtree nodes, because you have to see all of them.

But we can put a test back for that.  It should work.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilterTest.java -> Phillip, just propose a new change as a successor of this one where you add all your test improvements.
