DESCRIPTION

Add a performance optimized variant of the ANY_DIFF filter

If a treewalk walks also over index and the workingtree then
the IndexWorkingTreeDiff filter can be used which works much
faster then the semantically equivalent ANY_DIFF filter. This
is because this filter can better avoid computing SHA-1 ids
over the content of working-tree files which is very costly.

This fix will significantly improve the performance of e.g.
EGits commit dialog.

Great minds think alike... I was starting to write this same code myself 15 minutes ago, and then saw your change pop in my inbox.

I have a few nits that should be cleaned up.  I'll cherry-pick and clean up those couple of items, then submit.

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> We also should do this in DiffFormatter, when a WorkingTreeIterator and a DirCacheIterator are both invovled in the diff with ANY_DIFF.

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexWorkingTreeDiff.java -> These should be declared final so its much more clear the values can be cached in registers during include().

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexWorkingTreeDiff.java -> I don't think this is possible.  If we have valid values for dirCacheIndex and workingTreeIndex, n must be at least 2.

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexWorkingTreeDiff.java -> You might as well hardcode this as 0.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexWorkingTreeDiff.java -> I think we can reach this point for a directory when TreeWalk.isRecursive() is false and all of the trees are equal above.

When that happens we'll NPE below when isModified() tries to use a null DirCacheEntry.

We should either document in the class Javadoc that this filter must only be used on a recursive TreeWalk, or we should return true if FileMode.TREE.equals(wm), so the subtree can be considered by the caller.

A more aggressive (and much more complex) approach would be to recursively stat validate the directory contents if the DirCacheIterator has a valid ObjectId for this tree from the 'TREE' cache extension.  If all of the files are stat clean, we can return false back, preventing the need to dive into the tree objects from the repository.  That may save some CPU time, but its really frigging hard to get right here in the face of SkipWorkTreeFilter and NotIgnoredFilter also being in the same filter graph (or not being in the filter graph, depending on what the caller wants).

Patch Set 1:

Eh, the more I dig into the relevant section of IndexDiff, the more I see that should be fixed.

I'll post a bunch of relevant changes later today or early tomorrow my time.

Patch Set 1:

I just pushed a bunch of IndexDiff cleanups that should really be put in before this goes in.

I don't have time to rebase this on top tonight, I'll do it tomorrow morning my time if you don't get to it before me.
