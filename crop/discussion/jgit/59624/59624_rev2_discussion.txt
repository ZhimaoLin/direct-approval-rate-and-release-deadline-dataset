DESCRIPTION

xxx@xxx.xxx annotations to BitmapIndexImpl

This makes it easier to distinguish between implementations of methods
from the interface from helpers internal to org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.*.

This was illegal in Java 5 but JGit requires newer Java these days.

Is this a thing in JGit now? When I asked Shawn 6 months ago he said that dating back to Java 5 inconsistencies when interfaces could not use @Override, JGit style chose never to xxx@xxx.xxx But I see them sneaking into the code. Is this explicitly allowed (or was it only implicitly disallowed?)
