DESCRIPTION

Revert "Require a DiffConfig when creating a FollowFilter"

This reverts commit 0bdf030b26248c77806ababd757dad58f1344e57.
At this time clients prefer a random NPE when trying to use a class that
is created without compile errors. Revert the bug fix and allow clients to
believe FollowFilter will work correctly just because their code compiled.

Would it be to hard to add this as an optional parameter so we can use it in jgit/egit and have a default config for other users?

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

An NPE is a bug and stays a bug, fixing this is more important than not changing the API once more in a major release, we still have 4 weeks to go until Kepler is due and we release every 3 months. If this is a problem we should consider to leave the release train and merge fixes instead of sticking to known bugs.

egit compile error is fixed with 94188f68395fa4bdd7055e90d85377dc832e4c5e so I propose we abandon this revert
