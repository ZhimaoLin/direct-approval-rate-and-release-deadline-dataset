these API filters aren't unused, if you remove them and do a clean build in Eclipse you'll get API errors complaining about these API changes

Patch Set 1:

Before removing these Eclipse was warning me that they are not needed.  After removing them and doing a clean build, the warnings go away and there are no errors.

Patch Set 1:

The warnings are:

 The API problem filter for: 'The field org.eclipse.jgit.transport.http.HttpConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM in an interface that is intended to be implemented or extended has been added' is no longer used

and

 he API problem filter for: 'The method org.eclipse.jgit.api.ArchiveCommand.Format.putEntry(T, ObjectId, String, FileMode, ObjectLoader) in an interface that is intended to be implemented has been added' is no longer used

with this change I get the following API errors:

Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
The field org.eclipse.jgit.transport.http.HttpConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM in an interface that is intended to be implemented or extended has been added	HttpConnection.java	/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/http	line 79	Compatibility Problem
The major version should be incremented in version 4.7.0, since API breakage occurred since version 4.6.0	MANIFEST.MF	/org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF	line 5	Version Numbering Problem
The method org.eclipse.jgit.api.ArchiveCommand.Format.putEntry(T, ObjectId, String, FileMode, ObjectLoader) in an interface that is intended to be implemented has been added	ArchiveCommand.java	/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api	line 203	Compatibility Problem

which API baseline are you using ? I am using EGit 4.6:
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/egit/updates/org.eclipse.egit.repository-4.6.0.201612231935-r.zip
as the baseline

Patch Set 1:

I'm not sure what target I was using before, but I was getting compilation errors due to Eclipse still using an older version of Jetty (it was older than the one before the recent update).

I changed to the target in:

 org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.target/jgit-4.7.target

and that fixed the jetty-related compilation errors.

Patch Set 1:

After switching to egit 4.6 and doing a clean build, the compiler errors are back, and I still have several warnings about "has non-API return type" and "has non-API parameter".
