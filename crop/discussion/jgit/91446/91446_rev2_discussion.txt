Line:19, org.eclipse.jgit/.settings/.api_filters -> with this filter removed I get the following error (using 4.6.0 or 4.6.1 API baseline)

The field org.eclipse.jgit.transport.http.HttpConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM in an interface that is intended to be implemented or extended has been added	HttpConnection.java	/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/http	line 79	Compatibility Problem

Abandoned

Must be something wrong with my environment or configuration.
