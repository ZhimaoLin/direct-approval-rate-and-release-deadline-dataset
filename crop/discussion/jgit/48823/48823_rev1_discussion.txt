DESCRIPTION

Archive: Allow caller to supply the ObjectReader

from a merge result that is held by an ObjectInserter and has
not yet been flushed to the respository.

Line:401, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> This changes the contract to make it the caller's responsibility to close 'out' if we throw an exception. That might be fine (or even better, we could call outa.finish() and leave 'out' unclosed), but we would need to change some part of the calling sequence at the same time to make sure callers remember to add a close call on their end.

I'll make a change to just merge the 'try' blocks so this can be rebased on top and not have to deal with that.
