DESCRIPTION

WIP: Add an implementation for HttpConnection using Apache HttpClient

This change implements the http connection abstraction with the help of
org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. It also sets the the default
implementation used by JGit to this implementation which is not what we
want in the end. This was just done to let all http tests run against
the new implementation. Ultimately we want to configure which
HttpConnections to use with the help of git configuration parameters.

One thing that is missing from this WIP proposal is handling of SSL
related configuration (e.g. setting hostname verifier, keymanagers, ...)
