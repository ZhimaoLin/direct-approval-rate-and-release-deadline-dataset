DESCRIPTION

WIP: Add an implementation for HttpConnection using Apache HttpClient

This change implements the http connection abstraction with the help of
org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. It also sets the the default
implementation used by JGit to this implementation which is not what we
want in the end. This was just done to let all http tests run against
the new implementation. Ultimately we want to configure which
HttpConnections to use with the help of git configuration parameters.

One thing that is missing from this WIP proposal is handling of SSL
related configuration (e.g. setting hostname verifier, keymanagers, ...)

we also need to add the new dependencies to the jgit target platform, the features using this and also to the p2 repository, I can add this

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I would instead use the version range "[4.1.0,5.0.0)" for all these dependencies

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HttpClientConnection.java -> style nit: remove blank line

Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HttpClientConnection.java -> we need this method as it is used in jgit

the missing implementation is also failing test org.eclipse.jgit.http.test.SmartClientSmartServerTest.testPush_ChunkedEncoding

Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HttpClientConnection.java -> as you said we need this for ssl support

Line:256, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HttpClientConnection.java -> as you said we need this for ssl support

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> as you said, this should be configurable

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/pom.xml -> style nit: indentation doesn't match

Line:12, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> s/1.1.1/[1.1.1,2.0.0)/

Line:189, pom.xml -> why is this version different from those used in org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF ?
