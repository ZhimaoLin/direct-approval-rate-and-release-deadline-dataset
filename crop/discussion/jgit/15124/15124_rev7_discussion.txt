DESCRIPTION

WIP: Add an implementation for HttpConnection using Apache HttpClient

This change implements the http connection abstraction with the help of
org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. It sets the default implementation
used by JGit to the JDK's implementation. Ultimately we want to
configure which HttpConnections to use with the help of git
configuration parameters.

One thing that is missing from this WIP proposal is handling of SSL
related configuration (e.g. setting hostname verifier, keymanagers, ...)
