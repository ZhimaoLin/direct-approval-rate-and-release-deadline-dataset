DESCRIPTION

Add an implementation for HttpConnection using Apache HttpClient

This change implements the http connection abstraction with the help of
org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. The default implementation used by
JGit is still the JDK HttpURLConnection. But now JGit users have the
possibility to switch completely to org.apache.httpclient. The reason
for this is that in certain (e.g. cloud) environments you are forced to
use the org.apache classes.

- tested successfully using EGit, tried cloning linux kernel repository using this implementation and it worked nicely

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/http/apache/TemporaryBufferEntity.java -> s/it's/its/

Line:197, pom.xml -> unnecessary change ?

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/http/apache/HttpClientConnection.java -> shouldn't we allow to configure which algorithm to use ?

Line:266, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/http/HttpConnection.java -> style nit: unnecessary addition of a blank line ?

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/http/apache/HttpClientConnection.java -> Currently I don't see a usecase that we need something different than TLS. We need this context only when we set hostnameverifiers or keystores for https connections. I think there we need TLS.
