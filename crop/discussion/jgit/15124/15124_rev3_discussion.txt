DESCRIPTION

WIP: Add an implementation for HttpConnection using Apache HttpClient

This change implements the http connection abstraction with the help of
org.apache.http.client.HttpClient. It sets the the default
implementation used by JGit to the JDK's implementation. Ultimately we
want to configure which HttpConnections to use with the help of git
configuration parameters.

One thing that is missing from this WIP proposal is handling of SSL
related configuration (e.g. setting hostname verifier, keymanagers, ...)

Patch Set 3:

There two things missing: 
- chunking should be supported
- ssl needs to be configured

Other than that this looks ok to me.
