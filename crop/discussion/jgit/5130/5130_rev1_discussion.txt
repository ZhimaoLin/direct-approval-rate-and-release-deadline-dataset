DESCRIPTION

EolCanonicalizingInputStream: binary detection should be optional

EolCanonicalizingInputStream may also be used in combination with
.gitattributes. If .gitattributes states that a file is of type text, line
endings have to be canonicalized even if the actual file content seems
to be binary.

Patch Set 1:

this misses javadoc of the parameter detectBinary, which (in a default setup) breaks compilation, as this is set to Error (i can't remember ecplicitly setting this...)
