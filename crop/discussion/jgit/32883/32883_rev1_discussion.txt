DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Report more stats during partial writes

It can be useful for a server operator to know how long a pack
writer spent writing out objects, even if the request aborts and
never finishes.

Record more of the stats data inside of a finally block, to
ensure these can be included into the server's monitoring.
