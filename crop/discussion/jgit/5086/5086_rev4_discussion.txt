Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AdvertiseRefsHookChain.java -> Ouch. This sucks.

Consider we write a hook that wants to only show refs/heads/ and refs/tags/. Lets also consider it may want to support being mixed in with other hooks in a chain.

If there was a hook before it, it should use getAdvertisedRefs() to look at the current map, pick out only refs/{heads,tags} and then reset the map. OK but this is really slow if there was no prior hook because you are now doing getAllRefs() to pre-populate the transport object. That defeats one of the notions of this hook, which is to try and use the lower-level APIs to only scan the subspaces that it needs.

Right now as you have it there is no clean way to know if there is a prior hook and whether you should be replacing the prior results, filtering them, etc.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AdvertiseRefsHookChain.java -> Would it be sufficient for this case to change the definition of getAdvertisedRefs() to not call db.getAllRefs()? That is, it will only return non-null if a previous hook has called setAdvertisedRefs(). The latter hook would have to have separate code paths for the filtering/scanning cases, but I don't see a way around that.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AdvertiseRefsHookChain.java -> Yes it would help if we change getAdvertisedRefs() to return null until a hook has called setAdvertisedRefs(). You may need to audit the callers within JGit to make sure they are OK with this ordering of operations. I suspect its OK... but WTF do I know.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AdvertiseRefsHookChain.java -> Ok, will do. I've audited the callers in the past, I don't mind doing it again.

Under this new contract we would of course not require hooks to call setAdvertisedRefs(), going back to the discussion in the previous patch.
