DESCRIPTION

Add support for include.path with tilde

As per native Git, support include.path with tilde.

The only case still not supported is relative path but this one needs
more code rework to be supported. Relative path needs to be relative to
the configuration file in which the include directive was found.
Currently, Config.fromText method is not aware of which file the content
is coming from.
