DESCRIPTION

Add support for include.path with tilde

As per native Git, support include.path with tilde.

The only case still not supported is relative path but this one needs
more code rework to be supported. Relative path needs to be relative to
the configuration file in which the include directive was found.
Currently, Config.fromText method is not aware of which file the content
is coming from.

This change is not needed on stable-4.4 but I pushed it against stable-4.4 since it depends on parent changes.

I will abandon this one and move it to master branch once parent changes are on master.

Line:1129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Would extract the above if block into a helper method focusing on returning a proper File object based on tilde presence (or absence). Doing so would simplify this addIncludedConfig method as well, preserving its focus.
