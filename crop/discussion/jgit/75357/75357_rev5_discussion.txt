DESCRIPTION

Add support for include.path with tilde

As per native Git, support include.path with tilde.

The only case still not supported is relative path but this one needs
more code rework to be supported. Relative path needs to be relative to
the configuration file in which the include directive was found.
Currently, Config.fromText method is not aware of which file the content
is coming from.

An unrelated problem with this whole include.path mechanism is the snapshot logic in file based configs, which look only at the base file, but not at the included files...

Line:1143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> If you make this protected, you can override it in the file based config to do the relative path resolution. Relative paths only make sense for file based configs, don't they?

Line:1143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> I think Config should not depend on java.io.File, only FileBasedConfig should depend on filesystem.

Line:1143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> The dependency on java.io.File was introduced in I700bd7b7e and not in this change, I was following the same path.

I will rework include file to be done only in FileBaseConfig to remove dependency on java.io.File and hopefully support relative path as suggested.

Abandoned

As mentioned before, this change is not needed on stable-4.4. I will push it against master once dependent changes are merged on master.
