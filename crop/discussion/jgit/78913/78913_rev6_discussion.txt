DESCRIPTION

Consistently use HTTP status enums from org.apache.http.HttpStatus

Currently the codebase uses a mix of the enums from two different
classes:

- javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse
- org.apache.http.HttpStatus

Prefer to use o.a.http.HttpStatus because it provides more values than
j.s.http.HttpServletResponse, for example SC_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this doesn't justify adding a new dependency, we try to keep dependencies of the core jgit bundles minimal since they are used by many applications.

So far only the optional bundles org.eclipse.jgit.http.apache and org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server use apache.http and they use more than a few constants.
