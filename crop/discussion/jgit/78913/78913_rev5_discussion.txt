DESCRIPTION

Consistently use HTTP status enums from org.apache.http.HttpStatus

Currently the codebase uses a mix of the enums from two different
classes:

- javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse
- org.apache.http.HttpStatus

Prefer to use o.a.http.HttpStatus because it provides more values than
j.s.http.HttpServletResponse, for example SC_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY.
