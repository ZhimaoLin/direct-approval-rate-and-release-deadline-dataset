DESCRIPTION

Fix WWW-Authenticate auth-scheme comparison

The auth-scheme token (like "Basic" or "Digest") is not specified in a
case sensitive way. RFC2617 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) specifies
in section 1.2 the use of a "case-insensitive token to identify the
authentication scheme". Jetty, for example, uses "basic" as token.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The change breaks the HttpClientTests. I will push a new version.
