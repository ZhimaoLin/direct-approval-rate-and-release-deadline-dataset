Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkUtils.java -> Is it intentional that we don't allow to specify annotated Tags in the refs collection? I thought this method is like 'git branch --merged' and for a linux repo I can say 'git branch --merged refs/tags/v3.5'. But in JGit maybehead would be a RevTag object and would be ignored. Or?
