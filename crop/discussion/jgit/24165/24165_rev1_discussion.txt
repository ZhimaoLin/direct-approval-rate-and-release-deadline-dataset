DESCRIPTION

Fix (workaround) GC test failures on Windows

By default Java on Windows has a 1/100th second resolution on
timestamps that cause tests to fail. It's hard or impossible
to create tests that prove that a blob modified in very near
time is either not deleted or not. Loosen the checks and make
treat an expiration of of zero to prune all loose objects
regardless of timestamp, including timestamps in the future.

Update API docs to warn about very near time expiration dates.
