DESCRIPTION

Fix StashApplyCommand for stashes containing untracked changes.

If there are untracked changes, apply only the untracked tree
after a successful merge. The merge tree from merging untracked
with HEAD would also contain files already reset before (changes
in tracked files) and try to reset those again,leading to false
checkout conflicts.
