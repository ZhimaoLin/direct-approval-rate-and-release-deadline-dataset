DESCRIPTION

Add getObjectSize to ObjectReader

This is an informational function used by PackWriter to help it
better organize objects for delta compression.  Storage systems
can implement it to provide up more detailed size information,
or they can simply rely on the default behavior that uses the
ObjectLoader obtained from open.

For local file storage, we can obtain this information faster
through specialized routines that parse a pack object header.
