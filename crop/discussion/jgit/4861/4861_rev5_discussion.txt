DESCRIPTION

Add comand support for git-submodule

Adds the following commands:

This also updates AddCommand so that file patterns added that
are submodules can be staged in the index.

This change mirrors the last commit pushed to stable-1.2 that included changes based on Robin's feedback.

I would like to get started on the EGit side of things soon so any other feedback on this change would be appreciated.
