Interesting.... when is PATH empty and when it is; is that to be considered really empty or does the OS have a default PATH?

Patch Set 1:

I hit this bug because I wanted to ensure my environment was not causing a failure different from what I was seeing elsewhere, so I did the normal unix thing and ran `env -i java -jar jgit-cli.jar ....`.

`env -i` clears all environment variables, so PATH was not set.  I didn't expect PATH to need to be set.  With my patch, things work as I expected them to.  While some OSes may have a default path setting, that doesn't mean you can't have this situation happen.

Patch Set 1:

Carl: Can you add a blurb about why/when the empty path can occur and that we explicitly ignore a potential "default" path, simply because we believe the corner case is not important.
