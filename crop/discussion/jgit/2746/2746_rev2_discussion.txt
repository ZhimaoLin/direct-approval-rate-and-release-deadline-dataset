DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Add a PreUploadHook to monitor and control behavior

Embedding applications can use this hook to watch actions within
UploadPack and possibly reject them. This could be useful to prevent
clones of a large repository from this server, or to stop abusive
negotiation rounds that offer thousands of objects in a single batch.
