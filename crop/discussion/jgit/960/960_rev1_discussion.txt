DESCRIPTION

Rename Repository getWorkDir to getWorkTree

This better matches with the name used in the environment
(GIT_WORK_TREE), in the configuration file (core.worktree),
and in our builder object.

Since we are already breaking a good chunk of other code
related to repository access, and this fairly easy to fix
in an application's code base, I'm not going to offer the
wrapper getWorkDir() method.

Line:1022, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> You added 'and has no working directory' here but the test is still the same. If the 'has no working directory' is just a clarification on what it means to be bare, then it would be better to change this to 'if the repository is bare (i.e. it has no working directory)' so that people don't think it's a separate condition.
