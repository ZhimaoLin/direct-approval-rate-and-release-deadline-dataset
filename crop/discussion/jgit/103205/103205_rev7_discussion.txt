DESCRIPTION

dfs: Switch InMemoryRepository to DfsReftableDatabase

This ensure DfsReftableDatabase is tested by the same test suites that
use/test InMemoryRepository.  It also simplifies the logic of
InMemoryRepository and brings its compatibility story closer to any
other DFS repository that uses reftables for its reference storage.

mthai: Taking over this change to address review comments.

Sorry to let this hang, and thanks for picking it up.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> You can restore the original author by using 'git commit --amend --author="Yoselin Hanna xxx@xxx.xxx The committer field will still give credit for who gave the finishing touches.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> This line isn't needed --- when looking at "git log" it doesn't tell me anything about what the change did.

You can have a line like this if you have made some specific changes that need pointing out, though.

Please include a blank line afterward, so that tools like Gerrit and git-interpret-trailers(1) can interpret the footer that comes below correctly.

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> I have to take over authorship to push, due to 

remote: error: You are not a project committer.                        
remote: error: Only project committers can push on behalf of others.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> removed

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> That's annoying. I don't think we should work around that by falsifying authorship, though. I can push changes for you if you like.
