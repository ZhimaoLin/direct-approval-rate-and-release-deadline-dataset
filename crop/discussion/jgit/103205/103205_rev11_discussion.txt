DESCRIPTION

dfs: Switch InMemoryRepository to DfsReftableDatabase

This ensure DfsReftableDatabase is tested by the same test suites that
use/test InMemoryRepository.  It also simplifies the logic of
InMemoryRepository and brings its compatibility story closer to any
other DFS repository that uses reftables for its reference storage.

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Why can't the config from refdb be used here, like in patchset 10?
