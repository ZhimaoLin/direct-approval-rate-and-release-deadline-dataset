DESCRIPTION

dfs: Switch InMemoryRepository to DfsReftableDatabase

This ensure DfsReftableDatabase is tested by the same test suites that
use/test InMemoryRepository.  It also simplifies the logic of
InMemoryRepository and brings its compatibility story closer to any
other DFS repository that uses reftables for its reference storage.

Two questions. The rest looks good.

Line:717, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollectorTest.java -> Is losing this test intentional?

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> This feels like a layering violation. Is there e.g. a method in DfsReftableDatabase that could handle this?

Line:717, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollectorTest.java -> Not really, I should have fixed the condition its testing for. Done.

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Done
