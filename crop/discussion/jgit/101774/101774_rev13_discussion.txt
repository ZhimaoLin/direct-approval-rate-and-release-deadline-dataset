DESCRIPTION

reftable: file format documentation

Some repositories contain a lot of references (e.g. android at 866k,
rails at 31k). The reftable format provides:

- Near constant time lookup for any single reference, even when the
  repository is cold and not in process or kernel cache.
- Near constant time verification a SHA-1 is referred to by at least
  one reference (for allow-tip-sha1-in-want).
- Efficient lookup of an entire namespace, such as `refs/tags/`.
- Support atomic push `O(size_of_update)` operations.
- Combine reflog storage with ref storage.

Line:203, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> This precedes the `restart_count`, so say that. It doesn't follow anything talked about to this point.

Line:219, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> This is unclear. How would not adding padding cause the next block to spill into the block without padding? What you have written is clear without this.

Line:453, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> This section clearly describes how alignment and size for log blocks differ from other blocks, so I think it is fine to keep calling them blocks rather than switching to "log chunks".

Line:504, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> There isn't an update index section below.

Is it worth addressing what state the repository is in when the update index overflows? My thoughts would be that further updates get frozen until a full GC is run, which can reset that counter in the new GC pack, allowing the reftable ordering function of the update index to function again.

reflog history could get written to a separate reflog archive file as part of that GC. `git log` could be taught to look at that file. To avoid infinite history, only one archive file of this type could be allowed.

Line:765, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> s/by repositories/on repositories/

Line:767, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> This talks about obj blocks but then about lookup by name again. Maybe something like: If looking up by SHA-1 is a common operation, obj blocks avoid disk seeks at the cost of storing SHA-1s twice.

Line:856, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> "Tombstone" may be more familiar than "shadows", so: That serves as a tombstone, overriding any assertions about the existence of the reference from earlier files in the stack.

Will push an updated doc later. I have comments from git-core list to also fold in.

Line:203, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Done

Line:219, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Done

Line:504, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Fixed to point to "update transactions" below.

The update_index field is a 64 bit counter. It won't overflow.

Line:765, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Done

Line:767, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Reworded.

Line:856, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Done
