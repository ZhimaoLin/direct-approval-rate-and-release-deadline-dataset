DESCRIPTION

reftable: file format documentation

Some repositories contain a lot of references (e.g. android at 866k,
rails at 31k). The reftable format provides:

- Near constant time lookup for any single reference, even when the
  repository is cold and not in process or kernel cache.
- Near constant time verification a SHA-1 is referred to by at least
  one reference (for allow-tip-sha1-in-want).
- Efficient lookup of an entire namespace, such as `refs/tags/`.
- Support atomic push `O(size_of_update)` operations.
- Combine reflog storage with ref storage.

Line:771, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> It the idea that .log files are log-record-only reftables, and.ref files are ref-only or mixed ref-and-log? It would be good to be explicit.
