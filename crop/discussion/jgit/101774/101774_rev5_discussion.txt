DESCRIPTION

reftable: file format documentation

Some repositories contain a lot of references (e.g. android at 866k,
rails at 31k). The reftable format provides:

- Near constant time lookup for any single reference, even when the
  repository is cold and not in process or kernel cache.
- Near constant time verification a SHA-1 is referred to by at least
  one reference (for allow-tip-sha1-in-want).
- Efficient lookup of an entire namespace, such as `refs/tags/`.
- Support atomic push `O(size_of_update)` operations.
- Combine reflog storage with ref storage.

Line:163, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> I'm getting confused as to whether the update index is used for ordering reftables in time when merging them together, or are for ordering ref log entries for a single reference, or both. I think both, but it needs to be made more explicit.

Line:482, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Below it says that when importing logs each line should get a unique index, but I would thing of the importing as a single transaction. Can you clarify that?

Line:512, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Cite the log format in the core git implementation rather than stating it is complex.
"The log record values follow the core git implementation [citation], and include the following values:"

Line:579, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Please switch to using 'position' consistently when referring to absolute locations in the file, and offset when referring to relative offsets.

Line:163, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Its both, and I've already made it pretty clear in the document.

The file level min_update_index and max_update_index are for ordering files. Its right in the next paragraph.

The log record level update_index is for ordering individual log records within the scope of a ref. That is explained below in the log record section.

Line:482, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Clarified in the importing section.

Line:512, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Done

Line:579, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Done
