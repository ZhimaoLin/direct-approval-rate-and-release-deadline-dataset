MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We probably shlould be consistent, but I don't think much thought has been done regarding what to prefer. Bundles are closer to the unit of packaging and versioning , than packages themselves.

Making sure we re-export everything seems easier in  Eclipse with biundles than packages. but other than that I have no clear preferenvce myself.
