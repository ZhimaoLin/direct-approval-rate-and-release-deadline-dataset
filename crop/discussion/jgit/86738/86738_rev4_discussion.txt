DESCRIPTION

Fix FileSnapshot.isModified

FileSnapshot.isModified may report a file being clean although it is
actually dirty.

Imagine you have a FileSnapshot on file f. lastmodified and lastread are
both t0. Now time is t1 and you
1) modify the file
2) Update the FileSnapshot of the file (lastModified=t1, lastRead=t1)
3) modify the file again
4) wait 3 seconds
5) ask the Filesnapshot whether the file is dirty or not. It will answer
it's clean.

Every file which has been modified longer than 2.5 seconds ago will be
reported to be clean. That's not always correct as the test shows.

The real-world problem fixed by this is the following:
A gerrit server using JGit to handle git repositories is answering fetch
requests while simultaneously native git is doing a garbage collection
on the repo. At time t1 native git writes temporary files in the pack
folder setting the mtime of the pack folder to t1. A fetch request
causes JGit to search for new packfiles and JGit remembers this scan in
a Filesnapshot on the packs folder. Since the gc is not finished JGit
doesn't see any new packfiles. The fetch is processed and the gc ends
while the filesystem timer is still t1. GC writes a new packfile and
deletes the old packfile.

3 seconds later another request arrives. JGit does not yet know about
the new packfile but is also not rescanning the pack folder because it
cached that the last scan happened at time t1 and packfolder mtime is
also t1. Now JGit will not be able to resolve any object. This behaviour
is persistent because now gerrit can't read refs/meta/config anymore and
will not allow any pushes anymore. The packs folder will not change its
mtime and therefore a rescan will not take place.
