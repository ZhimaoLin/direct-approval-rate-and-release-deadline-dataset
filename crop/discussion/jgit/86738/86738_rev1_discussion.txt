DESCRIPTION

Fix FileSnapshot.isModified

FileSnapshot.isModified may report a file beeing clean although is
acutally dirty.

Imagine you have a FileSnapshot on file f. lastmodified and lastread are
both t0. Now time is t1 and you
1) modify the file
2) Update the FileSnapshot of the file (lastModified=t1, lastRead=t1)
3) modify the file again
4) wait 3 seconds
5) Ask the Filesnapshot whether the file is dirty or not. It will answer
it's clean.

Every file which has been modified longer than 2.5 seconds ago will be
reported to be clean. That's not always correct as the test shows.

The real-world problem fixed by this is the following:
A gerrit server using JGit to handle git repositories is answering fetch
requests while simultaniously native git is doing a garbage collection
on the repo. At time t1 native git writes temporary files in the pack
folder causing the mtime of the pack folder to be set to t1. A fetch
request causes JGit to search for new packfiles and JGit remembers this
scan in a Filesnapshot on the packs folder. Since the gc is not finished
JGit doesn't see any new packfiles. The fetch is processed and the gc
ends while the filesystem timer is still t1. The gc caused a new
packfile beeing written and the old packfiles to be deleted.

3 seconds later another fetch comes. JGit does not yet now about the new
packfile but is also not rescanning the pack folder because he
remembered the last scan was during t1 and packfolder mtime is also t1.
Now JGit will not be able to resolve any object. This behaviour is
persistent because now gerrit can't read refs/meta/config anymore and
will not allow any pushes anymore. The packs folder will not change it's
mtime and therefore a rescan will not take place.
