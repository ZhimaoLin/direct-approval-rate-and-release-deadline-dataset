DESCRIPTION

Batch reference updates together for storage

clone, fetch and push can all update multiple references in a single
command invocation. Rather than performing sequential iteration
of each reference change inside of the application code, push this
down into the reference database where the implementation can take
advantage of the batch size and optimize itself.

For the local filesystem implementation the obvious optimization
is to write a packed-refs file when the repository is completely
empty. The initial clone, fetch or push into the destination may
have hundreds of new references. Writing all of these as loose
files is not efficient. This optimization is not implemented in
this commit and is left as an exercise for the reader to supply
in a future commit to JGit.

To make the API changes simple, define the BatchRefUpdate type and
implementation using the existing sequential behavior.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> -1 on including the text of arbitrary IOExceptions here, you'll recall a bug we had recently where we leaked internal information via an IOException.

Line:397, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> Again, don't necessarily want to blindly show the message to the end user.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

(2 inline comments)



Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> Done

Line:397, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceiveCommand.java -> Changing this code to report a different error message isn't related to batching the updates together. I would rather keep the error handling matching current behavior, and then later address how errors are reported to clients in a separate set of changes.

I think there is more that has to happen to protect internal server details from clients than just setting the result message to a less revealing string.

Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> Did you mean to change this? I don't see a newer patch set. Or are you just marking this comment reviewed and postponing this change until we can fix it more thoroughly, as you mentioned elsewhere?

I have this batch-ref topic running in production for a little while now. If there are no -1/-2 votes then I will submit the entire 4 change series around this time tomorrow.
