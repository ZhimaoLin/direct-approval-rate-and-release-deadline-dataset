DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Avoid CRC-32 validation when feeding IndexPack

There is no need to validate the object contents during
copyObjectAsIs if the result is going to be parsed by unpack-objects
or index-pack.  Both programs will compute the SHA-1 of the object,
and also validate most of the pack structure.  For git daemon
like servers, this work is already done on the client end of the
connection, so the server doesn't need to repeat that work itself.

Disable object validation for the 3 transport cases where we know
the remote side will handle object validation for us (push, bundle
creation, and upload pack).  This improves performance on the server
side by reducing the work that must be done.
