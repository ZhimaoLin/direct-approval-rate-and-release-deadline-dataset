DESCRIPTION

Include supported extensions in PackFile constructor.

Previously a PackFile class was assumed to only support a .pack and .idx
file. Update the constructor to enumerate the supported extensions for
the pack file. This will allow the bitmap code to only be executed if
the bitmap extension file is known to exist.

Line:1094, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Eclipse complains with an error that this method is unused:

The method hasExt(PackExt) from the type PackFile is never used locally	PackFile.java	/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file	line 1094	Java Problem

Patch Set 7:

The BITMAP_INDEX hasn't been merged yet, which uses the field:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/7939/13/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java

I am trying to put the framework for multiple extensions in place before adding the first extension.

Patch Set 7:

I know, but I hate seeing error markers in Eclipse and jgit's project settings flag unused code as "error". E.g. with this Eclipse asks me "Errors exist in required project "org.eclipse.jgit" Proceed with launch?" when starting jgit's unit tests and I don't want to see this unless there are real errors.
