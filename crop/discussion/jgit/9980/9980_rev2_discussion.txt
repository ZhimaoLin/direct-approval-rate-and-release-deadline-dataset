DESCRIPTION

Include supported extensions in PackFile constructor.

Previously a PackFile class was assumed to only support a .pack and .idx
file. Update the constructor to enumerate the supported extensions for
the pack file. This will allow the bitmap code to only be executed if
the bitmap extension file is known to exist.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> spell pack

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> nit-pick. no braces here

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackExt.java -> static methods should be before instance members. So move this just below the VALUES array.

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> I thought we talked about making this a BitSet somehow. Have PackExt keep a static int that counts how many PackExts have been created and declared. Change its constructor to instead use a static factory method that automatically registers the PackExt into the VALUES array and assigns it a unique bit. Assume we only permit 32 PackExts for now.

Then here we can have a simple int that is a bit set of the PackExts that are present.

Line:748, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> inline name here, its shorter
