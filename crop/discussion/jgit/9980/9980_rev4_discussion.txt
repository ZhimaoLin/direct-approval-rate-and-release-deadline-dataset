DESCRIPTION

Include supported extensions in PackFile constructor.

Previously a PackFile class was assumed to only support a .pack and .idx
file. Update the constructor to enumerate the supported extensions for
the pack file. This will allow the bitmap code to only be executed if
the bitmap extension file is known to exist.
