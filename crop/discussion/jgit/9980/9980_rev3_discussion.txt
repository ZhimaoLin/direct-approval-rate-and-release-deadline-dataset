DESCRIPTION

Include supported extensions in PackFile constructor.

Previously a PackFile class was assumed to only support a .pack and .idx
file. Update the constructor to enumerate the supported extensions for
the pack file. This will allow the bitmap code to only be executed if
the bitmap extension file is known to exist.

Line:109, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackExt.java -> This is now reference equality given the way the implementation works. So you can drop equals().

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackExt.java -> This is actually also reference equality. So we could just drop this and use the object identity.

Line:121, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackExt.java -> Include the bit in the toString(), e.g. maybe 1<<getPosition()

Line:348, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Why is this a List. Why not just use the bit form?

Line:745, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Same as above, don't use a list use the bit form.
