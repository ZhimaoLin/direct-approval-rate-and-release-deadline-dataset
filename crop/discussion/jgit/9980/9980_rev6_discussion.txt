DESCRIPTION

Include supported extensions in PackFile constructor.

Previously a PackFile class was assumed to only support a .pack and .idx
file. Update the constructor to enumerate the supported extensions for
the pack file. This will allow the bitmap code to only be executed if
the bitmap extension file is known to exist.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackExt.java -> You can just say public static synchronized PackExt and have the JVM handle the locking for you.

Line:72, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackExt.java -> We should throw IllegalStateException if VALUES.length == 32.

Line:1095, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> != 0 is also valid if the bit is only ever 1 bit set.
