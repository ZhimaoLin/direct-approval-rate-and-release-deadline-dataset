DESCRIPTION

Add Subsequence utility methods

DiffAlgorithm implementations may find it useful to construct an Edit
and use that to later subsequence the two base sequences, so define
two new utility methods a() and b() to construct the A and B ranges.

Once a subsequence has had Edits created for it the indexes are
within the space of the subsequence.  These must be shifted back to
the original base sequence's indexes.  Define toBase() as a utility
method to perform that shifting work in-place, so DiffAlgorithm
implementations have an efficient way to convert back to the caller's
original space.
