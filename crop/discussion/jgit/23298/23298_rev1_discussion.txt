DESCRIPTION

Display progress while checking connectivity on push

Verifying 100 new objects are fully connected to the existing DAG
is usually very cheap. Checking the entire Linux kernel history is
fully connected when pushing it to a new repository can take 30-60
seconds. Display a progress counter during this time so the client
knows the server is still working.
