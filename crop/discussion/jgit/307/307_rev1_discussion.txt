DESCRIPTION

Reuse the line buffer between strings in PacketLineIn

When reading pkt-lines off an InputStream we are quite likely to
consume a whole group of fairly short lines in rapid succession, such
as in the have exchange that occurs in the fetch-pack/upload-pack
protocol.  Rather than allocating a throwaway buffer for each
line's raw byte sequence, reuse a buffer that is equal to the small
side-band packet size, which is 1000 bytes.  Text based pkt-lines
are required to be less than this size because many widely deployed
versions of C Git use a statically allocated array of this length.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> <= is more optrimal here. We don't need to reserve place for a NUL byte
