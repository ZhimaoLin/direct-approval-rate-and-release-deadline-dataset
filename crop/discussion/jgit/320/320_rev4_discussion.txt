DESCRIPTION

Added Merge command to command line

In preparation to my upcoming commits bringing new merge strategies I add a simple merge command
to the command line for testing purposes. This merge command accepts the merge strategy as option
and uses the SIMPLE_IN_CORE_TWO_WAY as default. It expects exactly one other revision which is
merged with current head.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

sorry, the last patchset contained a unwanted .prefs file. Now this is fixed and all comments are addressed.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

style nit: your commit message is a bit wide (around 100 chars), please reformat
