DESCRIPTION

Added Merge command to command line

In preparation to my upcoming commits bringing new merge strategies I
add a simple merge command to the command line for testing purposes.
This merge command accepts the merge strategy as option and uses the
simple-two-way-in-core as default. It expects exactly one other
revision which is merged with current head.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This command doesn't work correctly in case of dirty working dirs. See the comments in http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg00220.html. I'll propose a new patchset.
