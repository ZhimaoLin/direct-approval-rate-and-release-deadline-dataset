DESCRIPTION

Added Merge command to command line

In preparation to my upcoming commits bringing new merge strategies I add a simple merge command
to the command line for testing purposes. This merge command accepts the merge strategy as option
and uses the SIMPLE_IN_CORE_TWO_WAY as default. It expects exactly one other revision which is
merged with current head.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> style nit: we don't use braces for single line blocks

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> you probably unintentionally hit "return" here -> unnecessary whitespace

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> No, our checked-in code formatter does it like that. And you can see
why he would do so if you set your tab width in the gerrit UI to '4'. By breaking the line after the '.' he manages to stay in our maximum line length
