DESCRIPTION

Added Merge command to command line

In preparation to my upcoming commits bringing new merge strategies I add a simple merge command
to the command line for testing purposes. This merge command accepts the merge strategy as option
and uses the SIMPLE_IN_CORE_TWO_WAY as default. It expects exactly one other revision which is
merged with current head.

What is the commit message if the src is not a branch (see comment in line 123)?

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> why not range up to next version which might be incompatible ?

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> this does not work if ref denotes a tag

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> ref can be a commit which is not a HEAD of a branch.
Shouldn't the message be different in that case?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> I agree. I does work for lightweight tags (http://book.git-scm.com/3_git_tag.html) but not for tag objects.
I'll add some code here for real tag objects

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> Done. This was a typo in the comment. Actually we support ours, theirs, simple-two-way-in-core.
I guess 'simple-two-way-in-core' will not be used when we have recursive, octopus strategies in place - therefore I would like not to describe this strategy.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> could we use the strategy names in lower case and rather use "-" instead of "_" that's easier to type and I think native git does it similarily:

ours, theirs, simple-two-way-in-core

simple-two-way-in-core sounds weird as a strategy name.

I think the semantics of these strategies should be also described shortly.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> for native git it's not a hard prereq that the index is clean. The man page says 
"git pull and git merge will stop without doing anything when local uncommitted changes overlap with files that git pull/git merge may need to update"
I would like to follow the same semantics. But this check would be in the merge strategies. They would fail when trying to overwrite uncommited data.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Merge.java -> I think this clean index precondition should be explicitly checked before merge is started.
