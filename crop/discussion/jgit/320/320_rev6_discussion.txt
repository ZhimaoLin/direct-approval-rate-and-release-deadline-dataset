Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks OK. I am only not sure about (non)usage of placeholders in the resource bundle.

Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> don't you need a {0} placeholder in for the file name?

Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> no, I don't. Thats a string who is printed on his own line. In the next lines we'll print the pathes of the files which we don't want to overwrite.
