DESCRIPTION

Meaningful error message when trying to check-out submodules

Currently, a NullPointerException occurs in this case. We should
instead throw a more meaningful Exception with a proper message.
This is a very "stupid" implementation which simply checks for
the existence of a ".gitmodules" file.
