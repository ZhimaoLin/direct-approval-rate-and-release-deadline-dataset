DESCRIPTION

Meaningful error message when trying to check-out submodules

Currently, a NullPointerException occurs in this case. We should
instead throw a more meaningful Exception with a proper message.
This is a very "stupid" implementation which simply checks for
the existence of a ".gitmodules" file.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Instead of refusing to check out a project that has a .gitmodules file, I would prefer to fix the code that is trying to process a GITLINK entry as though it were a blob.

FWIW, even C Git ran into a ton of bugs when GITLINK was added to the core code.  It took them a while to shake out all of the code paths that cared.

Patch Set 2:

Of course it would be great to implment submodule support. As far as I know, however, there is currently no activity in this area. I would suggest the following:
1. we promote bug 314853 to a feature request
2. we point the other bugs to that one as duplicate
3. we use the code changes proposed here to inform the end users about the missing feature so that they won't have to create new bugs
