Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> You replaced MultipleParentsNotAllowedException by NoSuchParentException. Can this be ok? What is if I have not called setMainline() and try to cherry-pick a merge commit? Then I would still expect a MultipleParentsNotAllowedException. In such a case NoSuchParentException is not meaningful to me

If you don't call setMainline() the implementation will default to the first parent (old behaviour). I don't understand your concern especially that it is parity with CLI git.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> How you pick the parent is ok for me. I am only complaining because in error cases you don't differentiate anymore between that I have picked a non-existing parent and that I have not picked a parent at all but specified a merge commit.

Also native git gives me different error messages in these situations. Try this:

 git init
 touch a
 git add a
 git commit -m addA
 git branch target
 git checkout -b side
 touch b
 git add b
 git commit -m addB
 git checkout master
 echo a > a
 git commit -a -m modifyA
 git merge side
 git checkout target
 git cherry-pick master
 # the previous command returned: fatal: Commit 9ee535192272b65a6911fd19403176be7ba5c759 is a merge but no -m option was given.
 git cherry-pick -m 3 master
 # the previous command returned: fatal: Commit 9ee535192272b65a6911fd19403176be7ba5c759 does not have parent 3

The two last cherry-picks gave to different error messages and I would like to have two different exceptions (NoSuchParentException, MultipleParentsNotAllowedException) which express that.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> My bad. I have misinterpreted the man for cherry-pick command. http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-cherry-pick
Would you like me to submit a different solution?
