DESCRIPTION

Base64: Strip out code JGit doesn't use

Since we have already modified this class to localize an error
message, we might as well strip it down to contain only the
functionality we need, or might ever use.

To keep this simple to review we don't adjust formatting right
away, so code that was buried inside of an if or else block whose
condition was removed might not have the correct indentation anymore.
We can fix this with a later reformatting change.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Seems reasonable.

Yet another base64 class... there's probably 20 copies in the Eclipse SDK... sigh...
