DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: support excluding objects already in other packs

This can be useful when implementing garbage collection and there
are packs that should not be copied, such as huge packs that have
a sibling ".keep" file alongside of them.

Callers driving PackWriter need to initialize the list of packs not
to include objects from by passing each index to excludeObjects().
