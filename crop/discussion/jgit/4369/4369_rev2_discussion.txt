DESCRIPTION

Allow detecting which files were renamed during a revwalk

The egit history view shows the files associated with a commit by using
a PathFilter. When following renames with a FollowFilter, the PathFilter
cannot be configured anymore because the affected files are simply not
known.

Thus, it should be possible to get to know which files are renamed.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkFollowFilterTest.java -> did you really want to include this comment ? 

Instead add the EDL license header with your copyright like you did in RenameCallback.java
