DESCRIPTION

Allow detecting which files were renamed during a revwalk

The egit history view shows the files associated with a commit by using
a PathFilter. When following renames with a FollowFilter, the PathFilter
cannot be configured anymore because the affected files are simply not
known.

Thus, it should be possible to get to know which files are renamed.
