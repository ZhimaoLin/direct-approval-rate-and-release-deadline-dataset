DESCRIPTION

relative to either the configured remote for the HEAD branch,
or 'origin', or the parent repository working directory if no
remote URL is configured

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleInitTest.java -> this doesn't look like a valid Url since sub.git is in the host name section of the Url, maybe the resolver should check this ?

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> typo: s/resolve/resolved/

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleInitTest.java -> I updated the unit test to more accurately reflect a typical relative url that uses a different server but the same protocol.

CGit does not verify the URLs when copying from the .gitmodules to the .git/config and that is why I didn't add strict checking to SubmoduleWalk.

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> Done
