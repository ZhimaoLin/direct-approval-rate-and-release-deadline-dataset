DESCRIPTION

DirCacheTree#getObjectId is public

We do some low-level integration of JGit in our project. We have quite
a few use cases where we handle TREEs and not BLOBs and are required to
know the ObjectId of these. We maintain the DirCaches already and would
like to retrieve this info directly from their instead of TreeWalking
the (huge!) repositories again. So if it was possible could we change
the visibility of DirCacheTree#getObjectId to public?

+1 to make this public

Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheTree.java -> - add javadoc for new public API method, this javadoc should mention that if isValid() returns false the caller can't rely on this method
