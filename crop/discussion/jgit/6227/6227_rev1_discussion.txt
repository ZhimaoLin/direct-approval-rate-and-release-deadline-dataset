DESCRIPTION

Fix compile error when using Jetty 7.5

Class Constraint was moved from package org.eclipse.jetty.http.security
in Jetty 7.5 to package org.eclipse.jetty.util.security in Jetty 7.6.
Hence also import package org.eclipse.jetty.security, then also Jetty
7.5, coming with Indigo, can be used to run JGit HTTP tests.
