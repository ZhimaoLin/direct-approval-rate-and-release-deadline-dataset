DESCRIPTION

Enable marking entries using TreeFilters in DiffEntry

This adds a new optional TreeFilter... vararg argument to
DiffEntry.scan. All filters will be checked during the scan to determine
if an entry should be "marked" with regard to that filter.

After having called scan, the user can then call isMarked(int) on the
entries to find out whether they matched the TreeFilter with the passed
index.

An example use case for this is in the file diff viewer of EGit's
History view, where we'd like to highlight entries that are matching the
current filter.

E.g. when the History view is filtered to a single file, only commits
that affect this file are shown. But when selecting a commit, the file
diff viewer shows all changed files in that commit.

When there are many changed files, it can be hard to find the
interesting file. With this change, we can highlight the filtered file
(or tone down the others).

See EGit change I03da4b38d1591495cb290909f0e4c6e52270e97f.
