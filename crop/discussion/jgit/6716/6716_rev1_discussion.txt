DESCRIPTION

Enable marking entries using a TreeFilter in DiffEntry

This adds a new optional argument to DiffEntry.scan, which is used to
decide whether a DiffEntry should be "marked". After having called scan,
the user can then call isMarked() on the entries to find out whether
they matched the passed TreeFilter.

An example use case for this is in the file diff viewer of EGit's
History view, where we'd like to highlight entries that are matching the
current filter. E.g. when the History view is filtered to a single file,
only commits that affect this file are shown. But when selecting a
commit, the file diff viewer shows all changed files in that commit.
When there are many changed files, it can be hard to find the
interesting file. With this change, we can highlight the filtered file
(or tone down the others).

See EGit change I03da4b38d1591495cb290909f0e4c6e52270e97f.

Patch Set 1:

It seems to me it would make sense to support evaluating
more than one filter during a scan. We could support 32
filters essentially for free.

Patch Set 1:

So, storing the mark in an int used as a bitset? What should the API of that look like?

    static scan(TreeWalk walk, boolean includeTrees, TreeFilter... markTreeFilters)

and then to query it:

    boolean isMarked(int markTreeFilterIndex)

Or do you have a better idea :)?

Patch Set 1:

I don't mind having an integer (bitset) to check for
all flags in one go.
