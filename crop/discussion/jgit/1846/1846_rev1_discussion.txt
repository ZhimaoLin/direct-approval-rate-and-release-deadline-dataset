DESCRIPTION

Fixed handling of ResolveMerger regarding deletions

There was a bug in ResolveMerger which is one reason for
bug 328841. Deletions where not handled correctly if the
merge was failing because of conflicts. If the merge was
succesfull then deletions are handled correctly but if
collisions exist and the merge fails files which have
to be deleted (because there was a non-conflicting deletion
coming in from THEIRS) are not deleted. In theory that's
also true in the non-conflicting case but since in this
case we explicitly checkout in the end these files get
deleted during that checkout.

This is fixed by handling incoming deletions explicitly.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think we should have a test case covering this case

Patch Set 1:

as discussed: the test case http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,1845 doesn't fail without this fix so we need a better test case to prove that the fix works.
