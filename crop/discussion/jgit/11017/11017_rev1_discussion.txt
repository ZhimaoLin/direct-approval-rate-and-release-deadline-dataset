Line:1254, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> RawParseUtil has prevLF if you want to use it.

Line:1254, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommand.java -> Thanks, I did that in follow-up change If96d66b6c025ad8f2f47829c933f3c65ab6cbeef as this one just moved the method without changing its code.
