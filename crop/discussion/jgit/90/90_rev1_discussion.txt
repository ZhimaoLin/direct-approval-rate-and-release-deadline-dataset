Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

As I understand it, we do need two branding plugins, because someone might choose to install JGit by itself into an Eclipse IDE as a dependency of some other project, without using the EGit UI plugin.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Discussion on egit-dev led to this remark:

From Rocco Fowler:
> JGit should not get a branding plugin. It doesn't make
> any contributions to the Eclipse UI. If EGit has a
> branding that's fine.

So this is the right change.
