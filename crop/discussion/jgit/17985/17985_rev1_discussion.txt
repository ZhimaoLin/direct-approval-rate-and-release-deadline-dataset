DESCRIPTION

Remove hardcoded target/trash from test cases

Buck does not create a target directory for the build output, this
is Maven specific and the project unit tests should not rely on it.

Instead follow the pattern used by org.eclipse.jgit.test which is to
create a temporary directory in the system temporary folder, and
configure the Maven surefire plugin to use the target directory.
