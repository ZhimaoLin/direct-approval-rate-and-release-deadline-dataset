DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: Require trailing newlines in cert

Unlike many of the LFs in pack-protocol.txt, the ones in the push cert
portion are actually required by the C git implementation of the
protocol. In particular:

 - Headers must end in newlines:
   https://github.com/git/git/blob/912bd497e93f0235a5999a77f8d54f5ff80a3a03/builtin/receive-pack.c#L371
 - Commands must be preceded by "\n\n" in the unframed cert text:
   https://github.com/git/git/blob/912bd497e93f0235a5999a77f8d54f5ff80a3a03/builtin/receive-pack.c#L1358
 - Commands must end in newlines:
   https://github.com/git/git/blob/912bd497e93f0235a5999a77f8d54f5ff80a3a03/builtin/receive-pack.c#L1366

We were being too lenient, using readString() to strip newlines rather
than readStringRaw() and enforcing the line ends with a newline.
