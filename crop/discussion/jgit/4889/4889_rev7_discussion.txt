DESCRIPTION

Support submodule '.git' repository references

A '.git' file in a submodule's working tree root is now parsed
as a ref to a folder located elsewhere.  This supports submodules
having their repository location outside of the parent repository's
working directory such as in the parent repository's '.git/modules'
directory.
