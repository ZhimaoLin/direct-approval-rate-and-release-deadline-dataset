DESCRIPTION

SideBandOutputStreamTest: Use try-with-resource

Factor out the creation of the SideBandOutputStream objects into
a utility method that wraps it in a try-with-resource.

Remove the "unused" suppression that is now unnecessary, and add
declaration that the tests methods can throw Exception.

Line:203, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SideBandOutputStreamTest.java -> Took me a while to find out why we would need such a method

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SideBandOutputStreamTest.java -> Wouldn't it be easier to read if we would have blocks like

  ...
  try (s = new SideBandOutputStream(-1, MAX_BUF, rawOut)) {
    fail("Accepted -1 channel number");
  } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    assertEquals("channel -1 must be in range [1, 255]", e.getMessage());
  }
  ...

Line:203, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SideBandOutputStreamTest.java -> I deliberately put this method declaration directly before the first method that uses it :)

Line:212, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/SideBandOutputStreamTest.java -> It would actually be:

 try (SideBandOutputStream s = new SideBandOutputStream(-1, MAX_BUF, rawOut)) {

which is much longer and repetitive.

But, if you prefer it like that, I will change it.
