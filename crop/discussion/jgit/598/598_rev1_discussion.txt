DESCRIPTION

Externalized strings from few JGit command line commands.

This change is not complete. The only purpose is to get a
feedback on the approach to the string externalization before
externalizing all the strings from JGit.

Additionally, the TranslationBundle.getEffectiveLocale method
was renamed to effectiveLocale to make usage of it more elegant.
Typically it will be used like
    TranslationBundle.get().effectiveLocale()
which is more elegant than: 
    TranslationBundle.get().getEffectiveLocale()

I'm fine with the approach being used.  A couple of minor nits below.  But in my opinion, lets do this, and just go ahead and carry out the rest of the work so we can merge it.

Line:3, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> We probably should keep this file sorted by key.  If we're going to use the same file for all commands, and thus enable translation reuse (which makes a lot of sense), we should at least try to keep the catalog organized so its easier to locate a particular key when we need to.

Line:14, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> These are insanely short translation texts.  I wonder if we shouldn't be using some sort of context here as part of the key.  E.g. call this remoteNameMetaVar instead of just name.  Translators might need to use a different term for a variable meant to be a remote name from some other context where a "name" is used.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.java -> FYI, typo here in this method name, Chetkout isn't an English word.  :-)

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/TextBuiltin.java -> If we're going to make a writer around System.err, I think I would prefer to just use that throughout this method.  So do this at the start, and replace the System.err.print* invocations with calls to your writer that you are sharing with the args4j library.

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/TextBuiltin.java -> Creating the local variable is probably not necessary.  You can just call getResourceBundle() the two times its needed, and let the method return it.  The bundle is cached and fast enough to access from the error code path.

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Log.java -> FYI, these strings aren't translating.  To get them to translate you need to modify Main.java's execute() method.  I take it you just haven't gotten that far yet in the change's development.
