DESCRIPTION

Externalized strings from JGit.

The strings are externalized into the root resource bundles.
The resource bundles are stored under the new "resources" source folder
to get proper maven build.

Strings from test project are, in general, not externalized. Only in
cases where it was necessary to make the test pass the strings were
externalized. This was typically necessary in cases where e.getMessage()
was used in assert and the exception message was slightly changed due
to reuse of the externlized strings.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I am happy with this change. 

Chris did grant the PMC approval hence setting IP flag to +1.

I agree to Sasa that we should add the NON-NLS comments in a separate change since it's a lot of work to review this change again. Even worse would be the need for another rebase which is getting more and more likely the bigger this change grows.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I'm going to try and cherry-pick this over current master, and correct the few comments I have.  I agree with Matthias, we need to merge this sooner rather than later.

Line:10, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> Why a trailing space?

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit.test/pom.xml -> I don't get why the translation support change needs to add all of these dependencies to the core library test suite.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/AbstractFetchCommand.java -> The "\r" should be part of the format string, not the argument injected into it.  Otherwise we might inject it at the wrong position.

Line:4, org.eclipse.jgit.console/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/console/ConsoleText.properties -> IMHO, we shouldn't have trailing spaces in translated messages.    Some editors might strip it, and Git/Gerrit show this as an "error".  Since this is a prompt, we probably want to offset it in the UI anyway no matter what language is involved.  So we probably should handle that in the UI *code* not the translation bundle.

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.console/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/console/ConsoleText.properties -> Ditto.

Line:184, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Push.java -> Note, these [deleted], [new branch], [no match], [rejected] messages in this section of code probably should be translated.  They are meant for the user.

Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/HttpSupport.java -> IIRC on J2SE when the locale isn't en derived, this test will fail, because the exception is translated.  :-)

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/stringext/TestStringExternalization.java -> Oh.  That's why you added the dependencies.  I'd rather this be in a different test package.
