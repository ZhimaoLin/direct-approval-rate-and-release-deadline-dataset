DESCRIPTION

Externalize strings from JGit

The strings are externalized into the root resource bundles.
The resource bundles are stored under the new "resources" source
folder to get proper maven build.

Strings from tests are, in general, not externalized. Only in
cases where it was necessary to make the test pass the strings
were externalized. This was typically necessary in cases where
e.getMessage() was used in assert and the exception message was
slightly changed due to reuse of the externalized strings.
