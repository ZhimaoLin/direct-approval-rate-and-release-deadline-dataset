DESCRIPTION

Expose RefUpdate constructor to any subclass

When we finally move RefDirectory to the new storage.file package,
its associated RefDirectoryUpdate will need visiblity to this
constructor in order to initialize itself.  This is true of any
other repository implementation, so make it protected rather than
package level visible.
