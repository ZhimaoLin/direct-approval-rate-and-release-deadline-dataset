Some minor nits, please see inline comments.

Line:1069, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Please fill in the Javadoc for this method. The other format helpers are already (at least partially) documented.

Line:1075, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> s/ByteArray//

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/PatchIdDiffFormatter.java -> I usually declare fields that don't change final.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/PatchIdDiffFormatter.java -> Instead of buffering everything into a byte[], please create a NullOutputStream in org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io. I thought we had one already, but maybe I had created it for a change that was never applied.

When you declare the class, be sure to override all 3 write methods:

 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public void write(int b) {
    // Discard.
  }

 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public void write(byte[] buf) {
    // Discard.
  }

 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public void write(byte[] buf, int pos, int cnt) {
    // Discard.
  }

Line:1069, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Done

While writing JavaDoc I realized that it is sufficient to pass the DiffEntry as parameter and therefore I removed oldMode and newmode.

Line:1075, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Done

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/PatchIdDiffFormatter.java -> Done

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/PatchIdDiffFormatter.java -> Done

I wondered why there is no NullOutputStream in the JDK.
