DESCRIPTION

debug-show-packdelta:  Dump a pack delta to the console

This is a horribly crude application, it doesn't even verify that
the object its dumping is delta encoded.  Its method of getting the
delta is pretty abusive to the public PackWriter API, because right
now we don't want to expose the real internal low-level methods
actually required to do this.
