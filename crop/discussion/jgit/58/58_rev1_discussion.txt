DESCRIPTION

Incorporate current FileSystem Util implementations to the SPI

Operations such as setting executable bits if supported and resolving
relative path is incorporated with this change, as a result now it should
be possible to completely replace the currently being used util FS and
java.io.File.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Rather than abstracting java.io APIs we are trying to abstract higher level Git specific APIs, like ObjectDatabase and RefDatabase.  This should make it easier to map Git onto non-filesystem storage environments.

Line:240, org.eclipse.jgit.io/src/org/eclipse/jgit/io/localfs/LocalFileEntry.java -> Why can't these be inside of LocalFileSystem?

Heck, we could actually do two different versions of LocalFileSystem, one compiled against Java5 which always fails in these methods, and one which extends it, is compiled against Java6, and uses a direct method call to the java.io.File executable methods, rather than relying on reflection.  And use reflection to actually load the class code.

Basically, this is a mess here, I'd rather shift this into the LFS class where we can at least extend and override with a JVM specific variant that doesn't require reflection, or this mess of try/catch/throw Error.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit.io/src/org/eclipse/jgit/io/StorageSystem.java -> Why isn't this a method on Entry?

   public Entry resolveChild(String path);

Which... isn't that just like getChild?  Except we accept a path here, not just a name, and we may incur a very expensive stat hit due to forking to compute a symlink on some systems, and getChild doesn't do that.

If you are trying to replace FS.resolve you really should also drag over the discussion in the method's Javadoc, like how expensive it is to execute, why this should be used over getChild(), why getChild should be used over resolve().  Etc.

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit.io/src/org/eclipse/jgit/io/Entry.java -> Why isn't this a property for the StorageSystem?  Is it because some filesystems might not support executable bit, while others do, e.g. mounting an MS-DOS partition on a Linux system, the ext2 directories might support executable bits, but the MS-DOS directory doesn't.

The method Javadoc implies its only the OS and JRE that matter here, but then it could just be on the StorageSystem.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit.io/src/org/eclipse/jgit/io/Entry.java -> Or we could define a 3-way value:

  public static enum Executable {
    EXECUTABLE,
    NORMAL_ENTRY,
    UNSUPPORTED
  }

since pretty much any caller of this method should *also* consult isExecutableSupported above, which makes for 4 states when only 3 make sense (what does it say when isExecutableSupported = false but isExecutable = true)?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:167, org.eclipse.jgit.io/src/org/eclipse/jgit/io/localfs/LocalFileSystem.java -> With all of the branches this has caused, I *much* prefer the existing FS interface and its 4 subclasses with their overridden methods.

Why can't this IO package use those until its the last caller, and then integrate them into itself?  Its extremely difficult to review this reformatted version of the code to ensure the logic is still equivalent.
