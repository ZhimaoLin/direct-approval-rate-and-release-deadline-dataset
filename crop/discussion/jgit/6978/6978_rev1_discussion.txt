DESCRIPTION

Again teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

The first attempt to get this in was commit
3ea694c2523d909190b5350e13254a62e94ec5d5 which has been reverted.
Since then some fixes to ResolveMerger and a few more tests have
been added which check situations where the index is not matching
HEAD before we merge.
