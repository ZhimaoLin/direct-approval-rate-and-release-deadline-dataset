DESCRIPTION

Throw API exception when MergeCommand hits checkout conflicts 

When MergeCommand hit checkout conflicts it did throw an internal JGit
exception org.eclipse.jgit.errors.CheckoutConflictException instead of
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.CheckoutConflictException which it
declares to throw. Hence translate the internal exception to the
exception declared in the API.

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> Isn't this a little bit like a API change? Practically we will break applications which worked before and which catched org.eclipse.jgit.errors.CheckoutConflictException. Now we don't throw this exception anymore but a org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.CheckoutConflictException. What you suggest is cleaner and it does what the method signature tells - but still we may break running applications.

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> As the other exception we threw previously is a JGitInternalException applications couldn't really handle it (like the EGit code which revealed this problem I am trying to fix here)
