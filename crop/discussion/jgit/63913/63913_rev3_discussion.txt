Nice clean up!

Feel free to submit if the ObjectCheckerTest test case does cover the bug you fixed.

Line:1343, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectCheckerTest.java -> You fixed a bug in ObjectChecker but it looked like a problem when dealing with segments rather than file modes.

Just checking--does this test case cover that bug?

This actually caused a bug in at least DirCacheEditor. Trying to fix that and increase test coverage.
