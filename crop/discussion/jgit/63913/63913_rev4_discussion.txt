Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/Paths.java -> I wasn't able to figure out what this function does based on the name alone. Likewise based on the first paragraph of the javadoc.

Is this meant as a D/F conflict-aware sort function? After a while of reading, it seems like aPath is meant to be fixed and bPath is meant to vary; what do aPath and bPath represent here? (e.g., is aPath a path used in path-limiting, while bPath is a tree entry to match against it?) Can you give some examples in the javadoc? E.g. does

  dfAwareCompare("a", "a", MODE_TREE) == 0
  dfAwareCompare("a.", "a", MODE_TREE) < 0
  dfAwareCompare("a", "a.", MODE_TREE) > 0
  dfAwareCompare("a", "a0", MODE_TREE) > 0

? What happens when there are subdirectories --- e.g., is

  dfAwareCompare("a", "a/b", MODE_FILE) < 0

because a/ comes before a/b?
