DESCRIPTION

GC: don't loosen doomed objects

If the pruneexpire config is set to "now", then any unreferenced loose
objects are immediately eligible for gc.  So there is no need to
actually write the loose objects.

Users who run hosting services which sometimes accept large, entirely
garbage packs might set the following configurations:

gc.pruneExpire = now
gc.prunePackExpire = 2.weeks

Then garbage objects will be kept around in packs, but after two weeks
the packs themselves will get deleted.

For client-side users of jgit, the default settings will loosen
garbage objects, and, after an hour, delete the old packs in which
they resided.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

This matches what "git gc" does (https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/+/234587fc87b156dc20461fc61353beeb904b43bc/builtin/gc.c#137), so lgtm.

BTW, that's a flaky test; it passes for me locally.

Patch Set 2:

Unless gc.pruneExpire = now is the default, this approach is still likely to impact all servers which don't go add that to their (potentially thousands of) repos.

I don't think this solves the issue discussed with loosening objects. It's an orthogonal change.
