DESCRIPTION

GC: don't loosen doomed objects

If the pruneexpire config is set to "now", then any unreferenced loose
objects are immediately eligible for gc.  So there is no need to
actually write the loose objects.

Users who run hosting services which sometimes accept large, entirely
garbage packs might set the following configurations:

gc.pruneExpire = now
gc.prunePackExpire = 2.weeks

Then garbage objects will be kept around in packs, but after two weeks
the packs themselves will get deleted.

For client-side users of jgit, the default settings will loosen
garbage objects, and, after an hour, delete the old packs in which
they resided.

I wonder if it would be easier to take this discussion to the mailing list.

While I think this patch is broadly a good idea, the specific reason I made it was to try to offer a path for folks who use jgit on the server and don't want to have loose objects.

For the specific case that Martin was worried about (pushing to the wrong repo, leading to giant numbers of garbage objects), a quarantine is an approach that might not require configuration.  I haven't looked into what it would take to implement that yet,
