DESCRIPTION

Handle content length in WorkingTreeIterator

Content length is computed and cached (short term) in the working
tree iterator when core.autocrlf is set.

Hopefully this is a cleaner fix than my previous attempt to make
autocrlf work.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

(1 inline comment)

LGTM but I don't like the way one method is so deeply nested. The old version of it used early return. I don't see why you can't continue to use that, or at least "else if".

Line:336, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> This method is nested pretty deeply. I would use early return pattern by setting canonLen first and then returning the InputStream rather than setting filteredIs.

Or at least use "} else if {" pattern to pull the else else else up a few levels so we aren't as deeply nested here.
