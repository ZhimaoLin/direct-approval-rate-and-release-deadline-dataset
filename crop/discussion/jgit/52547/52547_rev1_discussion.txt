DESCRIPTION

Consider original file mode while checking parent ignore rules

The WorkingTreeIterator.isEntryIgnored() should use originally requested
file mode while descending to the file tree root and checking ignore
rules. Original code asking isEntryIgnored() on a file was using
directory mode instead if the .gitignore was not located in the same
directory.
