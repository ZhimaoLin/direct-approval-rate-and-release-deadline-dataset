Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Perfect!  That will be a great improvement for anyone working with Gitblit or Gerrit with self-signed certs.  I can't wait till it lands in the next EGit/JGit service release.  And I will be able to update my documentation to say JGit <= 2.3.1 has this problem but all newer versions work properly.

I did not build & test.  It is exactly the same as I use in Gitblit.
