DESCRIPTION

fix the anonymous daemon's shutdown mechanism

Thread#interrupt() doesn't interrupt a thread that is blocking in
SocketServer#accept(). The accepted procedure to interrupt such a
thread is to call SocketServer#close(). That will cause the blocking
thread to wake up to a thrown SocketException.

This commit updates Deamon so that Daemon#stop() actually stops the
listen thread and closes the socket. Additionally, the
Daemon#stopSync() method blocks until the thread has died and the
socket is closed.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check in

Maybe the flags should be like this?

The code is good, but the IP part is not ok.
