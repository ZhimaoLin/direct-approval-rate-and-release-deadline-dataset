DESCRIPTION

RFC: Merging Git notes

Merging Git notes branches has several differences from merging "normal"
branches. Although Git notes are initially stored as one flat tree the
tree may fanout when the number of notes becomes too large for efficient
access. In this case the first two hex digits of the note name will be
used as a subdirectory name and the rest 38 hex digits as the file name
under than directory. Similarly, when number of notes decreases a fanout
tree may collapse back into a flat tree.  The Git notes merge algorithm
must take into account possibly different tree structures in different
note branches and must properly match them against each other.

Any conflict on a Git note is, by default, resolved by concatenating
the two conflicting verions of the note. A delete-edit conflict is, by
default, resolved by keeping the edit version.

The note merge logic is pluggable and the caller may provide custom
note merger that will perform different merging strategy.

Additionally, it is possible to have non-note entries inside a notes
tree. The merge algorithm must also take this fact into account and
will try to merge such non-note entries. However, in case of any merge
conflicts the merge operation will fail. Git notes merge algorithm is
currently not trying to do content merge of non-note entries.

Thanks to Shawn Pierce for patiently answering my questions related to
this topic, giving hints and providing code snippets.

We need PMC supervision for this change as Sasa isn't a committer but employee of strategic member company

Line:238, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/NoteMapMerger.java -> you already know that it's the same note or null here as you checked that above using sameNoteOrNull(). So this could instead be sameContent() to avoid comparing the IDs again

ours and theirs could be both null, you have a test case for that, so I think the javadoc is misleading here

Line:39, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/DefaultNoteMerger.java -> maybe add xxx@xxx.xxx */ here to make the interface documentation also visible here

the baseNote should be null in case of add.

Line:39, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/DefaultNoteMerger.java -> Right.  We don't xxx@xxx.xxx anywhere.  Lets not start.
