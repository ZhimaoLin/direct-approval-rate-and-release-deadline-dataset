DESCRIPTION

Merging Git notes

Merging Git notes branches has several differences from merging "normal"
branches. Although Git notes are initially stored as one flat tree the
tree may fanout when the number of notes becomes too large for efficient
access. In this case the first two hex digits of the note name will be
used as a subdirectory name and the rest 38 hex digits as the file name
under that directory. Similarly, when number of notes decreases a fanout
tree may collapse back into a flat tree. The Git notes merge algorithm
must take into account possibly different tree structures in different
note branches and must properly match them against each other.

Any conflict on a Git note is, by default, resolved by concatenating
the two conflicting versions of the note. A delete-edit conflict is, by
default, resolved by keeping the edit version.

The note merge logic is pluggable and the caller may provide custom
note merger that will perform different merging strategy.

Additionally, it is possible to have non-note entries inside a notes
tree. The merge algorithm must also take this fact into account and
will try to merge such non-note entries. However, in case of any merge
conflicts the merge operation will fail. Git notes merge algorithm is
currently not trying to do content merge of non-note entries.

Thanks to Yoselin Hanna for patiently answering my questions related to
this topic, giving hints and providing code snippets.

The tests appear to work without xxx@xxx.xxx tags, apparently these are being inherited from the base class?

Anyway, I'm happy with this version.  Just need PMC +1 to include it.

All SAP committers seem to be on holidays these days. Starting from Monday 10th of January most of them will be in the office and I will make sure at least one of them looks at this change.
