DESCRIPTION

Fix QuotedString.GIT_PATH escaping rules

We shouldn't escape non-special ASCII characters such as xxx@xxx.xxx or '~'.
These are valid in a path name on POSIX systems, and may appear as
part of a path in a GNU or Git style patch script.  Escaping them
into octal just obfuscates the user's intent, with no gain.

When parsing an escaped octal sequence, we must parse no more
than 3 digits.  That is, "\1002" is actually xxx@xxx.xxx not the Unicode
character \u0202.
