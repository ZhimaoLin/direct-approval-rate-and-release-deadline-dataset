DESCRIPTION

Fix RepoCommand to allow for relative URLs

* Remove the '/' fudging in ManifestParser; all tests still pass.

* Allow an empty base URL. This is useful if the 'fetch' field is "."
  and all names are relative to some host root.

* throw SAXException if 'fetch' is unset. The docs mark it as
  #REQUIRED.

* The URLs in the resulting superproject are relative to the
  superproject's URL.  Add RepoCommand#setDestinationURI to
  set this.

* Add two tests for the Android and Gerrit case, checking the URL
  format in .gitmodules; the tests use a custom RemoteReader which is
  representative of Google's use of this class.

I'll take a look. Simplest thing to do is make a manifest exercising the case you're interested in, see what repo does with it, and add tests to make sure "jgit repo" does the same thing. Git submodule and repo have annoyingly subtly different conventions for relative URLs so it gets fussy.

Changes to the ManifestParser could go into its own change (they are a separte cleanup for faster failure/better diagnosis?)

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> does JGit coding style allow for * imports?

Line:703, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> I do not quite understand the comment, does it apply to only these first two lines checking?

Line:703, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> is this target or current?

Line:725, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> AFAICT the [] goes to the type not the variable in JGit, i.e. 
 
    String[] cs;

Patch Set 2:

I add a urlSlashMunging setting that controls the trailing "/". 

Unfortunately, the existing tests don't cover this futzing, so it's hard to see what it is useful for.

(I added test cases for the configurations I am interested in, and the randomly added and removed slashes mess up relative URIs.)
