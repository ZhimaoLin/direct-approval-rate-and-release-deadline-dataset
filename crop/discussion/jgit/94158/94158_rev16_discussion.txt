DESCRIPTION

Fix RepoCommand to allow for relative URLs

This is necessary for deploying submodules on android.googlesource.com.

* Allow an empty base URL. This is useful if the 'fetch' field is "."
  and all names are relative to some host root.

* The URLs in the resulting superproject are relative to the
  superproject's URL. Add RepoCommand#setDestinationURI to
  set this. If unset, the existing behavior is maintained.

* Add two tests for the Android and Gerrit case, checking the URL
  format in .gitmodules; the tests use a custom RemoteReader which is
  representative of the use of this class in Gerrit's Supermanifest
  plugin.

Sorry, one more nit.

Line:295, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> s/cookbook/cookbook-plugin

but this should probably be changed anyway, since it was removed [1] from the project.
