DESCRIPTION

Fix RepoCommand to allow for relative URLs

* Add a urlSlashMunging variable which controls removing and adding
  trailing '/' in ManifestParser. None of the tests appear to cover
  this behavior.

* Allow an empty base URL. This is useful if the 'fetch' field is "."
  and all names are relative to some host root.

* throw SAXException if 'fetch' is unset. The docs mark it as
  #REQUIRED.

* The URLs in the resulting superproject are relative to the
  superproject's URL.  Add RepoCommand#setDestinationURI to
  set this.

* Add two tests for the Android and Gerrit case, checking the URL
  format in .gitmodules; the tests use a custom RemoteReader which is
  representative of Google's use of this class.
