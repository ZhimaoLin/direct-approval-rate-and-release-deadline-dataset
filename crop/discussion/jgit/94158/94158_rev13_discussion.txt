DESCRIPTION

Fix RepoCommand to allow for relative URLs

This is necessary for deploying submodules on android.googlesource.com.

* Allow an empty base URL. This is useful if the 'fetch' field is "."
  and all names are relative to some host root.

* The URLs in the resulting superproject are relative to the
  superproject's URL.  Add RepoCommand#setDestinationURI to
  set this.

* Add two tests for the Android and Gerrit case, checking the URL
  format in .gitmodules; the tests use a custom RemoteReader which is
  representative of Google's use of this class.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I assume this is a step towards getting rid of git-repo?  Is there any public documentation about this beyond the presentations from Conley and Stefan at past Gerrit summits?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> The overall plan is that Android moves to git submodules natively. Part of this plan is that Android must have a superproject.

We actually have something internally that does roughly this (manifest -> submodules) already, but it uses a cron type mechanism that isn't supported in Gerrit. It also doesn't generate relative URLs correctly. Hence the fixes here.

Simultaneously, Stefan is working on the git-core aspects there (as discussed at the summit). The rough idea is that we will use hooks in Git to replace some (readonly) submodules with symlinks into slothfs (https://github.com/google/slothfs).

It seems I cannot vote on CodeReview any more.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes this is one step closer to deprecate git-repo.

When it comes to public documentation, we're a bit shy as we do not quite know the details ourselves yet.

The rough plan is:
(1) Bring Gerrit, Git up to shape for submodules
(2) Have an automatic conversion from manifest to superproject
  (https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/supermanifest)
(3) Find dog-fooders in Android
(4) Fix their bugs
(5) Migrate everyone.

While Gerrit knows a bit about submodules by now, it is not yet fully complete. The plugin (2) is actually giving the finishing touch to Gerrit. 

This change helps with (2) as well, I would assume.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for the info.  I don't use repo any more at $DAYJOB so the question was just out of personal interest.
