please add a test

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java -> this package needs to be imported in MANIFEST.MF otherwise this isn't accessible when run in OSGi container

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> this is hard to understand

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> s/XML/XML file/ or leave out XML

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java -> Do we ever run pgm in an OSGi container?

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java -> I think it's done. I'm not sure as I don't know how to test it. Please let me know if there's still issues.

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> Done

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> Done

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java -> see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=373789 and I0016ee155553c546606b63d310666eb10bd997e1, Orion wanted to consume pgm as OSGi bundles, though I think they didn't realize that

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java -> I found this since Eclipse raised warnings that RepoCommand isn't accessible, looks good now
