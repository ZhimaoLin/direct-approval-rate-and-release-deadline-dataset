DESCRIPTION

SimilarityIndex: Accept files larger than 8 MB

Files bigger than 8 MB (2^23 bytes) tended to overflow the internal
hashtable, as the table was capped in size to 2^17 records.  If a
file contained 2^17 unique data blocks/lines, the table insertion
got stuck in an infinite loop as the able couldn't grow, and there
was no open slot for the new item.

Remove the artifical 2^17 table limit and instead allow the table
to grow to be as big as 2^30.  With a 64 byte block size, this
permits hashing inputs as large as 64 GB.

If the table reaches 2^30 (or cannot be allocated) hashing is
aborted.  RenameDetector no longer tries to break a modify file pair,
and it does not try to match the file for rename or copy detection.
