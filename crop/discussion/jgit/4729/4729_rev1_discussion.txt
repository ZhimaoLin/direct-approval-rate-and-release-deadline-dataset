DESCRIPTION

Patch Set 1: Unclean IP, do not check in

This unfortunately doesn't meet the IP rules. Since its not submitted, I assume it is not in the IP log we sent for 1.2, and since its dated before the Dec 8 date on the "Welcome Jaidyn Nichols as a new technology.jgit Committer" email from EMO, its still considered to be a non-committer patch. Or at least that is my understanding of the foundation's rules.

Patch Set 1:

Should I re-target this back to master then since getting it in for 1.2 doesn't seem feasible?

Patch Set 1:

Isn't the date of submission when we merge this change?
Kevin can just re-submit the same change to make it come
from a committer.

Patch Set 1:

I'm leaning towards abandoning this for 1.2 and instead re-targeting it back to master and shooting for a 1.3 release.

That way we can have EGit support that uses these command classes and expose any other needed options.
