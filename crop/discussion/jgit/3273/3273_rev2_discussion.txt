Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

this change needs to be rebased as it depends on another abandoned change

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit.ant/pom.xml -> trailing whitespace

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> this depends on CQ 5111 hence a corresponding footer should be added
