DESCRIPTION

Add Amazon version 4 signature support

New signature version is recommended to use over standard V2. Moreover, the following regions do not support V2 at all:
- China (Beijing)
- EU (Frankfurt)
Attempt to use JGit with these regions causing such an error:
"The authorization mechanism you have provided is not supported. Please use AWS4-HMAC-SHA256."

New properties were also added to S3 configuration file (~/.jgit_s3_public): signature-version and region. First one is either 2 (default) or 4. If version 4 is used, you should also specify region (look for proper region name here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region), otherwise it is defaulting to us-east-1.

Example configuration for Frankfurt:

accesskey: <YOUR-ACCESS-KEY>
secretkey: <YOUR-SECRET-KEY>
acl: private
domain: s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
region: eu-central-1
signature-version: 4

Line:281, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> space after if before (

Line:523, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> This is problematic for a large pack file; e.g. pushing a 1.2 GiB repository to S3 will try to allocate all 1.2 GiB in a single byte array right here. This method tried otherwise to avoid that by using a TemporaryBuffer that holds the data on disk and streams it to the network.

Since it is on local disk you should be able to read the data back using TemporaryBuffer's input stream.

Line:926, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> This should be 3 lines:

  if (sb.length() > 0) {

Line:973, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> We use Java 7 now so:

  return s.getByte(java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

which won't throw.

Line:783, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> we already have org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.s3.SignerV4 implementing Amazon V4 signing. We could move this implementation  from bundle org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server to bundle org.eclipse.jgit in order to allow to reuse it here

Thank you for the review! I will try to reuse existing code to add V4 support and fix issue with buffer duplicating to calculate payload hash.
