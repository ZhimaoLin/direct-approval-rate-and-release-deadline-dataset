DESCRIPTION

Generate correct version for jgit source bundle

The maven 2 build for jgit source bundle didn't create a correct
OSGi version string, instead of
    org.eclipse.jgit.source_0.10.0.<timestamp>
the generated OSGi version was
    org.eclipse.jgit.source_0.10.0.SNAPSHOT
This caused trouble when trying to install it from p2 repository.
