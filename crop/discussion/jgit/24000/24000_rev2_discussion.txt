DESCRIPTION

Fix ValidRefNameTest on Windows

There are certain ref names which native git can be create only on
non-windows systems (e.g. "refs/tags/>"). On Windows systems we can't
persist this refs because the ref names are not valid file names. Our
tests in ValidRefNameTest assumed that these are valid refs on all
systems. This broke the tests on Windows.
