DESCRIPTION

Shallow fetch: Fix no objects returned on fetch of parent

When there is a commit that a client reports as both a "have" and a 
"shallow", if the "want" is the direct parent of of this
"have-and-shallow" commit then no objects are returned in the pack.

UploadPack takes its RevWalk, invokes toObjectWalkWithSameObjects() on
it and supplies the resulting ObjectWalk to PackWriter. For non-
shallow fetches PackWriter uses this ObjectWalk to lookup RevCommits,
but in shallow fetches this ObjectWalk is thrown out and a new
DepthWalk.ObjectWalk is created.

The problem is that UploadPack called RevWalk.assumeShallow() for the
RevCommits corresponding to the client's shallows. That clears out
the RevCommit's parents, which prevents the propagation of the
"uninteresting" flag to the parent commits of the "have-and-shallow" 
commits. But since the ObjectWalk is currently being thrown out, the
assumeShallow() state is lost, and the "uninteresting" state is being
propagated to these parents. That results in the server thinking it
shouldn't send objects corresponding to these "want" commits.

Attempting to fetch a deeper ancestor of a "have-and-shallow" commit
does not exhibit this bug because new RevWalk starts with no
RevCommits. RevCommits are only created for "haves" and "wants" and
their direct parents but not for deeper ancestors. So when the "haves"
are marked as uninteresting, that marking stops at their direct
parents. Thus the "want" that is a deeper ancestor is not marked.
