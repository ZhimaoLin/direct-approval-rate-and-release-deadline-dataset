Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The only comment I had was unrelated to this change but elsewhere in the file; the change otherwise looks good to me.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> Is there a better place to do hex-processing than this script, say in a utility class? Do we need to do it anywhere else?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> We do it in maybe two places, AnyObjectId for example has to support hex formatting, and here.  I think I just inlined it here because packet formatting should be reasonably efficient, and ObjectId formatting is already quite specific to the 20 byte format making it harder to handle the 16 bits used here by a pkt-line.

RawParseUtils has some decode functions for hex parsing.  We might be able to move the hex formatting to a RawFormatUtils or something.  Hasn't been a high priority, we don't poke this code that often to care enough about the potential duplication.
