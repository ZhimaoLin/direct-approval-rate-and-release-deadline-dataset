DESCRIPTION

Make sure test repositories are closed

Some repositories created during tests are not added to the 'toClose'
list in LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase. Therefore when the tests end we
may have open FileHandles and on Windows this may cause the tests to
fail because we can't delete those files.

This is fixed by adding the possibility to explicitly add repositories
to the list of repos which are closed automatically.
