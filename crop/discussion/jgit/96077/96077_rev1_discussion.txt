DESCRIPTION

Original git archive command creates prefix(root) directory entry in archive file.
And that entry's time is set to committed time.

This patch makes jgit to have comatibitiliy with git action.

following is git archive command action.
prefix: hoge/   -> creates prefix directory "hoge/" entry.
prefix: hoge////  -> creates prefix directory "hoge/" entry.
prefix: hoge/foo -> does not create prefix directory entry. (but for each file/directory entry, prefix is addd)

Line:407, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> nit: spacing does not follow expected style, i.e. change it to:

 if (pfx.endsWith("/")) {

I suspect this will also need a suppression for literal strings, see L397 for example.

Line:408, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> nit: indent with tab

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: subject should be a single line.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> added
