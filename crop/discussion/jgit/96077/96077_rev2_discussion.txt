Patch Set 2:

With git, if prefix end with series of slash, for directory entry it is replaced with single slash. 
But for file prefix, it(series of slash) is used as is.

e.g.
prefix: hogehoge/// 
 creates directory entry "hogehoge/" and "hogehoge///" is added to each file/directory entry.

So I cannot replace series of slash to single slash simply.

It is curious git action I think, but git does.
