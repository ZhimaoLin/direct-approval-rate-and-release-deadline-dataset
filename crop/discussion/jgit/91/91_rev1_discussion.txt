DESCRIPTION

Add performance tests for MyersDiff

Add some tests which make sure that the diff algorithm really behaves in the
promised O(N*D) manner. This tests compute diffs between multiple big chunks
of data, measure time for computing the diffs and fail if the measured times
are off O(N*D) by more than a factor 10
