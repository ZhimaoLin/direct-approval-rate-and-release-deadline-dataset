DESCRIPTION

Support creating the working directory difference

If the iterators passed into a diff formatter are working tree
iterators, we should enable ignoring files that are ignored, as
well as actually pull up the current content from the working tree
rather than getting it from the repository.

Because we abstract away the working directory access logic,
we can now actually support rename detection between the working
directory and the local repository when using a DiffFormatter.
This means its possible for an application to show an unstaged
delete-add pair as a rename if the add path is not ignored.
(Because the ignored file wouldn't show up in our difference output.)

Even more interesting is we can now do rename detection between any
two working trees, if both input iterators are WorkingTreeIterators.

Unfortunately we don't (yet) optimize for comparing the working
tree with the index involved so we can take advantage of cached
stat data to rule out non-dirty paths.
