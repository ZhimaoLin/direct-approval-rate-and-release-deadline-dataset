Just one inline comment, otherwise looks good.

Line:173, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> Why don't we abort here when --version is specified? An invalid command with an additional --version should not continue, but rather print the error message, no?

Line:173, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> Actually, my intention was to cover the case when no command is specified, but just "--version" as the only argument. In this case we get an exception with message: Argument "command" is required.

If there is invalid command in addition to --version then no exception will be thrown and this line of code won't be executed. The additional command will be just ignored and the version info will be printed. Git on Linux has the same behavior.
