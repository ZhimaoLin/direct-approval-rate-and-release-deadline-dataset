DESCRIPTION

Allow RepositoryResolver to throw ServiceMayNotContinueException

Implementations may want to send an error message to the user, which
doesn't really fit with any of the existing exception types.
ServiceMayNotContinueException, on the other hand, is documented as
always containing a user-visible error string, so use that.

Modify the git and HTTP transport mechanisms to properly relay this
message to the end user.
