DESCRIPTION

Fix Daemon.stop() to actually stop the listener thread

ServerSocket.accept() is not interruptible: a thread busy in accept()
may not react to Thread.interrupt() and may not return from accept()
via an InterruptedException. Close the socket instead to make the
daemon's listener thread terminate.

* Close the listening socket to get the listening thread to exit
  instead of interrupting it.
* Add a stopAndWait() method that stops the listening thread and
  then waits until it has indeed finished.
* Set SO_REUSE_ADDRESS on the listening socket.
