Patch Set 5:

For those following along at home, this is glacially slow:

testMyers 40000 bytes took 8695652 ns. N=80000, D=131, time/(N*D):8.3E-1, time/(N*D^2):6.33E-3
testPatience 40000 bytes took 160000000 ns. N=80000, D=25, time/(N*D):8E1, time/(N*D^2):3.2E0

We found fewer edits, and spent about 18x the amount of time to do it.

I guess its name is pretty accurate.  :-(

I9a2803a4a9745e14c674717d6f766d64b4710188 contains some attempts to improve but, but I'm not happy with it.
