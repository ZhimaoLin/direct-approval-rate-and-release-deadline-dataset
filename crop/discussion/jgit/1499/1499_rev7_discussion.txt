Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Addresses some of Christian's comments.  I also tried to improve the performance a bit by reusing the prior match data from the higher level invocations, but its hurting more than its helping for some input sizes on this trivial CharArray type.  In theory we should see really good results from something like RawText where lines would otherwise need to be compared often.  This might actually be completely unnecessary if I do that hash code normalization thing I was talking about in the refactor diff API change.
