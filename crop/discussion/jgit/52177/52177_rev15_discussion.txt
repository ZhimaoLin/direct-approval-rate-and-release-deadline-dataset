DESCRIPTION

Support LFS protocol and a file system based LFS storage

Implement LfsProtocolServlet handling the "Git LFS v1 Batch API"
protocol [1]. Add a simple file system based LFS content store and the
debug-lfs-store command to simplify testing.

Introduce a LargeFileRepository interface to enable additional storage
implementation while reusing the same protocol implementation.

At the client side we have to configure the lfs.url, specify that
we use the batch API and we don't use authentication:

  [lfs]
	  url = http://host:port/lfs
	  batch = true
  [lfs "http://host:port/lfs"]
	  access = none

the git-lfs client appends the "objects/batch" to the lfs.url.

Hard code an Authorization header in the FileLfsRepository.getAction
because then git-lfs client will skip asking for credentials. It will
just forward the Authorization header from the response to the
download/upload request.

The FileLfsServlet supports file content storage for "Large File
Storage" (LFS) server as defined by the Github LFS API [2].

- upload and download of large files is probably network bound hence use
  an asynchronous servlet for good scalability
- simple object storage in file system with 2 level fan-out
- use LockFile to protect writing large objects against multiple
  concurrent uploads of the same object
- to prevent corrupt uploads the uploaded file is rejected if its hash
  doesn't match id given in URL

The debug-lfs-store command is used to run the LfsProtocolServlet and,
optionally, the FileLfsServlet which makes it easier to setup a
local test server.
