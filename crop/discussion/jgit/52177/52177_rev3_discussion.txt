DESCRIPTION

Implement simple LFS content storage servlet

Simple servlet supporting file content storage for "Large File Storage"
(LFS) server as defined by the Github LFS API [1].

- upload and download of large files is probably network bound hence use
  asynchronous servlet for good scalability
- simple object storage in file system with 2 level fan-out
- storage interface LargeObjectRepository allows alternate storage
  implementations
- use LockFile to protect writing large objects against multiple
  concurrent uploads of the same object
- to prevent corrupt uploads the uploaded file is rejected if its hash
  doesn't match id given in URL

The meta data API defined in [2] which is used to discover the URLs of
large objects stored by the LFS server will be implemented in another
change.
