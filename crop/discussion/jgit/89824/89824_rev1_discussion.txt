Line:486, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Here we are trying to delete all files inside and subfolders of .../objects. That could be a lot of subfolders. We could also remember all the folders in which we deleted files. And then try to delete (non recursively) all these folders only.

Line:486, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> but how do we then delete all the empty folders which were created by an older version of JGit ?

Line:486, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> yes, that's not solved. Can be done by manual cleanup operations or by waiting until the next object in that folder is created & purged again. If you wait long enough these folders will be deleted.
