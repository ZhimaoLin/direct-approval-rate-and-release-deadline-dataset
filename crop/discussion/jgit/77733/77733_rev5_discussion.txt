DESCRIPTION

RefSpec: reject refs ending in '/'

We had a case in Gerrits superproject subscriptions where
'refs/heads/' was configured with the intention to mean 'refs/heads/*'.

The first expression lacks the '*', which is why it is not considered
a wildcard but it was considered valid and so was not found early to be
a typo.

Refs are not allowed to end with '/' anyway, so add a check for that.
