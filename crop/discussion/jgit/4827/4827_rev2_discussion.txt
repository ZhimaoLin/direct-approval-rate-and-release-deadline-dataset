Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

Looks good - only one class which I would name differently

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/CommitMaxCountRevFilter.java -> I would call this class only MaxCountRevFilter. It's implicitly clear that it works on commits (Similar to AuthorRevFilter)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/CommitMaxCountRevFilter.java -> Done. Also, I renamed the test class to match this one.
