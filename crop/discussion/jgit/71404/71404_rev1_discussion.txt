DESCRIPTION

WIP: introduce config parameter to use builtin filter/hooks

JGit should include implementations for LFS [1] related hooks and
filters. This would allow to work with JGit on LFS enabled repositories
without the need to install the native lfs tooling. Java components
running in the cloud which use JGit to push data to or fetch data from
git repositories (e.g. web based IDE's) would be enabled to support LFS.

This commit introduces a config parameter filter.lfs.useJGitBuiltin
which will be used (by future commits) to determine whether builter
filter/hook implementations should be used.
