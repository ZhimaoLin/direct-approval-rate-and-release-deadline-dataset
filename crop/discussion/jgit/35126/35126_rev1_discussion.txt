DESCRIPTION

RebaseCommand should ignore submodule modifications

Before a rebase happens the RebaseCommand checks that the workingtree is
clean. We don't want to start a rebase on a dirty worktree. If the
worktree is dirty a rebase should not be allowed. But RebaseCommand
should ignore modifications done to submodules. E.g. if a submodules
HEAD points to <x> but the root repository has in index that the
submodule should point to <y> then this should not prohibit a rebase.
Also native git allows a rebase in this case. Since jgit's StatusCommand
has learned to ignore submodule changes this is now used by the
RebaseCommand to determine the repository state correctly.
