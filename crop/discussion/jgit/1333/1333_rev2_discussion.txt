DESCRIPTION

Allow for optional tagger and message in Tag

We should be more lenient when tagging without an
tagger or message. Currently, we will throw an NPE
which is incorrect behavior.

Line:382, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectInserter.java -> Nak.  Needs to be:

  if (tag.getTagger() != null) {
    w.write("tagger ");
    w.write(tag.getTagger().toExternalString());
    w.write('\n');
  }

That is we only produce the "tagger" header line if there is an identity that will appear on it.  We never should create an empty header line.

I'll fix it during cherry-pick.
