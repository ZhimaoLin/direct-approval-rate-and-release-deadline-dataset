DESCRIPTION

Probe filesystem and set core.filemode correctly

When creating a new FileRepository, probe the capability of the
local filesystem and set core.filemode based on how it reacts.

We can't just rely on FS.supportsExecute() because a POSIX system
(which usually does support execute) might be storing the repository
on a partition that doesn't have execute support (e.g. plain FAT-32).

Creating a temporary file, setting both states, checking we get
the desired results will let us set the variable correctly on
all systems.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

This seems fine to me.  But do we want it in 0.9?

Thanks, Shawn!
I would think that it is sufficient to fix this in master because there is the workaround to manually set the filemode property to false later on.
