DESCRIPTION

Call ProgressMonitor.update() from main thread

Don't permit transient worker threads to access the underlying output
stream of a ProgressMonitor, as they might get marked as the stream's
writer thread.  Instead proxy update events from the workers back onto
the application's real work thread.  This ensures that the stream only
sees a single thread, and its the thread that will remain alive for
the entire life cycle of the operation.

This fixes IOException("Write end dead") during local repository fetch
when threaded delta search is enabled.  One of the transient delta
search threads became the designated writer for the pipe, and when it
terminated the reader end thought the writer was dead, even though the
main writer thread was still executing in PackWriter.
