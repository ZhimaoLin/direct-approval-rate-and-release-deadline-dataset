DESCRIPTION

Provide NLS support in JGit.

The support for NLS relies on java.util API to load a standard
ResourceBundle and then uses java reflection API to inject localized
strings into public String fields of the corresponding instance
of TranslationBundle.

Locale setting is supported per thread to enable concurrent threads
to use different locales. This is useful when JGit runs in a server
context where (error) messages might need to differ per-request to
suit the user's preference.

I'm OK with this.

Shawn, seems like we may want to sneak this in for 0.7.0 if you're comfortable.

Though I would like an IP Review +1 from a current SAP committer before we submit this.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/errors/TranslationBundleException.java -> Style-nit:  We prefer public final.  I'll let it slide.

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLS.java -> Style-nit:  We prefer "private final".  I'll let it slide.
