DESCRIPTION

Provide NLS support in JGit.

The support for NLS relies on java.util API to load a standard
ResourceBundle and then uses java reflection API to inject localized
strings into public String fields of the corresponding instance
of TranslationBundle.

Locale setting is supported per thread to enable concurrent threads
to use different locales. This is useful when JGit runs in a server
context where (error) messages might need to differ per-request to
suit the user's preference.

Chris: for this change I would like to claim the IP process described in figure 2 in http://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf, can you supervise this change ? Is it ok to use Gerrit for that or do we need to document this in a bug in Bugzilla ? Sasa and myself are working for the same company and SAP is a member company which signed the member committer agreement.

IP wise, this is fine.

I would address Shawn's comments and I think we are good to go on this one.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLS.java -> Please document what happens if the bundle fails to load for the current locale.  I know you throw an Error below.  I'd prefer it to be a specific Error type that a caller could catch if they want to more gracefully abort due to an invalid translation.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLS.java -> See my comment below about the default value; setting to null here would cause that behavior to fail.  So you'd need to set to the initial value instead.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLS.java -> Instead of doing this, extend InheritableThreadLocal above and implement its initialValue() method to construct this NLS instance.  That way when you are in default mode we still can maintain a thread-local cache of the bundles we've examined.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLS.java -> Translation text can't change, its loaded from the code archive we ourselves came from.  So I think we should do a global table that holds a cached singleton of all translations.  Its a finite cost and "leaking" them after they are needed shouldn't be a problem.

So change this code to be:

  TranslationBundle bundle = map.get(type);
  if (bundle == null) {
    bundle = lookupBundle(locale, type);
    map.putIfAbsent(type, bundle);
  }

and write a global cache:

  private static final Map<Locale, Map<Class, TranslationBundle>> cachedBundles
    = new HashMap<Locale, Map<Class, TranslationBundle>>();

  private static synchronized <T extends TranslationBundle>
  T lookupBundle(Locale locale, Class<T> type) {
    ...
  }

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLS.java -> These fields should be marked final.

Maybe a ConcurrentHashMap would be better here, then we can avoid the synchronized during reads.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/TestNLS.java -> I hate tests that sleep.  This is also prone to race conditions if the test is run on a heavily loaded system... which our automated Brenden Conley builds are.  So please expend the extra effort to implement a proper barrier between the threads to ensure they both set their locale before they can continue.  It shouldn't that hard, use a java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier.
