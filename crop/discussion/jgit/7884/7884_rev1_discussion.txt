DESCRIPTION

CheckoutCommand: Support checking out ours and theirs

The checkoutPaths body is split into two implementations, depending on
whether we are checking out the index or a branch. This improves
readability, as in the index case we now also need to have access to
DirCacheIterator.

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> instead of independent ours/theirs options which need to be checked in order to prevent meaningless option combinations I think it would be better to use a combined option setStage() accepting an enum with the possible stages you may want to checkout (ours, theirs, common base)

Line:491, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Good idea! Will rework. Does base stage make sense? It doesn't seem to be supported by `git checkout`.
