DESCRIPTION

CheckoutCommand: Support checking out ours and theirs

The checkoutPaths body is split into two implementations, depending on
whether we are checking out the index or a branch. This improves
readability, as in the index case we now also need to have access to
DirCacheIterator.

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Why not include BASE too, and include the numeric value for simplicity below.

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Base: The reason was that `git checkout` also doesn't offer it (only --ours, --theirs). Numeric value: Ok.
