DESCRIPTION

Added dirty-detection to WorkingTreeIterator

Added possibility to compare the current entry of a WorkingTreeIterator
to a given DirCacheEntry. This is done to detect whether an entry
in the index is dirty or not. 'Dirty' means that the file in the working tree
is different from what's in the index. Merge algorithms will make use of
this to detect conflicts.

Patch Set 6:

Does this have to be adapted when you change the Racy Git Handling as discussed in http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg00490.html?

LGTM, but I think there is a redundant line of code here that we can safely remove.  I assume you will be doing a subsequent change to handle racily clean stuff.

Line:425, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Isn't this expression entirely redundant?

If we remove it we still get the same behavior.  When forceContentCheck is false we fall through to the else below, which compares the values and if != returns true.

Line:425, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Amazing you find this. Yesterday Matthias and I also saw this duplicate check. I this check propose a new patchset and submit.
