DESCRIPTION

Add PatienceDiff to DiffPerformance tests

To optimize PatienceDiff some load tests may be useful.  Reuse most
of what was written for MyersDiff.

Because PatienceDiff works by looking for common unique lines within
the region, the DiffTestDataGenerator needs to be modified to produce
a unique character for each region.  If we don't give PatienceDiff
a few unique points, it will just offer back a single REPLACE edit
that covers the entire files, and this doesn't tell us very much.

Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffPerformanceTest.java -> Yes, you are right, these line shouldn't be in. But this println is already commented with "to be removed". Currently we really want this output in our local versions because we are very interested in those values during performance optimizations. But in the end these lines should be removed.
