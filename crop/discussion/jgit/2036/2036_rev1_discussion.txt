DESCRIPTION

Abstract SSH setup to support GIT_SSH

In order to honor GIT_SSH the TransportGitSsh class needs to run the
process named by the GIT_SSH environment variable and use that as the
pipes for connectivity to the remote peer.  Refactor the current
transport code to support a different type of pipe connectivity, so we
can later add GIT_SSH.

It's fine. I would prefer we didn't have Connection and friend as inner classes though...

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> Do we really want these as inner classes?
