DESCRIPTION

Allow checkout paths without specifying branch name

JGit CLI should allow to do this: checkout -- <path>

Currently, even if "a" is a valid path in the git repo, jgit CLI can't
checkout it:
$jgit checkout -- a
error: pathspec 'a' did not match any file(s) known to git.

The fix also fixes at same time "unnamed" zombie "[VAL ...]" argument
shown on the command line.

Before fix:
$jgit -h
jgit checkout name [VAL ...] [-- path ... ...] [--force (-f)] [--help
(-h)] [--orphan] [-b]

After fix:
$jgit -h
jgit checkout [name] [-- path ... ...] [--force (-f)] [--help (-h)]
[--orphan] [-b]

Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1

(2 comments)

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> with your change it can happen that we call setStartPoint(null) ... but the rest of the code handles this correctly, +1

Line:617, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CheckoutTest.java -> looks good. I also checked that replacing a symlink with a file works.
