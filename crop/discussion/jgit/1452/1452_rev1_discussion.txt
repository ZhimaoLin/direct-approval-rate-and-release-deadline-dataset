DESCRIPTION

Currently, if a branch is created that has special chars ('#' in the bug),
Config will surround the subsection name with double quotes during
it's toText method which will result in an inavlid file after saving the
Config.

Line:839, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Can we have a unit test to verify this works correctly?  I'm especially concerned about regressions in the future so it would be nice if we have a test case that shows proper quoting.
