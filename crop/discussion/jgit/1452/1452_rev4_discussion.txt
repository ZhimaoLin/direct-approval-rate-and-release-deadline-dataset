DESCRIPTION

Avoid double quotes in Git Config

Currently, if a branch is created that has special chars ('#' in the bug),
Config will surround the subsection name with double quotes during
it's toText method which will result in an inavlid file after saving the
Config.

Bug: 318249

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> Unfortunately the other tests are in a class called RepositoryConfigTest.  (Historical reasons.)

I would support the idea of renaming that test class to ConfigTest, and then adding this new method to it.

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> If you look atRepositoryTestCase we flat out assert a very specific formatting for the entire file.  So for this we would say:

  String exp = "[testsection \"testsubsection\"]\n\ttestname=testvalue\n";
  assertEquals(exp, config.toText());

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo on invalid (you have "inavlid").
