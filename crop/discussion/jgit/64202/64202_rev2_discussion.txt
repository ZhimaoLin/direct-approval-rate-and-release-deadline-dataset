DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Declare preparePack object sets xxx@xxx.xxx

Require callers to pass in valid sets for both want and have
collections. Offer PackWriter.NONE as a handy constant for an
empty collection for the have part of preparePack instead of null.

Line:677, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Hopefully we get the point where all nullable parameters are annotated with @Nullable and anything else is assumed to xxx@xxx.xxx 

Since this is a central class it may make sense to annotate this for a couple of release cycles, but maybe we pull it back out after that?

Line:700, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> nit: xxx@xxx.xxx null}

Line:677, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java xxx@xxx.xxx should work on the class or package once we get there.
