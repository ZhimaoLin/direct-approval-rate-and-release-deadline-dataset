DESCRIPTION

DO NOT SUBMIT: Instrument WindowCursor to track down pack corruption

Demonstrate that Gerrit MeyersDiff code uses the same WindowCursror
instance simultaneously from two different threads and thus leading
to pack file corruption: [1].

The problem is that code in PatchListLoader: [2].
When a timeout happen, and the Future.cancel(true) method is invoked:

  result.cancel(true);

It's not guarantuee that this thread is interrupted. If it's stuck in
a tight loop, it won't stop.

Yet, the next line:

  toFileHeaderWithoutMyersDiff(diffFormatter, diffEntry);

invokes WindowsCursor.inflate() method while the first thread is still
active.
