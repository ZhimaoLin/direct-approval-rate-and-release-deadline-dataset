DESCRIPTION

Stream whole deflated objects in PackWriter

Instead of loading the entire object as a byte array and passing
that into the deflater, let the ObjectLoader copy the object onto
the DeflaterOutputStream.  This has the nice side effect of using
some sort of stride hack in the Sun implementation that may improve
compression performance.
