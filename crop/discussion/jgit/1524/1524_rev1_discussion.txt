DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: Rethrow exceptions caught during indexing

If we get an exception while indexing the incoming pack, its likely
a stream corruption.  We already report an error to the client, but
we eat the stack trace, which makes debugging issues related to a
bug inside of JGit nearly impossible.  Rethrow it under a new type
UnpackException, so embedding servers or applications can catch the
error and provide it to a human who might be able to forward such
traces onto a JGit developer for evaluation.
