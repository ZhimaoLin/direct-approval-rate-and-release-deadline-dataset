DESCRIPTION

Tighten up local packed object representation during packing

Rather than making a loader, and then using that to fill the object
representation, parse the header and set up our data directly.
This saves some time, as we don't waste cycles on information we
won't use right now.

The weight computed for a representation is now its actual stored
size in the pack file, rather than its inflated size.  This accounts
for changes made when the compression level is modified on the
repository.  It is however more costly to determine the weight of
the object, since we have to find its length in the pack.  To try and
recover that cost we now cache the length as part of our ObjectToPack
record, so it doesn't have to be found during the output phase.

A LocalObjectToPack now costs us (assuming 32 bit pointers):

                   (32 bit)     (64 bit)
  vm header:         8 bytes      8 bytes
  ObjectId:         20 bytes     20 bytes
  PackedObjectInfo: 12 bytes     12 bytes
  ObjectToPack:      8 bytes     12 bytes
  LocalOTP:         20 bytes     24 bytes
                 -----------    ---------
                    68 bytes     74 bytes

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

1) The "assuming 32-bit pointers" part is misleading.

2) nitpick(?): The cost of having an object actually means having a reference to it somewhere. Current JVM won't pack objects like C does.

Other than that, ok.

Patch Set 1:

Are you expecting me to rewrite the series to edit this commit message?

Yea, the JVM doesn't quite pack data the same way as C git does, so that part is a little misleading here, but its a useful approximation of how heavy a given entry in the object to pack table is.
