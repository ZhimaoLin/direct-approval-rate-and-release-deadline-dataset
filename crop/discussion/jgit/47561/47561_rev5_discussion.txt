DESCRIPTION

ObjectReader: remove the walkAdvice API

This was added a very long time ago to support the failed
DHT storage implementation. Since then no storage system
was able to make use of this API, but it pollutes internals
of the walkers.

Kill the API on ObjectReader and drop the invocations from
the walker code.
