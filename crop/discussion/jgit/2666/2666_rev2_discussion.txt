DESCRIPTION

Make the supported Transports extensible and discoverable

The new TransportProtocol type describes what a particular Transport
implementation wants in order to support a connection.  3rd parties
can now plug into the Transport.open() logic by implementing their
own TransportProtocol and Transport classes, and registering with
Transport.register().

GUI applications can help the user configure a connection by looking
at the supported fields of a particular TransportProtocol type, which
makes the GUI more dynamic and may better support new Transports.
