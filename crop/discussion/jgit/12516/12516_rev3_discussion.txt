DESCRIPTION

Support refspecs with wildcard in middle (not only at end)

The following refspec, which can be used to fetch GitHub pull requests,
is supported by C Git but was not yet by JGit:

  +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*

The reason is that the wildcard in the source is in the middle.

This change also includes more validation (e.g. "refs//heads" is not
valid) and test cases.
