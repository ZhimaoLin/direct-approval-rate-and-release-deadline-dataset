DESCRIPTION

Implement Buck driven build

Today there are plenty of modern build tool systems available in the
wild (in no particular order):

* http://bazel.io
* https://pantsbuild.github.io
* http://shakebuild.com
* https://ninja-build.org
* https://buckbuild.com

The attributes, that all these build tools have in common, are:

* reliable
* correct
* very fast
* reproducible

It must not always be the other build tool, this project is currently
using. Or, quoting Gerrit Code Review maintainer here:

  "Friends, don't let friends use <the other build tool system>!"

This change is non-complete implementation of JGit build in Buck,
needed by Gerrit Code Review to replace its dependency with standlone
JGit cell. This is very useful when a developer is working on both
projects and is trying to integrate changes made in JGit in Gerrit.

The supported workflow is:

  $ cd jgit
  $ emacs <hack>
  $ cd ../gerrit
  $ buck build --config repositories.jgit=../jgit gerrit

With --config repositories.jgit=../jgit jgit cell is routed through
JGit development tree.

To build jgit, issue:

  $ buck build //:jgit
  [-] PROCESSING BUCK FILES...FINISHED 0,0s

Yes, you can't measure no-op build time, given that Buck daemon is
used.

As long as these build tools don't support OSGi we will still need Maven for at least a part of the build since we need JGit OSGi bundles, features, and p2 repository to install it in Eclipse and compile other bundles like EGit against JGit.

I think as long as this is the case using Buck should be optional since otherwise we would force all contributors to install both Maven and buck.

Adding Buck as an optional build for those hacking on Gerrit seems useful. Though I would prefer if this build would build all JGit bundles and also allow to run all JGit tests . I think otherwise those using the partial Buck build may introduce changes which break build or tests of other JGit bundles not used by Gerrit since they won't notice such problems in a partial build.

When dependencies are changed or added the Buck build will be the third place to maintain the dependencies (currently we have to maintain them redundantly in OSGi manifests and Maven pom.xml files due to limitations of Tycho). We don't touch dependencies frequently so this should be manageable.

buck-out/ should be added to .gitignore

buck-cache/ ends up in the top level folder, should this go to some hidden folder under $HOME similar to where Gerrit has its buck cache ?

Could you add a build target which builds all JGit artefacts ?

If the buck build would allow to install the build artefacts into the local Maven repository we could run the packaging build (using Tycho to build org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/pom.xml) based on that to create the OSGi specific artefacts and see if those hacking on JGit and EGit can also benefit from builiding the JGit jars using buck.

Line:3, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/BUCK -> why is this class excluded ?

Line:8, BUCK -> what about sources for the other bundles ?

Line:14, BUCK -> why servlet and not http-server which would better match the bundle name ?

Line:32, BUCK -> s/jnit/junit/

Line:1, tools/default.defs -> can we move this under tools/buck/ as long as we still need a Maven build

Line:3, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/BUCK -> It requires OSGI APIs and the OSGI JAR is not in the deps list. So it can't compile. I think that's a sane approach. Buck can't build an OSGI binary anyway.

Line:32, BUCK -> Done
