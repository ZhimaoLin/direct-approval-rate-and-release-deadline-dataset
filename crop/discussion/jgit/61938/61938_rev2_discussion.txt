DESCRIPTION

Implement Buck driven build

Today there are plenty of modern build tool systems available in the
wild (in no particular order):

* http://bazel.io
* https://pantsbuild.github.io
* http://shakebuild.com
* https://ninja-build.org
* https://buckbuild.com

The attributes, that all these build tools have in common, are:

* reliable
* correct
* very fast
* reproducible

It must not always be the other build tool, this project is currently
using. Or, quoting Gerrit Code Review maintainer here:

  "Friends, don't let friends use <the other build tool system>!"

This change is non-complete implementation of JGit build in Buck,
needed by Gerrit Code Review to replace its dependency with standlone
JGit cell. This is very useful when a developer is working on both
projects and is trying to integrate changes made in JGit in Gerrit.

The supported workflow is:

  $ cd jgit
  $ emacs <hack>
  $ cd ../gerrit
  $ buck build --config repositories.jgit=../jgit gerrit

With --config repositories.jgit=../jgit jgit cell is routed through
JGit development tree.

To build jgit, issue:

  $ buck build //:jgit
  [-] PROCESSING BUCK FILES...FINISHED 0,0s

Yes, you can't measure no-op build time, given that Buck daemon is
used.
