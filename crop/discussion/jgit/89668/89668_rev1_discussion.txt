DESCRIPTION

ReceivePackAdvertiseRefsHookTest: Don't close repositories in teardown

The repositories get added to the "toClose" set by createBareRepository,
and are then closed in the superclass's tearDown method.

Explicitly closing them in this test class's teardown causes the use
count to go negative when subsequently closed again by the superclass.
