Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/ManifestParser.java -> JGit uses java 8, right? Why not using the java NonNull annotation?

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/ManifestParser.java -> We started using these annotations when JGit used Java 7 so we created our own annotations. We could switch to Java 8 annotations (is this a breaking change ?), but I think this should be done in another change.
