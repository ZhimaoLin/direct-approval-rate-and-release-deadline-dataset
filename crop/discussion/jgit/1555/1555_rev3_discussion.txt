DESCRIPTION

Remember loose objects and fast-track their lookup

Recently created objects are usually what branches point to, and
are usually written out as loose objects.  But due to the high cost
of asking the operating system if a file exists, these are the last
thing that ObjectDirectory examines when looking for an object by
its ObjectId.

Caching recently seen loose objects permits the opening code to
jump directly to the loose object, accelerating lookup for branch
heads that are accessed often.

To avoid exploding the cache its limited to approximately 2048
entries.  When more ids are added, the table is simply cleared
and reset in size.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I think this is ready to go now.  The cache is simple and pretty low cost to put in front of pack lookup.
