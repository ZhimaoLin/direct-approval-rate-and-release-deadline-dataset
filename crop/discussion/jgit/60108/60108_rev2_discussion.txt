Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Currently I have not found a real problem with this but wanted to make you aware about the following:

I think we are changing semantics a little bit here. Before one precondition for getRef() to throw an IOException was that the caller specified needle did not contain a "/". Even  if we got an IOException from readRef() we sometimes didn't rethrow that and simply moved to the next searchPath element. That's not true anymore. Even if the needle contains a '/' we may throw an IOException.

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java xxx@xxx.xxx ?

Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> The double-negatives are confusing.  !!needle.contains("/") becomes name.contains("/"). So I think there is no semantic change (but thanks for looking into it --- this kind of thing is exactly what I hope to find in review).

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Good call.

aside from the xxx@xxx.xxx this is ok for me

Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> +1. Right, I overlooked the leading "!". My fault.
The reason I looked longer on this is that you just removed a complicated if block controlling when we throw exceptions.  I thought: that must be a semantic change. But I am convinced now that's ok. The check in readAndResolve() whether the full name contains a "/" really replaces this beast.
