Patch Set 1: No score

If we have this function, we can then determine from the client whether or not the URL is a supported type, instead of having a fixed-set defined in EGit.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

OK.  I had planned to do that differently though.  I instead wanted JGit to export some sort of list of TransportMethod objects or something that described the different transports it supported.  Then the UI could just offer a view over that list of objects.  And those objects could also tell us if they support authentication or not, username/password or private key, or etc.  so the UI could adapt based on what the transport claims it can do, rather than hardcoding.  This might be useful for an S3 type storage where its not really username/password that makes up the credentials for connecting.

But, in the interm, this is fine.
