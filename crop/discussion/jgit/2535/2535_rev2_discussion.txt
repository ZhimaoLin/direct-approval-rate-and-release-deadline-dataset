DESCRIPTION

BundleWriter: Always use OFS_DELTA

CGit just learned to always use OFS_DELTA when writing out bundle
files.  This makes sense because bundle came about well after
OFS_DELTA was established, so any version of CGit that can read a
bundle file can also read OFS_DELTA.  Since OFS_DELTA is smaller,
always use it when writing bundles.
