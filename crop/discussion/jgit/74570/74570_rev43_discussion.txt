 + add a test for push options
 + push: accept push options
 + receive-pack: implement advertising and receiving push options
 + push options: {pre,post}-receive hook learns about push options

 "git push" learned to accept and pass extra options to the
 receiving end so that hooks can read and react to them.

 Will merge to 'master'.
