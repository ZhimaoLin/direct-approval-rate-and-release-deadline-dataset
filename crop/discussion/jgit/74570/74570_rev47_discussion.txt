Patch Set 47: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> "constructConfig" doesn't convey much meaning. The returned value also isn't used after config.save(), so I'd suggest a single "void connectLocalToRemote(Git local, Git remote)" helper function (which can be static).

Also s/git/local/ and s/git2/remote/ would improve readability.

Line:259, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> nit: This method is actually adding the commit to the repo, so "addCommit" is more descriptive.

Sorry, where specifically (with regard to s/git/local/ and s/git2/remote/)?

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> The "Git git" variable -> "Git local" and "Git git2" -> "Git remote".  That makes the following lines read:

connectLocalToRemote(local, remote);
RevCommit commit = addCommit(local);
PushCommand pushCommand local.push()...
assertEquals(commit.getId(), remote.getRepository()...

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> I think we're a bit out of sync now. If you refer to patch set 48 (the latest one), is that what you're looking for?

Line:253, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> Patch set 49 looks good. I'll download and look at it locally. If it looks good on my local machine I'll submit.
