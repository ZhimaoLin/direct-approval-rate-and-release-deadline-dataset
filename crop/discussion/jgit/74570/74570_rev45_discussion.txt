Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> "updates" is unused, here and in other tests.

Line:252, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> Is the RemoteConfig being set up the same way in every test? If so please factor that out into a helper function so it is clear that this isn't one of the parameters under test.

Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> This can also be factored out to a helper since it isn't one of the parameters under test.

Line:388, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> If this command is expected to throw an exception then the following lines are a bit misleading. Maybe drop them and append this line with "// expect TransportException here"
