Line:1133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Oh! I thought this was here before. Let's just keep what there was before, no need to add a commented //white

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> and read the next line with

    pushOption = pckIn.readString();

so we're not stuck in an infinite loop.

Line:197, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> style: In JGit (as well as in Git core,) we omit the braces in case there is only one statement after if/while etc.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> And for reading I think we need to be a bit more elaborate similar to BaseReceivePack#recvCommands:

	String line;
	line = pckIn.readString();
	if (line == PacketLineIn.END) {
		break;
	}

We don't need to catch the EOFException like we do in BaseReceivePack#recvCommands, as we can just propagate that as an IOException.
