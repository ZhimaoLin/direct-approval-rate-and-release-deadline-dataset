Only change the style of code you are touching anyway, if you change one line in an if statement with multiple else clauses it's ok to change style for the complete if statement. We want to avoid pure formatting changes only adapting otherwise unchanged code to the new style.

Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> I think this is a leftover from resolving a rebase conflict, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76650/ which removes it from this place.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> As there is only one option per argument, should we rename that to singular?
