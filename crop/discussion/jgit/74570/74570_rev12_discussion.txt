Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PushOptionsTest.java -> I don't quite understand how we need to keep that test for backward compatibility as this is tested in PushConnectionTest already? (So I would understand if we do another test with no push options transmitted, but this seems a bit random to me?)
