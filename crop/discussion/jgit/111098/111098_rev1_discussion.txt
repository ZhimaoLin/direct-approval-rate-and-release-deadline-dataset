DESCRIPTION

Work around a Jsch bug: ensure the user name is set from URI

JSch unconditionally overrides the user name given in the connection
URI by the one found in ~/.ssh/config (if that does specify one for
the used host). If the SSH config file has a different user name,
we'll end up using the wrong name, which typically results in an
authentication failure or in Eclipse/EGit asking for a password for
the wrong user.

Unfortunately there is no way to prevent or circumvent this Jsch
behavior up front; it occurs already in the Session constructor at
com.jcraft.jsch.Session() and the Session.applyConfig() method. And
while there is a Session.setUserName() that would enable us to correct
this, that latter method has package visibility only.

So resort to reflection to invoke that setUserName() method to ensure
that Jsch uses the user name from the URI, if there is one.

@Matthias: master or stable-4.9?

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschConfigSessionFactory.java -> I hate this, but doing this without reflection is very hard.

Essentially we'd need a cache of JSch instances not by host but by user name and host. Then we could provide Jsch a customized session-specific OpenSshConfig in which we'd already have set the user name to the one from the URI.

Doing so would also enable us to properly do the %p and %r replacements in OpenSshConfig. While it should be possible with such an approach to avoid this reflection here, it is a rather major refactoring, and I don't see how to do it without breaking interfaces. I also don't have the time to take on such a larger refactoring now; I'm up to my ears in $DAYJOB work.

So this is the best stop-gap measure I could come up with.
