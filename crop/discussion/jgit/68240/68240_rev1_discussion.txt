DESCRIPTION

Add ignoreRemoteFailures option to RepoCommand

With ignoreRemoteFailures set to false, we can ignore remote failures
(e.g. the branch of a project described in the manifest file does not
exist), skip that project and continue to the next one, instead of fail
the whole operation.

Line:364, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> maybe something like:

 /**
  * Set whether to skip projects whose commits don't exist remotely

Line:493, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Can we distinguish the case of a missing object (or missing repository) from bugs and intermittent I/O failures?

E.g. RefNotFoundException or MissingObjectException vs TransportException or JgitInternalException.

Alternatively, would it make sense to require that the RemoteReader return null when the sha1 doesn't exist (and it can log its own message) and throw an exception for other failures?

Line:493, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Should this 'continue;'? That would save later code from having to check for a null objectId.
