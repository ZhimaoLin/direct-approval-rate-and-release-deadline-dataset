DESCRIPTION

Add ignoreRemoteFailures option to RepoCommand

With ignoreRemoteFailures set to true, we can ignore remote failures
(e.g. the branch of a project described in the manifest file does not
exist), skip that project and continue to the next one, instead of fail
the whole operation.

Two nits left. Thanks again and sorry for the slow review.

Line:478, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> The '= null' is not needed, since both branches of the "if" assign to objectId.

Line:490, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> not needed: we have already called 'continue' or thrown an exception in the objectId == null case.
