DESCRIPTION

Exclude refs/tags from bitmap commit selection

Commit db77610 ensured that all refs/tags are in the primary GC pack.
It did that by adding all of the refs/tags commits to the primary GC
pack PackWriter's "interesting" object set.

Unfortunately, all commit objects in the "interesting" set are
selected as commits for which bitmap indices will be built. In a
repository like chromium with lots of tags, this changed the number of
bitmaps created from <700 to >10000. That puts huge memory pressure on
the GC task.

This change restores the original behavior of ignoring tags when
performing bitmap index commit selection.

Commits for refs/heads and refs/tags for unannotated tags can not be
differentiated in the "uninteresting" objects set. We instead identify
refs/tags commits by passing their ObjectIds as a new "noBitmaps"
parameter to the PackWriter.preparePack() methods.
PackWriterBitmapPreparer.setupTipCommitBitmaps() can then use that
"noBitmaps" parameter to exclude those commits.
