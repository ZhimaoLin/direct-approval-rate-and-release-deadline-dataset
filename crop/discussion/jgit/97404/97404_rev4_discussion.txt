DESCRIPTION

Exclude refs/tags from bitmap commit selection

Commit db77610 ensured that all refs/tags commits are added to the
primary GC pack. It did that by adding all of the refs/tags commits to
the primary GC pack PackWriter's "interesting" object set.

Unfortunately, all commit objects in the "interesting" set are
selected as commits for which bitmap indices will be built. In a
repository like chromium with lots of tags, this changed the number of
bitmaps created from <700 to >10000. That puts huge memory pressure on
the GC task.

This change restores the original behavior of ignoring tags when
selecting commits for bitmaps.

In the "uninteresting" set, commits for refs/heads and refs/tags for
unannotated tags can not be differentiated. We instead identify
refs/tags commits by passing their ObjectIds as a new "noBitmaps"
parameter to the PackWriter.preparePack() methods.
PackWriterBitmapPreparer.setupTipCommitBitmaps() can then use that
"noBitmaps" parameter to exclude those commits.

Line:979, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java xxx@xxx.xxx for this too?

Line:747, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> this helper function comment is redundant.

Line:747, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> This is a pre-existing public API method, not a helper function, so it needs JavaDoc.

Line:747, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Well, this is an internal class, but I made some effort not to change the semantics of the existing public methods since it is probably used by clients.
