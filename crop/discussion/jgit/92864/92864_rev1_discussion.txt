DESCRIPTION

Don't remove pack when FileNotFoundException is transient

The FileNotFoundException is typically raised in three conditions:
1. file doesn't exist
2. incompatible read vs. read/write open modes
3. filesystem locking
4. temporary lack of resources (e.g. too many open files)

1. is already managed, 2. would never happen as packs are not
overwritten while with 3. and 4. it is worth logging the exception and
retry to read the pack again.

Log transient errors using an exponential backoff strategy to avoid
flooding the logs with the same error if consecutive retries to access
the pack fail repeatedly.

I added the missing branch configuration for stable-4.5 in https://hudson.eclipse.org/jgit/job/jgit.gerrit/configure
and manually triggered a build

I don't have Verified permissions, however, I did a load test this morning by saturating the file-descriptors with wrk: the failure is no more persistent and once the workload stops and the pressure on file-descriptor is off, the repos are back again.

Line:562, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> this is not a retry count but rather "transientErrorCount"

it looks like initializing to 0 could be wrong, but actually it's not since all paths not removing the pack do update the counter so we can avoid adding PackFile.getTransientErrorCount().
