Line:577, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> That's the wrong workingTreeIterator. This workingTreeIterator instance was given to us to initialize the treewalk. But whenenver the treewalk goes down into subdirectories new instances of the workingtreeiterators are created. I changed the code so that the right iterator is passed to this method.
