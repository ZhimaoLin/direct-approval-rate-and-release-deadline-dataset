DESCRIPTION

Provide native readdir() via JNI

Some platforms (notably Linux and FreeBSD) can supply not only the
name of a file in a directory, but also what sort of file it is.
This can be useful when traversing the directory structure as it
may save lstat() calls on directories or symbolic links.

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/fs/FileAccessNativeTest.java -> I think we should extend this test to have like 120 entries in the directory. Its not an even power of 2 for the temporary array, so 120 would exercise that the array resized correctly during the loop, and again at the end if it was too large. It would also help to test that part of the JNI where I am not sure I am using the local reference table correctly. I suspect the native tier would be more likely to crash the JVM or fail with some sort of exception if we are misusing JNI and we actually have enough entries to test it.

Line:95, libjgit_native/src/list.c -> I think we are missing a DeleteLocalRef(env, e) call here. But I really don't know. :-(

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/fs/FileAccessNativeTest.java -> You need to test non-ascii names here to match what the java API's do

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/fs/FileAccessNativeTest.java -> Done

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/fs/FileAccessNativeTest.java -> thanks for the tip: on Mac this succeeds for symbolic link and fails for file and directory

Line:95, libjgit_native/src/list.c -> also the expanded test succeeds without adding this
