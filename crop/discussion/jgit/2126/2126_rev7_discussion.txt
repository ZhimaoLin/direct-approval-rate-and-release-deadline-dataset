DESCRIPTION

Provide native readdir() via JNI

Some platforms (notably Linux and FreeBSD) can supply not only the
name of a file in a directory, but also what sort of file it is.
This can be useful when traversing the directory structure as it
may save lstat() calls on directories or symbolic links.
