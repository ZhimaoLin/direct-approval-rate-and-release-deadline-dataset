Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackOutputStream.java -> I'm fairly certain this was not a typo and is actually a micro optimization that I benchmarked as better than &&.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackOutputStream.java -> I was just about to do the same "fix" until I found this change.

I think it's debatable whether such a micro optimization is preferable to readability, but we can at least add a comment here to stop people trying to fix it again.
