Line:520, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> I don't get this: We are in a block which we enter only when "authMethod.getType() == HttpAuthMethod.Type.NONE". And in this line you are adding "authMethod.getType()". Doesn't this mean the ignoreTypes collection will always only contain HttpAuthMethod.Type.NONE?
