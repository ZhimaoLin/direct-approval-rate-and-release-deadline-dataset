DESCRIPTION

DfsObjDatabase: clear PackList dirty bit if no new packs

If a reference was updated more recently than a pack was written
(typical) the PackList was perpetually dirty until the next GC
was completed for the repository.

Detect this condition by observing no changes to the PackList
membership and resetting the dirty bit.
