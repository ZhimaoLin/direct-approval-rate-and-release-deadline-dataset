Line:310, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> Nit: above the empty set is passed (preparePack turns null into an empty set, but why not be consistent and just pass that here). Consider adding a HAVE_NONE constant to PackWriter.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftree/RefTreeNames.java -> nit: xxx@xxx.xxx true}

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftree/RefTreeNames.java -> If "stage" has a special connotation, extract it as a constant with a JavaDoc description.
