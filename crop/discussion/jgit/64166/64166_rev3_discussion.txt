Line:312, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> I was suggesting enhancing the PackWriter.preparePack() API directly with via an explicit value (null object pattern) so that over time all calls where there are no "haves" will look like pw.preparePack(wants, NONE);

Line:522, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I know that change is already in. But the change was created and merged during europes evening/night time so let me ask some questions:

Shouldn't we document in the javadoc that we are writing a new packfile and what is in that file? That's not so obvious to me. Since all refs starting with refs/heads still go into the standard default packfile I guess that only the reftrees themselves got into the additional packfile, or?
What's about tests which proove that the new packfile contains the right data?
