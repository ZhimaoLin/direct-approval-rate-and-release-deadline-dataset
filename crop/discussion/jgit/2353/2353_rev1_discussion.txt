DESCRIPTION

Hard reset should not report conflict on untracked file

This problem surfaced since EGit Core ResetOperationTest is failing
since change I26806d21. JGit detected checkout conflict for untracked
files which never were tracked by the repository. 

"git reset --hard" in c git also doesn't remove such untracked files.
