Line:11, tools/maven-central/deploy.rb -> Normally, arrays are concatenated using +. | does a union, which may not be what you want (if a param would need to be added twice, it would be removed).

Line:12, tools/maven-central/deploy.rb -> This is repeated everywhere, why not write it like this:

  system(*prefix, argN1, argN2)

Or define a function which does the unwrapping:

  def run(args)
    system(*args)
  end

Then call it like this:

  run prefix + [...]

Line:57, tools/maven-central/deploy.rb -> It's common to put arrays in `[]` (even though it's not strictly necessary)
