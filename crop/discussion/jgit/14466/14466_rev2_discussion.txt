Patch Set 2:

Chris, we are not yet ready to release jgit following [1] since tweaking the version numbers involves running our hacky Perl script ./tools/version.sh since we are releasing OSGi artifacts using plain Maven (we can't use Tycho here since this doesn't allow to create Maven artifacts but only OSGi bundles published via a p2 repository). Also I don't have the time to spend another few days tweaking poms and playing with Hudson to find out how to automate publishing to oss.sonatype.org which we only need once every 3 months, running these 2 scripts takes 5 min.
