Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Still not final...

Todos: It should be possible to omit the option when paths are specified. What happens when -o and -all are set together?

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> We discussed this in person: we should concentrate on the worktree content for those pathes included in '-o'. That's how native git works. We should even make sure that after the commit -o operation we do
have updated index entries for those entries included in "-o". It is like we would do a "git add" for all pathes included by -o.

Line:328, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitAndLogCommandTests.java -> I think it is crucial that we check for each commit also the content he brings for each file. If we only check which files are included in a commit then we miss to test important -o functionality
