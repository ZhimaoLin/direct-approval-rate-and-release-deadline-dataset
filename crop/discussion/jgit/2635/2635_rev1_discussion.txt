First draft...

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> thats the problem: we shouldn't delete from the original index. We should instead process every single path with is in the original dircache. For each path covered by -o we should copy what's in the original index. For every other path we should copy whats in HEAD. 

In other words. For our copy of our index we have to work on all files which are not covered by -o option. We should reset them to HEAD state. All the pathes covered by -o are just copied over.

Line:429, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> We should at least mention whether we support any wildcards/special syntax here.

Line:250, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitAndLogCommandTests.java -> you can replace all this lines by writeTrashFile("a"). Also true for all the other writes to files. The tests are much easier to read this way.

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitAndLogCommandTests.java -> the git.commit()...call() already returns the RevCommit you are searching for. No need to call git.log() . Or do you explicitly wanted
to test that the log command finds the last commit.

This comment is also true for the remaining new tests.

Line:284, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitAndLogCommandTests.java -> Really?? Where is b.txt? A "commit -o b.txt" should not remove b.txt from the index, or? The index should always contain all files which should be in the next commit - not only those files which should be modified by the next commit. If we would commit in this state then the next commit would only contain a .txt, and  b.txt would not be under version control anymore. A git log would tell that the last commit has deleted b.txt

I would expect an index containing a.txt and b.txt. I wouldn't even expect that a commit -o changes the index substantially.

Try it out with native git:
git init
echo a>a
echo b>b
git add .
git ls-files --stage
git commit -o b -m only_b
git ls-files --stage
git commit -m both
git ls-files --stage
git log -p

Line:284, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitAndLogCommandTests.java -> Yes, you are absolutely right. I will add this to the test, i.e. first do a commit -o and then perform a 'normal' commit.
