DESCRIPTION

Remove packIndex field from FileObjDatabase openPack method.

Previously, the FileObjDatabase required both the pack file path and
index file path to be passed to openPack().  A future change to add
a bitmap index will add a .bitmap file parallel to the pack file
(similar to the .idx file). Update the PackFile to support
automatically loading pack index extensions based on the pack file
path.
