DESCRIPTION

Add dfs fsck implementation

JGit already had some fsck-like classes like ObjectChecker which can
check for an individual object.

The read-only FsckPackParser which will parse all objects within a pack
file and check it with ObjectChecker. It will also check the pack index
file against the object information from the pack parser.
