DESCRIPTION

JGit fsck implementation

JGit already had some fsck-like classes like ObjectChecker which can
check for an individual object as well as ObjectWalk which can check
the connectivity of the object.

The JGit fsck utilizes these two classes through a read-only
FsckPackParser which will parse all objects within a pack file. It will
also check the pack index file against the object information from the
pack parser.
