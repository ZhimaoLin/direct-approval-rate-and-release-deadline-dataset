DESCRIPTION

add setAllowEmpty() to CommitCommand

CommitCommand should allow to specify whether empty commits (commits
having the same tree as the sole predecessor commit) are allowed or not.
Similar to native git's "--allow-empty" flag. 

The defaults differ between JGit and native git even after this change.
When not specifying paths then by default JGit allows to create empty
commits while native git does not. It would be API breaking to changes
this now.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> In the end I need to differentiate in the call() method between
- the user has not called setAllowEmpty() but called setOnly() -> allowEmpty=false
- the user has not called setAllowEmpty() and not called setOnly() -> allowEmpty=true
- the user has called setAllowEmpty(true) -> allowEmpty=true
- the user has called setAllowEmpty(false) -> allowEmpty=false

There are three relevant states this attribute can have: not set/true/false. I use <null> to express that this attribute was not set.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> Sorry, please forget the last comment. Your are right, I can skip assigning null to this attribute.
