DESCRIPTION

add setAllowEmpty() to CommitCommand

CommitCommand should allow to specify whether empty commits (commits
having the same tree as the sole predecessor commit) are allowed or not.
Similar to native git's "--allow-empty" flag.

The defaults differ between JGit and native git even after this change.
When not specifying paths then by default JGit allows to create empty
commits while native git does not. It would be API breaking to changes
this now.
