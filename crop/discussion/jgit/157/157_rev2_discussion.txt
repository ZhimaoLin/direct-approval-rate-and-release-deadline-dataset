Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

I rebased this on top of my maven-bundle-plugin work, and cleaned it up to be consistent with the current -feature directory.

Because the -feature and -site still run under Tycho, we get a proper P2 site at the end of the build, driven off the feature.xml just like we'd expect, even though the core stuff is actually built using maven-bundle-plugin.

Chris, I won't submit this without your +1 because its basically your work.

It looks like I hijacked your rename the -feature to .feature change by uploading the P2 repository change to the wrong Change-Id.  :-(

Regarding the -feature to .feature, I actually like having the P2/Eclipse related metadata and glue named slightly differently than the package naming conventions we normally use.  These don't offer code into the workspace at runtime, so they don't really have a package name that makes sense.  So if I hadn't stepped all over patch set 1 by accident, I would have voted -1 on patch set 1.  :-)

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

The rename attempted in patch set 1 is wrong, and I stepped on it by mistake with patch set 2 sent to the wrong change.  Further, patch set 2 is dead, we can't rely on Tycho right now for building a P2 update site.
