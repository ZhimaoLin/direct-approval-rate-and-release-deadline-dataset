Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

Since this is a simple refactoring all the changes should end up as moves, in this patch they are new files and the corresponding deletes are missing, or am I missing something?

Since move detection is not yet there in EGit you need to do this using native git.
