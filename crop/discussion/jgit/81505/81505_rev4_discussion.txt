Patch Set 4:

Since this commit is in I can't clone https based repo's anymore. I think that it is important to mention that in my environment I need a proxy to access e.g. github.com. 

To reproduce: when in the root of the JGit repo root and when I have setup a local proxy (e.g. with the "mitmproxy" tool) and then execute:

  java -Dhttps.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 -cp org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/target/jgit-cli.jar org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Main clone https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git

I get the exception:

Caused by: org.eclipse.jgit.errors.TransportException: https://github.com/chalstrick/dondalfi.git: cannot open git-upload-pack
	at org.eclipse.jgit.transport.TransportHttp.connect(TransportHttp.java:527)

When I checkout the parent commit of this one the command succeeds. Google knows this error message and points you to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36268092/how-to-use-httpclientbuilder-with-http-proxy. Do we need something like this in our code?
