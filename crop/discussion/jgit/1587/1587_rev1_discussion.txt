Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RevWalkTextBuiltin.java -> I would prefer to say:

  if (oid == null)
    oid = a.getObjectId();

over using the ?: operator below.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RevWalkTextBuiltin.java -> Not every ref points to a commit.  For example in the jgit repository itself the ref refs/tags/spearce-gpg-pub points to a blob.  :-)

This should be wrapped in a try/catch to catch IncorrectObjectTypeException and ignore the error.
