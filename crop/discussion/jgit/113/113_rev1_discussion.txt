Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Please consider to rename the constant to be more precise.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> How about DEFAULT_REMOTE_NAME instead of REMOTE in order to be more explicit ? That's how the corresponding constant in EGit was named (see your other patch).
