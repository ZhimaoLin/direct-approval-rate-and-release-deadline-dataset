DESCRIPTION

Remove pointless boolean during native push

The boolean field sentCommand is always true at this point, as it
was assigned just 5 lines above.  So we always set the status of
the update command object to AWAITING_REPORT.

Simplify the logic by dropping the ?: operator.  I assume this is
older code from an attempt to manage dry-run push support within
the native connection, but in fact dry-run support is done higher
up inside of PushProcess.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; No score

I agree: after looking at the code I fully agree that the ?: operator can be skipped here.
