  * prefix - Optional property prefix, default is 'git.'
  * failonmissing - Whether or not to fail build when path does not exist

Task sets four properties:
  * _prefix_.state - RepositoryState
  * _prefix_.isClean - Status.isClean()
  * _prefix_.branch - Repository.getBranch()
  * _prefix_.commitId - Repository.resolve(getFullBranch().getName())

Sorry for the unhelpful message.  This change was abandoned automatically by a script, and due to operator error the correct message was not added.

It should have read:  "Abandoning after 3 months of inactivity.  If this change is still needed, please restore it."

Patch Set 2:

There was no response from maintainers since submitting a year ago. What's the likelihood of it being accepted if I rebase it again?
