DESCRIPTION

Fixes stack overflow if there's a cycle in alternates

There are clearly a couple of ways to handle this problem: one would
be for myAlternates to load all possible alternates, but that didn't
seem to be in the spirit of how the current implementation does
thingsâ€”doing as little work as possible and returning as soon as
possible. So this fix has methods that iterate over alternates keep
a reference to the FileObjectDatabase instance that started the
process. Those methods both check their alternates against the
primary's list and add new alternates to it as they are encountered.
Alternates the primary "knows" about are not traversed.

Line:766, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> alternates is already of a special synchronized class

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileObjectDatabase.java -> Please fix the indentation.

Since there is only one component, there is no point doing the extra arithmetic in hashCode

Line:377, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileObjectDatabase.java -> Since there is only one component, there is no point doing the extra arithmetic here
