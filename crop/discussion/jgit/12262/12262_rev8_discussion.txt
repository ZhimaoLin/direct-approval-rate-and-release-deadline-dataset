DESCRIPTION

Move ArchiveCommand into standard porcelain API

Allow use of ArchiveCommand without depending on the jgit command-line
tools.

Ideally this functionality would be part of the org.eclipse.jgit.api
package and callable through a Git object, but that would make the
org.eclipse.jgit bundle depend on commons-compress, unnecessarily
complicating the process of installing and upgrading JGit.

So this patch puts the functionality that requires an archiver into
its own bundle for people who want it.
