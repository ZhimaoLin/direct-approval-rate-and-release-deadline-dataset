Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

Why do we need a new bundle for a single command ? I think this should rather go into org.eclipse.jgit's api package instead and org.eclipse.jgit.pgm should then be refactored to use the implementation in org.eclipse.jgit

or do I miss something ?

Patch Set 4:

It's to prevent a dependency by the main API on commons-compress. If that dependency is fine, I agree that it would be nicer to put this in org.eclipse.jgit.api.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/about.html -> Fixed. (Most existing about.html files have the same trailing whitespace, but that's no reason not to make this copy more readable.)
