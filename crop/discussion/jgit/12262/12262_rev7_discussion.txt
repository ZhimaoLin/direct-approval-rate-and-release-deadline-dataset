DESCRIPTION

Move ArchiveCommand into standard porcelain API

Allow use of ArchiveCommand without depending on the jgit command-line
tools.

Ideally this functionality would be part of the org.eclipse.jgit.api
package and callable through a Git object, but that would make the
org.eclipse.jgit bundle depend on commons-compress, unnecessarily
complicating the process of installing and upgrading JGit.

So this patch puts the functionality that requires an archiver into
its own bundle for people who want it.

Still a work in progress. Fighting with Tycho ("No solution found because the problem is unsatisfiable"), hence the random change of providers for the OSGI framework.

(2 inline comments)

I didn't yet fully review this change, few remarks already:

- missing .settings (copy them from org.eclipse.jgit)

copy and adapt the following files from org.eclipse.jgit:
- missing .project and .classpath, we want contributors to be able to work without installing maven
- missing build.properties

Line:16, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I think we can't rely on an activator in all cases, e.g. org.eclipse.jgit.pgm and Gerrit use JGit as a plain jar and don't use OSGi class loading

Line:447, pom.xml -> I am not sure this is the right source to get the osgi framework from
