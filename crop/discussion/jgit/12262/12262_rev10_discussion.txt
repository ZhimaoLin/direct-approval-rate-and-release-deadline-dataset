DESCRIPTION

Move ArchiveCommand into standard porcelain API

Allow use of ArchiveCommand without depending on the jgit command-line
tools.

To avoid complicating the process of installing and upgrading JGit,
this does not add a dependency by the org.eclipse.jgit bundle on
commons-compress.  Instead, the caller is responsible for registering
any formats they want to use by calling ArchiveCommand.registerFormat.

This patch puts functionality that requires an archiver into a
separate org.eclipse.jgit.archive bundle for people who want it.  One
can use it by calling ArchiveCommand.registerFormat directly to
register its formats or by relying on OSGi class loading to load
org.eclipse.jgit.archive.FormatActivator, which takes care of
registration automatically.

Once the appropriate formats are registered, you can make a tar or zip
from a git tree object as follows:

	ArchiveCommand cmd = git.archive();
	try {
		cmd.setTree(tree).setFormat(fmt).setOutputStream(out).call();
	} finally {
		cmd.release();
	}
