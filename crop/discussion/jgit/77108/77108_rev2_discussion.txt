DESCRIPTION

Limit receive commands

Place a configurable upper bound on the amount of command data
received from clients during `git push`.  The limit is applied to the
encoded wire protocol format, not the JGit in-memory representation.
This allows clients to flexibly use the limit; shorter reference names
allow for more commands, longer reference names permit fewer commands
per batch.

Based on data gathered from many repositories at $DAY_JOB, the average
reference name is well under 200 bytes when encoded in UTF-8 (the wire
encoding).  The new 3 MiB default receive.maxCommandBytes allows about
11,155 references in a single `git push` invocation.  A Gerrit Code
Review system with six-digit change numbers could still encode 29,399
references in the 3 MiB maxCommandBytes limit.
