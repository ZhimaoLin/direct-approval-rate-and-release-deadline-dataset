DESCRIPTION

Limit receive commands

Place a configurable upper bound on the amount of command data
received from clients during `git push`.  The limit is applied to the
encoded wire protocol format, not the JGit in-memory representation.
This allows clients to flexibly use the limit; shorter reference names
allow for more commands, longer reference names permit fewer commands
per batch.

Based on data gathered from many repositories at $DAY_JOB, the average
reference name is well under 200 bytes when encoded in UTF-8 (the wire
encoding).  The new 3 MiB default receive.maxCommandBytes allows about
11,155 references in a single `git push` invocation.  A Gerrit Code
Review system with six-digit change numbers could still encode 29,399
references in the 3 MiB maxCommandBytes limit.

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> A very minor point that could just be reflective of poor reading comprehension on my part, but it took me a non-negligible amount of time to understand that this comment means "if the limit is set, the limit must not be 0." Perhaps this sentiment could be equivalently but much more clearly expressed with the simple addition of a comma after "set":

// if set, limit must not be 0 (means unlimited).
