DESCRIPTION

Limit receive commands

Place a configurable upper bound on the amount of command data
received from clients during `git push`.  The limit is applied to the
encoded wire protocol format, not the JGit in-memory representation.
This allows clients to flexibly use the limit; shorter reference names
allow for more commands, longer reference names permit fewer commands
per batch.

Based on data gathered from many repositories at $DAY_JOB, the average
reference name is well under 200 bytes when encoded in UTF-8 (the wire
encoding).  The new 3 MiB default receive.maxCommandBytes allows about
11,155 references in a single `git push` invocation.  A Gerrit Code
Review system with six-digit change numbers could still encode 29,399
references in the 3 MiB maxCommandBytes limit.

Line:1067, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> nit: Unrelated?  I think jgit doesn't not use them normally for single command blocks?  Same other places in this change?

Line:606, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> nit:  s/too/Too/ ?  (to match below)

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> style: bracketing style seems to not match the rest of file.

Line:1067, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> In recent reviews it has been said that braces should be added even for one-liners, in new code.

This is not new code though, so it should probably not have been added here.

(it's added because this whole block got moved in the original version, and then moved back here by me in the latest Ps to fix the test failures)

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> it's not consistent in the file anyway; see L217 for example.

for new code we should use brackets, according to recent reviews.
