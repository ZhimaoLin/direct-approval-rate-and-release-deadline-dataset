DESCRIPTION

Do authentication re-tries on HTTP POST when pushing

There is at least one git server out there (GOGS) that does
not require authentication on the initial GET for
info/refs?service=git-receive-pack but that _does_ require
authentication for the subsequent POST to actually do the push.

This occurs on GOGS with public repositories; for private
repositories it wants authentication up front.

Handle this behavior by adding 401 handling to our POST request.
Note that this is suboptimal; we'll re-send the push data at
least twice if an authentication failure on POST occurs. It
would be much better if the server required authentication
up-front in the GET request.

Also limit the number of times we'll follow redirects.

Tested successfully with a public repository at try.gogs.io.
That server offers only BASIC auth, so the other paths
(DIGEST, NEGOTIATE, fall back from DIGEST to BASIC) are untested
and I have no way to test them.

Also tested with a public repo after clearing the credentials and
then entering wrong data: correctly asks three times during the HTTP
POST for user name and password, then gives up.

Also tested successfully with a private repo at try.gogs.io,
verifying that the authentication from GET gets applied initially
to the POST request.

Line:1021, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> While I think that this statement is correct, I also see that HttpAuthMethod.Negotiate creates a *new* GSSContext on each configureRequest(). I think that is broken.

Another thing that I haven't quite found the answer to is how SPNEGO is supposed to work with several subsequent requests. I can't believe that each request has to be authenticated individually and go again through the several exchanges. I would expect a once established GSSContext to remain valid (after all,it has a lifetime), and be able to re-use it for multiple subsequent requests until the lifetime ends. But I don't see our code doing that, and I have not found any clear documentation of that. What should the token be to send on the second request once the GET has been successfully authenticated with NEGOTIATE?

Hmmm... maybe I've been looking for too long at the JDK doing NTLM as part of Negotiate at https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1086668/ ... If we do only the Kerberos part of SPNEGO, using a fresh context might actually work?
