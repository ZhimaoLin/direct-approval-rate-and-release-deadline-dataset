DESCRIPTION

Do authentication re-tries on HTTP POST when pushing

There is at least one git server out there (GOGS) that does
not require authentication on the initial GET for
info/refs?service=git-receive-pack but that _does_ require
authentication for the subsequent POST to actually do the push.

This occurs on GOGS with public repositories; for private
repositories it wants authentication up front.

Handle this behavior by adding 401 handling to our POST request.
Note that this is suboptimal; we'll re-send the push data at
least twice if an authentication failure on POST occurs. It
would be much better if the server required authentication
up-front in the GET request.

Also limit the number of times we'll follow redirects.

Tested successfully with a public repository at try.gogs.io.
That server offers only BASIC auth, so the other paths
(DIGEST, NEGOTIATE, fall back from DIGEST to BASIC) are untested
and I have no way to test them.

Also tested with a public repo after clearing the credentials and
then entering wrong data: correctly asks three times during the HTTP
POST for user name and password, then gives up.

Also tested successfully with a private repo at try.gogs.io,
verifying that the authentication from GET gets applied initially
to the POST request.

Please review carefully. Who's the HTTP authentication expert around here?

Line:964, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> How was that recursion limited? The new code follows only 3 redirects, and does it in the loop, not recursively.

Line:956, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Proxy authentication not handled. (It's also not handled in TransportHttp.connect().)

Line:1016, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Given that comment we might consider ignoring NEGOTIATE up front. We risk sending the data multiple times.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:956, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Don't know if it's needed, and I really don't know how to set up a mock proxy server for unit tests. We do open the http connection with a proxy, and at least the JDK HttpUrlConnection should handle it? Though I think I remember a forum topic on problems with an authenticating proxy...
