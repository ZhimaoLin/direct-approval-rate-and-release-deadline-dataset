DESCRIPTION

Do authentication re-tries on HTTP POST when pushing

There is at least one git server out there (GOGS) that does
not require authentication on the initial GET for
info/refs?service=git-receive-pack but that _does_ require
authentication for the subsequent POST to actually do the push.

This occurs on GOGS with public repositories; for private
repositories it wants authentication up front.

Handle this behavior by adding 401 handling to our POST request.
Note that this is suboptimal; we'll re-send the push data at
least twice if an authentication failure on POST occurs. It
would be much better if the server required authentication
up-front in the GET request.

Also limit the number of times we'll follow redirects.

Tested successfully with a public repository at try.gogs.io.
That server offers only BASIC auth, so the other paths
(DIGEST, NEGOTIATE, fall back from DIGEST to BASIC) are untested
and I have no way to test them.

Also tested with a public repo after clearing the credentials and
then entering wrong data: correctly asks three times during the HTTP
POST for user name and password, then gives up.

Also tested successfully with a private repo at try.gogs.io,
verifying that the authentication from GET gets applied initially
to the POST request.
