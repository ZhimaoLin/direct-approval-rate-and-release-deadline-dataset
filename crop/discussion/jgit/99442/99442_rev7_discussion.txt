DESCRIPTION

Do authentication re-tries on HTTP POST when pushing

There is at least one git server out there (GOGS) that does
not require authentication on the initial GET for
info/refs?service=git-receive-pack but that _does_ require
authentication for the subsequent POST to actually do the push.

This occurs on GOGS with public repositories; for private
repositories it wants authentication up front.

Handle this behavior by adding 401 handling to our POST request.
Note that this is suboptimal; we'll re-send the push data at
least twice if an authentication failure on POST occurs. It
would be much better if the server required authentication
up-front in the GET request.

Also limit the number of times we'll follow redirects.

Tested successfully with a public repository at try.gogs.io.
That server offers only BASIC auth, so the other paths
(DIGEST, NEGOTIATE, fall back from DIGEST to BASIC) are untested
and I have no way to test them.

Also tested with a public repo after clearing the credentials and
then entering wrong data: correctly asks three times during the HTTP
POST for user name and password, then gives up.

Also tested successfully with a private repo at try.gogs.io,
verifying that the authentication from GET gets applied initially
to the POST request.

Do we have a way to actually configure the test server such that it would behave like GOGS, i.e., request authentication only on the post?

Line:965, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/46261/ has much better redirect handling.

Patch Set 7:

Once https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/46261/ is in I'll rebase this and will add unit tests then. (Already written -- found a way to make the test server behave like GOGS).
