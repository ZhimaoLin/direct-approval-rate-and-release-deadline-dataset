DESCRIPTION

Fix carrying over flags during a RevWalk

There was a bug when carrying over flags from a merge commit to its non-first
parents. The first parent of a merge commit was handled differently and correct
but the non-first parents are handled by a recursive algorithm. Flags should be
copied from the root merge commit to parent-2, to grandparent-2, ... up to the
limit of STACK_DEPTH==500 parents-levels. But the recursive algorithm  was
always copying only to the direct parents of the merge commit and not the
grand*-parents.

This seems to be no problem when commits are handled in a strict date order
because then copying only one level is no problem if children are handled
before parents. But when commits are not seperated anymore by distinctive
correct dates (e.g. because all commits have the same date) then it may happen
that a merge-parent is handled before the merge commit and when dealing later
with the merge commit one has to copy flags down to more than one level

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitsSameDateTest.java -> Maybe add another test case for a custom flag in addition to UNINTERESTING? I would not be surprised if there are separate codepaths that get exercised there. (Although this probably just shows that I am not really all that familiar with this code :)

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> IIUC this should also happen if the commits are truly out of order, i.e. the parent has a strictly newer timestamp than the merge commit. Worth adding that to the test case?

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitsSameDateTest.java -> I can also imagine that different code paths are executed. But I added a test for a custom flag and that shows the same bug.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
