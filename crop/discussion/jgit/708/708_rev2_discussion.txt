DESCRIPTION

Fix SSH deadlock during OutOfMemoryError

In close() method of SshFetchConnection and SshPushConnection
errorThread.join() can wait forever if JSch will not close the
channel's error stream.  Join with a timeout, and interrupt the
copy thread if its blocked on data that will never arrive.
