DESCRIPTION

Suppress deprecation warnings related to UploadPackLogger

UploadPackLogger is deprecated but will not be removed until
JGit version 5.0.

Suppress the unavoidable deprecation warnings on usages of the
interface that are kept for backwards compatibility.

Add a TODO so that we don't forget to remove it in 5.0.
