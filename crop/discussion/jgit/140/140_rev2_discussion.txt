DESCRIPTION

Add merge algorithm

Adds the merge alorithm and tests for merge to jgit. The merge algorithm in
MergeAlgorithm.java will
- get as input parameters the common base, the two new contents called "ours" and "theirs"
- compute the Edits from base to ours and from base to theirs with the help of MyersDiff
- iterate over the edits
-- independent edits from ours or from theirs will just be applied to the result
-- for conflicting edits I first harmonize the ranges of the edits so that in the end we
   have exactly two edits starting and ending at the same points in the common base. Then
   write the two conclicting contents into the result

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

This looks pretty good.  Most of my comments are style nits,
the actual way its put together is fairly elegant.

If you fix the style nits, I think its ready for inclusion.

If you are still looking for a better name, "ContentMerger" ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeAlgorithm.java -> Since this class provides only static methods, provide a private constructor so instances cannot be created, and the class cannot be subclassed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeChunk.java -> Since these are immutable, mark them final so its clear to everyone they can't change once a MergeChunk has been created.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeResult.java -> I think we should clarify that the list is used as-is and thus should be immutable so the MergeResult doesn't suddenly modify due to the caller changing the list and reusing it for some other purpose after making the MergeResult.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeResult.java -> This worries me about being brittle with regards to the ordering of the enums inside of the enum declaration.  If they ever moved around, this switch might start reporting strange results.

I wonder if this wouldn't be better:

  private static final ConflictState[] states = ConflictState.values();

  state = states[chunks.get(idx++)];

My only concern is would it be faster or slower than the switch.  I suspect it would be slower, but have nothing to back up that hunch.  :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeFormatter.java -> I think the Javadoc should also clarify that not only are we dealing with RawText objects, but that its a line-oriented file with LF being used as the line delimiters when producing conflict regions.

This is good enough for most uses, but if someone comes along and wants to do a different merge function, they might be tempted to use this code until they start to discover our hidden LF assumptions.  We should be a bit more clear about that up front in the docs.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeFormatter.java -> I don't think we should assume the host character encoding here.  We should probably get the character encoding passed in to us.  We might be able to figure it out by looking at the input sequences and guessing, or by looking at a .gitattributes file.
