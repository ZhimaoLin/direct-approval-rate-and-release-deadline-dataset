DESCRIPTION

Add file content merge algorithm

Adds the file content merge alorithm and tests for merge to jgit.
The merge algorithm:

- Gets as input parameters the common base, the two new contents
  called "ours" and "theirs".

- Computes the Edits from base to ours and from base to theirs with
  the help of MyersDiff.

- Iterates over the edits.

- Independent edits from ours or from theirs will just be applied
  to the result.

- For conflicting edits we first harmonize the ranges of the edits
  so that in the end we have exactly two edits starting and ending
  at the same points in the common base. Then we write the two
  conclicting contents into the result stream.
