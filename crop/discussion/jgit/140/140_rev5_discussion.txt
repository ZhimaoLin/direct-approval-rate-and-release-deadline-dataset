DESCRIPTION

Add merge algorithm

Adds the merge alorithm and tests for merge to jgit. The merge algorithm in
MergeAlgorithm.java will
- get as input parameters the common base, the two new contents called "ours" and "theirs"
- compute the Edits from base to ours and from base to theirs with the help of MyersDiff
- iterate over the edits
-- independent edits from ours or from theirs will just be applied to the result
-- for conflicting edits I first harmonize the ranges of the edits so that in the end we
   have exactly two edits starting and ending at the same points in the common base. Then
   write the two conclicting contents into the result

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I worked on all of Robins comments. This lead to changes mostly on comments. To get around String encoding problems for the merge test data I decided to use the default encoding defined in Constants (wich happens to be UTF-8)

Only 3 comment typos.  I'll +2 and you can submit as-is if you want, or maybe clean them up with one more round.  :-)
