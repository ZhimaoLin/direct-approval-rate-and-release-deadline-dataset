I'm a bit confused by these errors, since I don't really know how this dependency management stuff works. And this whole series succeeded locally on my machine.

do we really want to do a major version increment in a release meant for Kepler SR1 ?

Patch Set 1:

I don't have enough experience with supporting multiple versions of JGit to know what the downside is of having lots of new major versions, I suppose. So I'll defer to you in this case :)

Anyway, I think we can avoid a breaking API change here in one of two ways:
-Pass a db into newReader and use the default implementation I proposed (aggressively flush).
-Have a default implementation return null and force call sites to fall back to db.newReader().

I haven't looked at the call sites recently enough to know which one of these is better, but I will try it out today or tomorrow.

then please avoid to break the API here, we are releasing as part of the release train and so far only did major version changes with the train's yearly release in June every year and minor releases synchronized with the train's service releases in September and February (+ another minor version in December)

If you haven't seen Shawn's email on jgit-dev but you're reading this review thread, I suggest you head over there and weigh in :)

For this particular series, though, the newInserter(db) approach isn't too horrendously ugly, so I think we can drop this change.
