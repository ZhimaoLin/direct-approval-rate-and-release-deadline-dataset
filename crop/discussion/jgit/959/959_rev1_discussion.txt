DESCRIPTION

Refactor repository construction to builder class

The new FileRepositoryBuilder class helps applications to construct
a properly configured FileRepository, with properties assumed based
upon the standard Git rules for the local filesystem.

To better support simple command line applications, environment
variable handling and repository searching was moved into this
builder class.

The change gets rid of the ever-growing FileRepository constructor
variants, and the multitude of java.io.File typed parameters,
by using simple named setter methods.

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/T0003_Basic.java -> The constructor isn't used here - passed to builder, perhaps?

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryBuilder.java -> I don't see the difference between this and the BaseRepositoryBuilder at this stage. Should this be abstract? If so, what is the difference? If not, then what's the distinction between this and a FileRepositoryBuilder?

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> You've called it 'frb' but this is an instance of 'RepositoryBuilder'. Shouldn't this be a FileRepositoryBuilder instead?

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/FileRepository.java -> I thought blank lines introduced a paragraph anyway?

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/T0003_Basic.java -> Thanks, also fixed in 1046.

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryBuilder.java -> BaseRepositoryBuilder is type parameterized by the the type of repository it creates, and the type of the builder itself, to implement all of the chaining methods.  Because of these two type parameters its a horrible thing to use in application level code.

This class exists to define those type parameters with sane defaults, and prevent application code from needing to care.  But FileRepositoryBuilder wants different values for the same type parameters, but still wants roughly the same logic.  So we throw all of that up in BaseRepositoryBuilder.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Main.java -> Thanks, fixed in http://egit.eclipse.org/r/1046

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/FileRepository.java -> Eh.  Our style seems to be to include <p> anyway.  Might just be my habit from the dark days of Javadoc where \n just meant space and <p> was required to get a proper paragraph break.
