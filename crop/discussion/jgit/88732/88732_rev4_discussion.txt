DESCRIPTION

Enable and fix 'Should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx warning

Set missingOverrideAnnotation=warning in Eclipse compiler preferences
which enables the warning:

  The method <method> of type <type> should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx
  since it actually overrides a superclass method

Justification for this warning is described in:

  http://stackoverflow.com/a/94411/381622

Enabling this causes in excess of 1000 warnings across the entire
code-base. They are very easy to fix automatically with Eclipse's
"Quick Fix" tool. Fix all of them.

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java -> these 2 methods simply do not exist in Jetty 9.2.13:

but they exist in 9.3.9:
