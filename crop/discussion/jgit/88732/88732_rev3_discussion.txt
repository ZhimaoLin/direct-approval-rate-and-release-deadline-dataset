DESCRIPTION

Enable and fix 'Should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx warning

Set missingOverrideAnnotation=warning in Eclipse compiler preferences
which enables the warning:

  The method <method> of type <type> should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx
  since it actually overrides a superclass method

Justification for this warning is described in:

  http://stackoverflow.com/a/94411/381622

Enabling this causes in excess of 1000 warnings across the entire
code-base. They are very easy to fix automatically with Eclipse's
"Quick Fix" tool.

Fix all of them except 2 which cause compilation failure when the
project is built with mvn; add TODO comments on those for further
investigation.

Patch Set 3:

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java -> caused by missing Maven dependency to

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
      <artifactId>jetty-security</artifactId>
    </dependency>

hence the compiler doesn't see the superclass and complains about xxx@xxx.xxx annotation

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java -> it seems there are more Jetty modules missing on Maven classpath, we need to ensure Maven classpath matches package dependencies defined in Manifest.mf
