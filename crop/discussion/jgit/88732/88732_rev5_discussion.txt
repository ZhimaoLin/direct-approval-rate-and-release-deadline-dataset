DESCRIPTION

Enable and fix 'Should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx warning

Set missingOverrideAnnotation=warning in Eclipse compiler preferences
which enables the warning:

  The method <method> of type <type> should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx
  since it actually overrides a superclass method

Justification for this warning is described in:

  http://stackoverflow.com/a/94411/381622

Enabling this causes in excess of 1000 warnings across the entire
code-base. They are very easy to fix automatically with Eclipse's
"Quick Fix" tool.

Fix all of them except 2 which cause compilation failure when the
project is built with mvn; add TODO comments on those for further
investigation.
