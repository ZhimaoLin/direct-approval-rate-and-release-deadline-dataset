DESCRIPTION

Enable and fix 'Should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx warning

Set missingOverrideAnnotation=warning in Eclipse compiler preferences
which enables the warning:

  The method <method> of type <type> should be tagged xxx@xxx.xxx
  since it actually overrides a superclass method

Justification for this warning is described in:

  http://stackoverflow.com/a/94411/381622

Enabling this causes 1020 warnings across the entire code-base. They
are very easy to fix automatically with Eclipse's "Quick Fix" tool.

It's not working as expected.

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java -> This fails when building on the command line:

 error: method does not override or implement a method from a supertype

but xxx@xxx.xxx is removed, Eclipse gives a warning.

Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/http/AppServer.java -> Same here
