Line:383, pom.xml -> If anything, we should be using the jsch repo from http://jsch.sourceforge.net/maven2/ . It's worth noting that there is a discussion on jsch-users regarding deploying the latest version on maven central.

Patch Set 2:

I would love to get things from maven central.

If jsch just put the latest release in maven central, that will make our life easier.
