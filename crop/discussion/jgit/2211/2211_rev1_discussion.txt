This is a huge can of worms for JGit to upgrade to .44.  In the meantime I would bump Gerrit Code Review itself to .44, it excludes the JGit JSch dependency inside of its pom specifically to allow it to use a newer version.

Sigh. I started the CQ process for 0.1.44 anyway as this will be needed for the Eclipse platform before 3.7 is out the door.
