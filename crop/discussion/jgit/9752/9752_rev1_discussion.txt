Patch Set 1: Unclean IP, do not check in

I'm not sure we have go for following http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/IP_Due_Diligence_for_Git_and_Gerrit just yet. Do you have any other information?

Patch Set 1:

Here you go:

    I have authored 100% of the content I'm contributing;
    I have the rights to donate the content to Eclipse; and
    I contribute the content under the project's license(s) (e.g. EPL) 

I don't know how long it still takes to finalize this simple thing, but currently it's a waste of every ones time.

Note that I'm a committer on EGit already.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Unfortunately being a commit on EGit seems to not imply committer status on JGit. That must be applied for separately.
