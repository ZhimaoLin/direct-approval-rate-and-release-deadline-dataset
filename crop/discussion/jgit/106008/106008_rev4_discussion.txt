DESCRIPTION

PullCommand: Handle URI strings in setRemote()

Previously, the test would have been failing. There are some
complexities to handling repos for which the remote is a local file. I
am sure that I haven't covered all of the possible inputs, but it
works for many common cases.

Good point about being able to pull from an arbitrary remoteUri. I have also taken the liberty to make the default fetch List<RefSpec> include "HEAD:" as that is the default ref spec used by the command-line git client when you fetch without specifying a refSpec.

Line:834, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Move this into a separate change, since this intended enhancement is unrelated to the subject of this change "PullCommand: Handle URI strings in setRemote()".

this does not work in all cases:
* clone jgit repository
* comment out fetch refspecs in .git/config
* run "jgit fetch origin"
* this works with native git command line but fails when using this version of jgit:

 $ jgit fetch origin
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException: Nothing to fetch.

I moved the setting of the HedRef up to the PullCommand and also showed how to do the same for users of the FetchCommand who might want to pull from a URI.

Line:834, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Done
