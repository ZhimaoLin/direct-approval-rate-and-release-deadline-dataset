DESCRIPTION

PullCommand: Handle URI strings in setRemote()

complexities to handling repos for which the remote is a local file. I
am sure that I haven't covered all of the possible inputs, but it
works for many common cases.

I notice that the Hudson build failed. I'm not familiar with the failing test, but I'll investigate this now:
