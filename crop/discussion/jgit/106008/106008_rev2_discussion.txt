DESCRIPTION

PullCommand: Handle URI strings in setRemote()

Previously, the test would have been failing. There are some
complexities to handling repos for which the remote is a local file. I
am sure that I haven't covered all of the possible inputs, but it
works for many common cases.

it should also be possible to pull from a URL which isn't configured as a remote

Line:298, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> ignore since neither an existing remote nor parseable as a URI
