DESCRIPTION

Split note leaf buckets at 256 elements

Leaf level notes trees are split into a new fan-out tree if an
insertion occurs and the tree already contains >= 256 notes in it.

The splitting may occur multiple times if all of the notes have the
same prefix; in the worst case this produces a tree path such as
"00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/00/be" if all
of the notes begin with zeros.
