DESCRIPTION

Use long for more object counts in PackWriter

Packs can contain up to 2^32-1 objects, which exceeds the range of a
Java int. Try harder to accept higher object counts in some cases by
using long more often when we are working with the object count value.

This is a trivial refactoring, we may have to make even more changes
to the object handling code to support more than 2^31-1 objects.
