DESCRIPTION

Use long for more object counts in PackWriter

Packs can contain up to 2^32-1 objects, which exceeds the range of a
Java int. Try harder to accept higher object counts in some cases by
using long more often when we are working with the object count value.

This is a trivial refactoring, we may have to make even more changes
to the object handling code to support more than 2^31-1 objects.

Line:970, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> why do you no longer preset the capacity of the BlockList to the number of objects to be added ?

Line:970, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Oh, good catch. I should restore that. I took it out thinking the BlockList would default to a directory of 256. But with this argument present the BlockList uses a smaller directory, between 1 and 4 entries.
