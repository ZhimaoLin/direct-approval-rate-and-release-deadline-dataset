This change does not yet fully implement the migration steps [1] required for Tycho 0.12 adoption.

[1] http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/tycho-user/msg00102.html

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/pom.xml -> this group id needs to change to org.eclipse.tycho since 0.12 is the first version coming from eclipse :-)

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/pom.xml -> some of the tycho artifactIds changed with 0.12
