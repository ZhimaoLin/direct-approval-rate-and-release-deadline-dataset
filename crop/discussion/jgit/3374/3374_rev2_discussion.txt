Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I was having some issues with Tycho running UI tests in 0.12, I think we should have off for now.

Patch Set 2:

On Mac egit ui tests were successful for me with this change, maybe you have to run maven once with the -U option, this was also mentioned in some mails of the mail thread around the mail with the migration instructions. On which platform do you face problems with ui tests ?

Patch Set 2:

Linux.

We should potentially wait until tycho is approved through the Eclipse IP process, it's still being worked on.
