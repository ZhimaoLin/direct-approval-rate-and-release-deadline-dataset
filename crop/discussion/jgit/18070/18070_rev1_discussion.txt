DESCRIPTION

Declare that org.eclipse.jgit.transport uses com.jcraft.jsch

This should prevent class cast problems caused by jgit and egit bundles
wiring to different versions of com.jcraft.jsch.

Looks fine and should help with the immediate issue with com.jcraft.jsch.  At some point we may need to revisit the best practices of manifests in Eclipse and use tools (such as PDE) to calculate the uses directives for us.  I imagine you have more package uses relationships than this.

If so you are not alone, there are tons of uses relationships from the eclipse project that do not specify the uses directive either.

jgit has very view dependencies, I checked all of them and found that the only external types exposed in package org.eclipse.jgit.transport are from jsch, all other classes used from 3rd party dependencies are only used internally by the jgit implementation.
