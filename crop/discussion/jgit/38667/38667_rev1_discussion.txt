DESCRIPTION

Fix junit tests under windows when the platform is explicitly changed

SystemReader used a chached ObjectChecker which was instantiated only
once. But in case of unit tests where we can change the platform
dynamically (e.g. MockSystemReader.setWindows()) this is wrong and
caused DirCacheCheckoutMaliciousPathTest.testMaliciousAbsoluteCurDrivePathWindowsOnUnix()
to fail. This change allows user of SystemReader to force the creation
of a new ObjectChecker. MockSystemReader.setWindows() and .setUnix()
make use of this feature.
