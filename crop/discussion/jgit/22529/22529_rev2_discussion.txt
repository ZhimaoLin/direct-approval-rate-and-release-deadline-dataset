DESCRIPTION

Don't raise checkout conflict for file missing in working tree

During a checkout we want to prevent to overwrite unsaved local file
content. Jgit was therefore checking whether the file to overwrite is
dirty or missing and would raise a conflict if this was the case. That
was wrong. It should only check if the file is dirty. It's ok to
"overwrite" a missing/non-existing file.
