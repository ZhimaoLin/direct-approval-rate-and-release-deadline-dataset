DESCRIPTION

Fix RefUpdate performance for existing Refs

No longer invoke the expensive RefDatabase.isNameConflicting() check on
updating existing refs, reducing batch ref update time by ~97%.

The RefDirectory implementation of isNameConflicting() is quite
slow (it has to do an expensive loose-ref scan) but it's only necessary
to perform this check on ref update if the ref is being *created* - if
the ref already exists, we can already guarantee that it does not
conflict with any other refs.

C-Git seems to use a similar condition before making the
is_refname_available() check:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/v1.8.1.4/refs.c#L1660-L1670

As an example of the effects on performance, here's a simple timing
experiment using The BFG to remove one file from the JGit repo:

---
$ wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg-repo-cleaner/1.0.1/bfg-1.0.1.jar
$ git clone --mirror https://git.eclipse.org/r/p/jgit/jgit.git
$ java -jar bfg-1.0.1.jar -D make_jgit.sh jgit.git
....
Updating references:    100% (5760/5760)
...Ref update completed in 148,949 ms.

BFG run is complete!
---

The execution time for the run is completely dominated by the batch ref
update at the end. Repeating the experiment with BFG v1.0.2 (using JGit
patched with this change), the refs update is dramatically reduced:

---
Updating references:    100% (5760/5760)
...Ref update completed in 4,327 ms.

pleasantly surprised to see Robin has just been working in a the same area with a more substantial change in I17d0b3cc (Speed up clone/fetch with large number of refs) which would address performance for ref creation :)

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> I was thinking that we cannot rely on that because packed refs may exist in conflicting forms, but when you update you create a loose ref.  Normally the conflict checks should prevent this, but...

This doesn't help with clone or a fetch with many refs. It seems we should merge our patches.

Yup, this change doesn't help on clone/fetch with many new refs, just for update of existing refs. It does have the virtue of being a very small change.

Robin's patch is more ambitious, would be very happy to see that go in! Just needs to address Shawn's comments?

IANAC (I Am Not A Committer), but am happy to review or submit an updated patch on I17d0b3ccc27f868c8497607d8e57bf7082e65ba3 if that helps.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> If the refs in .git/packed-refs exist in conflicted forms, won't they continue to be in conflict even if we abort the ref update and don't create the loose ref?

I confess I'm not sure, but don't I think I can see a way that omitting the isNameConflicting() check (in the case of existing refs) would make things worse.
