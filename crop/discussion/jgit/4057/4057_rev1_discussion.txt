Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> why do you change Google's copyright statement ? I think you are working for IBM

Line:951, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> please also fix the typo : s/refAlreadExists/refAlreadyExists/

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Sorry, this what we do in Eclipse with every change. I thought that IBM is one of the "other copyright owners". I will leave it untouched in the next patch set.
