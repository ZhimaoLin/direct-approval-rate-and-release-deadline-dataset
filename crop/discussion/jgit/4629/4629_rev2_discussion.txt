DESCRIPTION

Refactor DfsReader selection of cached packs

Make the code more clear with a simple refactoring of the boolean
logic into a method that describes the condition we are looking
for on each pack file. A cached pack is possible if there exists
a tips collection, and the collection is non-empty.
