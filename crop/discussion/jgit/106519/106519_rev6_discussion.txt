Line:697, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Use tabs

Line:699, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> This makes me slightly uncomfortable because it limits the ability of this test to detect regressions.

I think it should be possible to test this by overriding ObjectInserter#newReader to return a custom ObjectReader whose ObjectLoaders fail if you try to read past FIRST_FEW_BYTES. It's a little ugly, but fortunately there is Object{Reader,Inserter}.Filter which makes overriding less painful than it could be.

Line:708, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Nit: use StandardCharsets.UTF_8 (optionally with a static import)

Line:713, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Tabs

Line:716, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> UTF_8

Line:724, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> UTF_8

Line:729, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> See my comment above, here is where you would wrap the inserter in a custom ObjectInserter subclass that prevents the merger from reading further than it should.

It's somewhat surprising you can control reading from something called "inserter", but for this test it's nice that it's possible.

Yeah, I won't claim it's not surprising, but ObjectInserter#newReader is extremely important for Gerrit, hence all the JGit APIs that take only an inserter.
