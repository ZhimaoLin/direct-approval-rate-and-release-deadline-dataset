LGTM, just style nits.

Line:717, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Now we have 1 tab and the rest spaces

Line:740, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Nit: blank line between methods

Line:757, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> I wouldn't object.

Line:790, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Nit: blank line before method.

Line:809, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Nit: stray space
