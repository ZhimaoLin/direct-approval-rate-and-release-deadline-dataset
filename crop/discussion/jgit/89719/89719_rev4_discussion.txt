DESCRIPTION

IndexDiffSubmoduleTest: Fix negative use count

submoduleStandalone is created by createWorkRepository() which adds
the created repository to the set of repositories to be closed in
the test teardown. It is therefore not necessary to explicitly close
it.

Patch Set 4:

After this patch I only have 3 instances of "close() called when useCnt is already zero" when running "mvn clean package" from the command line:

http://paste.openstack.org/show/598375/

One of them is from RepositoryCacheTest #testRepositoryUnregisteringWhenExpiredAndUsageCountNegative and that's expected.

The other two, in TransportTest and URIishTest, do not occur when I run the tests in Eclipse.
