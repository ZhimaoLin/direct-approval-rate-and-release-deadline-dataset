DESCRIPTION

Do not rewrite parents in RevWalkTextBuiltins

Default behavior of C git is to skip parent rewriting unless
particular history simplification or --parents flags are passed. Since
JGit has no such flags, JGit should not rewrite parents.

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RevWalkTextBuiltin.java -> I think this breaks the graphical viewer tool. You may need to set true in that program, which IIRC is a subclass of this class.

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/RevWalkTextBuiltin.java -> Glog overrides createWalk to return a PlotWalk, it doesn't call the super method.
