Corrected style nits and Javadoc error

The Javadoc for SshSessionFactory.getSession wrongly stated that the
timeout value should be in seconds. Changed this to milliseconds.

squash this commit with your previous commit and ensure that
change-id footer is the one from the previous commit:

Change-Id: Iece43632086afadf175af6638255041ccaf2bfbb

and push it to gerrit again. This will ensure that the squashed commit ends up as second patchset in that change. When this succeeded abandon this change.
