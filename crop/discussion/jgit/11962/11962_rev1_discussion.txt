DESCRIPTION

Support excluding objects during DFS compaction

By excluding objects the compactor can avoid storing objects that
are already well packed in the base GC packs, or any other pack
not being replaced by the current compaction operation.

For deltas the base object is still included even if the base exists
in another exclusion set.  This favors keeping deltas for recent
history, to support faster fetch operations for clients.

Line:306, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> how could this be true within a single pack? I thought an object could only occur once within a pack, since you pre-filtered these in toInclude.

Line:334, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> So you are trying to find all objects in the src that are not already in the repository.

Line:306, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> Call it being paranoid. The resulting pack is corrupt if an object is included twice.

Line:334, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> Objects in src that were not explicitly excluded, yes.
