DESCRIPTION

Do not fake a SymbolicRef as an ObjectIdRef

When doing a detaching operation, JGit fakes a SymbolicRef as an
ObjectIdRef. This is because RefUpdate#updateImpl dereferences the
SymbolicRef when updating it. For example, assume that HEAD is
pointing to refs/heads/master. If I try to make a detached HEAD
pointing to a commit c0ffee, RefUpdate dereferences HEAD as
refs/heads/master first and changes refs/heads/master to c0ffee. The
detach argument of RefDatabase#newUpdate avoids this dereference by
faking HEAD as ObjectIdRef.

This faking is problematic for the linking operation of
DfsRefDatabase. It does a compare-and-swap operation on every
reference change because of its distributed systems nature. If a
SymbolicRef is faked as an ObjectRef, it thinks that there is a
racing change in the reference and rejects the update. Because of
this, DFS based repositories cannot change the link target of symbolic
refs. This has not been a problem for file-based repositories because
they have a file-lock based semantics instead of the CAS based one.
The reference implementation, InMemoryRepository, is not affected
because it only compares ObjectIds.

When [1] introduced this faking code, there was no way for RefUpdate
to distinguish the detaching operation. When [2] fixed the detaching
operation, it introduced a detachingSymbolicRef flag. This commit uses
this flag to control whether it needs to dereference the symbolic refs
by calling Ref#getLeaf. The same flag is used in the reflog update
operation.

This commit does not affect any operation that succeeds currently. In
some DFS repository implementations, this fixes a ref linking
operation, which is currently failing.

 > Would the dfs/ and file/ parts of this work as separate changes?

No. A change in RefUpdate affects both.

Yes. There are many tests that operate on references. This commit changes all kind of reference operation (delete, update, link), and no test is failing.

I found that I could separate the InMemoryRepository change, so I reset that.
