DESCRIPTION

Do not fake a SymbolicRef as an ObjectIdRef

When doing a detaching operation, JGit fakes a SymbolicRef as an ObjectIdRef.
This is because RefUpdate#updateImpl dereferences the SymbolicRef when updating
it. For example, assume that HEAD is pointing refs/heads/master. If I try to
make a detached HEAD pointing to a commit 0xc0ffee, RefUpdate dereferences HEAD
as refs/heads/master first and changes refs/heads/master to 0xc0ffee.
The detach argument of RefDatabase#newUpdate avoids this dereference by faking
HEAD as ObjectIdRef.

This faking is problematic for the linking operation of DfsRefDatabase. It does
a compare-and-swap operation on every reference change because of its
distributed systems nature. If a SymbolicRef is faked as an ObjectRef, it thinks
that there was a change in the reference and rejects the update. Because of
this, DFS based repositories cannot change the link target of symbolic refs.
This has not been a problem for file-based repositories because it has a
file-lock based semantics instead of the CAS based one. The reference
implementation, InMemoryRepository, has a hack to revert the reference back to a
SymbolicRef.

When [1] introduced this faking code, there was no way for RefUpdate to
distinguish the detaching operation. When [2] fixed the detaching operation, it
introduced a detachingSymbolicRef flag. This commit uses this flag to control
whether it needs to dereference the symbolic refs by calling Ref#getLeaf. The
same flag is used to the reflog update operation. As a side-effect,
InMemoryRepository's compareAndPut implementation becomes a straightforward CAS
operation.
