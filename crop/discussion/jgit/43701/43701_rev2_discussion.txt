DESCRIPTION

TestRepository: Add a checkout method to move HEAD around

This flushed out a number of bugs in the way DfsRefUpdate, or at least
the InMemoryRepository implementation, processes symrefs. These have
been fixed, to an extent, in InMemoryRepository, but other
implementations may still suffer from these bugs.

Line:508, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> Since even the index is not updated I also think that's no checkout. Even "reset" would fit only if you are in detached head state, because otherwise the reset would update that ref HEAD is pointing to. I would call it "updateHEAD".

Line:508, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/TestRepository.java -> Good points, I was replacing usages of checkout so that's what I was thinking about, I forgot about reset.

"Update HEAD but not index or working tree" is called "reset --soft", so I named the method "reset" and specified in the javadoc that it is a soft reset. I am still open to other options but would like to keep it succinct.
