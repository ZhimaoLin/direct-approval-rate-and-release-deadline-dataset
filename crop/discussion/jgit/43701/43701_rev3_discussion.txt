DESCRIPTION

TestRepository: Add a checkout method to move HEAD around

This flushed out a number of bugs in the way DfsRefUpdate, or at least
the InMemoryRepository implementation, processes symrefs. These have
been fixed, to an extent, in InMemoryRepository, but other
implementations may still suffer from these bugs.
