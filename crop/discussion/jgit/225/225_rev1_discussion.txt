DESCRIPTION

Enable building all JGit artefacts from org.eclipse.packaging Tycho build

This simplifies the full build including Eclipse feature and update site
from the packaging Tycho build. To start it run the following command
from the JGit project root:
    mvn -f org.eclipse.packaging/pom.xml clean install

Projects working on org.eclipse.jgit can still build using Maven 2 by
running the following command from the JGit project root:
    mvn clean install

Shawn mentioned here

that Tycho currently doesn't support offline build so this seems to be a general problem with Tycho and shouldn't change with this patch.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This doesn't work properly since Tycho is currently not able to mix pom-first and manifest-first builds in the same reactor build.
