DESCRIPTION

Make ObjectDirectory getPacks() work the first time

If an object hasn't been accessed yet the pack list for a repository
may not have been scanned from disk.  If an application (e.g. the dumb
transport servlet support code) asks for the pack list for an
ObjectDirectory, we should load it immediately.
