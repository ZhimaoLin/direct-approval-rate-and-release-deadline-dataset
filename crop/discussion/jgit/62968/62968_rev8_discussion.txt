DESCRIPTION

debug-rebuild-ref-tree: Simple program to build a RefTree

This tool scans all references in the repository and writes out a new
reference pointing to a single commit whose root tree is a RefTree
containing the current refs of this repository.

It alway skips storing the reference it will write to, avoiding the
obvious cycle.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/debug/RebuildRefTree.java -> Nit: slightly more idiomatic to combine these lines.
