DESCRIPTION

debug-rebuild-ref-tree: Simple program to build a RefTree

This tool scans all references in the repository and writes out a new
reference pointing to a single commit whose root tree is a RefTree
containing the current refs of this repository.

It alway skips storing the reference it will write to, avoiding the
obvious cycle.
