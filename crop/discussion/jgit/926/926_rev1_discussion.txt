DESCRIPTION

Move lib.FileRepository to storage.file.FileRepository

Aside from moving FileRepository, we also move all of its
supporting classes that are internal implementation details,
such as WindowCursor and RefDirectory.

Because of the number of files affected by the move, the only
edits made are to import statements and MANIFEST.MF files to
expose (or import) the new package.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

This change is strictly RFC.  It currently is broken because PackWriter (which is staying in lib) is still heavily dependent upon classes that we moved to storage.file, and I haven't yet found a way to refactor that dependency out.
