DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: allow push options to be set

Some embeddings of JGit require creating a ReceivePack instance in
another process from the one that handled the network socket with the
client.  Similar to the PushCertificate add a setter to allow the
option list to be supplied.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Please make this xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> In guava, this would be

  public void xxx@xxx.xxx Iterable<String> options) {
    ...
    pushOptions = options == null ? null : ImmutableList.copyOf(options)
  }

Is there a non-guava equivalent or should we just mention in the javadoc that this takes ownership of its argument and the caller is responsible for not mutating it?
