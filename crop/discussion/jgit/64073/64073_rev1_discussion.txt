DESCRIPTION

RevCommit: Better support invalid encoding headers

With this support we no longer need the 'utf-8' alias. UTF-8 will be
automatically tried when the encoding header is not recognized and used
if the character sequence cleanly decodes as UTF-8.

Modernize some of the references to use StandardCharsets.

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevTag.java -> I decided against it for now. There's only two uses and I don't want this public.
