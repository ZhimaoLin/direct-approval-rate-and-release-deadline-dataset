Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

I hacked this up to help me debug the large-delta topic.  I'm not happy with the amount of code duplication we now have, but on the other hand I'd love to see `jgit show` actually work in 0.9.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Show.java -> This sucks.  Log, Diff, and now Show all have the same option block.  I wish I knew of a way to not duplicate this and still get the options supported by args4j.

Line:171, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Show.java -> This first part of the try block is all duplicated with Log.  It would be nice if that wasn't the case.

Line:246, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Show.java -> This is duplicated with LsTree.  We should share the code.

Line:269, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Show.java -> This is duplicated with Log.  We should share the code.

Patch Set 1:

Shouldn't it in the end not be a command in our org.eclipse.jgit.api package? I am sure that people outside jgit would like to have a git-show implementation which is re-useable and has a a clean, type-safe interface. Code in the pgm package is not reuseable (it's not visible e.g. to egit), accpets all parameters as Strings and dumps return values to stdout.
It's not much - just moving that part of the code which does the real work into a comamnd.

Patch Set 1:

What do you suggest?  Have the command take an OutputStream and a Charset (the latter which defaults to UTF-8) and format the shown data to the stream?

This is useful only if you want to just blindly display the output of `git show` with almost no additional coloring or other formatting.  If you want to have a more complex formatting, you probably will just want to drop down to parsing the object, and going through its fields to format it as desired.  Which is 99% of this class.

Patch Set 1:

Agree with shawn.

Rebase and fixed the format for tree to be the same as
C Git show.
