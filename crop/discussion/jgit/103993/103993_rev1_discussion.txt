DESCRIPTION

Support http.<url>.* configs

Git has a rather elaborate mechanism to specify HTTP configuration
options per URL, based pattern matching the URL against "http"
subsection names.[1] The URLs used for this matching are always the
original URIs; redirected URLs do not participate.

Implement this for JGit. Factor out the HttpConfig from TransportHttp
and implement the matching and override mechanism.

The set of supported settings is still the same; JGit currently
supports only followRedirects, postBuffer, and sslVerify, plus the
JGit-specific maxRedirects key.

Add tests for path normalization and prefix matching only on segment
separators, and use the new mechanism in SmartClientSmartServerSslTest
to disable sslVerify selectively for only the test server URLs.

Compare also bug 374703 and bug 465492. With this commit it would be
possible to set sslVerify to false for only the git server using a
self-signed certificate instead of having to switch it off globally
via http.sslVerify.
