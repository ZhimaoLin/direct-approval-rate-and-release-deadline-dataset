DESCRIPTION

Fix resource leaks due to unclosed repositories

Whenever a call to JGit returns a Repository the caller should make sure
to call close() on it if he doesn't need it anymore. Since instances of
Repository contain e.g. open FileOutputStreams (for pack
files) forgetting to close the repository can lead to resource leaks.
This was the reason why dozens of the JUnit tests on windows to failed
with "Can't delete file ...." errors. In
LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase.tearDown() we tried to delete the repo's we
used during tests which failed because we had open FileOutputStreams.

Not only the obvious cases during Clone or Init operations returned
Repositories, but also the new SubModule API created repository
instances. In some places we even forgot to close submodule repositories
in our internal coding.

To see the effects of this fix run the JGit JUnit tests under Windows.
On other platforms it's harder to see because either the leaking
resources don't lead to failing junit tests (on Unix you can delete
files with open FileOutputStreams) or the java gc run's differently
cleans up the resources earlier.

Line:184, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/SubmoduleUpdateCommand.java -> please pull this up onto the prior line

Line:485, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> This local isn't necessary, you can write:

  try {
    return subRepo.resolve(Constants.HEAD);
  } finally {
    subRepo.close();
  }

and have everything work correctly. Same goes for the other hunks in this file.
