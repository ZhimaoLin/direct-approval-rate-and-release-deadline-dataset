DESCRIPTION

ReceivePack: support quiet capability

git-core has supported this for a long time; allowing clients to
avoid progress messages from the server if they are dumping to a
pipe instead of a tty.

Avoid the two progress monitors going on side-band and expose
isQuiet() method to allow hooks to also reduce their output if
this is sensible for them.
