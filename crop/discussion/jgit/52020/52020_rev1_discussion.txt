DESCRIPTION

BaseReceivePack: Don't throw from getPushCertificate()

Rather than lazily parsing the push in this method, parse it at the
end of recvCommands(), which already contains the necessary try/catch
for handling this error. This allows later callers to avoid having to
handle this condition superfluously.
