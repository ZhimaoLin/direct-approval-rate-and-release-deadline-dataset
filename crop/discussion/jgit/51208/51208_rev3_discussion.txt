DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: Make pushee optional

When pushing to an HTTP server using the C git client, I observed a
certificate lacking a pushee field. Handle this gracefully in the
parser.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is disappointing as it removes one of the replay protections. We will have to rely on nonce verification alone when these broken clients are being used against a server.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This can still be detected and rejected by a hook, if we want to disallow clients that can't provide this protection: check if cert.getPushee() returns null. Prior to this change there was a non-null check in the PushCertificate constructor, so that would have failed with an error earlier in the path.
