DESCRIPTION

PushCertificateParser: Make pushee optional

When pushing to an HTTP server using the C git client, I observed a
certificate lacking a pushee field. Handle this gracefully in the
parser.

What command did you use? (That could help people reproduce this.)

It's tempting to call this a bug in C git and fix it on that side.

Patch Set 1:

> What command did you use? (That could help people reproduce this.)

"git push internal HEAD:refs/heads/foo" where internal is persistent-https://foo/bar, using our custom forked version of the persistent-https helper in upstream's contrib.

Junio commented that it is also possible to trigger this by invoking "git send-pack" directly, which does not set the url field in the send-pack.c code.

 > It's tempting to call this a bug in C git and fix it on that side.

Sure, but there are plenty of stable C git clients in the wild with this bug, so it's effectively a part of the protocol at this point. Which is why I sent the documentation patch upstream to clarify in pack-protocol.txt.
