Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)



Line:345, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> There is a change for --squash being developed in parallel [1]. We better make sure they have distinguishable descriptions. Currently I wouldn't know which one to use without reading the explanation you sent me [2] ;)

Line:352, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> "a MergeResult with type MergeResult with MergeStatus..." sounds weird. Is this expected? Wouldn't "a MergeResult with MergeStatus..." be enough?

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/CLIText.properties -> FWIW, the message in native git is "Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested". With the current message a CLI test [1] is going to fail.
