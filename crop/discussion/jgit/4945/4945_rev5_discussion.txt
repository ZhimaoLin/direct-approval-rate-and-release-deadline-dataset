Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, approved

I am not sure whether we need it in this case (I am the change owner, but Tomasz has done the last commits). To be on the safe side: Tomasz, could you add your 3 lines as described in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions#Gerrit

Patch Set 5:

* I authored 100% of the content.
* I have the rights to donate the content to Eclipse JGit.
* I contribute the content under the project license (EDL).

Not sure about the first bullet, as I took over the review from Christian. I hope he didn't change his mind ;) There are also some bits added by Matthias.

>  switch the committer now

The author you mean? Currently author=you, committer=me. I guess it's either should be me or you in both fields.
