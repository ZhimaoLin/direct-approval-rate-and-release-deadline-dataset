Please see my inline comments

Line:135, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/MergeTest.java -> This fails because the information about squash is lost.

What about another status: MERGED_SQUASHED_NOT_COMMITTED?

Line:358, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> Why does newHead not contain the old commit? The javadoc says: "the object the head points at after the merge"

Not directly related to this change, but why is mergebase null in case of a resolve merge? The Merger does calculate the common base commit. It seems that it is not exposed to the caller.

Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommandTest.java -> Maybe add a test "testNoFastForwardNoCommit" (with the noff flag)
