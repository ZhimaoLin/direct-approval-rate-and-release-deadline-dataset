DESCRIPTION

ArchiveCommand: Allow to pass options to underlying stream

Current ArchiveCommand design doesn't allow to pass in options to
underlying stream implementations. To overcome this, client has to
implement custom format implementation (it cannot be derived from
the existing one, because the classes are marked as final), and set
the options using ThreadLocal, before the method

  ArchiveOutputStream createArchiveOutputStream(OutputStream s)

is get called.

This change extends the ArchiveCommand.Format by allowing to pass
option map during creation of ArchiveOutputStream.

ArchiveCommand is extended correspondingly. That way client can
easily pass options to the underlying streams:

  Map<String, Object> level = ImmutableMap.<String, Object> of(
      "level", new Integer(9));
  new ArchiveCommand(repo)
      .setFormat("zip")
      .setFormatOptions(level)
      .setTree(tree)
      .setPaths(paths)
      .setPrefix(prefix)
      .setOutputStream(sidebandOut)
      .call();
