DESCRIPTION

Fully implement SHA-1 abbreviations

ObjectReader implementations are now responsible for creating the
unique abbreviation of an ObjectId, or for resolving an abbreviation
back to its full form.  In this latter case the reader can offer up
multiple candidates to the caller, who may be able to disambiguate
them based on context.

Repository.resolve() doesn't take multiple candidates into account
right now, but it could in the future by looking for a remaining
^0 or ^{commit} suffix and take an expansion if there is only one
commit that matches the input abbreviation.  It could also use
the distance from an annotated tag to resolve "tag-NNN-gcommit"
style strings that are often output by `git describe`.
