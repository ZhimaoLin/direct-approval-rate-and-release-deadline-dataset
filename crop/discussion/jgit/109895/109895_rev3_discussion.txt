DESCRIPTION

Avoid bad rounding "1 year, 12 months" in date formatter

Round first, then calculate the labels. This avoids "x years, 12 months"
and instead produces "x+1 years".

One test case has been added for the original example the bug was found
with, and one assertion has been moved from an existing test case to the
new test case, since it also triggered the bug.
