DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Retain executable mode of existing files on Windows

Currently files in a repository marked as executable will have
that mode unset when modified and committed on systems that
do not support detection of this mode since the working tree
iterator will never report this mode for any entries.

This change updates AddCommand to check if the index file
mode should be used instead of the working tree file mode
when adding files to the index.

There are still other areas that need updating, but I wanted
to first get feedback on one potential approach for fixing this
issue.

Line:851, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> We should check the core.filemode setting for this.

Line:851, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I update the patch to check core.filemode when considering when to ignore working tree file modes and use the index file mode
