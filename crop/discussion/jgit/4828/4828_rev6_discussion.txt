DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Retain executable mode of existing files on Windows

Currently files in a repository marked as executable will have
that mode unset when modified and committed on systems that
do not support detection of this mode since the working tree
iterator will never report this mode for any entries.

This change updates AddCommand to check the core.filemode
config setting to determine if the working tree file mode
should be used when adding files to the index.

There are still other areas that need updating, but I wanted
to first get feedback on one potential approach for fixing this
issue.

Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> The only difference we want NOT to care about is
that of regilar file vs executable file.

The only important difference here is symbolic link. I think our previous behaviour was to change from link to file, though that was by-accident. However if we don't do that we'll mess upp even more by creatig a symlink where the target is the content of the linked-ot-file.

Line:525, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> spell executableFs.

Now that you obey filemode, the FS shouldn't matter anymore?

Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommand.java -> Done

Line:525, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/AddCommandTest.java -> I think believe is still needed so that the test consistently passes on run on both windows and linux and consistently fails when run without the change to AddCommand
