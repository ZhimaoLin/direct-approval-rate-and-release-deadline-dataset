DESCRIPTION

Retain executable mode of existing files on Windows

Currently files in a repository marked as executable will have
that mode unset when modified and committed on systems that
do not support detection of this mode since the working tree
iterator will never report this mode for any entries.

This change updates AddCommand to check the core.filemode
config setting to determine if the working tree file mode
should be used when adding files to the index.
