DESCRIPTION

RFC/WiP: LfsProtocolServlet: Allow getLargeFileRepository to raise exceptions

According to the specification [1] the server may return the following
error responses:

- 403: The user has read, but not write access.
- 404: The repository does not exist for the user.
- 422: Validation error with one or more of the objects in the request.

Add exception classes to cover these cases, derived from a common base
exception, and change the specification of getLargeFileRepository to throw
the base exception.

In LfsProtocolServlet#post, handle the new exceptions and send back the
appropriate HTTP responses as mentioned above.

The specification also mentions optional response codes (406, 429, 501,
and 509) but these are not implemented in this commit. Implementing these
in follow-up commits should be trivial.
