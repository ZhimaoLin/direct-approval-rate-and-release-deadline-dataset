DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: record manifest groups as submodule labels

Git submodule commands will soon have the ability to make a finer
selection on which submodules to operate on via labels to each submodule.

The RepoCommand which translates repo manifest files into submodules
should propagate this information along.

Line:796, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommandTest.java -> Does the order within the array matter here? If not then I think convert it to a set and check its members makes more sense here.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java -> This function only works in bare mode, and the command line works in non-bare mode, so there's no point adding support here.

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoProject.java -> This is a new API, so there has to be xxx@xxx.xxx annotation.

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoProject.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx annotation.

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoProject.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx annotation.
