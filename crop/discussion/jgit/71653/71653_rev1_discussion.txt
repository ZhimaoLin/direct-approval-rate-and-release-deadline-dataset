DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: record manifest groups as submodule labels

Git submodule commands will soon have the ability to make a finer
selection on which submodules to operate on via labels to each submodule.

The RepoCommand which translates repo manifest files into submodules
should propagate this information along.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Note: this is still WIP in Git core and there is a minimal chance of the "label" to change names. I just think we require a change like this very soon once the git-core discussion settles.
