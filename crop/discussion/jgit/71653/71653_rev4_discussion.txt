DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: record manifest groups as submodule labels

Git submodule commands will soon have the ability to make a finer
selection on which submodules to operate on via labels to each submodule.

The RepoCommand which translates repo manifest files into submodules
should propagate this information along.

Line:802, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommandTest.java -> If this assertion fails it will print a confusing "it works" message.
