DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: record manifest groups as submodule labels

Git submodule commands will soon have the ability to make a finer
selection on which submodules to operate on via labels to each submodule.

The RepoCommand which translates repo manifest files into submodules
should propagate this information along.
