DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: record manifest groups as submodule labels

Git core learned about attributes in pathspecs:

    pathspec: allow querying for attributes

    The pathspec mechanism is extended via the new
    ":(attr:eol=input)pattern/to/match" syntax to filter paths so that it
    requires paths to not just match the given pattern but also have the
    specified attrs attached for them to be chosen.

(177161a5f7, 2016-05-20)

We intend to use these pathspec attribute patterns for submodule
grouping, similar to the grouping in repo. So the RepoCommand which
translates repo manifest files into submodules should propagate this
information along. This requires writing information to the
.gitattributes file instead of the .gitmodules file. For now we just
overwrite any existing .gitattributes file and do not care about prior
attributes set. If this becomes an issue we need to figure out how to
correctly amend the grouping information to an existing .gitattributes
file.

Line:788, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommandTest.java -> s/gitmodules/gitattributes/

Line:794, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommandTest.java -> Use try-with-resources for BufferedReader too.

Line:516, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Is this a one-time migration thing, or will it be invoked on every repo command?

Line:520, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> "l" is unused.

Line:516, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> This is the same as recordRemoteBranch above, we will run it multiple times for now and once the migration is done completely we don't use all of this code any more.

Line:516, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> I think the whole gitrepo directory are only to be used in the transition from repo to submodule. Once we are in the whole new submodule world we won't need any code under gitrepo directory any more :)

Line:516, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> So during migration, repo's groups are the source of truth and continually overwrite the .gitattributes file, and then post-migration .gitattributes is the source of truth. 

What is the migration plan that guarantees that the repo tool doesn't get invoked post-migration? Is it just the caller's responsibility to make sure RepoCommand.setRecordSubmoduleLabels() does not get set?
