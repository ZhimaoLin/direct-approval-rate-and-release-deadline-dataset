DESCRIPTION

Added support for whitespace ignoring during diff

Added code to support ignoring leading, trailing, and changed
whitespace when performing a diff operation. I also added command
line options to Diff to enable the various whitespace ignoring
methods. These match the flags for git diff.

Mostly LGTM.  A couple more tests, and some optimization in the whitespace change.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreWhitespaceChangeTest.java -> Add a test with leading whitespace to make sure leading whitespace differences are still reported.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreTrailingWhitespaceTest.java -> Add tests with leading whitespace, to make sure it isn't ignored by the trailing type.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreLeadingWhitespaceTest.java -> You should add a test with trailing whitespace differences, to make sure you don't ignore trailing whitespaces here.

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreWhitespaceChange.java -> Why are we bypassing hashing here?  If we can't hash, can we avoid the cost of the hashes object altogether and simply not create it?  That may mean you need to *not* extend from RawText here, or you need to expose a method that lets you override the construction of the hashes table and instead returns null.

FWIW, you can probably still hash here.  You just have to collapse multiple spaces into a single one when you compute the hash value.

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreWhitespaceChange.java -> Whoops, that was something I left over from testing, and forgot to fix. It also means I forgot to do the hash function correctly...

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawTextIgnoreWhitespaceChangeTest.java -> That's being done by "     foo" != "foo"
