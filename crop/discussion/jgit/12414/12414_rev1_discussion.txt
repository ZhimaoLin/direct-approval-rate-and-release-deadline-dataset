Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/AutoCRLFOutputStream.java -> This hasn't exactly helped readability of the method.

Who enabled this warning and why are we fixing it everywhere?

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/AutoCRLFOutputStream.java -> this makes the code less readable, instead we should switch off this type of warning

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/AutoCRLFOutputStream.java -> I don't agree (e.g. it helps with debugging), but let's disable this warning if fixing these is not welcome:
