Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:748, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GitIndex.java -> 1) Bad name. Suggestion: getLastModified, i.e. same as in DirCacheEntry

3) Consider extending the DirCache API with the functions needed to perform whatever you need. This API is deprecated.
