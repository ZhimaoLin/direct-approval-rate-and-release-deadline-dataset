Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> why only at the end ?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I tried with git 2.6.4 (on Mac) and I was able to create a xxx@xxx.xxx

 $ git tag @

doesn't raise an error and I can also do e.g.

 $ git log @

I tried with 2.7.0 on ubuntu. Creating a tag '@' works with native git but even the 2.7.0 docu says that xxx@xxx.xxx is not a valid ref. You could open a bug against native git.
