DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: Rely on peeled ref data for include-tag

The peeled reference information for tags is more efficient to
work with than parsing the tag objects, as usually its coming from
the packed-refs file, which stores the peeled information for us.
Rely on the peeled information to decide if the tag should be
included or not, instead of using our RevWalk to parse the object.
