Patch Set 2:

The author of this commit differs from the committer (formatting), is this intended?

Author: Charity Bender xxx@xxx.xxx
Committer: Darion Cabrera <Charity xxx@xxx.xxx

Common Git practice is to use the full name, so the committer form would be better. Please also adjust Signed-off-by.
