DESCRIPTION

Add getString utility functions to RawText

These routines can be useful when debugging, because we can add an
expression to the Eclipse "Expressions" panel to show the text that
appears on a line.  Gerrit Code Review also uses these in its own
subclass of RawText in order to format patch files, so pulling it up
to be part of core JGit may help other applications too.
