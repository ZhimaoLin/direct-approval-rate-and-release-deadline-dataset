DESCRIPTION

BaseRepositoryBuilder: setGitDir should honor .git symref files

The current implementation of .setGitDir does not honor .git symref
files. This can cause problems because developers may assume that it
will properly handle these cases, and it makes JGit behave differently
from C Git.

In C Git, using --git-dir or setting the GIT_DIR environment variable
will properly follow a .git file symref, but JGit does not behave the
same way.

Modify .setGitDir() to take into account the symrefs itself, and change
the callers in BaseRepositoryBuilder to account for this moved logic.

Patch Set 3:

Sorry for the thrash here, I finally figured out what the issue with one of the test cases is. It's still failing one case locally, but so is the master branch on my system.

The goal of this patch is to ensure that symref .git files are honored whenever they are set as a git directory, rather than only when a user happens to open a repository in a certain manner. I'm working on a test case for this now.
