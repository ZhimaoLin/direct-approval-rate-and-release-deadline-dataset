DESCRIPTION

Fix NPE in DfsGarbageCollector and further reduce memory

DfsGarbageCollector asks PackWriter for the set of objects packed
after the bitmap index is written out.  This is now null as it was
cleared to release memory. Instead use PackBitmapIndexBuilder to
build the set as it also has the objects.

Reduce memory in PackBitmapIndexBuilder by fully discarding the
ObjectToPack instances. This was the original intent of commit
4bb523475d44 ("PackWriter: shed memory while creating bitmaps")
but failed as the instances were still held live here.

Switch to BlockList instead of ObjectToPack[]. This allows the
JVM to allocate many smaller arrays instead of one contiguous
array with 5.2M reference pointers. In a tight heap the smaller
allocations are more feasible.

Reduce the initial EWAHCompressedBitmaps for the 4 type maps.  On
average a typical repository is 30% commits, 30% trees and 30% blobs.
These bitmaps are typically very dense.  PackWriter orders objects by
commit, tree, blob when writing the file so these should always be a
very dense run of 1s with some 0s before and after. So even the 1/3rd
allocation is likely too large, but the later trim() will reduce the
internal buffer anyway.
