DESCRIPTION

blame: Reduce running time ~8.5% by skipping blamed regions

On very large source files like the 4500 line render_view_impl.cc some
regions at start or end of the file were already blamed on a
previously processed commit.  Cutting the header and trailer off to
match the current blame region can save significant time in diff.

This optimization has no impact if the header is immutable (e.g.
copyright notice that is never updated) or the tail is very stable
(e.g.  nobody ever adds to or edits the end of the file).

Abandoned

This is faster, but it produces incorrect results and could never work correctly.

There is no promise the header and footer of two commits directly relate to each other the way the blame region relates. A commit could add or delete lines that are outside of the blame region, as they were also modified in later commits.
