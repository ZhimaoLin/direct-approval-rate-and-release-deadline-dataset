DESCRIPTION

Add support for custom merge drivers into JGit

This extracts all "text only" logic from the ResolveMerger into a
separate TextMergeDriver, and adds a built-in BinaryMergeDriver which
only action is to keep the local content of a file in case of conflict.

These two built-in merge drivers are not contributed as would the
custom ones since they act as the default when no custom driver can
be found for a file. Custom drivers will be contributed through the
MergeDriverRegistry added by this commit.
