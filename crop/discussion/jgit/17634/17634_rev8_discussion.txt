DESCRIPTION

Add support for custom merge drivers into JGit

This extracts all "text only" logic from the ResolveMerger into a
separate TextMergeDriver.

Custom drivers will be contributed through the
MergeDriverRegistry added by this commit, though the new
TextMergeDriver is not contributed through it since it is used
as a default when no custom driver is registered for a given file.
