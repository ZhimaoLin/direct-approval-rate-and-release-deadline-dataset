DESCRIPTION

Fix null return from FS.readPipe when command fails to launch

When a command invoked from readPipe fails to launch (i.e. the exec call fails
due to a missing command executable), Process.start() throws, which gets caught
by the generic IOException handler, resulting in a null return. This change
detects this case and rethrows a CommandFailedException instead.

Additionally, this change uses /bin/sh instead of bash for its posix command
failure test, to accomodate building in environments where bash is unavailable.

Line:184, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSTest.java -> Why do you assume here that fs should be posix? This test should also fail on a windows machine, or?
