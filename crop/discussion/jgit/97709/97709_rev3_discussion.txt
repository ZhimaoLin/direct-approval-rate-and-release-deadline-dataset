DESCRIPTION

Fix null return from FS.readPipe when command fails to launch

When a command invoked from readPipe fails to launch (i.e. the exec call
fails due to a missing command executable), Process.start() throws,
which gets caught by the generic IOException handler, resulting in a
null return. This change detects this case and rethrows a
CommandFailedException instead.

Additionally, this change uses /bin/sh instead of bash for its posix
command failure test, to accomodate building in environments where bash
is unavailable.
