Patch Set 3:

Uff, that change is huge. It is the among the top-10 commits regarding size (added+deleted lines) in JGits history (all that described in a one line commit message :-)). You wrote nice tests so I think there is lot of good functionality in here. But the problem is: in JGit we really have to review and understand(!) the commits from contributors. Just green tests are not sufficient. And understanding 3500 lines in one shot is very hard and very time consuming.
 Couldn't you try to divide this change in different proposal implementing subfeatures. As an example in one change you could modify the way how to collect attributes. Another change could the rework in the area of Streams handling EOL. Then you introduce an eventing mechanism which watches for changes on .git* files. On the first glance they are independent from each other and could be seperate changes.
