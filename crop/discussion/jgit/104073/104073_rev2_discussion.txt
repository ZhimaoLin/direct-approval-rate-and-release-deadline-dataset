Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/fsck/FsckPackParser.java -> I usually do this by doing Integer.valueOf() at the offending location. What we don't want is implicit boxing in execution paths. Boxing in an exception message is fine.

Line:288, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/fsck/FsckPackParser.java -> I think this could be Integer.valueOf(entry.getType()) to fix the warning.
