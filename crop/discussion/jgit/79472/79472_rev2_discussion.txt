Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> spurios tab?

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> I'd go with "0000" to be consistent with git core.

(i.e. I'd try getting close to the additional output of "GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git ls-remote")

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Some motivation here would be nice. (i.e. what is the goal of this patch? How this aligns to concepts of git core and how we differ. Do we need tests and documentation for this?)

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> We can skip this step when debug logging is disabled:

  if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
    log.debug(...);
  }

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> Never mind --- I can't read.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Added a motivation section. I haven't seen testing for log statements done elsewhere, but manual inspection of the output seems to indicate it's working as intended.

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> I thought "flush-pkt" might be more explicitly understandable than a numerical code, but that also makes sense if it's already the established convention.
