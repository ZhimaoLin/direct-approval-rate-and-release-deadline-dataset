Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> Shouldn't private static be declared before public static?

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> How often does this get output?  If it's very frequently it might be better to use debug level otherwise it's going to spam the console.

Same for the other log.info calls added in this file.
