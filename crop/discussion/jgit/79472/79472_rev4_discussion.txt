DESCRIPTION

Packet logging for JGit

This change serves to emulate existing functionality in Git core,
namely the tracing of streamed packets (both in and out) as with
"GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git ls-remote". The packets are logged at the
DEBUG level to reflect the intended usage of this feature and to keep
down undesired noise.
