DESCRIPTION

Packet logging for JGit

This change serves to emulate existing functionality in Git core,
namely the tracing of streamed packets (both in and out) as with
"GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git ls-remote". The packets are logged at the
DEBUG level to reflect the intended usage of this feature and to
keep down undesired noise.

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> As Jonathan noted on the in side:

> We can skip this step when debug logging is disabled:

     if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
     ...

I think it is relevant here as we are constructing the string before passing it to the logger. On the input side we constructed / called decode anyway, but here we only do it for the purpose of logging. So we should check if logging is on.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> here we would not need to check before as the string is fixed?

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> spurious white space ;)
