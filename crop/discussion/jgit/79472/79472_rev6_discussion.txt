DESCRIPTION

Packet logging for JGit

This change serves to emulate existing functionality in Git core,
namely the tracing of streamed packets (both in and out) as with
"GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git ls-remote". The packets are logged at the
DEBUG level to reflect the intended usage of this feature and to
keep down undesired noise.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> this only captures parts of the actual transmission.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> I think we'd rather put the debugging output here.

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> and here

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> spurious white space change?

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> I would have expected the tracing to happen at the writePacket(buf, pos, len) level, since that captures all packets sent (not just packets sent as strings).

end() is where flush-pkts happen.
