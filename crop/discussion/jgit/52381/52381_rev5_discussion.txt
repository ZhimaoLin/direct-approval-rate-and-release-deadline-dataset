Thanks for explaining. Just nits left.

Line:294, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Could this happen at walk start time (by iterating over roots) so the RevFilter doesn't have to be constructed before any markStart calls?

That is, in StartGenerator.next():

 for (RevCommit c : w.roots) {
   c.flags |= w.startFlag.mask;
 }

If that's too ugly, then the factory in FirstParentRevFilter should get a note about this.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/FirstParentRevFilter.java -> (optional) This could use firstParent as the start flag.

Patch Set 5:

Backing up a bit, I wouldn't necessarily mind tweaking the generator to only consider first parent paths. I just think that approach doesn't work well with the RevFilter abstraction, so we would need some other way of passing that along to the RevWalk. Maybe a straight up setFirstParent(true) method.

Eh, probably not nicer, actually. I wrote it as a separate change (I4a9a0d57) and I'm not very happy with it. We have quite the gaggle of Generator implementations and I'm not sure I got all of them. While flawed, this implementation is at least self-contained. Let me know what you think.

I prefer the setFirstParent approach. I also like it more as an API.

But the FirstParentRevFilter is cute. If RevWalk had a getRoots() getter then FirstParentRevFilter could be self-contained, making it a nice demo.

The setFirstParent approach performs better because it can avoid traversing side branches. (The usual approach used by RevFilters of marking parents uninteresting doesn't work here because the side branches can be reachable by another path.)

I can imagine a world where both exist --- setFirstParent as the standard API, FirstParentRevFilter as a demo e.g. somewhere outside the public API.
