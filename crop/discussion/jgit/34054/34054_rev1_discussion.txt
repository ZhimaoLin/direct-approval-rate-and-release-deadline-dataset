Patch Set 1:

I think I may have seen something like the described problem before, somehow it rings a bell. Thanks for investigating this.

It would be really good to have a test case for it. Could you try to figure out what exactly causes the problem? You seem to have a reproducible case.

I'm not sure this is the right fix. And if the problem is somewhere else, this may just hide the real issue. The bug may also be in IndexDiff, or only occur in that context.
