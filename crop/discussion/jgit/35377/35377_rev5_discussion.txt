DESCRIPTION

[342372] Adds the git attributes computation on the treewalk.

Adds the getAttributes feature to the tree walks. The computation of
attributes needs to be done by the TreeWalk since it needs both a
WorkingTreeIterator and a DirCacheIterator.

Patch Set 5:

Last patch set adds xxx@xxx.xxx tag. Moreover it adds a cache for the attributes since the getAttribute method will most likely be called really often.
