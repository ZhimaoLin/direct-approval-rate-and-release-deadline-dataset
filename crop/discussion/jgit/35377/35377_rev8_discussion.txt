DESCRIPTION

[342372] Adds the git attributes computation on the treewalk

Adds the getAttributes feature to the tree walk. The computation of
attributes needs to be done by the TreeWalk since it needs both a
WorkingTreeIterator and a DirCacheIterator.

I have rebased this review so it can use the performance improvements made in the previous review ( use same mechanism than fastIgnoreRule).

Patch Set 8:

Hello,

 Yes I think so. The computation of the gitattribute should be done on the TreeWalk. The specification of the git attributes says that git should fallback on the working tree version or on the index version of the git attributes file depending on the current operation (check in and check out)[1]. This review simply creates the logic in the TreeWalk in order to use both the attributes computed from the WorkingTreeIterator and the DirCacheIterator. 
Regards

[1] "When the .gitattributes file is missing from the work tree, the path in the index is used as a fall-back. During checkout process, .gitattributes in the index is used and then the file in the working tree is used as a fall-back." from https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitattributes.html

just for info: I am working on Change-Id: Iffd72914cec5b434ba4d0de232e285b7492db868 to teach jgit to call filter commands defined in gitattributes. Currently that change is not related to this change. But of course this will change and I want to make use of the feature implement here.
