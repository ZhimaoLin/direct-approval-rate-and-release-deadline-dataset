DESCRIPTION

Fix dumb transport push

PackWriter incorrectly returned 0 from getObjectsNumber() when the
pack has not been written yet. This caused dumb transports like
amazon-s3:// and sftp:// to abort early and never write out a pack,
under the assumption that the pack had no objects.

Until the pack header is written to the output stream, compute the
current object count each time it is requested. Once the header is
started, use the object count from the stats object.
