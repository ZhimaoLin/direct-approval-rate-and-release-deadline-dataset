DESCRIPTION

Update build to use CBI jarsigner plugin

The dash signing plugin has been retired hence we need to update our
build to use the CBI jarsigner plugin for signing build results.

Pack test classes to enable signing them.

Also re-enable pack200 for bundle org.eclipse.jgit.

WORKAROUND: there is no easy way to run tests with maven-surefire-plugin
from signed test-jar so for a quick workaround we will have to add a
build step on Hudson so that we can run tests before signing:

- first step will do "clean, verify" to compile and run tests
- second step will do "install, deploy" with profile "eclipse-sign" and
use -DskipTests=true to skip tests since they would hit a
SecurityException when unsigned test classes are in same package as
signed classes under test
- third step will do "clean, install, deploy" on packaging reactor to
build features and p2 repository with profile "eclipse-sign" to sign and
pack200 all bundles.

TODO: p2 repository build doesn't pick up pack200 artifacts via
pomDependencies, this is a limitation of Tycho 0.18. I will have to use
p2 publisher to workaround this limitation.
