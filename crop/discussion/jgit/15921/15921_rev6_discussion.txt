DESCRIPTION

Update build to use CBI jarsigner plugin

The dash signing plugin will be retired soon hence we need to update our
build to use the CBI jarsigner plugin for signing build results.

We need to pack the test classes and also sign them since otherwise the
tests will hit a SecurityException when there are split packages since
the class loader enforces that all classes from the same package are
signed the same way.
