DESCRIPTION

Update build to use CBI jarsigner plugin

The dash signing plugin will be retired soon hence we need to update our
build to use the CBI jarsigner plugin for signing build results.

We need to pack the test classes and also sign them since otherwise the
tests will hit a SecurityException when there are split packages since
the class loader enforces that all classes from the same package are
signed the same way.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

still need to find a way to convince the surefire plugin to run the tests from the signed test-jars, otherwise we hit a SecurityException on split packages (some tests are in same package as code being tested) since code being tested is signed and test classes in same package are not signed

also see the following patches supporting this change
- https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16021/ -> allows to suppress jars for test modules
- https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16027/ -> needed for pack200 packing of jgit bundles
