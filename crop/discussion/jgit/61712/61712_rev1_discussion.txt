DESCRIPTION

ReceiveCommand.filter: Accept Iterable

PreReceiveHook is given a Collection<ReceiveCommand> and it can be
very useful here to call ReceiveCommand.filter(cmds, NOT_ATTEMPTED).

Overload filter to accept both Iterable and List.
Keep backwards binary compatibility for List by upcasting to Iterable.
