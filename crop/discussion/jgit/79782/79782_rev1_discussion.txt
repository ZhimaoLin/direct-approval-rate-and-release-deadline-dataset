> Do you intend to include this in the 4.5.0 release?

The reason I asked is because we're using a snapshot build of JGit master on Gerrit's stable-2.13 branch.  If the released 4.5.0 requires Java 8 we won't be able to upgrade to that on stable-2.13, and on master we'll need to wait until the Gerrit build is upgraded to Java 8.
