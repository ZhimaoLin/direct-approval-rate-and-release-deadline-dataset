Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Same question here.

Line:15, .buckconfig -> Was the intent for source_level to be 8, too, or only target_level?

It makes definitely sense to allow Java 8 language constructs if we go with Java 8 minimum execution environment. I didn't explicitly requested this but this was part of the plan. 

Do you have some objections?

If JGit 4.5 is coming end of September lets defer this until JGit 4.6. It gives Gerrit time to also transition to Java 8, and is only another ~4 weeks that we have to continue to develop JGit with Java 7.

Is there a more specific date for this planned release?  It would be nice if we can get it before we release Gerrit 2.13.
