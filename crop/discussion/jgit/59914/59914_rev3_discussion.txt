DESCRIPTION

Make BitmapIndexImpl.CompressedBitmap public

PackWriterBitmapPreparer (which is in another package) is already well
aware of the mapping between EWAHCompressedBitmaps and the
higher-level CompressedBitmap objects of the BitmapIndexImpl API.
Making the CompressedBitmap type public makes the translation more
obvious and wouldn't break any abstractions that aren't already
broken.  So expose it.

This is all under org.eclipse.jgit.internal so there are no API
stability guarantees --- we can change the API if internals change
(for example if some day there are bitmaps spanning multiple packs).

In particular this means the confusing toBitmap helper can be removed.
