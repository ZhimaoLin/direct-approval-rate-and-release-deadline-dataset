DESCRIPTION

Add public isStaleFileHandle() API, improve detection.

Add a public API to the FileUtils to determine if an IOException is a
stale NFS file handle exception.  This will make it easier to detect
such errors, and interpret them consistently throughout the codebase.
This new API is a bit more lenient in its detection than the previous
detection, and should be able to detect some errors which previously
were not identified as stale file handle exceptions because they had the
word NFS in the error message.  Adjust the packfile handling code to use
this new API for detection.

Line:526, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> I would use a Matcher and cache the compiled regex instead of recompiling it for each call

Line:526, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> any idea how often this is called on NFS from your experiments ? If we are on NFS it might be worth caching the compiled regex if retries happen frequently.

Line:526, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> This is just an API, so anything I quote now about usage statistics could be different when this API gets used elsewhere.  

Currently it is called when pack files are deleted and a client still holds a reference to it.  That likely happens only during repacking, so it depends how often people repack.  I would suspect that even on an extremely busy site, that repacking is a minor operation done very seldomly compared to other operations (it typically scales as a small percentage of usage).  In the change following this, I will use this for the packed-refs file also.  That can happen anytime the packed-refs file is deleted.  This generally also happens during git gc, but it can also happen when people delete refs.  

I feel that it would not make sense to optimize this path for speed over memory unless there is a known specific use case which needs that.  I don't think any of the current know use cases need that, and I don't anticipate Exception paths typically needing that.
