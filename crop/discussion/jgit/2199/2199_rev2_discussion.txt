DESCRIPTION

Introduce pure metaData comparision between WorkingTree- and index-entries

Instead of offering only a high-level isModified() method a new
method compareMetadata() is introduced which compares a working tree entry
and a index entry by looking at metadata only. Some use-cases
(e.g. computing the content-id in idBuffer()) may use this new method
instead of isModified().

Patch Set 2:

No Robin, this change isn't the same as I2b2170c2. It's more like I2b2170c2 depends on this one. The change here introduces methods to compare a workingtree- and index-entry purely by metadata and the change I2b2170c2 makes use of this methods to reuse a SHA-1 if possible.

Line:648, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> yes, right. This string may pop up until to the user - but it would be a real developers fault because he has not covered all possible cases. But I guess it doesn't hurt to have this in.
