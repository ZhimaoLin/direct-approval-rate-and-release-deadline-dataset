DESCRIPTION

introduce pure metaData comparision between WorkingTree- and index-entries

Instead of offering only a high-level isModified() method a new
method compareMetadata() is introduced which compares a working tree entry
and a index entry by looking at metadata only. Some use-cases
(e.g. computing the content-id in idBuffer()) may use this new method
instead of isModified().

Line:544, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> If I read the code below right, this NOT_EQUAL never occurs due to modification timestamp, so we probably shouldn't mention it here.

I wonder if we should call this DIFFER_BY_METADATA, to match DIFFER_BY_TIMESTAMP below.

Line:646, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> This should be an IllegalStateException or some other sort of RuntimeException.  If there is a new value added to the enum, we should fail rather than returning true.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style-nit: Please capitalize the beginning of the short summary.

Line:544, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> right, calling it DIFFER_BY_METADATA sounds more consistent. I'll do that

Line:646, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Done

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
