DESCRIPTION

Set "potentialNullReference" to "error" level and fixed all issues

There should be no functional change, the logic updated only to make
code simple so that compiler can understand what is going for. Removed
xxx@xxx.xxx annotations since they cannot be used if
"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.potentialNullReference" option is
set to the "error" level.
