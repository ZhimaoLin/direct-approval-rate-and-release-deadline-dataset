DESCRIPTION

Do not cherry-pick merge commits during rebase

Rebase computes the list of commits that are included in
the merges, just like Git does, so do not try to include
the merge commits. Re-recreating merges during rebase is
a bit more complicated and might be a useful future extension,
but for now just linearize during rebase.
