DESCRIPTION

Fix hanging fetch via SSH

Signaling the need to flush() only via the interrupted status of a
copying thread doesn't work realiably with jsch. The write() method of
com.jcraft.jsch.Session catches the InterruptedException in several
places. As a result StreamCopyThread can easily miss the interrupt if it
was interrupted during the dst.write() or dst.flush() call. When it
happens, StreamCopyThread will not send some data to the remote side and
will not get the response back, because remote side will wait for more
data from us.

The flushCount field incremented during flush() method guarantees we
don't miss flush() even if jsch catches InterruptedException in
dst.write() or dst.flush() calls.

Checking the flushCount after dst.write() is needed because dst.write()
can clear interrupt status, in this case the next blocking src.read()
won't throw an exception and we will not call flush().

Flush is performed only after src.read() was blocked and thrown an
InterruptedIOException exception, this guarantees that we flush all the
data available in src so far (src.read() doesn't block while more is
available).

FlushCount is reset to 0 only when there were no flush() calls since
last blocked read, that means we flushed all data available in src. If
there were flush() calls, the interrupt status is restored, so next
blocked read will throw InterruptedException and we will flush()
again.
