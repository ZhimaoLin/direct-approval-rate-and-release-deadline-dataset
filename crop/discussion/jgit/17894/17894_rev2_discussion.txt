be thrown if any other options were set.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Wouldn't his mean that JGit will start to handling PackBitmapIndexes which have options which are not understood by this jgit? What should jgit do if he see's options which he doesn't understand. If we say JGit should simply ignore options he doesn't understand than this change is ok. If we say JGit should deny working on PackBitMapIndexes with unknown options then this change is harmful. I can't decide.

The only other option is BITMAP_OPT_HASH_CACHE (16), which we can ignore. If it's set, however current jgit will refuse to work with the pack.
