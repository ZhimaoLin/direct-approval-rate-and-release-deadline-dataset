DESCRIPTION

URIish: fall back to host as humanish name

When we have a URI that contains an empty path component (that is
it only contains a "/") we want to fall back to the host as
humanish name.

This change is according to the behavior of upstream git, which
falls back on the hostname when guessing directory names for
newly cloned repositories (see [1] for the discussion).

Patch Set 2:

I've come to a conclusion now with Junio, Jeff et al. The linked gmane thread discusses the issue and my patches fixing behavior for host-only URIs have been queued.
The agreed behavior is that when we clone a repository with empty path component, we want to guess a directory name which contains the host name only, that is no port number and (obviously) no authentication data.
The new patch adds the fallback to host name only for the humanish name.
