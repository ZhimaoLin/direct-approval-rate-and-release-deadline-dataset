DESCRIPTION

URIish: fall back to host as humanish name

When we have a URI that contains an empty path component (that is
it only contains a "/") we want to fall back to the host as
humanish name.

This change is according to the behavior of upstream git, which
falls back on the hostname when guessing directory names for
newly cloned repositories (see [1] for the discussion).
