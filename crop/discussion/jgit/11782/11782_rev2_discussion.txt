DESCRIPTION

Skip main thread test in ThreadSafeProgressMonitor

update(int) is only invoked from a worker thread, in JGit's case
this is DeltaTask. The Javadoc of TSPM suggests update should only
ever be used by a worker thread.

Skip the main thread check, saving some cycles on each run of the
progress monitor.
