DESCRIPTION

CommitCommand: Ensure unmerged paths are added correctly with setOnly

With bug 391855, PathEdit will be changed to apply an edit for each
stage. With that, CommitCommand would no longer work correctly when
committing an unmerged path.

This changes it to use a DirCacheBuilder which allows us to correctly
replace the entries for the three stages with one, which is not possible
with PathEdit.

Bug: 391859
Change-Id: I6dc180aec7e2cbf8d1e91f50482c95bc420f79de
