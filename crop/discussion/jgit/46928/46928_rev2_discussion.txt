DESCRIPTION

Support agent= capability in wire protocol

Since git-core ff5effd (v1.7.12.1) the native wire protocol transmits
the server and client implementation and version strings using
capability "agent=git/1.7.12.1" or similar.

Support this in JGit and hang the implementation data off UploadPack
and ReceivePack.  On HTTP transports default to the User-Agent HTTP
header until the client overrides this with the optional capability
string in the first line.

Extract the user agent string into a UserAgent class under transport
where it can be specified to a different value if the application's
build process has broken the Implementation-Version header in the
JGit package.

Great! Two suggestions for clarification in spots where I got confused. Otherwise looks good.

Line:757, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> This is a short method; I'd rather skip the early return for clarity: execute the following chunk of code if this is not null, then return userAgent at the end whether enabledCapabilities is null or the user agent capability isn't advertised.

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UserAgent.java -> This comment is confusing. As I interpreted it, this is presenting the value obtained from a remote peer over the network. I recommend clarifying that it provides a value that should be presented over the network, e.g.:

User agent to be reported by the JGit client and server over the network

For HTTP transports, supply this as the xxx@xxx.xxx User-Agent} header. On native transports, advertise the user agent in the capability headers.

Line:757, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> But its a short method. Early return is just as readable as shoving everything right one level of indentation to avoid early return.

In short methods we do use early return or early fail in JGit, especially if it allows us avoid a level of indentation for significant portions of the following code.

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UserAgent.java -> Done
