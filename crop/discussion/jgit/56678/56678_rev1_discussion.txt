I think I found a bug in Strings.deleteBackslash

Line:468, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/Strings.java -> prev is never reset so If an escaped backslash is found subsequent unescaped won't be deleted:
For instance pattern "a\\b\c" should match "a\bc" but won't because unescaped backslash removal will stop after encountering first escaped backslash
