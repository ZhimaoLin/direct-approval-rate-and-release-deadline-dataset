Thanks, this was not the root cause (different matcher is used if escaped backslashes are found), but still wrong.

I've added now your test case and fixed? the glob parser.

I would really appreciate more test cases and comparison with Git CLI behavior - if we still have some differences.

Patch Set 2:

I hacked some test generating random patterns and path and comparing result of c git "check-ignore" to the result of FastIgnoreRule.isMatch.



It finds some discrepencies but I don't understand why.

Here are the assertion to add to IgnoreRuleSpecialCasesTest to cover the problems I found.
assertMatch("|][#]1|2*", "|][#]1|2*", false /*cgit result*/);
assertMatch("[/\\", "[/\\", false /*cgit result*/);
assertMatch("b/][\\|", "b/][\\|", false /*cgit result*/);
assertMatch("1#(1]1a[}!", "1#(1]1a[}!", false /*cgit result*/);


I can commit the test somewhere but not sure where. It's  not really a unit test and requires c git to be installed and on the path.

Cool.

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/56760/

 > assertMatch("[/\\", "[/\\", false /*cgit result*/);

Fixed with next patchset

 > assertMatch("b/][\\|", "b/][\\|", false /*cgit result*/);

Fixed with next patchset

 > assertMatch("1#(1]1a[}!", "1#(1]1a[}!", false /*cgit result*/);

That's the funniest one. C git shows this:
1#(1]1a is properly ignored via 1#(1]1a rule but none of the following patterns
1#(1]1a[   is not matched by 1#(1]1a[
1#(1]1a[}  is not matched by 1#(1]1a[}
1#(1]1a[}! is not matched by 1#(1]1a[}!

C Git seems to have a bug: it doesn't like opening bracket without closing one.

So a file "[" is not matched by "[", "[*" rules. I've added extra tests, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/56770

Please attach the script to the bug, or submit as a "disabled" test. It is valuable since it found more then one bug.
