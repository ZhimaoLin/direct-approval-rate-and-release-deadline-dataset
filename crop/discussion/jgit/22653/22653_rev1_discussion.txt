Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> revert this trailing whitespace

Line:966, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> this ended up in the wrong commit and should go into https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22652/ to fix the compilation error there
