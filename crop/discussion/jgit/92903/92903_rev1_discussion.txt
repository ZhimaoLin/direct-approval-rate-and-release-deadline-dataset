Line:296, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> This is the same handling as in the block at L288-291, so it could be added there instead, i.e.

 } catch (IOException | Throwable err) {
     ....

Also, should this specifically catch OutOfMemoryError rather than Throwable?

Line:358, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> Same here

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The bug specifically mentions out of memory error.

Line:296, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> also we could consider to move the call to close() which is repeated in each catch block to a common finally block
