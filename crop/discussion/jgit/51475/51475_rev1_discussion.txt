DESCRIPTION

Use local variable in RepositoryTestCase.indexState

There is a signature of the test helper method `indexState`,
in `RepositoryTestCase`, that accepts a `Repository` object
as an argument.  However, there was one line of code where
this variable was not being used, and the method was instead
referring to a member variable `db`.  I believe this was
probably just an oversight in a previous refactor, and
that the correct behavior is to use the variable from
the argument list.  This change also has the benefit
of making it possible to convert this method to a static
method, since it no longer relies on any state from the class.

good catch. That's simply a bug. Then: why don't we directly additionally make this method static and move it to the class where you want it. That's all test code so we don't have to care about API changes etc. All the users of this method are not affected. Moving a member method to a static method of the parent class doesn't require code changes, or? At least CheckoutCommandTest still compiles (and is correct now. It was doing wrong tests before your fix)

Yes, I have a follow-up branch ready to go, which converts this to a static and moves it to the parent class.  Was just waiting for confirmation that I'd interpreted this correctly.  Do you want to merge this one and then I'll submit my follow-up branch?
