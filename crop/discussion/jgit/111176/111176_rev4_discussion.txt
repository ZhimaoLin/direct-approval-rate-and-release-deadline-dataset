Patch Set 4:

The test failure with the inheritance approach is that FoundObject is tied to a pack. If the object is not in a pack yet (no flush yet), it doesn't know how to deal with it. The solution is in this case, it should fallback to open(cur, OBJ_ANY) before throw the MissingObjectException.
