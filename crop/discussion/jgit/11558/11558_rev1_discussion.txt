DESCRIPTION

Added characters to be escaped in file name patterns

Originally, characters could not be escaped in FileNameMatcher patterns.
This breaks file name matching when escaped brackets "\[" and "\]" are
used in the pattern. A fix has been implemented to allow for any
character to be escaped by prepending it with a '\'

IP assertion needed

Line:833, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/FileNameMatcherTest.java -> Add a case for escaped '\' and a mix of all to test that the escaping does not only work at the start and end of strings.

Line:283, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/FileNameMatcher.java -> nit: Braces not needed.

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/FileNameMatcher.java -> // does not work if looking for '\', though we don't need that now

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/fnmatch/FileNameMatcher.java -> I don't see how you could look for an unescaped escape character, as there isn't really such a thing. Please elaborate if you want me to fix it.
