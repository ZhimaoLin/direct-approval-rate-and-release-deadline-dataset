DESCRIPTION

Added characters to be escaped in file name patterns

Originally, characters could not be escaped in FileNameMatcher patterns.
This breaks file name matching when escaped brackets "\[" and "\]" are
used in the pattern. A fix has been implemented to allow for any
character to be escaped by prepending it with a '\'
