DESCRIPTION

Add option to DirCacheCheckout to allow skipping conflicting files

A new property 'skipConflicts' allows to skip conflicting files during
checkout. Non-conflicting files will be checked out as usual and
getConflicts() lists the files which were skipped during checkout due
to conflicts.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would mention that this option is only relevant when failOnConflict is false. That's important because the defalt for failOnConflict is true and commands like git.checkout()... will use "true". You mentioned this in the javadoc's ... but I would repeat that in the commit message.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Will do. I am waiting for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75443/ to get approved. After that, I need to rebase this change onto it anyway and thereby will amend the commit message.
