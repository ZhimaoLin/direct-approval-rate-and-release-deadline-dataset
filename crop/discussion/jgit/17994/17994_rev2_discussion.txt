DESCRIPTION

RFC Break library up into modules

Instead of compiling the entire library as one JAR, break it down into
smaller units based on purpose.  This allows some parts of the build
to compile in parallel, potentially reducing latency by making better
use of available CPUs.

After this change 'lib' has been reduced to approximately the smallest
set of classes that do not have circular dependencies upon each other.

As a result org.eclipse.jgit/BUCK is now rather messy, because it is
showing the real mess within org.eclipse.jgit.  The JAR has very
blurry lines with many classes crossing between package boundaries.
Packages rarely contain all related classes.

Currently it is impossible to separate the server protocol components
(e.g. UploadPack, ReceivePack) from the main runtime library.

Package internal.storage.file cannot be broken out, as it is required
by internal.storage.pack and other classes in the library.

looks like RebaseTodoLine shouldn't use an API exception, we can't add a reference to the api module since this would yield a circular module dependency. So it seems we should fix this by using another exception here and translate that in RebaseCommand to an API exception

Patch Set 2:

alternatively we could put the API exceptions into their own buck module in order to break up the module dependency cycle

Patch Set 2:

Yes, was hitting the same problem here. And it is very good sample why Maven sucks: you don't really see your dependencies.

I think RebaseTodoLine shouldn't use anything from the API space.
