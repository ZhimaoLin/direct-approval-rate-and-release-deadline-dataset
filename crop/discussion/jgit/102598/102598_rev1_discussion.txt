DESCRIPTION

Fix exception handling for opening bitmap index files

When creating a new PackFile instance it is specified whether this pack
has an associated bitmap index file or not. This information is cached
and the public method getBitmapIndex() will always assume a bitmap index
file must exist if the cached data tells so. But it may happen that the
packfiles are repacked during a gc in a different process causing the
packfile,bitmap-index and index file to be deleted. Since JGit still has
an open FileHandle on the packfile this file is not really deleted and
can still be accessed. But index and bitmap index file are deleted.
Modify getBitmapIndex() to be aware of such a situation in invalidate
the packfile instance if such a situation occurs.

This problem showed up when a gerrit server was serving repositories
which where garbage collected with native git regularly. Fetches and
clones for certain repositories failed permanently after a native git gc
was deleting old bitmap index files.

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcConcurrentTest.java -> can you add a test which tests that after a gc run by a different process jgit will find and use the bitmap index of the new packs created by gc ?

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcConcurrentTest.java -> remove dead code ?

Line:167, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcConcurrentTest.java -> remove duplicate "when"

Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcConcurrentTest.java -> repo is gc'ed

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> missing blank after comma

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Fix getBitmapIndex() to invalidate

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcConcurrentTest.java -> I could add a test with multiple processes. But I think it is not required because this test shows (because he is failing without the fix) that even a gc started from the same process shows the problem. The test shows that you only have to run a gc with a different Repository instance (pointing to the same location in the filesystem) in order to corrupt the original repository/objectDatabase. And with the fix we can write the packfile - means we detect the new packfile.

An explicit test whether the new bitmap index file is used has been added.
