DESCRIPTION

Speed up bitmap creation time in GC.

Previously, bitmap indexes were created from scratch on every run of GC.

+ Update the PackWriter to reuse previously computed bitmaps, by mapping
  the old positions to the new positions on the fly and caching the
  result.
+ Add a flag byte to each bitmap which marks whether the bitmap is able
  to be reused (since it was at the max commit distance when it was
  originally selected).
+ Shrink the range of commits between each bitmap and use a step
  function.

On the linux kernel, this decreased time to create a bitmap
from about 60 seconds to 10 seconds.
