DESCRIPTION

Speed up bitmap creation time in GC.

Previously, bitmap indexes were created from scratch on every run of GC.
Update the PackWriter to reuse previously computed bitmaps, by mapping
the old positions to the new positions on the fly and caching the
result.

On the linux kernel, this decreased time to create a bitmap
from about 60 seconds to 10 seconds.
