DESCRIPTION

IndexDiff: Provide conflict type (stage mask)

Adds a new method getConflictTypes() which returns a Map<String,
ConflictType> (path to conflict type). ConflictType is an enum for all
possible stage combinations (BOTH_DELETED, ADDED_BY_US, ...).

This can be used to implement the conflict text for unmerged paths in
output of "git status" or in EGit for decorations/hints.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Well, the thing is that a path with type BOTH_DELETED is already returned in getConflicting() (before this change). And apparently BOTH_DELETED and ADDED_BY_US/ADDED_BY_THEM can be a result in case of a rename/rename conflict: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4681361/305973

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> So, Christian, have you seen my comment? I can rename the enum to StageState. The method on IndexDiff could be called getConflictingStageStates(). That would be ok for me, as it is close to getConflicting().

Sorry Robin, I commented some time ago but now found out my comment was still in draft state.

Long story short: I like your proposal to call it getConflictingStageStates()

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> very good example in the stackoverflow discussion. A file x was renamed in one branch to y and in another branch to z. When merging the branches I get a conflict. Is this one conflict or is it three conflicts (one on x, one on y, one on z)? For me this is one conflict and I can find out the kind of the conflict by looking at the index state. Because I see there a BOTH_DELETED in combination with a ADDED_BY_US/ADDED_BY_THEM I learn what kind of conflict it is. But BOTH_DELETED is not sufficient for me to understand why I have a conflict.

Don't get me wrong: I like BOTH_DELETED and all that names, but I wouldn't call it a conflict type.

Thanks, see new patch set.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Ok, you were convincing :). Changed it to StageState (has a nicer plural than status).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> What this enum represents is the status of the index for a certain path regarding the stages. Which stages do exist for this path and which not. I would rename it to StageStatus, Stages or something like that. Do you have a better name?

Why? Because I have problems with a conflict type called "BOTH_DELETED". Both deleted should be fine! That's not the reason for/type of a conflict.

The same argument goes for ADDED_BY_US, ADDED_BY_THEM, .... . These all don't describe situations where we don't expect a conflict.

But besides this I like the idea to publish the stageState.
