DESCRIPTION

IndexDiff: Provide stage state for conflicting entries

Adds a new method getConflictingStageStates() which returns a
Map<String, StageState> (path to stage state). StageState is an enum for
all possible stage combinations (BOTH_DELETED, ADDED_BY_US, ...).

This can be used to implement the conflict text for unmerged paths in
output of "git status" or in EGit for decorations/hints.
