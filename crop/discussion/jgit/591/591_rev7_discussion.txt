DESCRIPTION

Add builder-style API to jgit and Commit & Log cmd

Added a new package org.eclipse.jgit.api and a builder-style API for
jgit. Added also the first implementation for two git commands: Commit
and Log.

This API is intendet to be used by external components when
functionalities of the standard git commands are required. It will also
help to ease writing JGit tests.

For internal usages this API may often not be optimal because the git
commands are doing much more than required or they expect parameters of
an unappropriate type.

>This was my first idea, but it didn't worked out when trying to implement it. Problem is that every Command implements call() but throws a different set of exceptions Although we have a common interface the implementations differ in the set of exceptions they throw.

The call interface that you implement already has "throws Exception". Do we need it?

As for the state state. This is a public API, which means we want something that can stay as it is, Ideally forever. If it was an internal thing it would be less important, but it leaks through the setState (now setCallable) method. 

Also: Spelling error in commit message "This API is intendet"
