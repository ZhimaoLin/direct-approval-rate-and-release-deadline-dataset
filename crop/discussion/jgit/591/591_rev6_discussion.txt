DESCRIPTION

Add builder-style API to jgit and Commit & Log cmd

Added a new package org.eclipse.jgit.api and a builder-style API for
jgit. Added also the first implementation for two git commands: Commit
and Log.

This API is intendet to be used by external components when
functionalities of the standard git commands are required. It will also
help to ease writing JGit tests.

For internal usages this API may often not be optimal because the git
commands are doing much more than required or they expect parameters of
an unappropriate type.

Patch Set 6: No score; No score

I think the state-without-a-name is a problem here. What does it mean? It it cannot be name it is not defined and
I don't think we want that. How about having more flags. checkState could check all flags.

You may want two flags/states. gooaAndDone, badAndDone, notDoneYet.

Make the call to call() an internal one and wrap iit so commands gets executed through that wrapper. The wrapper then keeps track of the state to each command doesm't have to deall with the unnamed state.

execute() {
   try {
       call();
       setState(DONE);
   } catch (RuntimeException e) {
       setState(FAILED);
       throw e;
   }
}

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> Style: declare these two where they are initialized

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> what about errors? Is it ok to retry execution of a partially failed command?

You're now the second one who doesn't like this. Ok, I'll give it a specific name e.g. "callable". Maybe we'll have even more flags later, but up to know I only need "callable".

This was my first idea, but it didn't worked out when trying to implement it. Problem is that every Command implements call() but throws a different set of exceptions. Although we have a common interface the implementations differ in the set of exceptions they throw.

If I would do like you suggested I would force user to call the wrappers call() method which will always only "throws Exception".

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Not sure about that. There might be some error situations which for example represent only temporal problem and for which it would make sense to wait a second and try it again with the same set options.
(Somebody locks currently something Log needs).
In other situation's you may receive and exception and based on the exception type you reset an option to a different and retry the command (e.g. setch errors "server not available" where you might try again with another protocol).
So in general I think a good contract could be: "Only one succesful call to call() per instance. Or: only one result per instance.

Or?
