DESCRIPTION

reftable: wrap a collection of refs in a RefCursor

This is useful for transaction code that wants to write a compaction
at the same time as its making a commit of one or more references.
The new mutations can go into a RefCursor.from(List<Ref>) wrapper and
be added first to the compactor, then existing tables from the stack
can be added with tryAddFirst.

Abandoned

This is a bad idea. Implementors are better off using a ReftableWriter to ByteArrayOutputStream, and pass that into ReftableReader.
