DESCRIPTION

Add helper method to CleanCommand to delete files

The nested conditional logic in CleanCommand's call method was getting a
bit out of hand, so this commit refactors the repetition into a
cleanPath method that deletes the file and adds the file to the list of
cleaned files, taking into account recursion and whether or not it is a
dry run.
