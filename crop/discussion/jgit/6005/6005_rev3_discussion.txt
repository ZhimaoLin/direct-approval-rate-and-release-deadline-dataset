this change breaks tests in IndexDiffFilterTest

We need you to explicitly assert the contributor questions [1] as a review comment on this change

Line:185, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> this line seems too wide, please use the JGit formatter settings, find them in tools/eclipse-JGit-format.xml

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommand.java -> this hunk seems unrelated to this change

Line:48, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> style nit: we don't use wildcards in import statements

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> we manage and sort import statements using Ctrl-Shift-O in Eclipse

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> it's unnecessary to have this in the commit message as this is obvious from the commit's diff
