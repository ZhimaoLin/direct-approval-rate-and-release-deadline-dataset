Line:263, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> JGitInternalException means something broke really bad, usually in an unexpected way. How can you know it is the exception you expected and not, say a wrapped FileNotFoundException?

- Don't use expected= (ever), it's too prone to accept the wrong error

- Make the error a GitAPIException

Line:263, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> I'm not sure about the need for a GitAPIException, but I stand firmly by the use of "expected=".
