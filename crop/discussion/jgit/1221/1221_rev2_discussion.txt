DESCRIPTION

Offer ObjectReaders advice about a RevWalk

By giving the reader information about the roots of a revision
traversal, some readers may be able to prefetch information from
their backing store using background threads in order to reduce
data access latency.  However this isn't typically necessary so
the default reader implementation doesn't react to the advice.
