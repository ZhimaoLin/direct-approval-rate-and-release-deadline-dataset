DESCRIPTION

Cluster packed blobs by delta chains

When writing out the blobs in a pack, sort first by the ObjectWalk
enumeration order (aka recency and tree path order), but cluster all
children of a delta behind their delta base. This matches the ordering
used by IndexPack when it is resolving deltas, speeding up IndexPack.

It also produces better locality when accessing a blob. Most blob
reads access a delta (as the vast majority of blobs are stored in
delta format), which then needs to inflate the base and apply the
patch. Placing all deltas near their base improves the odds that
a the base will be in memory, if not in the JGit buffer cache,
at least the OS buffer cache.

This change makes JGit PackWriter more closely match C Git behavior
changed in 1b4bb16b9ec3 ('pack-objects: optimize "recency order"').
JGit was already quite close to the new C Git behavior, and it is one
of the things that prompted C Git to update the ordering, but JGit was
missing the blob delta family clustering.

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/ObjectToPack.java -> it seems there is no test case covering this (where deltaBase is an instance of ObjectToPack), maybe we should add a test here

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/ObjectToPack.java -> Oy. We don't have a test covering a delta and its base in the pack? Yikes. Yes, we absolutely need to add a test here.
