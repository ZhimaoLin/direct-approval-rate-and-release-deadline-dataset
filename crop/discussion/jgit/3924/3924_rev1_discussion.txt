DESCRIPTION

Add copy constructor to PackConfig

Some embeddings of UploadPack (e.g. Gerrit Code Review) set their own
PackConfig from a server-wide configuration, overriding any JGit
defaults or settings that may exist at the local repository level.

Make a copy constructor form of PackConfig so this server-wide
configuration object can be copied and then merged with repository
specific configuration data.
