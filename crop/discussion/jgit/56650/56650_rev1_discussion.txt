DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Add an optional branch config to the gitmodules creation

When there is a "branch" key in the .gitmodules file, projects hosted
in Gerrit will automatically update once a submodule changes.
This mechanism is called superproject subscription [1].
This allows to enable this feature.

Line:327, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> I think it might make more sense that this option be a boolean instead (whether to use this feature), and the branch string is read from the manifest xml file when the option is set to true.

In order to read the branch name from the xml file, you might need to add a member "branch" into RepoProject, and make some modifications in ManifestParser and RepoCommand accordingly.

I agree with Yuxuan's suggestions.

Please also add the option to jgit/pgm/Repo.java and add a test e.g. in RepoCommandTest.

The commit message might also want to mention "git submodule update --remote".
