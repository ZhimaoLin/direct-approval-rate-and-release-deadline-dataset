DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Add an optional branch config to the gitmodules creation

When there is a "branch" key in the .gitmodules file, projects hosted
in Gerrit will automatically update once a submodule changes.
This mechanism is called superproject subscription [1].
This allows to enable this feature.

Patch Set 3:

(2 comments)

The main code is ok, but you still need to fix the test :)

Line:321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Please also mention that it only works in bare mode (see examples in setAuthor, setRemoteReader, etc.)

Line:452, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> So it could be a tag here, which is not a branch, but harmless in Gerrit. I think we should have a comment here to explain that.

Did you see my comments on patch set 2?

I gave some suggestions that I think would make this easier to read and wanted to check that they weren't lost.

Yes I saw them. I just focused on getting the test pass first, before incorporating all suggestions. I'll incorporate the suggestions today.
