DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Add setRecordRemoteBranch option to record upstream branch

On a server also running Gerrit that is using RepoCommand to
convert from an XML manifest to a git submodule superproject
periodically, it would be handy to be able to use Gerrit's
submodule subscription feature[1] to update the superproject
automatically between RepoCommand runs as changes are merged
in each subprojects.

This requires setting the 'branch' field for each submodule
so that Gerrit knows what branch to watch.  Add an option to
do that.

Setting the branch field also is useful for plain Git users,
since it allows them to use "git submodule update --remote" to
manually update all submodules between RepoCommand runs.
