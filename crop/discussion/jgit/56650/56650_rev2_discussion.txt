DESCRIPTION

RepoCommand: Add an optional branch config to the gitmodules creation

When there is a "branch" key in the .gitmodules file, projects hosted
in Gerrit will automatically update once a submodule changes.
This mechanism is called superproject subscription [1].
This allows to enable this feature.

(4 comments)

Line:709, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommandTest.java -> Also worth an example using revision="some-tag"

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is also useful for "git submodule update --remote" --- please also mention that in the commit message

Line:321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> This should describe what this does in terms of output to .gitmodules. How the branch config is meant to be used is described under submodule.<name>.branch at http://jk.gs/gitmodules.html ("man gitmodules") and https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-submodules.html

Line:327, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> The name of this option doesn't make it obvious to me what it will do. How about setRecordRemoteBranch(boolean recordRemoteBranch)?

Please also add the option to org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Repo.java so it is easier to experiment with the "jgit" commandline tool.

Actually here we only added the code to isBare() code path (we should mention that in the setGerritSuperprojectUpdate javadoc), and the pgm only use non bare code path, so it won't work there, and I don't think adding support to non bare code path is worth the effort.
