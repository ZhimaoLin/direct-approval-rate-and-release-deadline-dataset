DESCRIPTION

Handle null in ProgressMonitor setters

These commands' monitor fields can never be null unless someone passes
null to setProgressMonitor.  Anyone passing null probably meant to
disable the ProgressMonitor, so do that (by falling back to
NullProgressMonitor.INSTANCE) instead of saving a null and eventually
producing NullPointerException.
