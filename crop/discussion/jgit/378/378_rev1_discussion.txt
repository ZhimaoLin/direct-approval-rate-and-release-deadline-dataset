Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this



Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.updatesite/pom.xml -> Is it a cosmetic change? I see no difference instead of moving same lines.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score



Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.updatesite/pom.xml -> I moved the tag because it has no semantic difference to be earlier in the file, but then I can have tools/version.sh update the first 3 <version> elements in the file and skip the 4th, which is the version of the maven-assembly-plugin below.
