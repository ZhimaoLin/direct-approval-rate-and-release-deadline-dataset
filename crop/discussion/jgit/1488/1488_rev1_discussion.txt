DESCRIPTION

Move rename detection, path following into DiffFormatter

Applications just want a quick way to configure our diff
implementation, and then just want to use it without a lot of fuss.

Move all of the rename detection logic and path following logic
out of our pgm package and into DiffFormatter itself, making it
much easier for a GUI to take advantage of the features without
duplicating a lot of code.
