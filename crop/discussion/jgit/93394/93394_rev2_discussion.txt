DESCRIPTION

bazel: Mark junit targets testonly

Only testonly targets (such as tests) need to use junit.

In particular this involves making the toplevel :all rule testonly.
It's not clear to me what that rule is for --- "bazel build //..."
already works to build all targets.  In any case it appears to be for
testing, so marking it as testonly shouldn't be harmful.
