DESCRIPTION

Enhance RefDatabase with a refresh() method

There should be a way to explictly refresh the refs cached in the
RefDirectory. Since commit c261b28 (use of FileSnapshot) this is
not needed anymore for storage in the filesystem. But for DHT based
storage an explicit refresh may be needed.
