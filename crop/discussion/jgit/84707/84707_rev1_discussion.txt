Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/ObjectUploadListener.java -> I think you need to xxx@xxx.xxx tag now that it is public

I think we should not add public API in service releases

> I think we should not add public API in service releases

The reason I did this is because we have a Gerrit plugin for Gerrit 2.13 that needs to use ObjectUploadListener.  But since it's not public, the class in the plugin need to be declared in the org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.fs package, which is not very clean.

If this really can't go to the next 4.5 service release, we can live with it as it is and I'll move this to master.
