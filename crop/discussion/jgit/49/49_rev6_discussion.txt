DESCRIPTION

server side: smart fetch over HTTP

Clients can request smart fetch support by examining the info/refs URL
with the service parameter set to the magic git-upload-pack string:

  GET /$GIT_DIR/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1

The response is formatted with the upload pack capabilities, using
the standard packet line formatter.  A special header line is put
in front of the standard upload-pack advertisement to let clients
know the service was recognized and is supported.

If the requested service is disabled an authorization status code is
returned, allowing the user agent to retry once they have obtained
credentials from a human, in case authentication is required by
the configured UploadPackFactory implementation.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitServlet.java -> Known bug on the color coding issue here.  Its issue 251 [1].

Regarding the // at the end of the line, I rely very heavily on the Eclipse source code formatter style we have defined for the project.  When it doesn't break the lines nicely, I sometimes force the line breaking manually by renaming symbols until it breaks the way I want (and the name still makes sense), or I insert comments like this.

In this case the default breaking was unreadable compared to what I have forced manually.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitServlet.java -> 1) Gerrit colour coding gets this wrong, probably because of the */ in the string. Not that it's a biggie, I'm just pointing it out so you can have a look in context.
2) Not a big fan of the // with no comment at the end just so the .with goes onto a new line. I appreciate that it's in keeping with the rest of these though.
