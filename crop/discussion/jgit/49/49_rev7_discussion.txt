DESCRIPTION

server side: smart fetch over HTTP

Clients can request smart fetch support by examining the info/refs URL
with the service parameter set to the magic git-upload-pack string:

  GET /$GIT_DIR/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1

The response is formatted with the upload pack capabilities, using
the standard packet line formatter.  A special header line is put
in front of the standard upload-pack advertisement to let clients
know the service was recognized and is supported.

If the requested service is disabled an authorization status code is
returned, allowing the user agent to retry once they have obtained
credentials from a human, in case authentication is required by
the configured UploadPackFactory implementation.

Only comment was about ErrorServlet; it's not included in this change, and if it's a new one, shouldn't it be in this changeset?

Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitServlet.java -> Yup, saw it elsewhere, but wasn't immediately obvious about the hierarchy. So I'm happy.

Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitServlet.java -> ErrorServlet class was already introduced 3 commits back, in change Ia0f1a425d07d035e344ae54faf8aeb04763e7487.  So we can assume it exists here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitServlet.java -> This looks good, but ErrorServlet isn't part of this change. Is this an existing servlet or a new one added in a different change? If it's a new one, should it be part of this changeset?
