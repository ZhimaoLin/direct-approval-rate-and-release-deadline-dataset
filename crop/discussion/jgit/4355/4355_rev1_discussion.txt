DESCRIPTION

Convert ReadTreeTest and IndexDiffTest to DirCache (killing GitIndex)

ReadTreeTest and IndexDiffTest were still using it. There is however
a difference in test outcome in ReadTreeTest.testUntrackedConflicts.

I believe the new behavior is the right one, since we do not update
the index, nor data.
