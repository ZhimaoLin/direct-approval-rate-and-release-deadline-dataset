Line:944, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> I think this method now needs to have a Javadoc xxx@xxx.xxx 4.7 tag.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> why do you want to expose this method to subclasses ?

I am going to discard this change, since `toFileList` is public already.

Line:944, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffFormatter.java -> Thanks David for the review. Actually, I found that `toFileHeader` is the method which I am looking for. So, this CL is not necessary anymore. :)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for the review, Matthias. I was upgrading jgit from 3.4 to 4.5. All I need is to get an `EditList` from a `DiffEntry`. I just found that in 4.5, `toFileList` is exactly what I am looking for. So this CL is not necessary any more.
