DESCRIPTION

Fix resource leaks introduced with AutoClosable

In 77030a5e, AutoClosable was implemented for classes that use
release(). This caused resource leaks because the close() method  was
not calling the now deprecated release() method, which is the method
that sub classes implement to release resources.

Line:956, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> should we declare close() final to prevent overriding which would leak for old client code still calling release() ?

Line:956, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> Class overriding close should call super.close() which will call release.

I think it does matter that much if you plan to remove release method and only support close method in 4.0.
