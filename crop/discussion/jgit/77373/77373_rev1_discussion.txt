Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

This is logically not tangled with your large patch, so I'd suggest to rebase this patch on top of origin/master alone.

Also a word in the commit message on why this bug happened would be great, i.e. was this bug introduced accidentally and we need to fix it or is it just dead code?

git blame indicates that the last person to interact with those lines (and that part of the code in general) was Juliet Cantu in 2013. I'm unsure of whether its non-usage means that other lines that gave it some function have simply been removed since (and no one noticed to remove the original variable), or is indicative of some behaviour that should be occurring but isn't (which would be an actual bug, I presume) - I'll add Jonathan to CR this in case he knows?
