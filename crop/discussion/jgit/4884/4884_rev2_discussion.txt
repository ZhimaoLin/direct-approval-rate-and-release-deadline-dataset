Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)

Few more minor comments

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/SkipRevFilter.java -> This should be final

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/SkipRevFilter.java -> Count doesn't need to be explicitly initialized since it is 0 by default

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/SkipRevFilterTest.java -> Could you add a unit test for creating filter with a negative skip value?

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommandTest.java -> I think this unit test should be left as-is and two new unit tests should be added, one for skip only, and one for using skip and max together

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Shouldn't an AndRevFilter be used when both skip and maxCount are set?

Or am I misunderstanding the combined usage of the two?
