Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Two occurrences of 'the'

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/SkipRevFilter.java -> Perhaps a better comment would be something like:

"Filter that includes commits after a configured number are skipped"

"...show the commit output" is specific to the log command.

Line:334, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.java -> Looks like maxCountMustBeNonNegative was moved and a trailing whitespace was introduced.

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LogCommand.java -> Oops. Done.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/filter/SkipRevFilter.java -> Done.

Line:334, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.java -> I moved it on purpose, to keep alphabetical order. The whitespace was unintentional. Fixed.
