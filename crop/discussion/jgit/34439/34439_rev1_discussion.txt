Line:279, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Isn't the proper test here to check whether core.bare is true, rather than looking at the name, which may be a hint to humans, but not to git itself.

Line:279, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> you are right, this is what native git does, it doesn't hide bare repositories not regarding if their name starts with a dot or not

done
