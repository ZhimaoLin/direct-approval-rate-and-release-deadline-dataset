DESCRIPTION

Fix Javadoc formatting of org.eclipse.jgit.diff package

Without explicit <p> elements, Javadoc joins all paragraph, resulting in
unreadable Javadoc output, e.g. see here:

http://download.eclipse.org/jgit/docs/jgit-2.1.0.201209190230-r/apidocs/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.html

Also, <pre> is needed to preserve pre-formatted content.

The reflowing of text was automatically done on save.
