DESCRIPTION

WIP: Fix RevWalk when walking over commit graphs where commits have same creation date

In a commit graph where all commits have the same creation date commits are processed
by a RevWalk in a unusual order. There is a situation where the RevWalk fails to copy
the UNINTERESTING flag properly and therefore returns wrong results. When walking
over a hierarchy where the only interesting commit is a successor of a uninteresting
commit the revwalk finds commits although all commit should be uninteresting. This
does not happen when the commits have different (and consistent) creation dates and
DateRevQueue helps to process the commits in a correct order.

This WIP just adds a small test case which demonstrates this bug
