DESCRIPTION

WIP: Fix LogCommand/RevWalk when uninteresting is successor of interesting

Add a testcase which shows the problem. This test behaves differently
when written inside a LocalDiskRepositoryTestcase. The MockSystemReader
which is registered in this case seems to modify the situation. I was not
able to see the same behaviour in a LocalDiskRepositoryTestcase test even
if I use tick() to simulate similar timestamp deltas -- scary!
