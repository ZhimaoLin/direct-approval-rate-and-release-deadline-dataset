DESCRIPTION

Fix carrying over flags during a RevWalk

There was a bug when carrying over flags from a merge commit to its non-first
parents. The first parent of a merge commit was handled differently and correct
but the non-first parents are handled by a recursive algorithm. Flags should be
copied from the root merge commit to parent-2, to grandparent-2, ... up to the
limit of STACK_DEPTH==500 parents-levels. But the recursive algorithm  was
always copying only to the direct parents of the merge commit and not the
grand*-parents.

This seems to be no problem when commits are handled in a strict date order
because then copying only one level is no problem if children are handled
before parents. But when commits are not seperated anymore by distinctive
correct dates (e.g. because all commits have the same date) then it may happen
that a merge-parent is handled before the merge commit and when dealing later
with the merge commit one has to copy flags down to more than one level
