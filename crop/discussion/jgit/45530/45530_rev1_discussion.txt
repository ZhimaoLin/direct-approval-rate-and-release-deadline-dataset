DESCRIPTION

RFC: ObjectWalk.markUninteresting object cache

The change:

  "Let ObjectWalk.markUninteresting also mark the root tree as
  uninteresting" [1]

...turned out to be really costly on Gerrit replication (which is
essentially a jgit push or a series of the same jgit push).

During a push of a really large git, most time is spent reading and
inflating parts of the pack-files while walking the tree objects and
marking the objects uninteresting. This change introduces a very basic
cache in ObjectWalk to help minimize the need for disk reading.

Benchmarks of this basic cache using Gerrit's replication showed that,
on large gits (~3M objects), the replication time (with 1 slave) was
cut from ~60 seconds, to ~20 seconds (with a warm cache).

The cache is enabled through the system property:
'jgit.experimental.objectcache.size'
setting the maximum number of objects cached.

Since the cache's main purpose is to increase performance of
consecutive pushes of the same commit the cache has a rather
unorthodox FIFO type implementation.

The datastructure of the cache makes pruning of single objects rather
complex. Since other objects may contain references to the object it
would require to traverse the whole cache and remove all references.
The approach is instead to remove a whole tree.
