DESCRIPTION

Require the hamcrest packaging that comes with Eclipse

The other one gets installed with SWTBot, but you do not
need it if you do not hack EGit. Using import-package
instead of require-bundle fixes the dependency. Actually
we do not need hamcrest at this time, but JUnit wants it.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I get a NoClassDefFoundError here. Strange since the hamcrest bundle seems to export packeges
