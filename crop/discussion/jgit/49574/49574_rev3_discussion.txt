DESCRIPTION

Introduce exactRef and findRef in Repository, deprecate getRef

Using findRef instead of getRef makes it clearer that the caller wants to
search for the ref in the search path, instead of looking for a ref that
exactly matches the input.

This change introduces findRef and exactRefs methods but does not update
callers to use them yet.

NEEDSWORK: tests, update callers
