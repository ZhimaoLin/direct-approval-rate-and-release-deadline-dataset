DESCRIPTION

Repository: Introduce exactRef and findRef, deprecate getRef

Today the Repository class provides only one method to look up a ref by
name: getRef.  If I try to look up refs/heads/master and that ref does
not exist, getRef will look further in the search path for
ref/refs/heads/master, refs/heads/refs/heads/master, and
refs/remotes/refs/heads/master.  This behavior is counterintuitive,
needlessly inexpensive, and usually not what the caller expects.

Instead we should do what RefDatabase does: provide two separate methods
- exactRef, which looks up a ref when its exact name is known
- findRef, which looks for a ref along the search path

Do so.  For backward compatibility, keep getRef as a deprecated synonym
for findRef.

This change introduces findRef and exactRef but does not update callers
outside tests to use them yet.
