DESCRIPTION

Repository: Introduce exactRef and findRef, deprecate getRef

The Repository class provides only one method to look up a ref by
name, getRef.  If I request refs/heads/master and that ref does not
exist, getRef will look further in the search path:

 ref/refs/heads/master
 refs/heads/refs/heads/master
 refs/remotes/refs/heads/master

This behavior is counterintuitive, needlessly inexpensive, and usually
not what the caller expects.

Allow callers to specify whether to use the search path by providing
two separate methods:

- exactRef, which looks up a ref when its exact name is known
- findRef, which looks for a ref along the search path

For backward compatibility, keep getRef as a deprecated synonym for
findRef.

This change introduces findRef and exactRef but does not update
callers outside tests to use them yet.
