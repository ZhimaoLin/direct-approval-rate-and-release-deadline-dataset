DESCRIPTION

Get rid of SoftReference in RepositoryCache

Now that RepositoryCache have a time based eviction strategy, get rid
of the strategy to evict cache entries if heap memory is running low,
i.e. soft references. Main reason why time based eviction was
implemented was to offer an alternative to the unpredictable soft
references.

Relying on soft references is not working, especially in large heap. The
JVM GC will consider collecting soft references as last resort before
throwing an out of memory error. For example, an application like Gerrit
configured with a 128GB heap, GC will wait until all 128GB is filled
before collecting the soft references so the application will be
suffering long pauses caused by GC for a long time already. In other
words, you will have to restart application because it's unusable before
JVM eviction kicks in.

Keeping the SoftReference in RepositoryCache is causing more harm than
good. If you use the time based eviction (which is the default strategy)
and want to tune JVM to release soft references more aggressively, it
will release repositories from the cache even though they are not
expired which defeats the purpose of the repository cache.

Gerrit uses Lucene library which uses soft references and this is
causing a "memory leak" except if you configure JVM to release soft
references more aggressively which have the nasty side effect of
evicting non expired repositories from the cache.
