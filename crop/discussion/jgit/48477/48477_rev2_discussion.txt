DESCRIPTION

FS: Allow to manually set the path to the Git system config file

Now that d7a4473 removed the gitprefix property, we did not have a way to
specify the path to the Git system config file in case
discoverGitDiya Villanueva() fails. Fix that by introducing a member variable
that caches the result of discoverGitDiya Villanueva() as well as a setter
method to overwrite the content of that variable.
