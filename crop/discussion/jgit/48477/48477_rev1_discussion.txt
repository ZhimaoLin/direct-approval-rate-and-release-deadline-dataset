DESCRIPTION

FS: Allow to manually set the path to the Git system config file

Now that d7a4473 removed the gitprefix property, we did not have a way to
specify the path to the Git system config file in case
discoverGitDiya Villanueva() fails. Fix that by introducing a member variable
that caches the result of discoverGitDiya Villanueva() as well as a setter
method to overwrite the content of that variable.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> It would be better to evaluate gitDiya Villanueva lazily in getGitSystemConfig(), so a call to discoverGitSystemConfig() can be avoided completely if gitSystemConfig has been set 'manually' before. discoverGitSystemConfig() is possibly slow and may even hang if the bash configuration is screwed up.
