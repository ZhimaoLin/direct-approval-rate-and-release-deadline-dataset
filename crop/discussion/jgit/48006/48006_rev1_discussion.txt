DESCRIPTION

Add tests for ObjectFilter

NEEDSWORK: will have more tests --- just sending this out early in
case reviewers want to comment on the scaffolding.  I'd like to
test that

 - the default ObjectFilter is ALL
 - ObjectFilter affects nextObject() and not next()
 - omitting a tree implies omitting its subtrees
 - a blob or tree reached by another path is still returned
 - ObjectFilter can be mixed with RevFilter
