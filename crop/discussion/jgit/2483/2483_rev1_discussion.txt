Line:6, org.eclipse.jgit.console/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Are we expecting to do a 0.11.3 release?

Usually I merge the 0.11.1 unqualified version into master, and then update versions to be 0.12.0.qualifier.  If we need to go back and do changes to stable-0.11 we would create the 0.11.2.qualifier at that time.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

unnecessary bumping of version as we don't plan to ship a bug fix release for 0.11.1
