Line:239, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommitList.java -> Before the change the code had to remove the commit's lane before modifying the position and (re-)adding, because that would modify the hashCode, too. Now the hashCode is unaffected by the position, making the removal superfluous.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit.ui/src/org/eclipse/jgit/awtui/SwingCommitList.java -> I wonder why this code was here at all. I think there was no chance that color.equals(...) part contributed to the outcome. Nice that we can get rid of that

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe once upon the time somebody thought that putting two lanes with same position into the same hashtable bucket would be a wise idea.
Anyhow: it's nice to get rid of our own implementations of hashCode and equals. +1

Line:239, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommitList.java -> There is a bugzilla bug which explains why this remove() went int. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=365460 . But now, with Konrads change we don't need that anymore.
