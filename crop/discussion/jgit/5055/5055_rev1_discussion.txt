DESCRIPTION

Allow to pack a set of loose and packed refs into a new packed-ref file

Enhance the RefDirectory class to expose a method which writes a set of
refs (loose, packed or loose-packed) into a new packed-refs file. All
loose (and loose-packed) refs which are afterwards included in the new
pack file are deleted from the filesystem. This method will try to lock
every given ref in order to prevent that it is updated/deleted during
the runtime of this method. Before the method returns all files are
unlocked. Refs which can't be locked are ignored.

Let the garbage collector make use of this functionality to do a repack
of all non-symbolic refs.

Line:217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> you should have null check for the 'pm' progress monitor at the beginning of this method to avoid a NPE here in case when caller calls with null.

The same check as in the gc method above.
