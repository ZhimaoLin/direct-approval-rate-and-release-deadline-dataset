Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(11 inline comments)

We can't submit this because its a partially set up test case. The test might show the bug, but its not in a state that we can submit because it messes around with the public API of the pgm package.

Anyway, thank you for the test that shows the bug.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/TextBuiltin.java -> Do not make public.

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Please do not add empty Javadoc.

Especially in a commit whose only description is "gives strange result".

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Do not make this class public.

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Please do not make this public, nor non-final.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Do not add empty Javadoc.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Do not make public.

Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Diff.java -> Do not make public.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please elaborate and describe what the strange result is, and how it should be instead so that it is less strange.

OK, after reading the bug, I wish you had at least echoed the bug report here in the commit message. That would have saved me a lot of time commenting on the pgm.Diff class hacks that are used just to setup the test case.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style-nit: Use "Bug:" not "bug:".  Also, we tend to put this on the line before the Change-Id.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffTest.java -> Missing copyright header.

Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/DiffTest.java -> This should be using DiffFormatter, not pgm.Diff.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The current diff is:
" folder"
when it should be:
"- folder
+ folder change".

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sorry, will fix my commit template. It seems that because I used "bug" (lower case) the Changed-Id has been added at wrong position. I didn't put it there manually.
