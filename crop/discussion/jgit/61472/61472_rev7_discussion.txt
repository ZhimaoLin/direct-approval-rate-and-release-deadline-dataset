DESCRIPTION

WIP: LfsProtocolServlet and lfs-store command

This introduces the LargeFileRepository interface which enables the
protocol servlet to stay independent from the details of how LFS
protocol generates large object URLs and how it accesses the large
objects metadata.

At the client side we have to configure the lfs.url:

  [lfs]
	  url = http://host:port/lfs

git-lfs client appends the objects/batch to the lfs.url.

Hard code an Authorization header in the PlainFSRepository.getHeaders
because then git-lfs client will skip asking for credentials. It will
just forward the Authorization header from the response to the
download/upload request.

The LfsProtocolServlet handles the "Git LFS v1 Batch API" protocol [1].

The lfs-store command is used to run the LfsProtocolServlet and,
optionally, the LargeObjectServlet which makes it easier to setup a
local test server.

TODO: cleanup the lfs-store command. It uses a class from a test
package, depends on junit and the options are not very intuitive
