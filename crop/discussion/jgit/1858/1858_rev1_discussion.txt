DESCRIPTION

Fixed the git init to properly set bare=true

When --git-dir=X is given JGit creates a bare repository in the
directory X. However, when the --bare option is not explicitly
given, this is not properly reflected in the X/config file i.e.
the bare=true is missing.  This change fixes this minor issue.
