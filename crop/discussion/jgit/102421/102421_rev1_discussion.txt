DESCRIPTION

Eliminate SectionParser construction boilerplate

Happily, most anonymous SectionParser implementations can be replaced
with FooConfig::new, as long as the constructor takes a single Config
arg. Many of these, the non-public ones, can in turn be inlined. A few
remaining SectionParsers can be lambdas.
