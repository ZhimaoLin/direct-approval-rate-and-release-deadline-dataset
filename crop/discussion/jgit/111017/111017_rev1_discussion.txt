DESCRIPTION

ObjectDirectory: Add pack directory getter

So far, in order to get the pack directory it was necessary to resolve
it from the object directory. This resolution is already done when
creating the object directory, so simplify the call by just adding a
getter to the pack directory.

looks good but should go to master

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> * xxx@xxx.xxx tag for new API
* we do not add API in service releases in order to comply with semantic versioning rules so you can do this on master but not on stable-4.9
