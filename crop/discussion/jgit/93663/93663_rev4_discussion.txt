DESCRIPTION

Make diff locations more consistent

DiffAlgorithms can return different edit locations for inserts or
deletes, if they can be "shifted" up or down repeating blocks of
lines. This causes the 3-way merge to apply both edits, resulting in
incorrectly removing or duplicating lines.

Augment an existing "tidy-up" stage in DiffAlgorithm to move all
shiftable edits (not just the last INSERT edit) to a consistent
location, and add test cases for previously incorrect merges.

Patch Set 4:

Hudson seems to be failing on a flaky test - is there a way for me to manually re-trigger it? (Otherwise, I can push a no-op change.)
