DESCRIPTION

Make trailing diff delete locations consistent

The 3-way merge was incorrectly removing deleted sections from both
sides, when only one of two repeating sections is deleted. This is
because the the diff step can inconsistently remove one section from
side, and the other section from the other side.

There fix augments the final "tidy-up" stage in DiffAlgorithm to apply
to both INSERTs and DELETEs to reduce this inconsistency, and provides
some test cases to verify the fix.
