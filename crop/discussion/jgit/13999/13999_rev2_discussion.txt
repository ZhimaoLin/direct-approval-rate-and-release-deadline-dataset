Thanks for taking care of these.

I tried getting the testsuite to automatically catch these before and ran into args4j exiting instead of throwing an exception when dumping usage. Maybe I should fix that. :)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> From a quick glance at least the rev-parse texts look ok. What's left to fix?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> actually the text looks good but when running jgit rev-parse -h I get an error instead of the usage text, I need to debug that
