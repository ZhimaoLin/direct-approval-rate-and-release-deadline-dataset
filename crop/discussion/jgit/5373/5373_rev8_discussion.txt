DESCRIPTION

Improve handling of checkout conflicts

This converts a checkout conflict exception into a RebaseResult /
MergeResult containing the conflicting paths, which enables EGit (or
others) to handle the situation in a user-friendly way

Patch Set 8:

Is it intentionally that you only fix Rebase? During Merge and even during Checkout we have the same situation and we may hit CheckoutConflictException.

Patch Set 8:

i fixed all locations where i stumbled upon the problem. there was one more (branching), but the changes don't apply there anymore, since branch creation changed, and it looks like this already handles such conflicts now. i'll have to do some more manual testing on this (where things behave wrong now).
