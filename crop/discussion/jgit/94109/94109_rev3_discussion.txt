DESCRIPTION

Only throw MissingObjectException when necessary

When preparing the bitmap, the flag ignoreMissingStart only applied to
the start object. However, sometime the start object is present but some
related objects are not present during the walk, we should only release
the MissingObjectException when the ignoreMissingStart is set false.

Some nits about the comment below. The code change does what it says on the cover.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> I don't think that's true. This is a normal condition that can occur when the client has declared a "have" that we no longer have.

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> Not may, will.

This returns very early. When it trips, a fetch that was intended to get a small incremental set of additional objects would end up sending the entire history, if I understand correctly.

This might be the right thing to do right now, on the assumption that an enormous response is better than an error and no response at all. But we need to follow up afterwards to fix it.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> I think all the haves will be catched over line 102. If we don't have it, we will catch it before we enter here.

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> Done
