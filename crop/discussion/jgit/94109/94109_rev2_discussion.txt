DESCRIPTION

Only throw MissingObjectException when necessary

When preparing the bitmap, the flag ignoreMissingStart only applied to
the start object. However, sometime the start object is present but some
related objects are not present during the walk, we should only release
the MissingObjectException when the ignoreMissingStart is set false.
