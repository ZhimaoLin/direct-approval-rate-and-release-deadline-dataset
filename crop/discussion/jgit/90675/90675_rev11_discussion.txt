DESCRIPTION

GC: run autoGC in background

When running an automatic GC on a FileRepository, when the caller
passes a NullProgressMonitor, fork off a new thread (per repository)
to run the GC in.

In some cases, the auto GC limit is lower than the true number of
unreachable loose objects, so auto GC will run after every (e.g) fetch
operation.  This leads to the appearance of poor fetch performance.
Since these GCs will never make progress (until either the objects
become referenced, or the two week timeout expires), blocking on them
simply reduces throughput.

In the event that an auto GC would make progress, it's still OK if it
runs in the background. The progress will still happen.

This matches the behavior of regular git.

If the user passes a ProgressMonitor that is not a NullProgressMonitor,
they might actually care about the progress of the GC, and would get
confused if that progress happened after the autoGC call returns, so we
run in the foreground in that case.

Git (and now jgit) uses the lock file for gc.log to prevent simultaneous
runs of background gc. Further, it writes errors to gc.log, and won't
run background gc if that file is present and recent. If gc.log is too
old (according to the config gc.logexpiry), it will be ignored.

Unfortunately, this change requires an API change.  The old GC.gc()
method had a return value of the newly-created pack files. Nobody
inside jgit used this, and I don't know why it would be useful. This
return value meant that running it in the background wouldn't work.
As a result, the interface to GC needs to change to provide a method
that can run in the background.

On request by the Gerrit community [1] we will move this change to 4.7 to allow releasing this with 4.7.1. This requires that we don't change public API since we follow semantic versioning. Fortunately this is possible.

I will upload a new patchset for stable-4.7 shortly

Line:650, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> this object should be created by GC itself, it knows if gc should run in the background so there is no need to do this in the code calling gc()

Line:656, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> could be inlined

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcLog.java -> this class needs reformatting, we use tabs for indentation

Line:177, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcLog.java -> use String here and convert to byte[] in this method

Line:256, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> there is no urgent need to add a new public method since the only caller FileRepository.autoGc() lives in the same package and we can tolerate if we get an empty collection if gc runs in the background

Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> we should use a Callable instead of a Runnable then we can later return a Future when the task is run in the background

Line:276, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> can be inlined

Line:1222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> this is not needed if we create the GcLog in this class if background is true

Line:1231, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> doesn't need to be public since the only caller FileRepository lives in the same package
