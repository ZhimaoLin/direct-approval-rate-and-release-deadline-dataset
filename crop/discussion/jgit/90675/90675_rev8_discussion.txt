DESCRIPTION

FileRepository.autoGC: run in background

When running an automatic GC on a FileRepository, when the caller
passes a NullProgressMonitor, fork off a new thread (per repository)
to run the GC in.

In some cases, the auto GC limit is lower than the true number of
unreachable loose objects, so auto GC will run after every (e.g) fetch
operation.  This leads to the appearance of poor fetch performance.
Since these GCs will never make progress (until either the objects
become referenced, or the two week timeout expires), blocking on them
simply reduces throughput.

In the event that an auto GC would make progress, it's still OK if it
runs in the background.  The progress will still happen.

This matches the behavior of regular git.

If the user passes a ProgressMonitor that is not a
NullProgressMonitor, they might actually care about the progress of
the GC, and would get confused if that progress happened after the
autoGC call returns, so we run in the foreground in that case.

Git (and now jgit) uses the lock file for gc.log to prevent
simultaneous runs of background gc.  Further, it writes errors to
gc.log, and won't run background gc if that file is present and
recent.  If gc.log is too old (according to the config gc.logexpiry),
it will be ignored.

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcLog.java -> what I tried
* using jgit version https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/90868/4 and egit current master
* cloned https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit
* deleted most branches and tags to generate a lot of garbage
* played with pruneexpire options 
* ran jgit gc a couple of times until garbage objects were stored as loose objects
* created a couple of merge commits to provoke triggering autogc

then I hit the following exception:
