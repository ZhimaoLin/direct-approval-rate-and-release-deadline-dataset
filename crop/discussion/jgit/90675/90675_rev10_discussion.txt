DESCRIPTION

GC: run autoGC in background

When running an automatic GC on a FileRepository, when the caller
passes a NullProgressMonitor, fork off a new thread (per repository)
to run the GC in.

In some cases, the auto GC limit is lower than the true number of
unreachable loose objects, so auto GC will run after every (e.g) fetch
operation.  This leads to the appearance of poor fetch performance.
Since these GCs will never make progress (until either the objects
become referenced, or the two week timeout expires), blocking on them
simply reduces throughput.

In the event that an auto GC would make progress, it's still OK if it
runs in the background. The progress will still happen.

This matches the behavior of regular git.

If the user passes a ProgressMonitor that is not a NullProgressMonitor,
they might actually care about the progress of the GC, and would get
confused if that progress happened after the autoGC call returns, so we
run in the foreground in that case.

Git (and now jgit) uses the lock file for gc.log to prevent simultaneous
runs of background gc. Further, it writes errors to gc.log, and won't
run background gc if that file is present and recent. If gc.log is too
old (according to the config gc.logexpiry), it will be ignored.

Unfortunately, this change requires an API change.  The old GC.gc()
method had a return value of the newly-created pack files. Nobody
inside jgit used this, and I don't know why it would be useful. This
return value meant that running it in the background wouldn't work.
As a result, the interface to GC needs to change to provide a method
that can run in the background.
