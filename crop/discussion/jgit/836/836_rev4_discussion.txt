DESCRIPTION

"Bare" Repository should not return working directory.

If a repository is "bare", it currently still returns a working directory.
This conflicts with the specification of "bare"-ness.

Patch Set 4: No score

I couldn't quite do this according to the pseudo code by Shawn, as the config API does not allow to check whether a value is "set" (you always have to provide a default value).
I hope this is correct anyway.

I like this better.  I added a hint about how to check if a variable was set in the configuration.

Line:1131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Javadoc should be updated to reflect this new exception.

Line:1147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Javadoc should be updated to reflect this new exception.

Line:1291, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> You can see if its set by doing:

  getConfig().getString("core",null,"bare") != null

and then later doing the getBoolean() if that was true.  Maybe  we should put that getString(...) != null into an isSet() method in Config to make this easier to test.

Line:1300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Even if core.worktree wasn't set in the configuration file, it might have been set by the caller of Repository.  We have like 8 forms of our constructor that takes various arguments... one of those is the work tree path, which could have come from an environment variable.
