DESCRIPTION

"Bare" Repository should not return working directory.

If a repository is "bare", it currently still returns a working directory.
This conflicts with the specification of "bare"-ness.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Sorry this is turning into a nightmare, but the corresponding code in git-core is equally disastrous.  For legacy reasons, you can't just trust core.bare (turns out, this is actually my fault in git-core).  Even modern repositories sometimes don't have core.bare set, e.g. the `repo` tool used by Android forcibly removes core.bare when it creates a new git repository and requires the fallback detection logic to be used.

Given the complexity of this logic, I wonder if we shouldn't add some unit tests to help validate that the behavior matches what we expect to occur under the various states.

Line:261, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Style-nit: Please don't nest a end-of-line // style comment inside of a method call in the middle of an if conditional.  It just feels so wrong...  I'd prefer to have this comment in the { } block part of the conditional instead.

Line:265, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I think the better approach here is:

 if (workTreeConfig != null) {
    workDir = fs.resolve(d, workTreeConfig);
 } else if (getConfig().getString("core", null, "bare") != null)) {
    if (getConfig().getBoolean("core", "bare", true))
      workDir = gitDir.getParentFile();
    else
      workDir = null;
 } else if (Constants.DOT_GIT.equals(gitDir.getName())) {
    workDir = gitDir.getParentFile();
 } else {
    workDir = null;
 }

No, its not pretty.  None of the "setup" code in git-core is sane.  Its a horrible mess that nobody likes to touch, because the algorithm is completely, utterly broken, but users just expect it to keep working like it has been.

Line:1323, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> With all of the logic in the constructor, I wonder if we can simplify this method down to:

  public boolean isBare() {
    return workDir == null;
  }

Line:265, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Thanks a lot for the code.
I believe it must be !getConfig().getBoolean... See next patch set.
