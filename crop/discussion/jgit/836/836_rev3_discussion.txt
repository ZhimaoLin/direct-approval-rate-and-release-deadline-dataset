If a repository is "bare", it currently still returns a working directory.
This conflicts with the specification of "bare"-ness.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:1282, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Please refer to my comments on patch set 1, same line, for why I don't think this is a sufficient test.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> Bleh.  This is going to turn into one very ugly constants file if we start to put every configuration key into it.

I'd rather pull these into specialized config related classes than start exporting them as part of our Constants class.
