DESCRIPTION

"Bare" Repository should not return working directory.

If a repository is "bare", it currently still returns a working directory.
This conflicts with the specification of "bare"-ness.

Patch Set 10: Looks good to me, approved; No score

OK, this looks fine to me now.  I think some of the tests are redundant, but I'm happy to submit it as-is.
