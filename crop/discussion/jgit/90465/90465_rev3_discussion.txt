DESCRIPTION

Reintroduce garbage pack coalescing when ttl > 0.

Disabling the garbage pack coalescing when garbageTtl > 0 can result in
lot of garbage packs if they are created within the garbageTtl time.

To avoid a large number of garbage packs, re-introducing garbage pack
coalescing for the packs that are created within a single calendar day
when the garbageTtl is more than one day or one third of the garbageTtl.

Now with Tests. 

Thanks Jonathan for showing the usage of SystemReader to mock the clock.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollectorTest.java -> You can use tick() for this:

 tick(1);
 return super.getCurrentTime();

Most TestRepository operations call tick on its mockSystemReader, which is a little more resilient (since it makes behavior change less based on the number of times getCurrentTime gets called). Can the TestRepository use this as their MockSystemReader?

 Repository db = new InMemoryRepository(desc);
 git = new TestRepository<>(db, new RevWalk(db), mockSystemReader);

Line:495, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollectorTest.java -> Thanks for this.

Thanks Jonathan and Shawn. PTAL ...

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollectorTest.java -> Done

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollectorTest.java -> I looked at how TestRespository is using it's mockSystemReader and how it's advancing the clock. I agree it's not required to move the time forward with every call to getCurrentTime() and it's sufficient to move it forward once for every gc operation here. I removed the ticks here and and moving the time forward in run(gc) method below.

Based on my understanding, I think it may not be a good idea to use the same mock for both TestRepository and GCCollector, as the TestRepository is using it's mock to move the commit times to move forward in controlled manner. And here we will be using the mock to move the pack last modified times forward. If we share the same mock between these two instances, the tests may loose ability of updating the times in a controlled manner (ex: tests in this class does not have any idea about how the time got updating in TestRepository).
