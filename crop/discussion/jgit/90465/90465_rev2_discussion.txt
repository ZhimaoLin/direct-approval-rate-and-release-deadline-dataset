DESCRIPTION

Reintroduce garbage pack coalescing when ttl > 0.

Disabling the garbage pack coalescing when garbageTtl > 0 can result in
lot of garbage packs if they are created within the garbageTtl time.

To avoid a large number of garbage packs, re-introducing garbage pack
coalescing for the packs that are created within a single calendar day
when the garbageTtl is more than one day or one third of the garbageTtl.
