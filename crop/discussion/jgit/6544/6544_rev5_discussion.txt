Line:434, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> isSmartHttp is designed to distinguish between servers that support smart HTTP *at all* and those that don't. Dumb HTTP servers will just serve the contents of the file called /info/refs when asked for /info/refs?service=foo.

Because you're adding a new service that is not supported by extant *smart* HTTP servers, the error handling may have to be a little different.

Of course, now that I've written that, I realize that extant servers (googlesource.com, kernel.org, github.com) just return 403, so there might not be a right answer here.

Line:813, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Nit: unnecessary blank line.
