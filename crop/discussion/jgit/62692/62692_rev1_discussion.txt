DESCRIPTION

Fix possible arithmetic overflow when setting a timeout

BasePackPushConnection#readStringLongTimeout() was setting a timeout 10
times bigger than some other timeout or the pack transfer time. This
could lead to negative integer values when we hit an arithmetic
overflow. Add a check for this situation and set the timeout to
Integer.MAX_VALUE when overflow happens.
