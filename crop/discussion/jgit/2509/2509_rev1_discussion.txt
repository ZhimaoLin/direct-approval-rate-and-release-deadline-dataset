DESCRIPTION

http.test: Delete badly named JUnit configurations

We also have org.eclipse.jgit.http--All-Tests, which matches the
style of the org.eclipse.jgit.core--All-Tests name. Drop the others
as these are just redundant duplicates.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

Seems fine to me. I hardly use the launch shortcuts.
