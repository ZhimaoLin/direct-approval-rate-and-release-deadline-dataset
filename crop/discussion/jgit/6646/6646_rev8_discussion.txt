DESCRIPTION

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Patch Set 8: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I removed a tests which I authored and which was not important for this specific issue. Now this change has according to lcp 243 lines. Markus gave his legal statement ... so in my eyes this is ready to be submitted.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> This has broken Gerrit Code Review. It looks like we are now adding a tree mode here, and the DirCacheEntry type doesn't accept that. You are missing a nonTree guard on the modeO flag.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Uff, right - that's a severe bug. That's frustrating: although 3 people reviewed it, although I spent much time on writing a big test for this (much more time than for the fix of course) and although this was tested in advance by real-world-non-jgit developers using egit to merge .... although all of this happened a very basic use case doesn't work: merging two unchanged subtrees.

When trying to fix this I wanted to write test which captures this bug. I found out that this is hard to reproduce with repos which have a real index. When merging with egit most people start with a c clean index and working tree: For each entry in ours we have an entry in the index and therefore we don't fall into this code block which is guarded with a "if (index == null)". In Gerrit we are always working with an in-core (in-memory) index which is initially always empty. I think that's why nobody detected this in advance.
