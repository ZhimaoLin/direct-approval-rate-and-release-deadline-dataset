DESCRIPTION

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Patch Set 5:

Mainly cleaned up the test case and increased the performance of this test. The test contained a lot of sleeps to avoid racily clean index entries. The number of sleeps have been reduced and the test runs faster.

I am more confident about this fix because I see that native git also goes the same direction to update the working tree first and the update the index (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01730.html).

One leftover is still not completely clear. Are there situations where we have to rollback modified working tree files in case while updating the working tree or the index we run into exceptions (e.g. can't update a locked working tree file)
