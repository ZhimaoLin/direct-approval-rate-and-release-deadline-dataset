DESCRIPTION

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Patch Set 2:

thanks robin; actually, i would have liked it very much to be able to re-use old index entries with stored values instead of asking the working tree iterator for them; is there a way to do this (a performant way of course ;))?

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

as already discussed: we definitely have a bug in how ResolveMerger creates DirCacheEntries. But blindly copying a for every entry metadata from the file to the dircache is wrong and not performant. I will contribue in a few hours one testcase which I am currently developing which already now shows the bug (unnecessary smugded entries after a merge). Also because of another problem discussed in http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01726.html I am developing more tests here.

But in general I think we found a more severe bug and I am happy to see the root cause of smudged entries. Better than trying to repair (unsmudge) the entries afterwards.
