DESCRIPTION

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Also add tests to make sure you get all the cases that matter.

Line:440, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Shouldn't we copy length and lastmodified here too?

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Can't see the reason for this extra line here. Doesn't fit the style.

Line:440, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I think we should simply copy from the previous index entry. In such a case where THEIRS brings nothing new we should do as minimal as we can do. Especially we should avoid filesystem access. Theoretically we could even have an index different from the working tree file and copying metadata from file to index entry would be wrong here.

Line:440, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> i think we should copy previous index entries wherever possible - i also think that getting metadata from files here is a really bad idea.
