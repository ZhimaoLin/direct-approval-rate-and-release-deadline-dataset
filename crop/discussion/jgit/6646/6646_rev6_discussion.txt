DESCRIPTION

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Patch Set 6:

just a minor change: calculate the DCE to keep() beforehand, as otherwise the test org.eclipse.jgit.notes.NoteMapMergerTest.testNonNotesWithoutNonNoteConflict() breaks (NullPointerEx. because index is null in that case).
