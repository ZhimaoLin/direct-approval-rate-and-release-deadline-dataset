DESCRIPTION

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

rebased and tested harder on Windows where we have problems with locked files & file deletions.

From my side the fix is ready to be submitted.

Do we need the explicit contributor statement for Markus?

Patch Set 7:

according to lcp this patch has 275 lines of code so we need to file a CQ here.

For all contributions from non-committers we always need the explicit contribution statements as a comment in Gerrit or in Bugzilla as described in [1]. This is also required for small patches < 250 LOC which don't need a CQ.

Patch Set 7:

Do we really need that? I wrote a big parts of this and only my last addition of test cases brought it over >250 lines. Markus asked in on a comment on patchset 2 from Jul 9 whether somebody wants to take over this change. Since he was the one who found the initial problem I didn't wanted to take over. But if this leads now to a CQ I ask myself:
- would it help if I takeover authorship. Markus is ok with that.
- would it help if I remove my last testcase additions and add them in a different change.
