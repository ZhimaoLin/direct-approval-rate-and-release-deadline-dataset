DESCRIPTION

Move ignore node handling into WorkingTreeIterator

The working tree iterator has perfect knowledge of the path structure
as well as immediate information about whether or not an ignore file
even exists at this level.  We can exploit that to simplify the
logic and running time for testing ignored file status by pushing
all of the checks down into the iterator itself.

This is an RFC, the changes cause IgnoreCacheTest to fail to compile.

Patch Set 1:

Thanks for the suggestion, I will take a look at reimplementing the tests, etc. with your patches.

Might need to make a slight change to the logic so NOT_IGNORED breaks instead of returns. I documented this case on my Eclipse wiki talk page, but if the folder "/a" is ignored then the file "/a/file.c" might be ignored even if it is expressly set as NOT_IGNORE by its local .gitignore file. Perhaps this would be naturally resolved by the order in which nodes are parsed? I will test.
