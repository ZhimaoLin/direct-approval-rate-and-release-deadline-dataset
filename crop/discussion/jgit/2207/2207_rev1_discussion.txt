DESCRIPTION

NoteMap implements Iterable<Note>

We will need to iterate over all notes of a NoteMap, at least this will be
needed for testing purposes. This change also implied making the Note class
public.

Two minor nits, but we can address them later.

Line:61, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/Note.java -> We probably should go ahead and make the constructor public.

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/Note.java -> We also need to make this public.  Otherwise the client of the Iterator<Note> cannot see the blob that is attached to the note.

Line:61, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/Note.java -> Hmm.. how would that fit with the:

 public void set(AnyObjectId noteOn, ObjectId noteData)

from the NoteMap interface? Should this method then become

 public void add(Note note)

Line:66, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/notes/Note.java -> Actually, when splitting the old commit I by mistake did this change in the wrong commit i.e. in the commit where the note merge was done.
