Much more pleasant reading than the first patches

Line:240, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> It seems these two paths could be one

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> No quotes here

Line:106, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> I think you can leave out the speculations here.
As I understand it recursive strategy with multiple tips is NOT an octopus, but rather a repeated sequence of merges. Octopus is its own strategy.

Line:215, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> "too many bases" repeated and not translated

Line:336, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> repated, too many bases

Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> Syntax error. missing words.
Line breaks missing.

Line:424, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> nit: no try/finally but you can keep a oneline (//) comment on the
cleanup if you want to

Line:593, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> nit: extra empty line

Line:610, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> nit: extra empty line

Line:899, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> whitespace error

Line:910, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> only indent one tab

Line:49, SUBMITTING_PATCHES -> Good, note, but belongs in another commit
nit-pick: trailing spaces

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergeStrategy.java -> Indent

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> what is this text "TOO_MANY_BASES" good for ?

Line:382, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> nit: use // for one line comments

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> s/Headone/Head one/

s/Headtwo/Head two/
