Patch Set 9:

so rename detection would be an issue for the processEntry of the resolve merge, right? cgit's recursive merge does have rename detection ;) this would be one of the more important features i think (but is also add-able after this change ofc).

Patch Set 9:

The behaviour of processEntry has not changed with respect to any name change detection. If it did not do it before, it still has that limitation. I re-used it, so if it has that functionality added for the ResolveMerger, it may be directly usable for the RecursiveMerger

Patch Set 9:

The new algorithms in RecursiveMerger (especially the calculation of a mergeBase in case we have multiple commono ancestors) are not tested yet. I'll add a test with a criss-cross merge setup where we first time test the new functionality of RecursiveMerger
