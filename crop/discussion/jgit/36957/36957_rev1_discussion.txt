DESCRIPTION

Deprecate checkoutEntry without ObjectReader

Callers should manage the ObjectReader, as this allows the JGit library to cache
context relevant information across files checked out at the same time. If the
caller only has one file to checkout, it should still explicitly manage the life
span of the ObjectReader.
