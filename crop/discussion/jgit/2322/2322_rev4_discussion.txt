DESCRIPTION

Add graft/replace support

Grafts replace parent during history walking. Instead of using the
parents encoded in the commit, replacement are looked up in the
.git/info/grafts file.

The format of the grafts file is very simple. It consists of zero
or more lines of SHA-1's separated by spaces. The first SHA-1 is
a commit id and the rest is the new parents.

By default grafts are followed for RevWalk.

The parents that were reached using grafts are marked as such, ...think

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Doing the replacement i only RevWalk is not enough.
Should i fix the ObjectReaders instead?

Patch Set 4:

Implementing grafts seems simple and non-instrusive, while general replacement needs changes all over the place, especially if we want to enable it on a per thread basis. Using ThreadLocal seems kind-o-dirty
