DESCRIPTION

RFC: Add graft/replace support

not working, but a hint of what I'm trying to do...

Grafts replace parent during history walking. Instead of using the
parents encoded in the commit, replacement are looked up in the
.git/info/grafts file.

The format of the grafts file is very simple. It consists of zero
or more lines of SHA-1's separated by spaces. The first SHA-1 is
a commit id and the rest is the new parents.

By default grafts and replacements are enabled. Callers that want
to not use grafts must use an instance of DelegatedRepository that
removes the replacements.

The parents that were reached using grafts are marked as such, ...think
