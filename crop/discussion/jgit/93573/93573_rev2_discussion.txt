DESCRIPTION

Fix flaky test

The order that getRequests() returns requests is not well-defined,
so testListRemote would fail approximately 50% of the time.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I can't reproduce these failures, I used RepeatRule to repeat these tests 2000 times but they didn't fail

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> On reflection, it's pretty weird that the order is arbitrary.    I have no idea how that can happen.  But nonetheless, locally, on master, I do get these failures, and this patch does fix them.  I'm open to other suggestions about how to fix it, or how to reliably reproduce it.  

My config:
Apache Maven 3.3.9
openjdk version "1.8.0_121"
Debian

Sorry for the unhelpful message.  This change was abandoned automatically by a script, and due to operator error the correct message was not added.

It should have read:  "Abandoning after 3 months of inactivity.  If this change is still needed, please restore it."
