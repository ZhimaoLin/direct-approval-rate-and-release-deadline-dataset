DESCRIPTION

Introduce hook support into the FS implementations

This introduces the background plumbing necessary to run git hooks from
JGit. This implementation will be OS-dependent as it aims to be
compatible with existing hooks, mostly written in Shell. It is
compatible with unix systems and windows as long as an Unix emulator
such as Cygwin is in its PATH.
