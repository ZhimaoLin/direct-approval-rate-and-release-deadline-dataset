DESCRIPTION

smart HTTP server: Pass along "want X not valid" to client

If the client sends a SHA-1 that the server does not recognize echo
this back to the client with an explicit error message instead of
the generic "internal server error".

This was always the intent of the implementation but it was being
dropped on smart HTTP due to the UploadPackServlet catching the
PackProtocolException, discarding the buffered message UploadPack
meant to send, and sending along a generic message instead.
