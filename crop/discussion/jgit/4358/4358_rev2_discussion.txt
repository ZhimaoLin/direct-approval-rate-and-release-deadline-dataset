Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

Previously this change was based on #4345. I would like to get this change instead of change #4345. I reordered Robin's changes so that we don't need #4345 anymore.

Robin, if you would change the commit message (remove RFC,...) we can accept this one.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> This change is good. Robin, could you update the commit message (remove RFC, better description) so we can accept it.
