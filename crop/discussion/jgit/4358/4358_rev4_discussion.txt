DESCRIPTION

Fix bad checkout behaviour when a file is removed

We deleted the entry if there was a file and an index
entry, but not when there was just an index entry. Now
delete the file in both cases since the missing file
just means our worktree is dirty. This affected the
implementation of reset --hard.
