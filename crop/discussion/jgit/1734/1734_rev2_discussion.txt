DESCRIPTION

Add Cherry-Pick command

Implemented the initial version of a cherry-pick command.
A correct error handling is missing (what happens if the
checkout fails, the cherry-pick leads to conflicts etc).
But straightforward cherry-picks works.

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/errors/InvalidCherryPickCommit.java -> I think this isn't the best class name for this meaning of an error.  Maybe call it MulitpleParentsNotSupportedException?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> Style-nit: Constructors should appear before instance methods.

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> lookupCommit assumes the thing is a commit.  That should be true, but someone may have manually done something in the repository to make HEAD be a non-commit.

You should use parseCommit here and take the parsing hit in order to ensure the new parent is actually a commit.  Otherwise we might create a corrupt object where a parent points to something that isn't a commit if HEAD was mangled externally.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> FWIW, there is a use case for cherry-picking commits with more than one parent.  Its called reverting (or replaying) a merge.  In those cases the caller needs to tell us what parent to compare against as an input argument.

I don't know how you will implement revert, but keep in mind we will want to come back here and optionally support a different parent when there are more than 1 parents involved.

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> You missed changing this:

  revWalk.parseHeaders(srcCommit.getParent(0))

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CherryPickCommand.java -> Thanks for fixing; this is better.
