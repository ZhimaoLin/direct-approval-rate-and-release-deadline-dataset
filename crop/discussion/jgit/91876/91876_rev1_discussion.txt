DESCRIPTION

Update Jetty to 9.4.1.v20170120 in buck build

5e8e2179b218ede7d14b69dc5149b0691b5859cf (Update Jetty to
9.4.1.v201470120, 2017-01-26) updated Jetty in the maven build.
Update the buck build to match so buck builds work again.

The buck build will go away soon, but in the meantime (until
the bazel build gets the same level of support) it is convenient as a
faster way of running tests than using maven.
