DESCRIPTION

Get rid of a duplicate constant for SHA-1 length

Since Constants.OBJECT_ID_LENGTH is a compile time constant we
can be sure that it will always be inlined. The same goes for the
associated constant STR_LEN which is now refactored to the Constant
class and given a name better suited for wider use.

Patch Set 10: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

Personally I prefer patch set 9, but I can split out the other replacements and submit separately if you want to go with 10.
