DESCRIPTION

Clarify the definition of AnyObjectId.RAW_LEN

This value should always be 20, and should always match with
Constants.OBJECT_ID_LENGTH.  Hardcode the constant to 20 to
support inlining, but check at class load time that the value
in Constants still matches our assumptions.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

This might be a better way to clean up the code, as we can now inline the value anytime its referenced.

Patch Set 2: No score

Your explanations make it clearer to me thank you.

1. Should we put them into the code?
2. What still acts as nails on the blackboard of my soul is the dead code warning eclipse throws at me.
What would help is replacing this with an assert statement.
Advantage no. 1: The warning would be gone :) (I am sorry but it weighs rather heavily on my mind.
2. it would still act as an ensurance that your assumptions further down the line are correct.
