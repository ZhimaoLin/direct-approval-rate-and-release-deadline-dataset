DESCRIPTION

Get rid of a duplicate constant for SHA-1 length

Since Constants.OBJECT_ID_STRING_LENGTH is a compile time constant we
can be sure that it will always be inlined. The same goes for the
associated constant STR_LEN which is now refactored to the Constant
class and given a name better suited for wider use.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

For whatever reason the JUnit tests run two seconds faster now.
