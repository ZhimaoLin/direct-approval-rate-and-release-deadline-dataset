DESCRIPTION

Get rid of a duplicate constant for SHA-1 length

Since Constants.OBJECT_ID_LENGTH is a compile time constant we
can be sure that it will always be inlined. The same goes for the
associated constant STR_LEN which is now refactored to the Constant
class and given a name better suited for wider use.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> Style-nit: We don't use <br>, but we instead use \n<p>\n to break the line:

  /**
   * A Git object hash is 160 bits, i.e. 20 bytes.
   * <p>
   * Changing that is not going to be as easy as changing this declaration.
   */
