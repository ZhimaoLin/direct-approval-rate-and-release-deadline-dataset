DESCRIPTION

Use limited getCachedBytes in RevWalk

Parsing is rewritten to use the size limited form of getCachedBytes,
thus freeing the revwalk infrastructure from needing to care about
a large object vs. a small object when it gets an ObjectLoader.

Right now we hardcode our upper bound for a commit or annotated
tag to be 15 MiB.  I don't know of any that is more than 1 MiB in
the wild, so going 15x that should give us some reasonable headroom.

Looks fine, I'll push another change to use STREAM_THRESHOLD unless you have an objection.

Line:238, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> We should probably use ObjectLoader.STREAM_THRESHOLD to make this a little bit mysterious when looking at the code... keep it all in one place.
