DESCRIPTION

Use limited getCachedBytes in RevWalk

Parsing is rewritten to use the size limited form of getCachedBytes,
thus freeing the revwalk infrastructure from needing to care about
a large object vs. a small object when it gets an ObjectLoader.

Right now we hardcode our upper bound for a commit or annotated
tag to be 15 MiB.  I don't know of any that is more than 1 MiB in
the wild, so going 15x that should give us some reasonable headroom.
