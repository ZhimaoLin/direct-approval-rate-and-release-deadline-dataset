Patch Set 3:

Just a warning: don't start using the new method assertEqualsFile() everywhere. This method is hiding from you whether you a looking at a.txt or a symbolic link to a.txt (hiding that is the main purpose of the new method). For the gitdir it's ok, but for files inside the git working tree you often want that a symbolic link to a.txt is treated different from a.txt.
