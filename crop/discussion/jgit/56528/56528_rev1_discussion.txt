DESCRIPTION

Set repository also in subtree WorkingTreeIterators

WorkingTreeIterator has a field referencing the repository it's
iterating. When creating an iterator for a subtree of an existing
iterator this field wasn't set in the subtree iterator. This seems
inconsistent and makes accessing the repository from a subtree iterator
unnecessarily complex. This will be used to fix bug 478148 in
Ic123849ec6dd66e5bec6453152f428a0566149f4.
