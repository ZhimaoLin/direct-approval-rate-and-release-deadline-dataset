DESCRIPTION

[RFC] archive: Record executables and symlink bits

Setting the mode for a zip entry is now as simple as
"entry.setUnixMode(mode)", so do that.

The test checks using the system's "zipinfo" command (from InfoZIP)
that the mode has been recorded correctly on systems that happen to
have a "zipinfo" command, using org.junit.Assume to distinguish them.
