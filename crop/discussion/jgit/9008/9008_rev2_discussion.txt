DESCRIPTION

[RFC] archive: Record executables and symlink bits

Setting the mode for a zip entry is now as simple as
"entry.setUnixMode(mode)", so do that.

The test checks using the system's "zipinfo" command (from InfoZIP)
that the mode has been recorded correctly on systems that happen to
have a "zipinfo" command, using org.junit.Assume to distinguish them.

Thanks. A few other changes since v2:

 * small typofixes in change descriptions
 * remembered to actually list the packages being used in org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF (can this check be automated when testing with Maven?)
 * style fixes suggested in your review

Thoughts of all kinds welcome, as always.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done. :)
