DESCRIPTION

Mark non-externalizable strings as such

A few classes such as Constanrs are marked xxx@xxx.xxx as are
toString() methods with many liternal, but otherwise $NLS-n$ is used for
string containing text that should not be translated. A few literals may
fall into the gray zone, but mostly I've tried to only tag the obvious
ones.
