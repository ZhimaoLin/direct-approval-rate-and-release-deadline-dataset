Line:269, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.java -> You need to keep this translation for the WalkPushConnection.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/WalkPushConnection.java -> There is no message here, this class is the one executing the command. It wants to say funnyRefname as the message. So this one is correct in the old version.
