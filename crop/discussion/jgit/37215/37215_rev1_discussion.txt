DESCRIPTION

Deprecate checkoutEntry variant that accepts File

Entries should only be written to the working tree managed by the
Repository. Simplify callers by passing only the entry and computing
the work tree location inside of the checkoutEntry method.

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Was there a specific reason to change the order of steps? Previously we first updated files and then deleted others and now it is reversed.

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> The old checkout code deleted a directory if it overlapped with a file. That no longer happens.

I assume that if we are merging from "src/foo" existing to "src" as a file, "src/foo" and "src" are listed in toBeDeleted and "src" is in toBeCheckedOut.

By running toBeDeleted first we remove "src/foo" and then "src" successfully, and now toBeCheckedOut doesn't have to rmdir "src" in order to create "src" as a file.

This is the better way to handle the directory-to-file switch. If things go wrong, the switch will fail and the merge will abort.
