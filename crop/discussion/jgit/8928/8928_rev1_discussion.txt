(2 inline comments)

- looks good, but I think we should rather fix the observed problems instead of adding ignored tests

Patch Set 1:

Thanks, Matthias. I authored 100% of the content I've contributed so far to JGit and have authorization from Google to donate it to Eclipse under the Eclipse Distribution License (EDL, http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.html), which is a 3-clause BSD-style license.

I agree that we should fix args4j or our use of it to make testing easier and included the xxx@xxx.xxx tests to make the issue clearer to people reading the codebase until that happens. Should they be dropped?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Unfortunately Eclipse IP rules still require that contributors who are not committers have to assert these contribution statements for every change they contribute. Though hopefully until end of this year this policy will be replaced by using git Signed-off-by footers for this purpose, hopefully EMO accepts this proposed improvement [1].

I didn't recognize that the ignored tests fail due to an args4j problem, in that case I am fine to ignore these tests for now. Could you file a bug for args4j to track the problem ?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I get "Access Restriction" errors after fetching the change. Haven't you forgot to add org.eclipse.jgit.dircache to imported packages.
