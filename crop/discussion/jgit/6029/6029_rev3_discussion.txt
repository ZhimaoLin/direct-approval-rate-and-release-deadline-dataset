DESCRIPTION

Prevent finding wrong refs on case insensitive file systems

If multiple refs existed in a repository which are not distinguishable
on a case insensitive file system we found and returned a ref with the
wrong case since the file system tricked us.

This leads to an infinite loop in EGit if a repository has two tags
which are only different in case. We found that CDT's repository hits
this problem with the tags refs/tags/cdt_8_0 and refs/tags/CDT_8_0. The
RepositoryChangeScanner calling RefDirectory.getRefs("") doesn't see
refs/tags/cdt_8_0 while RepositoriesViewLabelProvider.getStyledText()
calling RefDirectory.getRef("cdt_8_0") finds this tag since new
File(parent, name) also matches a file with name CDT_8_0 having the
wrong case on case insensitive file systems. This leads to refsChanged
events being fired in both cases which implies the observed infinite
loop driven by the periodically running RepositoryChangeScanner. Since
refsChanged events lead to recomputation of IndexDiff this is consuming
a lot of resources.

Patch Set 3:

Maybe we should instead warn about double cased refs when they are written or provide a separate command to check portability of a repository (also double cased file paths are problematic if some developers of a project are using a case insensitive file system).

Patch Set 3:

Isn't C Git also detecting this per file system. Btw, we
don't have case-insensitivty support currently, and when we get it, it should be unicode-aware unless prohibitatively expensive. C Git only does this for ASCII.

Patch Set 3:

We could perform a compatibility scan of the repo at some points, e.g. share where we could flag things like incompatibilities like this, wierd filenames ISO-latin vs UTF-8, impossible file names etc.

Patch Set 3:

The collission is between a tag and a branch, e.g. between refs/heads/cdt_8_0 and refs/tags/cdt_8_0, though we don't use them that way internally.
