DESCRIPTION

Prevent finding wrong refs on case insensitive file systems

If multiple refs existed in a repository which are not distinguishable
on a case insensitive file system we found and returned a ref with the
wrong case since the file system tricked us. 

This leads to an infinite loop in EGit if a repository has two tags
which are only different in case. We found that CDT's repository hits
this problem with the tags refs/tags/cdt_8_0 and refs/tags/CDT_8_0. The
RepositoryChangeScanner calling RefDirectory.getRefs("") doesn't see
refs/tags/cdt_8_0 while RepositoriesViewLabelProvider.getStyledText() 
calling RefDirectory.getRef("cdt_8_0") finds this tag since new
File(parent, name) also matches a file with name CDT_8_0 having the
wrong case on case insensitive file systems. This leads to refsChanged
events being fired in both cases which implies the observed infinite
loop driven by the periodically running RepositoryChangeScanner. Since
refsChanged events lead to recomputation of IndexDiff this is consuming
a lot of resources.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

For a networked file system the difference may be huge, but for local files systems the overhead seems neglible, even with cold cache (On OS X).

Patch Set 2: No score

Does not work if the repo path is via a symbolic link. No loose refs will be read.

Performance: 5-10% worse access on Apple's JDK wih 5000 loose refs (e.g. refs/changes). Better on OpenJDK (OSX too). Need If08f8e7b8ef94ec00023a3f78bbf502ebd9699fb for OpenJDK testing.

Maybe fixing the refs-changed logic can be done some other way and as for really handling doublecased refs on a case-insensitive FS that will still not work. We'll just be surprised differently. An option would be to always pack perhaps, though that is not enough.
