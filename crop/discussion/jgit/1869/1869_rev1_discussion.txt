DESCRIPTION

Format JGitText so that it can be edited with the current formatter settings

The code formatter settings will put the comments in a separate line
when adding members to JGitText. This formats the class so that the
existing code is consistent with the code formatter settings.
This is a formatting-only change.

Line:61, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/JGitText.java -> I'm not sure I'm happy with this.  The current file is neatly organized, one string name per line.  The new formatting is 3 lines per string.  Ugh.

I just undo the code formatter on save.  So my fingers now do "Ctrl-S Ctrl-Z" when editing this file.
