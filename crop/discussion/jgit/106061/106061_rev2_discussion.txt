DESCRIPTION

Suppress "Unlikely argument type for equals()" warnings in tests

This new warning was introduced in Eclipse 4.7 Oxygen [1].

The only instances of the warning are in test code that is asserting
that some class does not compare equal to Strings. As in the Gerrit
project [2] these asserts are arguably overkill, but arguably also
a reasonable test of an equals implementation. Ignore the warning in
these cases.

Note that if the project is opened in an earlier version of Eclipse,
a warning xxx@xxx.xxx will be emitted.

Patch Set 2:

I don't see these warning when opening the jgit projects using Oxygen.1 [1], so I am not sure if this is needed. 

[1] I used the following version:

Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers
Version: Oxygen.1 Release (4.7.1)
Build id: 20170914-1200

Patch Set 2:

I'm using 4.7.0

I'll see if the warnings go away if I upgrade to 4.7.1.

 Version: Oxygen.1a Release (4.7.1a)
 Build id: 20171005-1200
 OS: Mac OS X, v.10.12.6, x86_64 / cocoa

and I still see the warnings.
