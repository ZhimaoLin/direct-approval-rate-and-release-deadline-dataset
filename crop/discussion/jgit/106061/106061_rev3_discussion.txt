DESCRIPTION

Suppress "Unlikely argument type for equals()" warnings in tests

This new warning was introduced in Eclipse 4.7 Oxygen [1].

The only instances of the warning are in test code that is asserting
that some class does not compare equal to Strings. As in the Gerrit
project [2] these asserts are arguably overkill, but arguably also
a reasonable test of an equals implementation. Ignore the warning in
these cases.

Note that if the project is opened in an earlier version of Eclipse,
a warning xxx@xxx.xxx will be emitted.
