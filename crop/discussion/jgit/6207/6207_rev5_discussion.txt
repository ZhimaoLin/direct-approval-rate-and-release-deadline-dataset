Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> I think that having specialized exceptions in both the method signature and javadoc is redundant. This is what I guess John meant too. Anyway in this particular method, the lists of exceptions in throws and javadoc do not match.

In general I like this. Only one typo and one missing exception in a signature should be fixed.

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> I like the proposal of Robin and don't think we have to remove this redundancy. Here are my points:

- Which subclasses of GitAPIException may be thrown by a specific command is so important that I like every API user to know the specific checked exceptions which can occur. We have >20 GitAPIExceptions and most commands throw only very few of them. Having it in javadoc and in the signature makes it harder to overlook. 

- There is a difference in having it only in javadoc than in javadoc&signature: When programming Eclipse then Eclipse helps you to handle all relevant exceptions. If you have written down the call to the JGit API and then trigger Quick-Fixes (Ctrl-1) Eclipse can automatically create catch clauses for the exceptions in the signature. If you have described the possible exceptions only in javadoc then the quickfix will only create a catch for GitApiExceptions.

Of course we should fix that javadoc and signature doesn't match. Please add TransportException to the signature.
