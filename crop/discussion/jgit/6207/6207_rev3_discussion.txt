Line:148, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommand.java -> We do not need to add TransportException to the signature since GitAPIException is already there.

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommand.java -> We could remove all exceptions that extend GitAPIException from the signature.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> We could remove all exceptions that extend GitAPIException from the method signature

Patch Set 3:

The redundant exception subclasses in the throws clauses aren't needed, but it can be useful to have some kind of documentation of the specific subclasses that can be thrown by a given method (and why). I would just xxx@xxx.xxx for this because it gives you room to add an explanation in cases where it is not obvious.
