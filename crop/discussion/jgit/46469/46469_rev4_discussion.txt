Patch Set 4:

(2 comments)

Rebased and fixed two issues.

Line:805, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> in case second rename happens, first exception will be hidden. Original version has always thrown an exception.

Please check the fixed version in the next patch set.

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LockFile.java -> since 4.2 (fixed)

Patch Set 4:

> I don't know which filesystems don't support atomic move, the
 > filesystems we tried all support atomic move

At least we have the test FileUtils7Test#testAtomicMove which unconditionally fails if ATOMIC_MOVE is not supported. Means we can easily check that os&filesystem for the current directory (where you start the tests) supports atomic move inside this directory. I have not yet seen this test failing but the problem is that we may not have tried this test on all os&filesystem. I guess it fails especially when you move a file from one filesystem into another but I don't think JGit does renames into different folders. I personally tried Windows/NTFS, SUSE/NFS, Ubuntu/Ext4 and they succeeded. But I know that people are also trying to use JGit on z/OS and I have no idea how ATOMIC_MOVE behaves here (or whether we want to support this)
