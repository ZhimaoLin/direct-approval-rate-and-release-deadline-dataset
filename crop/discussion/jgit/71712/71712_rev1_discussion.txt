DESCRIPTION

Fix StashApply regarding handling of untracked files

There was a bug regarding how JGit handled untracked files when applying
a stash. Problem was that untracked files are applied by doing a merge
of HEAD and untrackedFiles commit with a merge base of the stashed HEAD.
That's wrong because the untrackedFiles commit has no parent and
contains only the untracked files. Using stashed HEAD as merge base
leads to unneccessary conflicts on files not event included in the
untrackedFiles commit.

Imagine this graph directly before you want to apply a stash which was
based on 0. You want to apply the stash on current HEAD commit 5.

  5 (HEAD,master)
 /
0---+
 \   \
  1---3 (WIP on master)
     /
    2 (untracked files on master)

Imagine for a specific (tracked) file f
- commit 0 contains X
- HEAD contains Y
- commit 2 (the untracked files) does not contain file f

A merge of 2 and 5 with a merge base of 0 leads to a conflict. The 5
commit wants to modify the file and the 2 commit wants to delete the
file -> conflict.

If no merge base is set then the semantic is correct.

Thanks to Bow for finding this bug and providing the test case.

Thanks for considering me to review the change. Your reasoning makes sense to me. When in doubt, I replay the scenario with native Git, but I guess you already did that.

I find the test case difficult to read (see my comments there) and moreover misplaced. Wouldn't it be closer to the unit under test if it was rewritten to merely construct the history that results when pulling and placed in StashApplyCommandTest?

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommandTest.java -> The first line that matters is writeToFile( ... ). If checking that there is nothing to update is really necessary it should be part of setUp().

Line:214, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommandTest.java -> Isn't here an assertion missing that the untracked file is actually in the state it should be?

yes, I did.

Right. If I would have written that test on my own it would be placed
somewhere else. But in this case a user of JGit added his own test to
PullCommandTest [1] where he replayed exactly the problem he was facing
in real life. I like tests which replay real-world bugs. Therefore I
wanted that test to in and copied it. And I was to lazy to add an
additional low level unit test.
