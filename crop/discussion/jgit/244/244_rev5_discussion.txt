DESCRIPTION

Generate an Eclipse IP log with jgit eclipse-iplog

The new plugin contains the bulk of the logic to scan a Git repository,
and query IPZilla, in order to produce an XML formatted IP log for the
requested revision of any Git based project.  This plugin is suitable
for embedding into a servlet container, or into the Eclipse workbench.

The command line pgm package knows how to invoke this plugin through
the eclipse-iplog subcommand, permitting storage of the resulting
log as a local XML file.

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit.iplog/src/org/eclipse/jgit/iplog/CSV.java -> No, we can't rename it readLines(), because it reads exactly one line and returns it.  The values in the list are the columns on that read line.

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit.iplog/src/org/eclipse/jgit/iplog/CSV.java -> can we name this method readLines() to make clear it reads not just a single line
