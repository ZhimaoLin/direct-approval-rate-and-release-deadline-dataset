DESCRIPTION

Generate an Eclipse IP log with jgit eclipse-iplog

The new plugin contains the bulk of the logic to scan a Git repository,
and query IPZilla, in order to produce an XML formatted IP log for the
requested revision of any Git based project.  This plugin is suitable
for embedding into a servlet container, or into the Eclipse workbench.

The command line pgm package knows how to invoke this plugin through
the eclipse-iplog subcommand, permitting storage of the resulting
log as a local XML file.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I'm reasonably happy with the code at this point.  It produces  a format Wayne seems to find acceptable.  I wish the committer data from Gerrit was a bit cleaner to load and process, but that will take some work on the Gerrit side to make exports easier.

Patch Set 3: No score; No score

Considering the size of this patch we should (maybe later) add some tests. On a first glance this looks ok, I will do some testing tomorrow.
