Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> I don't think we want to zero here? PackWriter runs 2 invocations of findObjects(); one for "have" and another for "want".

By clearing the counter we only report the last. Is that correct?

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapWalker.java -> s/public//

This type is not visible, so the methods aren't visible even if you declared them public. In such cases we avoid public to make it less confusing.

Line:2174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx 4.0
