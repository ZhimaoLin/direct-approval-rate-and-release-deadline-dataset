DESCRIPTION

Add merge algorithm

Adds the merge alorithm and tests for merge to jgit. The merge algorithm in
MergeAlgorithm.java will
- get as input parameters the common base, the two new contents called "ours" and "theirs"
- compute the Edits from base to ours and from base to theirs with the help of MyersDiff
- iterate over the edits
-- independent edits from ours or from theirs will just be applied to the result
-- for conflicting edits I first harmonize the ranges of the edits so that in the end we
   have exactly two edits starting and ending at the same points in the common base. Then
   write the two conclicting contents into the result
