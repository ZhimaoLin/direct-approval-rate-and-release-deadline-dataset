This doesn't seem to interact well with https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+/e3f19a5298acb67848966f6ba192f3a88abdce72/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java#984. Should escapeValue get an inquote parameter to allow the caller to tell it we are already in quotes?

I do not want to complicate escapeValue further. I would much prefer teaching JGit to parse "foo bar\nbaz", which is what C git emits. Then we can emit that escaped representation from escapeValue, which will be much simpler.

I missed the part where that usage is for escaping subsection names.

IMHO it's a bug to use escapeValue for subsection names, which have their own semantics. For example, they can't contain newlines at all, so escapeValue's current absurd newline escaping will wholly break the config file.
