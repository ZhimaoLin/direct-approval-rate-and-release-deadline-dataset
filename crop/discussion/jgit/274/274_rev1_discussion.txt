DESCRIPTION

Intermediate workaround for JGit's lack of core.autocrlf support

Windows users by default have core.autocrlf set to true. JGit
does not recognize the flags and thus works as if it is set. In order
to make JGit more compatible with msysgit we set the flag to false
in repositories that JGit creates.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

Yea, we should do this.  I'm holding back on +2 for someone who actually cares about Windows though.  :-)
