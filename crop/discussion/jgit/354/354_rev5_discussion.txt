DESCRIPTION

Add a paranoid 'must be provided' option to ReceivePack

By default a receive pack assumes that its user will only provide
references to objects that the user already has access to on their
local client.  In certain cases, an additional check to verify the
references point only to reachable objects is necessary.

This additional checking is useful when the code doesn't trust
the client not to provide a forged SHA-1 reference to an object,
in an attempt to access parts of the DAG that they weren't allowed
to see by the configured RefFilter.
