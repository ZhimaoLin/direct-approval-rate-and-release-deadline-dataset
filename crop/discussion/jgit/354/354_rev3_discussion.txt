DESCRIPTION

Adds a paranoid 'must be provided' option to ReceivePack

    By default, a receive pack assumes that its user will only provide
    references to objects that it can see. In certain cases, an additional
    check that verifies that the objects that were provided are reachable
    by a tree or a commit that the user can see is necessary.

    For example, it is useful when the code doesn't trust the client not
    to provide a forged SHA-1 reference to an object in an attempt to
    access parts of the DAG that they weren't allowed to see by the
    configured RefFilter.
