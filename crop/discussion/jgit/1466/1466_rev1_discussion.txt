Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:158, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> Style-nit: The curly braces aren't necessary.

I'm going to cherry-pick this directly onto master, its a simple bug fix that I don't want to be held up on the DIRC version 3 code.
