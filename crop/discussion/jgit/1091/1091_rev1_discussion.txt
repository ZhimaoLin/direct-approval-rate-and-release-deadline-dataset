DESCRIPTION

Added file size based rename detection optimization

Prior to this change, files that were very different in size (enough
so that they could not have enough in common to be detected as
renames) were still having their scores calculated. I added an
optimization to skip such files. For example, if the rename detection
threshold is 60%, the larger file is 200kb, and the smaller file is
50kb, the pair cannot be counted as a rename since they cannot
possibly share 60% of their content in common. (200*.6=120, 120>50)

Line:256, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityRenameDetector.java -> I find this awkward way to phrase the condition.  Elsewhere we talk about the common * 100 / max, so why not do the same here?

  min * 100 / max < renameScore
