DESCRIPTION

DeltaWindow.delta: Do not abort search when an object of the wrong type is encountered

Problem:
  DeltaWindow.delta returns NEXT_RES when an object of the wrong type is encountered.
  As a result the search for delta candidates is aborted. Unfortunately, if a good
  candidate was found earlier, it is discarded, missing out a delta compression
  opportunity.

Solution:
  Let DeltaWindow.delta return NEXT_SRC, to allow the search for candidates to
  continue.

Added two test cases to PackWriterTest where PackConfig.setDeltaCompress is
set to true, but PackConfig.setReuseDeltas is not.
