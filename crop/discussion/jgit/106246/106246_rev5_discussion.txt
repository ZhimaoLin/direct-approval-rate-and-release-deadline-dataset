DESCRIPTION

Use a new RevWalk for validating not advertised wants

Shadow commits in the RevWalk in the UploadPack object may cause the
UNINTERESTING flag not being carried over to their parents commits since
they were marked NO_PARENTS during the assumeShallow or
initializeShallowCommits call.

A new RevWalk needs to be created for this reason, but instead of
creating a new RevWalk from Repository, we can reuse the ObjectReader in
the RevWalk of UploadPack to load objects.
