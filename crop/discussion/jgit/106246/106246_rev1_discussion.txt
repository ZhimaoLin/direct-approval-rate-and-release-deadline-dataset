DESCRIPTION

Use a RevWalk for validating not advertised wants

Shadow commits in the RevWalk in the UploadPack object may cause the
UNINTERESTING flag not being carried into their parents commits, since
they were marked NO_PARENTS during the assumeShallow or
initializeShallowCommits call.

A new RevWalk needs to be created for this reason, but to instead of
creating a new ObjectReader from new RevWalk(Repository), we can reuse
the ObjectReader in the RevWalk of UploadPack to load objects.

Nice.

Could this get a test illustrating the bug it fixes?

Line:361, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:1338, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can this use try-with-resources?

I know that close() is a no-op in this case, but it's more consistent with the cases that matter.
