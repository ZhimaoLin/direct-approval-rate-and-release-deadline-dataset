Line:210, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> The one change since the last patch was to use toString instead of toPrivateString when setting the remoteUri variable.

This seemed appropriate since the remoteUri is used in the commit message for the merge and the password shouldn't appear there if included in the URI.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Why 3? Why not just allow the default size of 16?

Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> git pull is weird. If I say `git pull URL foo:refs/heads/foo master` then master is merged but foo is stored as refs/heads/foo.

I don't see you accounting for that f'king odd behavior in this change. But you probably should be.

Line:349, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> This seems wrong to me. Why are we asking the local repository  for a reference that exists on the remote side, and ignoring it if it does not exist locally?

Line:371, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> return setRefSpecs(Arrays.asList(specs)) is much shorter.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> I "borrowed" this from the PushCommand class

Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> So in the case you mention, foo is only fetched, not fetched and merged?

I was trying to reproduce the behavior you mentioned and it looked like an octopus merge is always done when multiple refspecs are included on the command line.
