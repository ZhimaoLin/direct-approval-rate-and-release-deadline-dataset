Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommandTest.java -> We should a a test for calling setRemote with a URL instead of remoteName.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Is it really the name of a remote or is it also possible to specifiy the URL like "git://myhost/myrepo.git"?

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> As this API should be as close to native-git as possible I would like to call this parameter "repository" instead of "remote". Have a look at http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html .

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> I was matching it to FetchCommand which uses setRemote

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> then FetchCommand has the same issue. I would prefer "repository" because it:
- matches the native git documentation
- "remote" would make me think I have to specify the name of a remote. But that's not correct. I can specify remote names but I am also able to specify URLs.

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommandTest.java -> Done

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> I also added support for setting the ref specs to pull as well and therefore it seems to make sense to have the setter method signatures for remote and ref specs mirror FetchCommand for consistency.

PullCommand should not be an outlier, FetchCommand, PushCommand, and LsRemote command also use setRemote to mean a name or URI to use in the Transport operation.

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Ok for me. But some comments

As you can see in the man pages of all 4 git commands you mention they all call it "repository". The push command man page e.g. shows  that "names of remotes" and URLs are different things and both can go into this parameter. I guess that's why they didn't called it "remote".

But even if I could convince you: since the FetchCommand API is included in our released jgit version I can't change it anymore. And I agree: beeing consistent between Fetch and Pull is important.

Maybe we could add additional setters for "repository" to all these commands just to be in sync with native git terminology.

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> I think setRepository would be confusing since the commands already have a getRepository which would return a diferrent object (Repository) than the proposed setter
