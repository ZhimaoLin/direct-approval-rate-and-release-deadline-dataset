Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> Just a comment: Looks strange that we may call the CheckoutCommand with orphan=true and createBranch=false. That's maybe also a bug in the API command that we don't check that if orphan is specified nobody should explicitly set createBranch to false.
