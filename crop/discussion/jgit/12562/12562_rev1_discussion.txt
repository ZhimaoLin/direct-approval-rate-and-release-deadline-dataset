depend on commons-compress, even if using a different underlying
library to write the archive.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> Put T out first not last. Its more C-style where the "output" side is the first parameter of a method so its more like an LHS of an assignment.

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> can return null

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/archive/ArchiveCommand.java -> bad formatting here
