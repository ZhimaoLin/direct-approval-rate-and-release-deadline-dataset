DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Add missing timers to Statistics

We did not record the time spent on the object reuse search or the
object size lookup, both of which occur between the counting phase and
the compressing phase.  If there are enough objects involved, these
times can be significant so its worth timing them and recording it.
