DESCRIPTION

Delete broken DFS read-ahead support

This implementation has been proven to deadlock in production server
loads. Google has been running with it disabled for a quite a while,
as the bugs have been difficult to identify and fix.

Instead of suggesting it works and is useful, drop the code. JGit
should not advertise support for functionality that is known to
be broken.

In a few of the places where read-ahead was enabled by DfsReader
there is more information about what blocks should be loaded when.
During object representation selection, or size lookup, or sending
object as-is to a PackWriter, or sending an entire pack as-is the
reader knows exactly which blocks are required in the cache, and it
also can compute when those will be needed. The broken read-ahead
code was stupid and just read a fixed amount ahead of the current
offset, which can waste IOs if more precise data was available.

DFS systems are usually slow to respond so read-ahead is still
a desired feature, but it needs to be rebuilt from scratch and
make better use of the offset information.
