DESCRIPTION

Remove repository from cache when it's closed

RepositoryCache has 2 methods to remove a repository from the cache but
they are never called when a repository is closed. Users of the cache
were expected to call one of those 2 methods but how could they have
called them at proper time without having visibility of the repository
usage count.

Ideally, I would have rework the RepositoryCache to wrap any repository
it opens in a class that would be responsible to unregister them from the
cache when it's really closed, i.e. when usage counter reaches 0. The
problem preventing the wrapping solution is the RepositoryCache.register
method that allows to register an already opened repository in the cache.
Such repositories cannot be wrapped because caller are still holding a
reference on the unwrapped repository.

Document that RepositoryCache.close method is removing the repository
from the cache as well as closing it and rework
RepositoryCache.unregister method to only remove the repository from the
cache. Use the latter to unregister repository when Repository.doClose
is getting executed.

Abandoned

Gerrit has been benefiting from this problem (cache never closing repositories) performance wise. I have concerns about the performance impact of this change series. For now, I abandon them I will restore them once I assessed the performance impact on our production servers.
