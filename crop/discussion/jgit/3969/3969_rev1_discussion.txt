DESCRIPTION

Fix offset64 creation for objects at 2 GiB

The offset32 format is used for objects before 2^31-1, while the
offset64 format is used for all other objects.  This condition was
missing the = needed to ensure an object placed exactly at 2^31
would have its 64 bit offset in the index.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackIndexWriterV2.java -> nit-pick:
Wouldn't it be better to change the writeOffset32 instead?
It looks funny when an offset of 0x7FFFFFFF requires a
64-bit offset in JGit, but not in C Git.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackIndexWriterV2.java -> Ohh. I see what you are saying. Yes, I have this code wrong. I'll send a replacement patch in a minute.
