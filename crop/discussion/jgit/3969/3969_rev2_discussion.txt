DESCRIPTION

Fix offset64 creation for objects at 2 GiB

The offset32 format is used for objects before 2^31-1, while the
offset64 format is used for all other objects.  This condition was
missing the = needed to ensure an object placed exactly at 2^31
would have its 64 bit offset in the index.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackIndexWriterV2.java -> I think this needs to be a POSITIVE integer, make it a long.
