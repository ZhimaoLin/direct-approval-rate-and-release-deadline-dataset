DESCRIPTION

Add configuration parameter to enable builtin hooks/filters

If the configuration parameter filter.<filterDriverName>.useJGitBuiltin
is set to true then for all corresponding filters JGit will try to
execute the builtin filter instead of the filter-command which is
defined in git configuration. It will fallback to the non-builtin
filters if no builtin filters are registered or if constructing them
leads to exceptions. If set to false JGit will not try to execute
builtin filters for the specified filter driver.

Example: The configuration contains the following lines

  [filter "lfs"]
    clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
    smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    useJGitBuiltin = true

Addtionally the .gitattributes file in the root of the working tree
contains:

    *.bin filter=lfs

In this case when new content is added similar to "git add 1.bin" then
the following will happen:

  - jgit will check whether a builtin command factory was registered
    for the command "jgit://builtin/lfs/clean". If that is true the
    factory is used to create a builtin filter command and that
    command is used to filter the content
  - Otherwise jgit will call the external program "git lfs clean ..."
    to do the filtering
