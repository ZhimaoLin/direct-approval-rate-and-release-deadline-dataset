DESCRIPTION

Add configuration parameter switch to builtin hooks/filters

If the configuration parameter filter.<filterDriverName>.useJGitBuiltin
is set to true then for all corresponding filters JGit will try to
execute the builtin filter instead of the filter-command which is
defined in git configuration. If set to false JGit will not try to
execute builtin filters for the specified filter driver.

Example: The repo config contains the following lines

  [filter "lfs"]
    clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
    smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    useJGitBuiltin = true

Addtionally the .gitattributes file in the root of the working tree
contains:

    *.bin filter=lfs

In this case when new content is added similar to "git add 1.bin" then
the following will happen:

  - jgit will check whether a builtin command factory was registered
    for the command "jgit://builtin/lfs/clean". If that is true the
    factory is used to create a builtin command and that command is
    used to filter the content
  - Otherwise jgit will call the external program "git lfs clean ..."
    to do the filtering
