DESCRIPTION

Add Squash/Fixup support for rebase interactive in RebaseCommand

The rebase command now supports squash and fixup. Both actions are not
allowed as the first step of the rebase.

In JGit, before any rebase step is performed, the next commit is
already cherry-picked. This commit keeps that behaviour. In case of
squash or fixup a soft reset to the parent is perfomed afterwards.
