DESCRIPTION

Add Squash/Fixup support for rebase interactive in RebaseCommand

The rebase command now supports squash and fixup. Both actions are not
allowed as the first step of the rebase.

In JGit, before any rebase step is performed, the next commit is 
already cherry-picked. This commit keeps that behaviour. In case of
squash or fixup a soft reset to the parent is perfomed afterwards.

Line:2242, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> This message is misleading. The test will probalby fail with this message if it fails

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> trailing space

Line:2242, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> Yes, this was from copy and paste.

I just remove the line. Additionally I add a new Exception type because this situation is not an internal exception of JGit, but a wrong usage of the API.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
