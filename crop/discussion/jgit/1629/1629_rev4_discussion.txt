Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

looks good, only some style nits. Sorry Dmitry for being so picky. If you use Eclipse and our checked in project settings regarding auto-save actions etc. you don't have to care anymore about such problems (e.g. trailing whitespaces)

Line:257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> style-nit: please use tabs here for indention

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> style-nit: wrong indention on the previous two lines

Line:268, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> style-nit: please remove trailing whitespaces
