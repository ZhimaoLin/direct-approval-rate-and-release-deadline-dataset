DESCRIPTION

Fix merge-base calculation

Fix JGits merge-base calculation in case of inconsistent commit times.
JGit was potentially failing to compute correct merge-bases when the
commit times where inconsistent (a parent commit was younger than a
child commit). The code in MergeBaseGenerator was aware of the fact that
sometimes the discovery of a merge base x can occur after the parents of
x have been seen (see comment in #carryOntoOne()). But in the light of
inconsistent commit times it was possible that these parents of a
merge-base have already been returned as a merge-base.

This commit fixes the bug by buffering all commits generated by
MergeBaseGenerator. It is expected that this buffer will be small
because the number of merge-bases will be small. Additionally a new
flag is used to mark the ancestors of merge-bases. This allows to filter
out the unwanted commits.
