DESCRIPTION

Do not implicitly guess username or email

Instead provide separate methods trying to construct this information
using data provided by the operating system. This enables applications
to differentiate between explicitly set configuration parameters and
best effort attempts to guess these parameters from the operating
system.

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> Why not assertNull(authorName)?

But you cannot make this change, it breaks everyone else. Code assumes they can do localConfig.get(UserConfig.KEY).getAuthorName() to fill out a PersonIdent. Returning null here because it wasn't set explicitly is going to break that assumption.

Instead we should continue to guess implicitly, but mark a boolean on UserConfig that says we guessed the author name, so we have:

 boolean isAuthorNameImplicit()
 boolean isAuthorEmailImplicit()

etc. to let the application know the current value came from the OS and our assumption rules, rather than being set explicitly.
