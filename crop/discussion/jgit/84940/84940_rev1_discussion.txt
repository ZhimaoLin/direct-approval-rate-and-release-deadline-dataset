DESCRIPTION

Deprecate SafeBufferedOutputStream

Java 8 fixed the silent flush during close issue by
FilterOutputStream (base class of BufferedOutputStream)
using try-with-resources to close the stream, getting a
behavior matching what JGit's SafeBufferedOutputStream
was doing:

  try {
    flush();
  } finally {
    out.close();
  }

With Java 8 as the minimum required version to run JGit
it is no longer necessary to override close() or have
this class. Deprecate the class, and use the JRE's version
of close.

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/AbbreviationTest.java -> Why are these removed?  Seems to be an unrelated change.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexWriterV1.java -> Unrelated import reorganization?

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/AbbreviationTest.java -> Unused imports because they are for this package. Looks like the test was moved into the package from outside and the imports weren't cleaned up during that move.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexWriterV1.java -> Gah. Looks like my Eclipse JGit workspace is ordering imports differently than the last author of this file.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexWriterV1.java -> Hmm.  If I run the Eclipse organize imports I get 88 modified files.
