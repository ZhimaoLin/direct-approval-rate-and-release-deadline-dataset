DESCRIPTION

dfs: reftable backed DfsRefDatabase

DfsReftableDatabase is a new alternative for DfsRefDatabase that
handles more operations for the implementor by delegating through
reftable. All reftable files are stored in sibling DfsObjDatabase
using PackExt.REFTABLE and PackSource.INSERT.

Its assumed the DfsObjDatabase periodically runs compactions and GCs
using DfsPackCompactor and DfsGarbageCollector.  Those passes are
essential to collapsing the stack of reftables.

(8 comments)

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Tests, por favor.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> IIRC this constant is used elsewhere so consolidate it in a central location.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Inline this

Line:432, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> This was really puzzling. Extracting it to a "packOnlyContainsReftable()" function would make it clearer.

Line:441, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Should this take the size of the N-1 table being compacted into too?

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> The next commit in the series switches InMemoryRepository over to DfsReftableDatabase.  All the existing tests will test this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:441, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> No, compactTopOfStack() will only compact the new table in the update with newest existing table.  This test ensures that the existing table is not too big and would take too long to compact.
