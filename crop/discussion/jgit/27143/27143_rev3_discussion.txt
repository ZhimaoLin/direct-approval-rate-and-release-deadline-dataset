DESCRIPTION

Adds a callAsMap() function to LsRemoteCommand.

The call() function of LsRemoteCommand returns Collection<Ref>, while its
internal is using Map<String, Ref> all the time. Sometimes the map is much more
useful to the caller so add a getMap() function to keep the API compatibility.

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LsRemoteCommand.java -> API breakage. The returned collection used to be modifiable, but is no more. I'm not sure if anyone will be affected.

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/LsRemoteCommand.java -> Done. Actually I think making the return value of callAsMap() is not that important as it's just a map generated in each call and modifying it won't affect anyone. But well.
