DESCRIPTION

Don't create .git/remotes folders on init

For historical reasons JGit was creating .git/remotes folder when
initialization an empty repository.  However, this folder is never
used and the new Git repository format doesn't contain them.

Removed the unnecessary remotes folder creation, it was removed from
C Git in 75c384efb52d ("Do not create $GIT_DIR/remotes/ directory
anymore") by Junio C Hamano on Dec 19 2006.  C Git hasn't made it
for almost 3 years.
