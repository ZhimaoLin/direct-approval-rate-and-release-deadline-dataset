DESCRIPTION

Support -merge attribute in binary macro

The merger is now able to react to the use of the merge attribute.
The value unset and the custom value 'binary' are handled (-merge
and merge=binary)

Since the specification of the merge attribute states that when the
attribute is unset, ours version must be kept in case of a conflict, we
don't overwrite the file but keep the local version.
