Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Doesn't this break ABI? IIUC a caller that does

  static DfsRefDatabase getRefDb(DfsRepository db) {
    return db.getRefDatabase();
  }

would get linkage errors after this change.

I don't mind because I can't imagine a caller that is just consuming the library instead of extending it doing that.

Yes, but this is an internal package using internal types. We don't promise squat. Its up to the caller during an update to make sure they aren't broken.
