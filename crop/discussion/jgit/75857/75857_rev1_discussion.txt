DESCRIPTION

Fix TreeWalk to reset attributes cache for each entry

Treewalk has a member 'attr' which caches the attributes for the current
entry. We did not reset the cache always when moving to next entry. The
effect was that when there are no attributes for an entry 'a' but 'a'
was skipped by a Treewalk filter then Treewalk stopped looking for
attributes until TreeWalk.next() was called again.
