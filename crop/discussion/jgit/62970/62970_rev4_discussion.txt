DESCRIPTION

FileRepository: Support extensions.refsBackendType = RefTree

This experimental code can be enabled in $GIT_DIR/config:

  [core]
    repositoryformatversion = 1

  [extensions]
    refsBackendType = RefTree

When these are set the repository will read references from the
RefTree rooted by the $GIT_DIR/refs/txn/committed reference.
