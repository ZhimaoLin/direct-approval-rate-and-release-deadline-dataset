DESCRIPTION

cleanup: Prefer assertEquals over assertTrue(....equals(...))

That is the common style and yields better diagnostics on failure.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> expected value is the first argument, hence I think the arguments should be flipped here

same for all changes below

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevObjectTest.java -> you lost the cast to Object here

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevObjectTest.java -> you lost the cast to Object here

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevObjectTest.java -> That was becuase the call is filtered via assertEquls, but perhpas its best to keep it in case someone adds an assertEquals specifically for AnyObjectId

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> Done, here and below

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevObjectTest.java -> I get an unnecessary cast (warning>error) if I try to cast here
