Line:352, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/Git.java -> Style-nit: trailing space.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NotesCommand.java -> These should each be their own GitCommand class, with factory methods on Git like noteList(), noteShow(), noteEdit(). That matches with the branch "command".

Line:122, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NotesCommand.java -> This should be a settable option.

Line:214, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NotesCommand.java -> Don't look this up again, you must use the same commit that the map was read from.

Line:220, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/NotesCommand.java -> The inserter has to flush before this method is called.

But why are we doing a force update here? This should be setting the expected old object id and doing a normal fast-forward update.
