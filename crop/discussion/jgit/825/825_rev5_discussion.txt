DESCRIPTION

Implement a Dircache checkout (needed for merge)

Implementation of a checkout (or 'git read-tree') operation which
works together with DirCache. This implementation does similar things
as WorkDirCheckout which main problem is that it works with deprecated
GitIndex. Since GitIndex doesn't support multiple stages of a file
which is required in merge situations this new implementation is
required to enable merge support.

This looks a lot better.  I think I'm down to one API style nit I missed earlier, and I'm still trying to get rid of that Tree class..

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Style-nit: Our public API should return Map, Set, List and not a concrete implementation type.  Sorry I missed this during earlier review iterations.

Line:570, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Isn't this just:

  if (walk.isDirectoryFileConflict())

at this point?  Basically we can't rely on Tree anymore, its dead and going away.  So we should be able to do the same thing with TreeWalk/NameConflictTreeWalk... and if we can't we should try to address the problem in those APIs rather than making new code rely on deprecated code.

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Done

Line:570, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I added also a check for m==0 because the original check went explicitly against a merge-tree which has a file in this directory/file conflict

BUT: during testing this I detected our isDirectoryFileConflict() was implemented wrong. Therefore I put the work on NameConflictTreeWalker into an own change. I am sure what is in that proposal is sub-optimal ... but it works. Let's focus on this change on DirCacheCheckout.
