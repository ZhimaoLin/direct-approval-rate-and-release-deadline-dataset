DESCRIPTION

Implement a Dircache checkout (needed for merge)

Implementation of a checkout (or 'git read-tree') operation which
works together with DirCache. This implementation does similar things
as WorkDirCheckout which main problem is that it works with deprecated
GitIndex. Since GitIndex doesn't support multiple stages of a file
which is required in merge situations this new implementation is
required to enable merge support.

I think I'm reasonably happy with this code now.

Line:398, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Yes.  Its always a conflict.  I'm not sure you can sanely resolve this case otherwise.

Line:497, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Actually, you *might* have the id of the tree.  Right now its really rare though if JGit is involved.  :-(

Line:791, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Style-nit: File.createTempFile() should be sufficient since we already import java.io.File here.  And we prefer spaces around operators like +.

Finally, should we use "._" instead as the prefix?  That way the temporary file is hidden from view when a user is doing `ls` at the same time as a checkout is occurring?

Line:135, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ReadTreeTest.java -> We shouldn't rely on platform encoding.  Please specify "UTF-8" or something here.
