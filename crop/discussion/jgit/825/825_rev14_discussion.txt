DESCRIPTION

Implement a Dircache checkout (needed for merge)

Implementation of a checkout (or 'git read-tree') operation which
works together with DirCache. This implementation does similar things
as WorkDirCheckout which main problem is that it works with deprecated
GitIndex. Since GitIndex doesn't support multiple stages of a file
which is required in merge situations this new implementation is
required to enable merge support.

Patch Set 14: IP review completed

fixed last failing test by taking care of File/Directory conflict case #20.

Now all tests succeed. Still there are questions in ReadTreeTest.java regarding commented-out tests.
