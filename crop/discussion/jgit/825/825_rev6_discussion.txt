DESCRIPTION

Implement a Dircache checkout (needed for merge)

Implementation of a checkout (or 'git read-tree') operation which
works together with DirCache. This implementation does similar things
as WorkDirCheckout which main problem is that it works with deprecated
GitIndex. Since GitIndex doesn't support multiple stages of a file
which is required in merge situations this new implementation is
required to enable merge support.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I worked in two comments from Shawn. But I had to seperate out the work on NameConflictTreeWalk into an own change.

Still I am not so happy with the tests. I have put some questions in ReadTreeTest and some assertions are now commented out because they will break DirCacheCheckout.
