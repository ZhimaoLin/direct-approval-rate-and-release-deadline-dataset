DESCRIPTION

jgit-cli version command falls back to Bundle-Version

If the version command cannot read the Implementation-Version of the
containing JAR then it will fall back to reading the Bundle-Version
header in MANIFEST.MF. This makes the command working also from the
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm bundle and during development in a host IDE.

Patch Set 3:

For a really useful version we should use the new describe command to generate the version string at build time

Matthias, could you explain in more details? The use case I am covering in this change is to make the command working when Implementation-Version is not available in the manifest. 

Do you propose an alternative way for specifying Implementation-Version during build time? How is this related to this change?

Patch Set 3:

Your proposed enhancement surely improves the current implementation.

But I think using git describe [1] would be a much better way to show a meaningful version number, this would require that we run jgit's describe command during the maven build to generate the version identifier at buildtime.

git describe shows the last tag if the current version happens to be a tagged release, otherwise the version string is a concatenation of the closest tag, the distance to this tag in number of commits and the abbreviated commit id of the current commit. E.g. this yields currently for my local jgit clone 

 v3.1.0.201310021548-r-15-g9378ce9

this means this clone has 15 commits on top of v3.1.0.201310021548-r and my current commit is 9378ce9.

I still don't get it how this relates to the bug that this patch tries to solve. The bug is that the version command fails in a particular situation. The problem is in the failing - then jgit completes with different exit code and this causes problems to scripts that rely a proper exit code. The actual output of the command is not an issue, especially in the qualifier part.

Matthias: It seems what you are describing is changing how the following is set in pom.xml, right?:

                <Implementation-Version>${project.version}</Implementation-Version>

This change is only about making it not show an error during development, when building with Eclipse.
