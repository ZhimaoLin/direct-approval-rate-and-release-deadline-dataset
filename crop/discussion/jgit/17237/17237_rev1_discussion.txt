DESCRIPTION

jgit-cli version command falls back to Bundle-Version

If the version command cannot read the Implementation-Version of the
containing JAR then it will fall back to reading the Bundle-Version
header in MANIFEST.MF. This makes the command working also from the
org.eclipse.jgit.pgm bundle and during development in a host IDE.
