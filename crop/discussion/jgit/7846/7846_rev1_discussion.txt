DESCRIPTION

Compress large /info/refs responses on HTTP

Enable streaming compression for any response that is bigger than
the 32 KiB buffer used by SmartOutputStream. This is useful on the
info/refs file which can have many branches and tags listed, and
is often bigger than 32 KiB, but also compresses by at least 50%.

Disable streaming compression on large git-upload-pack responses,
as these are usually highly compressed Git pack data. Trying to
compress these with gzip will only waste CPU time and additional
transfer space with the gzip wrapper. Small git-upload-pack data
is usually text based negotiation responses and can be squeezed
smaller with a little bit of CPU usage.

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/SmartOutputStream.java -> If out is already a GZIPOutputStream, looks like this double-compresses?

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/SmartOutputStream.java -> That looks impossible. Above at line 105 out = this. So here out = this. This isn't a GZIPOutputStream... its a TemporaryBuffer. No caller wraps this in a GZIPOutputStream currently, so we don't perform double compression.

If we use the new block at line 90 we can't get into this block here because of the startedOutput member being flipped. So we definitely cannot have double compression.

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/SmartOutputStream.java -> My mistake, I was looking at overflow(), which is unrelated to out.
