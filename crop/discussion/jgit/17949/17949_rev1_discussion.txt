DESCRIPTION

Skip submodules when writing archives

When it encounters a submodule entry, "jgit archive" tries to write
its content verbatim as an entry to the archive, which fails with a
JGitInternalException wrapping a MissingObjectException because the
submodule repository commits are typically not part of the
superproject.

When a subproject is available, it would be nice to recurse into it
and make one archive recording the state of the entire project.
Unfortunately sometimes the subproject is not available and sometimes
it is not obvious where to find the subproject (for example it can be
on another server).  If "jgit archive" relied on clones of the
submodules being available on disk in the work tree, then it would not
be usable for repositories without a work tree (for example when
serving from a database) or with not all submodules cloned.

Instead, just skip the submodule entries.  "git archive" does the
same.

Just a minor comment issue.

Line:283, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> I think this comment may need updating.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is saying basically the same thing you have but the way I think about it is that "jgit archive" should not produce different outputs from the same tree-ish depending on whether or not the submodules are cloned/checked out.

Line:283, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ArchiveCommand.java -> Yeah, it's just plain false ("git archive" includes entries for directories --- not sure what I did to convince myself otherwise). Will rebase on top of a fix.
