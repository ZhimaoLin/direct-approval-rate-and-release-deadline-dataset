DESCRIPTION

archive: Use an empty directory for submodules

When it encounters a submodule entry, "jgit archive" tries to write
its content verbatim as an entry to the archive, which fails with a
JGitInternalException wrapping a MissingObjectException because the
submodule repository commits are typically not part of the
superproject.

When a subproject is available, it would be nice to recurse into it
and make one archive recording the state of the entire project.
Unfortunately sometimes the subproject is not available and sometimes
it is not obvious where to find the subproject (for example it can be
on another server).  Even when running from a superproject worktree,
"jgit archive" should not produce different outputs from the same tree
depending on whether or not the submodules are checked out, so there
is no good default behavior that recurses here.

Instead, replace submodule entries with a placeholder empty directory.
"git archive" does the same.

Line:442, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> So this is a recursive submodule? Seems like this will cause an infinite loop if we ever change the default behavior to recurse :)

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well, it could be a useful default to have "jgit archive" fetch submodule contents if possible, so it might be more accurate to say "depending on whether or not the submodule repository can be found" or something.

Line:442, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> It's ok as long as we only recurse into the specific commit referenced by the submodule entry. :)

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Tweaked the wording a little.
