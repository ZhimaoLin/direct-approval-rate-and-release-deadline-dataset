DESCRIPTION

Move FileRepository to storage.file.FileRepository

This move isolates all of the local file specific implementation code
into a single package, where their package-private methods and support
classes are properly hidden away from the rest of the core library.

Because of the sheer number of files impacted, I have limited this
change to only the renames and the updated imports.
