DESCRIPTION

Increase core.streamFileThreshold default to 50 MiB

Projects like org.eclipse.mdt contain large XML files about 6 MiB
in size.  So does the Android project platform/frameworks/base.
Doing a clone of either project with JGit takes forever to checkout
the files into the working directory, because delta decompression
tends to be very expensive as we need to constantly reposition the
base stream for each copy instruction.  This can be made worse by
a very bad ordering of offsets, possibly due to an XML editor that
doesn't preserve the order of elements in the file very well.

Increasing the threshold to the same limit PackWriter uses when
doing delta compression (50 MiB) permits a default configured
JGit to decompress these XML file objects using the faster
random-access arrays, rather than re-seeking through an inflate
stream, significantly reducing checkout time after a clone.

Since this new limit may be dangerously close to the JVM maximum
heap size, every allocation attempt is now wrapped in a try/catch
so that JGit can degrade by switching to the large object stream
mode when the allocation is refused.  It will run slower, but the
operation will still complete.

The large stream mode will run very well for big objects that aren't
delta compressed, and is acceptable for delta compressed objects that
are using only forward referencing copy instructions.  Copies using
prior offsets are still going to be horrible, and there is nothing
we can do about it except increase core.streamFileThreshold.

We might in the future want to consider changing the way the delta
generators work in JGit and native C Git to avoid prior offsets once
an object reaches a certain size, even if that causes the delta
instruction stream to be slightly larger.  Unfortunately native
C Git won't want to do that until its also able to stream objects
rather than malloc them as contiguous blocks.
