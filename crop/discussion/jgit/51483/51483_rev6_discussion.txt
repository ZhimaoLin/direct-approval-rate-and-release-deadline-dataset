DESCRIPTION

Introduce FileModeStrategy to FileTreeIterator

This commit introduces a FileModeStrategy to
the FileTreeIterator class.  This provides a way to
allow different modes of traversing a file tree;
for example, to control whether or not a nested
.git directory should be treated as a gitlink.

I think this is ok for now. Lets make use of this new feature in a follow up change. Let's do the final submit of this change when we are sure that you can implement DIR_NOGITLINK with the API of FileModeStrategy.

Excellent, thanks for the notes.  We will definitely try that out next time we're working on something, and maybe I can file a PR to the wiki docs if I figure out why the steps there weren't working for me before.

That makes sense too, thanks.  Unfortunately it will probably be a week or two before I'm able to devote a developer to picking that patch back up, because we're getting ready for a release, but we'll work on it again ASAP.
