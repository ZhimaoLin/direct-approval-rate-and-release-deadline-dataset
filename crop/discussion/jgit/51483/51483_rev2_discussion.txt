DESCRIPTION

Introduce FileModeStrategy to FileTreeIterator

This commit introduces a FileModeStrategy to
the FileTreeIterator class.  This provides a way to
allow different modes of traversing a file tree;
for example, to control whether or not a nested
.git directory should be treated as a gitlink.

Patch Set 2:

I was finally able to get the code loaded up in Eclipse so that I could see the warnings/errors about docstrings, etc.  I fixed all of the ones that my Eclipse was complaining about.

Still to do: investigate your comment about using "p.getFileModeStrategy" instead of using the default for the case you highlighted.  And, adding tests.

Patch Set 2:

Christian: I'm not seeing any warnings from Eclipse about '@since' docstrings; not sure which fields I'm supposed to be adding that to.  Any ideas what I need to change about my eclipse set up in order to see the appropriate warnings?  I tried to follow all the steps in the contributing guide on the wiki but still not seeing xxx@xxx.xxx stuff.

Patch Set 2:

I've pushed up a new patch set that includes tests.  I think this should be ready to go, with the possible exception of some javadoc strings that Eclipse might warn about; I'm trying to get Eclipse set up to give me the warnings so that I can fix them, but I'm getting some errors from Eclipse about "provisioning" and resolving OSGi bundles, which I haven't been able to figure out how to fix yet.
