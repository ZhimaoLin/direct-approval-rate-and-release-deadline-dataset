DESCRIPTION

Introduce FileModeStrategy to FileTreeIterator

This commit introduces a FileModeStrategy to
the FileTreeIterator class.  This provides a way to
allow different modes of traversing a file tree;
for example, to control whether or not a nested
.git directory should be treated as a gitlink.

This looks fine to me, thanks.  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.  Also if there's an RTFM somewhere to help me figure out how to get the xxx@xxx.xxx tags right in the future, let me know... I think Puppet Labs will probably have some more patches to try to contribute in the not-too-distant future.

Line:172, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/FileTreeIterator.java -> Here the API baseline stuff became helpful. Eclipse warned me on this line that we are breaking API here (ok, on a protected method, not so important. But we could break projects subclassing FileTreeIterator here). API before was 
  
  protected FileTreeIterator(final WorkingTreeIterator p, final File root, FS fs)

and you changed it to take a FileTreeIterator instead of a WorkingTreeIterator. We should keep the constructor taking WorkingTreeIterator (and fall back to DefaultFileModeStrategy in this case) and add this constructor taking FileTreeIterator. The one taking WorkingTreeIterator could be marked deprecated. I uploaded a patch for that.

I would do the following:
- in eclipse preferences "Plugin-in Development->API Baselines" check the following 
-- you should see a baseline for org.eclipse.egit.repository-4.0.2.201509141540-r
-- that baseline is activated. Behind the baseline name you should see "(default baseline)"
-- "Missing API baseline" should be set to error

- in eclipse preferences "Plugin-in Development->API Errors/Warnings" check the following
-- on tab API Compatibility everything should be set to Error
-- on tab Version Management everything should be set to Error

- do a full rebuild by "Project->Clean...->Clean all Projects"

Great to here that.
