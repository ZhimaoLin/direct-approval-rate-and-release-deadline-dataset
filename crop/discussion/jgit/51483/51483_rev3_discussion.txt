DESCRIPTION

Introduce FileModeStrategy to FileTreeIterator

This commit introduces a FileModeStrategy to
the FileTreeIterator class.  This provides a way to
allow different modes of traversing a file tree;
for example, to control whether or not a nested
.git directory should be treated as a gitlink.

ping!  sorry to nag, just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the feasibility of this?  I'm willing to re-work it in any way that anyone sees fit if there are still issues with the current implementation.
