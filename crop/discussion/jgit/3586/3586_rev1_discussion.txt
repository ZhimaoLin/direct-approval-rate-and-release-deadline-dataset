DESCRIPTION

Fix CloneCommand not to fetch into remote tracking branches when bare

When cloning into a bare repository we should not create remote
tracking branches (e.g refs/remotes/origin/testX). Branches of the
remote repository should but fetched into into branches of the same
name (e.g refs/heads/testX). Also add the noCheckout option which
would prevent checkout after fetch.
