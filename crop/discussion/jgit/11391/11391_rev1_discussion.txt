It ssems you are trying to fix the same issue as https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/11321/

Line:1133, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> This an extra stat call in case f is a directory. In almost all cases f is a file, so we optimisically attempt to delete the file (or empty directory) first and do the expensive stuff if that fails.

Most likely the same indeed. This accounts for a good 30 failures of the SWTBot tests on windows. Please abandon this change, I'll verify once I3453342c17e064dcb50906a540172978941a10a6 is merged.
