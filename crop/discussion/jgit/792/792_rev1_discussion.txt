DESCRIPTION

Refactor ReadTreeTest to allow testing other checkout implementations

ReadTreeTest contains a lot of useful tests for "checkout" implementations.
But ReadTreeTest was hardcoded to test only WorkDirCheckout. This change
doesn't add/modify any tests semantically but refactors ReadTreeTest so that a
different implementations of checkout can be tested. This was done to allow
DirCacheCheckout to be tested without rewriting all these tests.
