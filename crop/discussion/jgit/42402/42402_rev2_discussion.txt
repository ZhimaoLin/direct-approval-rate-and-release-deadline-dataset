DESCRIPTION

[WIP] refactored pre-commit hook to make it less invasive.

Hooks are now obtained via a convenient API
like git commands, and callers don't have to check
for their existence.
The pre-commit hook has been updated accordingly.

Just a minor comment about naming. But otherwise, this looks good to me! Thanks!

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/Hooks.java -> Maybe HookFactory would be a better name to explicitly communicate that this class does not hold instances of hooks but _instantiates_ them.
