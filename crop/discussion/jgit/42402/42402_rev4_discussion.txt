DESCRIPTION

Refactored pre-commit hook to make it less invasive.

Hooks are now obtained via a convenient API like git commands, and
callers don't have to check for their existence.
The pre-commit hook has been updated accordingly.

Patch Set 4:

Hello, here is a review that removes the "Hook" enum.
I'm not convinced this is the way to go nut I decided to push this review anyway so as to gather feedback about it.

Thanks in advance.

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> For security you could check here if this is actually one of the constants. Code will be ugly though...

Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> style nit: trailing whitespace

Line:72, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> I would push down this constant to the respective hook class

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> if we want to prevent that new hooks can be created in different packages we could restrict GitHook's visibility to this package

What I fear is rather that someone finds a way to call

    FS.DETECTED.runIfPresent(..., "../../path/to/maliciouscrit", ...)

Which was not possible when the parameter was an enum.
