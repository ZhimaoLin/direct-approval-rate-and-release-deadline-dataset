DESCRIPTION

Refactored pre-commit hook to make it less invasive.

Hooks are now obtained via a convenient API like git commands, and
callers don't have to check for their existence.
The pre-commit hook has been updated accordingly.

Thank you Max & Philip, I now consider this ready for "public" review so I remove the [WIP] tag.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/PreCommitHook.java -> I think we don't need an enum value and a Hook class per hook, instead we could add a name to each hook class and get rid of the enum.

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/Hooks.java -> that's rather a factory class for instantiating supported hooks

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> this doesn't explain what a hook is, see http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks for some inspiration how to better explain hooks

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> I think we can drop the enum and make this

 public abstract String getName();

Thanks for your comments Matthias. Just one question on the removal of the Hook enum.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/GitHook.java -> I have let the enum because methods FS.runIfPresent receive a Hook (enum), and if they received a String, I feared that it could be a security risk, allowing malicious code to run something else than just hook scripts.
If you think this is nonsense, I'll gladly get rid og the enum!

And another small question: If you confirm the Hook enum must be removed, I think I'll have to create constants for the hook names: where shoud these constants go according to JGit coding conventions? In the class "Constants", in the GitHook class, elsewhere?

Thanks in advance.
