DESCRIPTION

FileBasedConfig: Use FileSnapshot for isOutdated()

Relying only on the last modified time for a file can be tricky.
The "racy git" problem may cause some modifications to be missed.

Use the new FileSnapshot code to track when a configuration file
has been modified, and needs to be reloaded in memory.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This breaks older applications.  We probably need to avoid clearing the configuration if the file content hasn't been modified since the last time it was read.
