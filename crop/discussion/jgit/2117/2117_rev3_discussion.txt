DESCRIPTION

FileBasedConfig: Use FileSnapshot for isOutdated()

Relying only on the last modified time for a file can be tricky.
The "racy git" problem may cause some modifications to be missed.

Use the new FileSnapshot code to track when a configuration file
has been modified, and needs to be reloaded in memory.
