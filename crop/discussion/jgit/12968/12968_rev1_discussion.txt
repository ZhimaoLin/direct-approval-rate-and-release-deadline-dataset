DESCRIPTION

Fix BatchRefUpdate progress-monitoring so it doesn't count twice

I was seeing output like this while running The BFG:

Updating references:    200% (374/187)

...issue sneaked in with 5cf53fda I think.

The update call is also moved to the end of the loop, as update() is
only supposed to be called after work has been done ("Denote that some
work units have been completed").
