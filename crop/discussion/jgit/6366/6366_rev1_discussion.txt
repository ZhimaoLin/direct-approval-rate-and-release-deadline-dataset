DESCRIPTION

Add a release() method to SubmoduleWalk

We need a way to release the underlying TreeWalk. Also, use this
method to release walks from the static factory methods on error or
when submodules are not found.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/submodule/SubmoduleWalk.java -> No, we can't blindly release in a finally. In the non-exception case (l. 111), we *don't* want to release, because the SubmoduleWalk's underlying TreeWalk is still used (e.g. in SubmoduleWalk.next()).
