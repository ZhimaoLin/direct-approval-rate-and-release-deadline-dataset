DESCRIPTION

push: support per-ref force-with-lease

When rebasing, force-pushing has a race condition: someone else might
have pushed a commit since the one you just rewrote. The force-with-lease
option prevents this by ensuring that the ref's old value is the one
that you expected.

Seems fine; couple of nits that I'd like to see cleaned up before this is submitted.

Line:1398, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> weird blank line in the middle of javadoc. Please either delete the line or include the * like on 1393 above.

Line:1404, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Looks like this method is missing xxx@xxx.xxx 4.7 annotation.

Line:61, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefLeaseSpec.java -> The fields should be final as they are never modified.
