DESCRIPTION

Rewrite reference handling to be abstract and accurate

This commit actually does two major changes to the way references
are handled within JGit.  Unfortunately they were easier to do as
a single commit.

Disambiguate symbolic references:
---------------------------------

  Reporting a symbolic reference such as HEAD as though it were
  any other normal reference like refs/heads/master causes subtle
  programming errors.  We have been bitten by this error on several
  occasions, as have some downstream applications written by myself.

  Instead of reporting HEAD as a reference whose name differs from
  its "original name", report it as an actual SymbolicRef object
  that the application can test the type and examine the target of.

  With this change, Ref is now an abstract type with different
  subclasses for the different types.

  In the classical example of "HEAD" being a symbolic reference to
  branch "refs/heads/master", the Repository.getAllRefs() method
  will now return:

      Map<String, Ref> all = repository.getAllRefs();
      SymbolicRef HEAD = (SymbolicRef) all.get("HEAD");
      ObjectIdRef master = (ObjectIdRef) all.get("refs/heads/master");

      assertSame(master,               HEAD.getTarget());
      assertSame(master.getObjectId(), HEAD.getObjectId());

      assertEquals("HEAD",              HEAD.getName());
      assertEquals("refs/heads/master", master.getName());

  A nice side-effect of this change is the storage type of the
  symbolic reference is no longer ambiguous with the storge type
  of the underlying reference it targets.  In the above example,
  if master was only available in the packed-refs file, then the
  following is also true:

      assertEquals(Ref.Storage.LOOSE,  HEAD.getStorage());
      assertEquals(Ref.Storage.PACKED, master.getStorage());

  (Prior to this change we returned the ambiguous storage of
   LOOSE_PACKED for HEAD, which was confusing since it wasn't
   actually true on disk).

  Another nice side-effect of this change is all intermediate
  symbolic references are preserved, and are therefore visible
  to the application when they walk the target chain.  We can
  now correctly inspect chains of symbolic references.

  As a result of this change the Ref.getOrigName() method has been
  removed from the API.  Applications should identify a symbolic
  reference by testing for instanceof SymbolicRef and not by using
  an arcane string comparsion between properties.

Abstract the RefDatabase storage:
---------------------------------

  RefDatabase is now abstract, similar to ObjectDatabase, and a
  new concrete implementation called RefDirectory is used for the
  traditional on-disk storage layout.  In the future we plan to
  support additional implementations, such as a pure in-memory
  RefDatabase for unit testing purposes.

  The implementation of the in-memory reference cache, reading, and
  update routines has been completely rewritten.  Most of the code
  was heavily borrowed or cribbed from the prior implementation,
  so copyright notices have been left intact as much as possible.

  The RefDirectory cache no longer confuses symoblic references
  with normal references.  This permits the cache to resolve the
  value of a symbolic reference as late as possible, ensuring it
  is always current, without needing to maintain reverse pointers.

  The cache is now a single map (rather than 3), reducing the
  in-memory footprint and improving access times by reducing the
  number of map operations required per-reference read or updated.

  The RefLogWriter class has been fully folded into RefDirectory
  and is therefore deleted.  Maintaining the reference's log is
  the responsiblity of the database implementation, and not all
  implementations will use java.io for access.  Future work still
  remains to be done to abstract the ReflogReader class away from
  local disk IO.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The rejecting factor here is those places that lack test coverage for non-trivcial code or where there is a condition in the code that was not covered.
