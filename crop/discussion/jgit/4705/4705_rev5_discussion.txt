DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Garbage collector for FileRepositories

This is work in progress. It is mainly a copy what Shawn wrote in
DfsGarbageCollector which is enhanced by handling index and reflog
entries. It's not ready at all but I want to share it fast to see
whether I am heading in the right direction.
