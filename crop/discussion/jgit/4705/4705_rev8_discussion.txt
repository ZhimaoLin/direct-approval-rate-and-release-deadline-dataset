DESCRIPTION

Garbage collector for FileRepositories

Implements a garbage collector for FileRepositories. Main ideas are
copied from the garbage collector for DFS based repos
(DfsGarbageCollector). Added functionalities are
- pruning loose objects
- handling of the index

TODO: we are still missing reflog handling, packing of refs, good
progress monitoring, support for pack.packSizeLimit, unpacking packed
objects into loose objects (to support that pruning packed objects
doesn't delete them until they are older than two weeks)
