DESCRIPTION

Garbage collector for FileRepositories

Implements a garbage collector for FileRepositories. Main ideas are
copied from the garbage collector for DFS based repos
(DfsGarbageCollector). Added functionalities are
- pruning loose objects
- handling of the index
- packing refs
- handling of reflogs (objects referenced from reflog will not be
pruned/)

TODO: we are still missing:
- unpacking packed objects into loose objects (to support that pruning
packed objects doesn't delete them until they are older than two weeks)
- expiration of reflogs
- support for configuration parameters (e.g. gc.pruneExpire)
