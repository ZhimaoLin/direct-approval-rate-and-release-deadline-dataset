DESCRIPTION

Garbage collector for FileRepositories

Implements a garbage collector for FileRepositories. Main ideas are
copied from the garbage collector for DFS based repos
(DfsGarbageCollector). Added functionalities are
- pruning loose objects
- handling of the index
- packing refs
- handling of reflogs (reflog entries will save objects from beeing
pruned)

TODO: we are still missing:
- unpacking packed objects into loose objects (to support that pruning
packed objects doesn't delete them until they are older than two weeks)
- expiration of reflogs

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> Currently I don't write new pack files when they already exist. The name of a pack file tell's you which objects are in. If I am about to create a pack file and see it exists already the I will not create it again but reuse the old one.
But I think I will change this behavior because the the different gc config parameters (e.g. pack.packSizeLimit, pack.compression) may cause that the result of a repack is different although I pack the same set of objects.

So, I'll change this comment to "new pack files" and will change the code accordingly.
