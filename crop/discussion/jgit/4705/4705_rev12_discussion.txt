DESCRIPTION

Garbage collector for FileRepositories

Implements a garbage collector for FileRepositories. Main ideas are
copied from the garbage collector for DFS based repos
(DfsGarbageCollector). Added functionalities are
- pruning loose objects
- handling of the index
- packing refs
- handling of reflogs (objects referenced from reflog will not be
pruned/)

TODO: we are still missing:
- unpacking packed objects into loose objects (to support that pruning
packed objects doesn't delete them until they are older than two weeks)
- expiration of reflogs
- support for configuration parameters (e.g. gc.pruneExpire)

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> Could we have another constructor without the expireAreMillis which would initialize the expireAgeMillis to 2 weeks?
As a user of this API this would be a more convenient way to stick to the default value.

Line:209, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> My tests show that the deleted object still stays in the ObjectDirectory.unpackedObjectCache.

If, after prune, I use the same instance of FileRepository that was passed to prune to call the "hasObject" method then it will return true for a loose object that was deleted here.

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> Done

Line:209, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> Fixed it by trying to load the object after I deleted the associated file. This will fail with a MissingObjectException and will remove the object from the cache.
