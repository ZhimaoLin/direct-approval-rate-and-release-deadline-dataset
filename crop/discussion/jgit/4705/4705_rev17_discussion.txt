DESCRIPTION

Garbage collector for FileRepositories

Implements a garbage collector for FileRepositories. Main ideas are
copied from the garbage collector for DFS based repos
(DfsGarbageCollector). Added functionalities are
- pruning loose objects
- handling of the index
- packing refs
- handling of reflogs (objects referenced from reflog will not be
pruned/)

TODO: we are still missing:
- unpacking packed objects into loose objects (to support that pruning
packed objects doesn't delete them until they are older than two weeks)
- expiration of reflogs
- support for configuration parameters (e.g. gc.pruneExpire)

Line:731, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/GC.java -> The <expireAgeMillis> is, I think, wrong syntax for javadoc.
If, in Eclipse, I put the mouse over a call to this method then the <expireAgeMillis> is not present in the text.

It should be:

 <code>expireAgeMillis</code>

Also, I think, a large part of this javadoc belongs to xxx@xxx.xxx expireAgeMillis
