DESCRIPTION

Take core.autocrlf into account for blame annotations

Blaming with core.autocrlf set to 'true' - even for freshly checked out
files - showed all lines as being locally modified. For autocrlf = true
the line breaks of the local file will be converted to LF for blaming.
This results in useful diffs and therefor in the desired blame
annotations.

For autocrlf = input no conversion takes place to cope with CRLF line
breaks in the repository, in addition to the usual LF. For autocrlf =
true CRLF line breaks in the repo can't be supported without additional
effort. In that case the whole local file will be blamed as being
locally modified.
