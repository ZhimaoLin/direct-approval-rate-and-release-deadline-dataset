DESCRIPTION

Take core.autocrlf into account for blame annotations

Blaming with core.autocrlf set to 'true' - even for freshly checked out
files - showed all lines as being locally modified. For autocrlf = true
the line breaks of the local file will be converted to LF for blaming.
This results in useful diffs and therefor in the desired blame
annotations.

For autocrlf = input no conversion takes place to cope with CRLF line
breaks in the repository, in addition to the usual LF. For autocrlf =
true CRLF line breaks in the repo can't be supported without additional
effort. In that case the whole local file will be blamed as being
locally modified.

Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BlameCommand.java -> Why?

Ideally the repp contains LF only for both INPUT and TRUE. There is no difference for the content of the repo. The only difference is what happens when the working tree copy is created.

Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BlameCommand.java -> Yes, but this method is about the working tree copy. It is canonicalized to match the repo content.

Accepting anyway, since its better and before and does not break anything else

Line:249, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/BlameCommand.java -> JGit does that on checkout, but the reason INPUT exists is because some editors does not. So we don't know the format.
