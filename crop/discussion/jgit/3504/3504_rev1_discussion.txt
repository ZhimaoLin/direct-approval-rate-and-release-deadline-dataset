Line:1081, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I'm slightly worried about doing the shorten here. It may start to come up ambiguous against other branches. We won't expand a shortened name like "review" to "refs/notes/review" because RefDatabase doesn't consider the "refs/notes/" namespace as one of the search prefixes.

This should be a different method, maybe in the NoteMap class?
