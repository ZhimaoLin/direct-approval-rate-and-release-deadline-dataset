Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> "d/f" is also included in untracked here, see:

	assertEquals(1, diff.getUntracked().size());
	assertTrue(diff.getUntracked().contains("d/f"));

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> DiffFormatter includes untracked files in general (try with a file "g" in the root). Is this also unexpected? I'm confused.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> But it should not and it appears that IndexDiff wasn't even supposed to report it, but still does, at least sometimes which is a huge performance loss in EGit. We should do things like C Git here and just report the untracked directory. Using gitignore is too complicated and in the general case will not help.

Line:151, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> My main issue here is that we should not report untracked files. Diff is for tracked files.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> I agree, here is potential for performance enhancements. The file "d/f" is a untracked file and native gits "git status -u" will also report it. But of course we would report smaller sets back to the caller if we can skip processing subtrees in case neither index nor the trees contain something below this path. Maybe we need some lookahead here while iterating over the trees. I'll make a proposal.

We should be aware that we may have to adapt some users of IndexDiff for that. I can imagine that e.g. a decorators which is called to decorate "d/f" currently expects that he gets a status for "d/f" and is not aware that he has to look whether any of the superfolders is reported to be untracked.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> The Staging view would also need to be adapted, it currently only works on files. After this, the directory "d" would be reported as untracked and could be added as a whole.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> I think the staging view should have the option to expand so one can select individual files for staging, not just the whole directory.
