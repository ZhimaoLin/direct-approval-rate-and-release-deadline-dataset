DESCRIPTION

Correct progress monitor on "Getting sizes:" phase

This counter always was running 1 higher, because it incremented
after the queue was exhausted (and every object was processed). Move
increments to be after the queue has provided a result, to ensure
we do not show a higher in-progress count than total count.
