DESCRIPTION

WIP: optimize attribute handling

Add counters to mergetAttributes() and and mergePerDirectoryEntryAttributes()
in AttributesHandler. Checking out in the EGit repository first dfbdc45 and
then 450d57a leads to 18000 calls to merge*Attributes(). Since there is only
one single file containing attributes containing a single line it looks we can
improve here.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> this is misleading, this change doesn't optimize but adds some tracing to detect what could be improved

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> That's why it is WIP and I gave it -2. In the end this change should contain the optimizations. But in this patchset, as a starting point, he is only counting.
