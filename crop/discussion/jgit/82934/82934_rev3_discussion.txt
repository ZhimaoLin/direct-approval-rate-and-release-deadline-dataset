DESCRIPTION

Unconditionally close repositories in RepositoryCache.clear()

Earlier we tried to close the repository before removing it from the
cache, so close only reduced refcount but didn't close it.

Now that we no longer leak usage count on purpose and the usage count is
now ignored anyway, there is no longer a need to run the removal twice.
