Patch Set 1:

You have to elaborate the commit message and explain what the problem is. Since Java 5 is our baseline, shouldn't all tests be run using 1.5?

As you may have noted we have actually duplicated some of the launchers. Maybe we should do that here too.

Patch Set 1:

For some reason, EE in jgit.ant.test's MANIFEST.MF was set to JavaSE-1.6, on the other hand the JRE on the classpath points to J2SE-1.5. I assumed the former is correct so I bumped Java version on the classpath. Can do it the other way round, if it makes more sense. I could fix jgit.console at the same time, as it would be the only bundle using Java 1.6 then.

Patch Set 1:

Fixing the manifest for the ant.test bundle seems like a more consistent solution.

You can't do the same with jgit.console since that one is actually dependent on Java 6.
