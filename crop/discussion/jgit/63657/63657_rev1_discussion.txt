DESCRIPTION

Fix TransportException when reading bundle.

When reading a bundle file, commit messages who's oneline format is longer than
982 characters caused JGit to treat subsequent text in the commit as a SHA,
then throw a TransportException because it's not a valid SHA.

Now the readLine method will read all the way to the end of the line, not just the first 1024 characters of it.
