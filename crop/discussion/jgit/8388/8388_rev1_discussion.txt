DESCRIPTION

ResetCommand: Use DirCacheBuilder in resetIndex

With bug 391855, DirCacheEditor's PathEdit will be applied for each
stage. For an unmerged path, this would result in 3 equal entries for
the same path.

By using a DirCacheBuilder, the code is simpler and does not have the
above problem with unmerged paths.

Bug: 391860
