DESCRIPTION

ResetCommand: Use DirCacheBuilder in resetIndex

With bug 391855, DirCacheEditor's PathEdit will be applied for each
stage. For an unmerged path, this would result in 3 equal entries for
the same path.

By using a DirCacheBuilder, the code is simpler and does not have the
above problem with unmerged paths.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

After running multiple tests locally... I was unable to reproduce the test failure. The tests pass also on Hudson. I'm comfortable enough to submit this to master and see if anyone else hits the issue.
