DESCRIPTION

Allow configurable ObjectCheckers in fetch

RecievePack already honors fsck settings for safeForWindows and
safeForMacOS.  Allow those same checks to be performed during fetch
through a caller-configurable ObjectChecker.

Default the fetch fsck options to match the current platform, as
it can be reasonably assumed the repository will be accessed here.

Patch Set 1:

FYI, I want this so we can ensure our JGit based cron fetcher can honor the configuration in the repository and avoid pulling in case conflicts to a cross-platform repository, e.g. "foo.c" and "Foo.c".
