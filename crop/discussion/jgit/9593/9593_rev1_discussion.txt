DESCRIPTION

RFC Add API to DfsObjDatabase for open/write by pack extension.

Previously, the DfsObjDatabase had a hardcoded getPackFile() and
getPackIndex() methods which opens a .pack and .idx file, respectively.
A future change to add a bitmap index will need to be stored in a
parallel .bitmap file. Update the DfsObjDatabase to support opening and
writing of files for any pack extension.

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> consistently static import members. since you imported one, import the other.

Line:664, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/dfs/DfsReader.java -> don't rely on toString(). toString() is for debugging and may contain nasty data that isn't useful in an exception. use getFile(".pack") or whatever to get a clean name for messages.

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/dfs/DfsPackCompactor.java -> Nit: Use static import to avoid such long lines.

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> Nit: Try to fit this all on one line:

  /** A pack file extension. */

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> Consider static import.

Line:254, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/dfs/DfsInserter.java -> static import?
