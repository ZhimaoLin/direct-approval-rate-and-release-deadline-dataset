DESCRIPTION

Replace DeltaWindow array with circularly linked list

Typical window sizes are 10 and 250 (although others are accepted).
In either case the pointer overhead of 1 pointer in an array or
2 pointers for a double linked list is trivial.  A doubly linked
list as used here for window=250 is only another 1024 bytes on a
32 bit machine, or 2048 bytes on a 64 bit machine.

The critical search loops scan through the array in either the
previous direction or the next direction until the cycle is finished,
or some other scan abort condition is reached.  Loading the next
object's pointer from a field in the current object avoids the
branch required to test for wrapping around the edge of the array.
It also saves the array bounds check on each access.

When a delta is chosen the window is shuffled to hoist the currently
selected base as an earlier candidate for the next object. Moving
the window entry is easier in a double-linked list than sliding a
group of array entries.
