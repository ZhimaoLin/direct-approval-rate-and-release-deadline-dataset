DESCRIPTION

Replace DeltaWindow array with circularly linked list

Typical window sizes are 10 and 250.  In either case the pointer
overhead of 1 pointer in an array or 2 pointers for a double linked
list is trivial.  A doubly linked list as used here for window=250 is
only another 1024 bytes on a 32 bit machine.

The critical search loops scan through the array in either the
previous direction or the next direction until the cycle is finished,
or another abort condition is reached.  Loading the next object's
pointer from a field in the current object avoids the branch required
to test for wrapping around the edge of the array.  It also saves the
array bounds check, and does not need to assume this is cheap on the
JVM, nor does it rely on the JIT to be able to see the code always
stays within the bounds.

When a delta is chosen the window is shuffled to save the currently
selected base.  Shuffling the window using a double linked list is
faster than sliding a segment of array entries.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Very nice refactoring. This is much more readable. I wish this was the way it looked the first time I tried to understand the code :)

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/DeltaWindow.java -> nit: comment does not match reality

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/DeltaWindow.java -> nit: this can be moved into the for loop init statement.

Line:458, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/DeltaWindow.java -> nit: this could be a for loop like you did above (or vice versa)

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/DeltaWindow.java -> Done

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/DeltaWindow.java -> Doing so causes the line to wrap. Its two lines either way. This reads cleaner to me than making the for loop span two lines.

Line:458, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/DeltaWindow.java -> Done
