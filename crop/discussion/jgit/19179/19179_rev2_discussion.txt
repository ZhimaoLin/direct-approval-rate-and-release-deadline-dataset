DESCRIPTION

Add recursive variant of Config.getNames() methods

These methods allow to find all configuration entry names for a given
section or section/subsection searching recursively through all base
configurations of the given configuration.

These methods are needed to calculate the names for the effective
configuration of a git repository which combines the configuration entry
names found in the repository, global and system configuration files

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> Why don't you keep the old assert? It's still relevant. Note the difference in case. And now that I think of that, how does the new getNames deal with differences in case?

I think it should keep the first encountered spelling as the listed key.

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> your right, I must have been blind to not spot the case difference and I don't correctly handle case in the recursive case, good catch :-(

Looks like I must handle recursion in ConfigSnapshot.getNames
