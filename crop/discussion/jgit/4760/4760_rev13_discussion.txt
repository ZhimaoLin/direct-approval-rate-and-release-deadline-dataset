Patch Set 13: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

IndexMessage and WorkingDirectoryMessage are wrong (here message of HEAD commit is "Revert "ignore""):

   WIP on dssd: AbbreviatedObjectId[10a1131] Revert "ignore"

native git instead creates the following message

   WIP on dssd: 10a1131 Revert "ignore"

Also fixed the message formatting issues you mentionend.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StashCreateCommand.java -> No, the RevWalk constructor that takes an ObjectReader is used here and that same reader is used elsewhere and disposed on line 299 in a finally block.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StashCreateCommand.java -> shouldn't the walk be disposed after use ?
