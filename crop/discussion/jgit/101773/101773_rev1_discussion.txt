DESCRIPTION

Use w1 for hashCode of AbbreviatedObjectId

Very short abbreviations that are under 8 hex digits do not
have values in w2. Use w1 as the Java hashCode() instead, so
that the prefix of the abbreviation is always included in the
hashing function used by any java.util.Collection type.

Tests need to be updated.

Is anyone outside the JGit library depending on this hash value?

No, they should not be depending on it. We have no contract on the stability of hashCode values across JGit versions.
