DESCRIPTION

Only attempt delta on objects at least 40 bytes in size

The delta search code requires objects to be at least one full
block of 16 bytes in order to hash the content. So 16 is a hard
lower bound on the size of object allowed to be delta compressed.
This is the test that used to be used by PackWriter.

DeltaWindow however has a different threshold. If the object size
is less than 40 bytes it computes a negative limit which confuses
later parts of the delta search logic. This is caused by a rule that
wants deltas to be at least 50% of the size of the whole object,
after taking into account the worst-case of a REF_DELTA's pointer
to its base.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Turns out this is not necessary, there is already a different guard that says at least 8 bytes is required for the delta header itself. Negative values are smaller than that so they fail the guard and no delta is attempted.
