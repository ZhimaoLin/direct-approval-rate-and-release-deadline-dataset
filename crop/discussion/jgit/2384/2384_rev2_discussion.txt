DESCRIPTION

PackWriter: Correct 'Compressing objects' progress message

The first 'Compressing objects' progress message is wrong, its
actually PackWriter looking up the sizes of each object in the
ObjectDatabase, so objects can be sorted correctly in the later
type-size sort that tries to take advantage of "Linus' Law" to
improve delta compression.

Rename the progress to say 'Getting sizes', which is an accurate
description of what it is doing.
