DESCRIPTION

buck: Make :jgit_src target work in cross-cell environment

This artifact is used from unzip utility in Gerrit Code Review
build toolchain and thus the file must exist on the file system.
Moreover, trying to use java_binary() didn't work either, as the
zip layout was wrong: all file contained 'org.eclipse.jgit/src/'
prefix.
