DESCRIPTION

Better way to handle relative URLs in manifest XML

The old implementation will NOT strip the filename part from the baseUrl, e.g.
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest with .. will be resolved to
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/, which is actually wrong. This
implementation will resolve it to https://android.googlesource.com/ to match the
behavior of repo.

I like this code better for sure. This code path is tested, right?

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Repo strips trailing slashes. Have we already trimmed trailing slashes at this point?

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> baseUrl is passed from caller, so if the caller give us something like "https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/", it won't work but it's the caller's fault?

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> Eh, this is way better than the status quo anyway.

I think as a follow-up change it would be nice to either strip off the trailing / or diagnose it with an exception. I don't remember whether repo does other normalization (e.g., does it strip off a trailing /.git?).

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> These kind of normalizations are just trying to correct some common errors on the user's side if I understood correctly? I think it should be OK to be more strict on user's errors, as long as we work as expected if user was correct?

Also ".git" at the end shouldn't be a problem, but I'm not sure why people would add "/.git" :(

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> No, I don't think they're user error. But let's leave this for a separate change. :)
