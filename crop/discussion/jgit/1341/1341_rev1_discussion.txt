DESCRIPTION

Make ObjectId.hashCode final too

Since equals() is now final and does not permit being overridden,
we should do the same thing with hashCode() to prevent different
subclasses from having different hashing behaviors.  This could
lead to the same mess that we had with different equals() behaviors.
