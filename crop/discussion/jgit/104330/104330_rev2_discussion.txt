DESCRIPTION

Fix missing RefsChangedEvent when packed refs are used

With atomic ref updates using packed refs, JGit did not fire a
RefsChangedEvent. This resulted in a user-visible regression in
EGit: the UI would not update after a "Fetch from upstream...".
Presumably it would also make Gerrit miss out on ref changes?

Strengthen the BatchRefUpdateTest by also asserting the expected
number of RefsChangedEvents, and ensure modCnt is incremented in
RefDirectory.commitPackedRefs() when refs really changed (as opposed
to some internal housekeeping operation, such as packing loose refs).
