Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

This rhymes badly with JGit being advertized as a pure Java client. There is no reason http push could not be implemented in Java too.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit; No score

ACK what Robin said, HTTP push support should be completely pure Java and not fork out to C Git.

My change I8c69b16ac15c442e1a4c3bd60b4ea1a47882b851 adds the new smart HTTP push support which matches the new HTTP push support that came out in Git 1.6.6.

What's missing is still WebDAV based push support.  But this wouldn't be too different from the TransportAmazonS3 case.  You just need to add WebDAV locking semantics around updates of certain files.  Or play it risky like the S3 code does and assume nobody else is writing at the same time as you.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

It was a workaround to make the push work. I knew that was wrong to commit it here, unfortunately my manager (Hayden Meyers) forced me to commit this patch, expecting that this would have been accepted. 
Sorry about this...
