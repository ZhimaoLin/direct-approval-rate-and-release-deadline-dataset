DESCRIPTION

DeleteBranchCommand does not clean up upstream configuration

It wrongly uses the full name of the branch to remove the
configuration entries but must use the shortened one.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Line:181, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/DeleteBranchCommand.java -> Unrelated to this change, but why does this take refs/heads/foo instead of foo?

I expected the command to take "foo" and prefix that with R_HEADS for me.  Unless I setRemote(true), in which case it would prefix with R_REMOTES.
