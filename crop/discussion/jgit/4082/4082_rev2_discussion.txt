DESCRIPTION

Enable full Transport configuration for JGit API commands

Add a TransportConfigCallback parameter to JGit API commands, to allow
consumers of the JGit command API to perform custom Transport configuration
that would be otherwise difficult to anticipate & expose on the API command
builders.


My specific use-case is configuring additional properties on SshTransport
- I need to take over the SshSessionFactory used by the transport. Using
TransportConfigCallback I can simply do this (rather than reimplement the
API command classes):

public void configure(Transport tn) {
  if (tn instanceof SshTransport) {
    ((SshTransport) tn).setSshSessionFactory(factoryProvider.get());
  }
}

Adding an explicit setSshSessionFactory() method to the JGit command
classes would bloat the API. Also, creating the replacement
SshSessionFactory is unnecessary if the transport is not SSH, but the type
of the Transport is only known once the remote has been resolved and the
URI parsed - consequently it makes sense to perform this step in a
callback, where the transport instance can be inspected to determine if
it's of a relevant type.


A note about where this leaves the API - there are now 4 commands:

CloneCommand
PullCommand
FetchCommand
PushCommand

-that share 3 identical transport-related parameters:

timeout
credentialsProvider
transportConfigurator

I think there's potential for introducing an interface or val-object to
identify/encapsulate this repetition, which I'd be happy to do in a
subsequent commit.
