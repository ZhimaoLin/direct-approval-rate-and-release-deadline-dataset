DESCRIPTION

blame: Reduce running time ~4.5% by skipping common subtrees

With this commit running blame on render_view_impl.cc[1] saves
about 644 ms over prior versions, reducing the time about 4.5%.

Large projects often contain strands of commits where no changes
are made to a particular subtree. Blame used to dive recursively
into these subtrees to look for the blob and check if its SHA-1
was changed. In chromium/src[1] only 20% of the commits modify
the content/renderer subtree relevant for the file.

The recursivePath is necessary to check for '/' and remember
if common subtree elimination should be attempted. When a file
lives within a subtree the extra cost to check for unmodified
subtrees saves time. However for files in the root tree the
extra work incurred by TreeWalk is not worthwhile and would
significantly increase overall running time.

Now typical running times from an otherwise idle desktop:

  real	0m13.387s  0m13.341s  0m13.443s
  user	0m15.410s  0m15.220s  0m15.350s

previously:

  real	0m14.085s  0m14.049s  0m13.968s
  user	0m15.730s  0m15.820s  0m15.770s
