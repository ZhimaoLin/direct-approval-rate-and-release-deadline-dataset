DESCRIPTION

Fix infinite loop in IndexPack

A programming error using the Inflater API led to an infinite
loop within IndexPack, caused by the Inflater returning 0 from
the inflate() method, but it didn't want more input.  This happens
when it has reached the end of the stream, or has reached a spot
asking for an external dictionary.  Such a case is a failure for us,
and we should abort out.

Thanks to Alex for pointing out that we had 3 implementations of
the inflate rountine, which should be consolidated into one and
use a switch to determine where to load data from.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Can we fix the comment? Otherwise it looks much better than it was before :)

Line:951, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IndexPack.java -> The argument is called 'keep' but this is phrased as 'do not discard' - similarly, there's a 'discard' synonym for 'do not keep'. Either we should change the var (keep -> discard) or we should change the comment to be 'keep' and 'do not keep'

Patch Set 2:

I failed to get the infinte loop by truncating one of the 5900 byte long packfiles. At no length did it loop. Did you fix a loop here?

I did complain about the inflate usage in some other piece of code, but that was a different pattern.
