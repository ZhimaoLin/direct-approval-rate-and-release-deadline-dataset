DESCRIPTION

Fixed Merge Algorithm regarding concurrent file creations

When in OURS and THEIRS a new file is created we want a conflict
when the two contents differ. If on two branches the same file
with the same content is created this should not be a conflict.
But: the current merge algorithm is throwing NPEs in this case.
Fix this by choosing an empty RawText as common base if the
base is empty.

- verified
- looks good except minor style nit

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> style-nit: as this is a constant this should probably be all upper case : EMPTY_TEXT

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I agree with Matthias, this should be EMPTY_TEXT.

Also, Gerrit Code Review defines an EMPTY_TEXT constant itself.  Maybe put this in RawText as a public static final constant so I can drop the one in Gerrit?  (My point here is, some applications probably also need the empty text the same way you need it here, so it should be a standard constant we export.)

Line:463, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Style-nit: Parens aren't necessary around the conditional.

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Its now a constant in the RawText class itself

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Done

Line:463, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> that rule is new to me. I thought the parens together with the ? operator are ok. But ok - I'll removed them
