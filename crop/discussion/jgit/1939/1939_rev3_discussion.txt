DESCRIPTION

Fixed Merge Algorithm regarding concurrent file creations

When in OURS and THEIRS a new file is created we want a conflict
when the two contents differ. If on two branches the same file
with the same content is created this should not be a conflict.
But: the current merge algorithm is throwing NPEs in this case.
Fix this by choosing an empty RawText as common base if the
base is empty.
