DESCRIPTION

Fixed Merge Algorithm regarding concurrent file creations

When in OURS and THEIRS a new file is created we want a conflict
when the two contents differ. If on two branches the same file
with the same content is created this should not be a conflict.
But: the current merge algorithm is throwing NPEs in this case.
Fix this by choosing an empty RawText as common base if the
base is empty.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> Style-nit: Constants should be declared before instance members, and public constants before private constants.  So this should be the first declaration in the class.
