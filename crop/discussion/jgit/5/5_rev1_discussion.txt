DESCRIPTION

Make it possible to clear a PlotCommitList

This allows SwingGraphPanes to be reused by simply clearing and
re-filling. Requires RevObjectList initialization to not call clear()
from its constructor, because this will lead PlotCommitList.clear()
to be called before all variables have been initialized.
