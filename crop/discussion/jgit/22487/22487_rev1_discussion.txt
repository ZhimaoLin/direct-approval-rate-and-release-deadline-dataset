DESCRIPTION

Detects background authentication, and force use of jgit authentication

Sun HttpURLConnection is able to handle authentication like SPNEGO without
caller intervention. However, there are some restrictions:
- do not need user intervention (user,password for example)
- it doesn't work when request body is chunked/streamed (because it cannot be
replayed)

Unfortunately there is no real way to leverage HttpURLConnection authentication
work as the authentication header is stripped off the request before returning
to the caller. There's also no way to disable explicitly authentication in
HttpURLConnection (SPNEGO auth will always be attempted if a valid token can be
created by GSSAPI).

This is an issue for jgit since it is expected that the first request will be
used to detect authentication method, and reuse for the subsequent requests.

This patch modifies TransportHTTP to detect authentication done in the background
by HttpURLConnection and sets the jgit authentication method accordingly so it will
always work for future requests (assuming that the authentication method used by
HttpURLConnection is also supported by jgit).

Looks quite good already. Minor comments, missing tests. I want tests because I am more interested to prove that you don't break existing authentications and not so much that  SPNEGO works.

Line:464, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> After reading the commit message I was expecting a much bigger implementation :-)

Line:471, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> I am wondering whether for this thing we could write tests. We do start in some of our unit tests our own git server, push/fetch to it, inspect the requests this server got, ... By that it should be possible to see/test this change in behaviour you introduce here.
Look at SimpleHttpServer.java or in EGit in PushTest.java.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't understand this restriction "do not need user intervention". Do you mean that it will not work when user intervention is required? Please rephrase

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I read this sentence multiple times before I think I understood. Maybe replacing "disable explicitly" by "explicitly disabling" would make it easier. Or "... no way to disable implicit authentication of HttpURLConnection ..." .

Trying to add tests but the way HTTP auth works make this code only useful for SPNego and has no effect on other auth methods.

Open to suggestion

Line:471, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Do you have any suggestion on how I could achieve this? I tried several approaches but it only works with SPNego which is not really easy to mock.

I tried for example to check what happens if auth info is provided using Java Authenticator, but it won't work in this case because basic auth doesn't send again WWW-Authenticate header once authenticated. SPNego will send it as per http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt

Line:507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> style nit: remove this unrelated change introducing a trailing whitespace

Line:469, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:471, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportHttp.java -> Can you describe how to test this manually ?
