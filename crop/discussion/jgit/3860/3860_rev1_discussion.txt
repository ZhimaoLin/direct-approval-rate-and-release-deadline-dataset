Looks good except a few minor things.

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> Style-nit: trailing whitespace.

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> Style-nit: trailing whitespace.

Line:180, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommandTest.java -> Looks like this test is doing the same as the testFastForwardWithFiles test. Or?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo. Should either be:

 Tests were added

or:

 Test was added

Patch Set 1: (5 inline comments)

I screwed up a bit with Patch Sets but the last one seems fine.

I committed fixes as separate commit with same Change-Id on my fix branch. Then rebased it on top of the most recent changes from upstream. Then pushed to gerrit. For some reason only first commit from my branch was recognized that's why my second Patch Set looks exactly as first. The third patch set is the result of soft reset and ammend of my fixes from second commit into third. I hope this won't affect merging of my changes.

init - - - a  < - master

In testFastForwardWithFiles there are 2 commits and no actual merge. Tree looks like this

   a   - - -  b  <- master
   |          |
branch1  branch1

      merge
