DESCRIPTION

Allow clients to ask for smart-http during info/refs

HTTP clients can signal they are smart HTTP clients by requesting

  GET /$GIT_DIR/info/refs?want=smart-http HTTP/1.1

If smart-http is requested the returned info/refs file includes a
server capability string on the first ref line, separated off of
the ref name using a NUL byte.  E.g.

  74ba6f...\trefs/heads/master\0 smart-http\n
