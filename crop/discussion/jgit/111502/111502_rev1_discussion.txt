Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableCompactor.java -> Is it possible for minUpdateIndex to be -1 at this point? Could it e.g. check for it and throw IllegalStateException?

What should minUpdateIndex and maxUpdateIndex be if there are no refs to write? Is that a caller error or is it a case that can come up?

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableCompactor.java -> Good catch!  Currently, compactor may write an empty reftable with minUpdateIndex = maxUpdateIndex = 0, so let's not change this behavior.
