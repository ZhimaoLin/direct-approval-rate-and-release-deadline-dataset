DESCRIPTION

RemoteRefUpdate: Accept Ref and ObjectId arguments for source

Applications may already have a Ref or ObjectId on hand that they want
the remote to be updated to.  Instead of converting these into a
String and relying on the parsing rules of resolve(), allow the
application to supply the Ref or ObjectId directly.
