DESCRIPTION

In TestRepository, use a consistent clock

The default author and committer objects in TestRepository were
initialized statically and did not use the MockSystemReader passed into
the TestRepository ctor. Make these fields non-static and initialize
them with a consistent clock.

Also make the author and commiter name and email strings public for
tests that want to verify against them.
