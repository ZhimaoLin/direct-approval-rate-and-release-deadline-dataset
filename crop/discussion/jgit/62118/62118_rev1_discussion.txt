Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ChainingCredentialsProvider.java -> I think we should also clarify the javadoc of CredentialsProvider#get(URIish, CredentialItem...) . Currently it is said that p.get(...) will return false if "the user canceled the request ...". If the user really canceled the request I am not sure whether continuing with the next provider in the chain is correct. But our implementations are different. E.g. NetRCCredentialsProvider will return false if it doesn't find an appropriate entry and in this case continuing with the next credentialsprovider is correct.
