DESCRIPTION

Support CredentialsProvider for SSH connections

When setting up an SSH connection, use the caller supplied
CredentialsProvider, if one has been given to the Transport
or was defined as the default.

The CredentialsProvider is re-wrapped as a JSch UserInfo,
allowing the connection to use this for user interactive
prompts.  This give a unified API for authentication on
any transport type.
