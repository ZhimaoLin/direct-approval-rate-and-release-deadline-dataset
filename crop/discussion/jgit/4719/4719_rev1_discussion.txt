DESCRIPTION

Fix History rendering

There was the possibility that during history rendering we draw a lane
"trough" a passed commit. Vadim Dmitriev found that out in bug 335818. 
I added the needed check to that block of code where it was missing.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I have to add a test which proves that this one fixes history rendering. Up to know I was not able to produce such a test, but I am proposing this early to get feedback from those who have problems with history rendering.

Patch Set 1:

- can we close the associated bug ?
- I will cherry-pick this to stable-1.2 as this was a bug confusing quite a number of users
