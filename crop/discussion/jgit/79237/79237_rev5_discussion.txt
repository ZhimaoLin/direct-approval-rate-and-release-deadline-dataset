Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> side note: This dependency isn't really necessary --- we could avoid it by hard-coding 403. But I don't mind it. (Just commenting to remind myself what to do in case it comes up later.)

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> Please add a @since comment xxx@xxx.xxx 4.5).

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> Likewise.
