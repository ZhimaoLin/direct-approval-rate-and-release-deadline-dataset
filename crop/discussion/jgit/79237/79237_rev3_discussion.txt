I like it.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> final?

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> optional: it would be nice to have a constructor that takes both status code and cause

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ServiceMayNotContinueException.java -> unrelated: this can do 'super(msg, cause)' now that we require Java 7.
