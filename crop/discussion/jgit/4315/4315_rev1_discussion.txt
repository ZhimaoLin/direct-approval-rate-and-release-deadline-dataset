DESCRIPTION

Do not requeue state vector in stateless RPC fetch

If the no-done capability was enabled on the connection, don't
queue up the state vector again once the ACK %s ready message
is observed from the remote. The pack will be following in this
response stream, so the state vector is no longer required.
