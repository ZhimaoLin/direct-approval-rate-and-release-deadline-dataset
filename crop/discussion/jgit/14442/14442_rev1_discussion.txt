DESCRIPTION

Add tests for for DirCacheCheckout and symlinks

DirCacheCheckout had a bug when the parentdirectory of a worktree was a
symlink. DirCacheCheckout was deleting those symlinks under certain
conditions. This was fixed in I81735ba0394ef6794e9b2b8bdd8bd7e8b9c6460f
without a test because previously it was hard to setup tests containing
symlinks. Since we can now write such tests I add a test for this
situation.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTestWithSymlinks.java -> style nit: we put the license header at the top of the file

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTestWithSymlinks.java -> s/with where/where/

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTestWithSymlinks.java -> why not fix teardown instead ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/for for/for/

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this sentence doesn't add value to the commit message

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> we usually put bug references at the top of the footers

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTestWithSymlinks.java -> Done

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTestWithSymlinks.java -> Done

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.java7.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTestWithSymlinks.java -> Done. The problem was that we had

  /trashDir/
    testRepo/
      .git/
      ...
    symlink -> /trashDir
 
The symlink was pointing to his own parent directory. This cause problems during recursive deletion of the hierarchy which I don't want to fix in this change.

Instead I changed it to

  /trashDir/
    repos/
      testRepo/
        .git/
        ...
    symlink -> /trashDir/repos
