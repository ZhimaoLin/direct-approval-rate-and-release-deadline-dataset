DESCRIPTION

Add tests for DirCacheCheckout and symlinks

DirCacheCheckout had a bug when the parentdirectory of a worktree was a
symlink. DirCacheCheckout was deleting those symlinks under certain
conditions. This was fixed in I81735ba0394ef6794e9b2b8bdd8bd7e8b9c6460f
without a test because previously it was hard to setup tests containing
symlinks.
