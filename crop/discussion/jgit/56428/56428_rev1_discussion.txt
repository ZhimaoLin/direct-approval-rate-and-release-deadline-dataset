See comment, I would like to check performance results first.

Line:363, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/ignore/internal/Strings.java -> This is the right method but too big hammer. It will need at least two string objects to create and so on. 
Since ignore rules have a huge impact on jgit performance I would try to start small...

BTW thanks to this issue I've found another one, see bug 478065 :-).
