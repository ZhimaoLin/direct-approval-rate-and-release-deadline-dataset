DESCRIPTION

Enhance reading of git-rebase-todo formatted files

Reading and writing files formatted like the git-rebase-todo files was
hidden in the RebaseCommand. Certain constructs (like leading
tabs+spaces) have not been handled as in native git. Also the upcoming
rebase interactive feature in EGit needs reading/writing these files
independent from a RebaseCommand. Therefore reading and writing those
files has been refactored to the Repository class. RebaseCommand gets
smaller because of that and doesn't have to deal with reading/writing
files.
Additional tests for empty todo-list files, or files containing comments
have been added.

Line:1643, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> this is a lot of code to create a test commit, I'd use RepositoryTestCase.commitFile() to simplify this

Line:1646, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> why do we need this assertion here ? add and commit commands are tested elsewhere

Line:1661, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RebaseCommandTest.java -> there is no side branch, all commits are done using master branch, so this message is misleading

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RebaseTodoFile.java -> formatting nit: either this line could be formatted on one line or line 109 is too wide

Line:42, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> s/comment/comment line/

Line:61, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RebaseTodoLine.java -> I think this enum is easier to read if you add a blank line between the enum values

Line:202, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RebaseTodoLine.java -> style nit: no braces around single line block

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RebaseTodoLine.java -> s/on that//
