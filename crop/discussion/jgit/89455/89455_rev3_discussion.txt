DESCRIPTION

gc: loosen unreferenced objects

An unreferenced object might appear in a pack.  This could only happen
because it was previously referenced, and then later that reference
was removed.  When we gc, we copy the referenced objects into a new
pack, and delete the old pack.  This would remove the unreferenced
object.  Now we first create a loose object from any unreferenced
object in the doomed pack.  This kicks off the two-week grace period
for that object, after which it will be collected if it's not
referenced.

This matches the behavior of regular git.
