DESCRIPTION

Add methods which write MERGE_HEAD and MERGE_MSG

Add methods to the Repository class which write into MERGE_HEAD
and MERGE_MSG files. Since we have the read methods in the same
class this seems to be the right place.

Line:1568, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> great, since also the last Id gets a \n I can get rid of some code and one variable here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/MergeHeadMsgTest.java -> We should test the write functionality by actually reading the file here and making sure the format is what we expect, rather than relying on the read code path.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1568, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> We always should be writing an LF after each ID.  Also, the IDs know how to copy themselves out better:

  id.copyTo(fos);
  id.write('\n');

Because of these tiny writes, the FileOutputStream should be a BufferedOutputStream so we can write everything in a single system call, rather than two syscalls per object being merged.
