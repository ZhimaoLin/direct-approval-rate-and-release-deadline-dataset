DESCRIPTION

Add methods which write MERGE_HEAD and MERGE_MSG

Add methods to the Repository class which write into MERGE_HEAD
and MERGE_MSG files. Since we have the read methods in the same
class this seems to be the right place.

I'll fix up the decode issue during cherry-pick.

Line:1482, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Hmm.  We must have missed this earlier.  We probably should be a bit more forgiving and use RawParseUtils.decode().  Its possible the commit message is already in UTF-8.  Or that its a local encoding.  RawParseUtils will fall back to the local decoding if its not UTF-8.
