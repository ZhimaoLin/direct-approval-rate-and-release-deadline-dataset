DESCRIPTION

Added the standard SULA for JGit

The Eclipse Foundation requires the standard SULA be present
in every feature. We had the license present via edl-v10.html
but we were missing the SULA via the license.html file. The
fix is to simply add the SULA.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Thanks for schooling me on git push Shawn.

This should be good for us to meet the Foundation's SULA requirements.
