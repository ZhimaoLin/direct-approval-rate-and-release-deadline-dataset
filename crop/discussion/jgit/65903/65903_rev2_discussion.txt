DESCRIPTION

Fix diff for added and removed submodule

Since If13f7b406, submodule difference are shown as a hunk. The issue
was that added and removed submodule were considered as Edit.REPLACE
instead of Edit.INSERT and Edit.DELETE in the DiffFormatter result.

Why do you want this on stable-4.1 ?
4.2 was release so preferable next service releases is 4.2.1

Gerrit is using v4.1.1.201511131810-r on the stable-2.12 branch, which is where this fix is targeted.

Between v4.1.1.201511131810-r and v4.2.0.201601211800-r (which we use on Gerrit master) there are 235 commits (not including merges):

  $ git log --oneline --no-merges v4.1.1.201511131810-r..v4.2.0.201601211800-r | wc -l
  235

whereas if we take another release off stable-4.1 we only get this specific fix:

  $ git log --oneline v4.1.1.201511131810-r..df904a4227360741635bf7aa6a6ad5e39057b343
  df904a4 Fix diff for added and removed submodule
  3e2aff1 Prepare 4.1.2-SNAPSHOT builds

So to minimise risk of degrades/regression, I would prefer to have another release off stable-4.1 if it is possible.

Do you have a plan for when 4.1.2 will be released? I would like to release Gerrit 2.12.1 within the next week or so, and I will need the new Jgit for that.
