DESCRIPTION

Avoid reading huge files into memory

When reading refs, avoid reading huge files that were put there
accidentally, but still read the top of e.g. FETCH_HEAD, which
may be longer than our limit. We're only interested in the first line
anyway.

Line:89, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IO.java -> This isn't always the complete contents. If the contents exceeds the limit, then only the limit is returned.

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IO.java -> I think its unnecessary to allocate a ByteArrayOutputStream here. Instead you can write the method as:

  FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(path);
  try {
    byte[] buf = new byte[limit];
    int cnt = 0;
    for (;;) {
      int n = in.read(buf, cnt, buf.length - cnt);
      if (n <= 0)
        break;
      cnt += n;
    }
    if (cnt == buf.length)
      return buf;
    byte[] res = new byte[cnt];
    System.arraycopy(buf, 0, res, 0, cnt);
    return res;
  } finally {
    try {
      in.close();
    } catch (IOException ignored) {
    }
  }

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is a bit too vague, lots of JGit reads files. I would rephrase the subject as:

  Support reading first SHA-1 from large FETCH_HEAD files

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please fix this line, it shouldn't say Change-Id twice.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> What is this line? Is it missing a Signed-off-by that you meant to put here, or something else?
