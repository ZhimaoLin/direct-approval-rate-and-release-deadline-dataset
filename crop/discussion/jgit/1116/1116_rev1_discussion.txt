DESCRIPTION

Honor pack.windowlimit to cap memory usage during packing

The pack.windowlimit configuration parameter places an upper bound
on the number of bytes used by the DeltaWindow class as it scans
through the object list.  If memory usage would exceed the limit
the window is temporarily decreased in size to keep memory used
within that bound.
