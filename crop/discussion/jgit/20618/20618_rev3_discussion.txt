DESCRIPTION

Fix RevWalkUtils.findBranchesReachableFrom not finding some branches

The "cut off" optimization causes it to not include branches that
contain the specified commit but happen to share commits with a branch
that does not contain the commit.

An example:

      -B foo
        \
    -A---C master

findBranchesReachableFrom for commit A with both branches as input may
not return master (depending on the order of the input). The reason is
that A is not contained in foo, and therefore the old code would put B
in the cutOff set. When then walking the master commits and B is
checked, it is found in the cutOff set and the walk is aborted, causing
master not to be returned even though it should.
