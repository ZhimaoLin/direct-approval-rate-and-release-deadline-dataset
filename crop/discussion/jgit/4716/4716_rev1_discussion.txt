DESCRIPTION

Discard request HTTP bodies for status code <400

The HTTP RFCs require a server to fully consume the request body before
it can return a non-error status code, which is any code below 400.

JGit returns most Git level errors inside of an HTTP 200 OK response,
and sometimes this happens before the entire request was consumed from
the servlet container. In such cases the body must be skipped or read
until EOF is reached, ensuring the HTTP keep-alive semantics will work
for the next request on the same TCP connection.

HTTP status codes >= 400 may be returned without consuming the body,
and a servlet container must set "Connection: close" in the response
headers when this happens, since the state of the request body is not
well defined with an early abort.

With the introduction of sendError() in GitSmartHttpTools there are
only a handful of locations that need to worry about the request body
being consumed, so sprinkle the call in as necessary.
