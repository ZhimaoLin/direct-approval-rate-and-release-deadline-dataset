DESCRIPTION

Fixed ordering of Config.getSubsections(...)

A standard HashSet was being used to store the list of subsections as
they were being parsed.  This was changed to use a LinkedHashSet so
that iterating over the set would return values in the same order as
they are listed in the config file.
