DESCRIPTION

Don't allow null name or e-mail in PersonIdent

toExternalString, equals and hashCode don't expect them to be null, so
explicitly disallow it in the constructor.

Also fix the documentation of setAuthor and setCommitter in
CommitCommand when specifying name and email as separate arguments.
