Line:405, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Maybe add a comment here explaining that only the root folder of a ignored folder hierarchy is reported. If a/b/c is listed in the .gitignore then you should not expect a/b/c/d/e/f to be reported here. Only a/b/c will be reported.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> The only place where you add stuff to 'ignoredPaths' is inside a block which we enter only if we don't find an entry in the index. What is with files which are listed in .gitignore but which have been added to the index before?

git init
echo a > a
git add a
git commit -m initial
echo b > b
git add b
echo b > .gitignore

When processing b dm would be different from 0 although b is ignored, or?

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> Why two local variables (wi and workingTreeIterator) both pointing to workingTree(tw). Let's use only  'wi' and move it's initialisation up the place where you first need it.

Line:405, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Done

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> Good point. I changed the method documentation and also the method name of IndexDiff.getIgnored to getIgnoredNotInIndex.
For EGit decoration purposes the ignored state of files is not relevant if they are part of the index. These files get a "+" decoration stating that they have been added.

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/IndexDiffFilter.java -> Done
