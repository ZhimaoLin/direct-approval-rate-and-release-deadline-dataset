Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

looks like you unintentionally squashed two unrelated changes (--squash option for merge and grafts support)

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/GraftsDatabase.java -> wrong timestamp, we have 2012

this class seems unrelated to this change

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileGraftsDataBaseTest.java -> wrong timestamp, we have 2012

how is this new class related to this change ?
