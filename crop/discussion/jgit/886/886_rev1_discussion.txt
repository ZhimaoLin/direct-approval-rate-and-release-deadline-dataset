DESCRIPTION

Begin abstracting Repository off the filesystem

Not every valid Git repository needs to live on the filesystem.
Some might live strictly in memory, such as during a JUnit test case.
Pull most of the important data structures and functions up into
the new GitRepository base class, which Repository extends.

The resolve(String) method was rewritten in terms of RevWalk, which
actually makes the code quite a bit simpler to follow, and should
allow it to parse expressions faster, as there is less parsing and
conversion overhead occurring per node that it has to traverse.

This refactoring is still incomplete.  We've pushed it through a
number of the core data classes like RevWalk, TreeWalk, and
Commit/Tag/Tree.  But all of the transport code is still relying on
the standard Repository class.  To try and keep changes readable,
we'll do more of the refactoring in subsequent commits.  This much
however needs to be done at once just to keep a compiled and working
implementation of the project.
