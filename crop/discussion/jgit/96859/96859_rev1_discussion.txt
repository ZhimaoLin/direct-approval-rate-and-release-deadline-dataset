* The bazel build also needs to be updated for a new jetty version, dependencies are defined in file WORKSPACE, see e.g.
https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/jgit/jgit/+/61e336475db27cb11cc370a9947bf6529e34daa0%5E%21/
* Target platforms in org.eclipse.jgit.target also need to be updated

Ah yes, I went ahead and fixed this problem upstream in jetty. See:

https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/1365
