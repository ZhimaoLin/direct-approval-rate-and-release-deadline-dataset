Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> here the method should return early otherwise the output is

 Already on 'b2'
 Switched to branch 'b2'

but native git only says

 Already on 'b2'

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> "jgit checkout xx" (xx not existing) prints:

 fatal: error: pathspec 'xx' did not match any file(s) known to git.

whereas native git says:

 error: pathspec 'xx' did not match any file(s) known to git.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> "jgit checkout -b b2" prints (branch b2 already existing):

 fatal: fatal: git checkout: branch b2 already exists

where native git says:

 fatal: A branch named 'b2' already exists.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> Done

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> The "fatal: " prefix is added in case an exception occurs when executing the command line. See catch clauses in org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Main.run(String[]). So I guess it's not the only place where the prefix is not expected.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> The native git I use (1.7.4.msysgit.0) prints:

 fatal: git checkout: branch b2 already exists

Doubled "fatal: " is bad, but the rest of the message seems to be fine.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> git 1.7.10.1 (Mac) says

 fatal: A branch named 'b2' already exists.

this matches the string "branchAlreadyExists", I would use this one also here

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/Checkout.java -> You're right, I'm seeing the same message after updating the native git client. I will try to do it more often now.
