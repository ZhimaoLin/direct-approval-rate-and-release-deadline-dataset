DESCRIPTION

IndexPack: Use byte limited form of getCachedBytes

Currently our algorithm requires that we have the delta base as
a contiguous byte array... but getCachedBytes() might not work
if the object is considered to be large by its underlying loader.
Use the limited form to obtain the object as a byte array instead.
