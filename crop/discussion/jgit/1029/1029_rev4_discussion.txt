DESCRIPTION

Added a preliminary version of rename detection

JGit does not currently do rename detection during diffs. I added
a class that, given a TreeWalk to iterate over, can output a list
of DiffEntry's for that TreeWalk, taking into account renames. This
class only detects renames by SHA1's. More complex rename detection,
along the lines of what C Git does will be added later.

Patch Set 4: (2 inline comments)



Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetector.java -> Style-nit: Pointless javadoc blocks should be removed, or made non-pointless.  :-)

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetector.java -> Use entry.oldMode and entry.newMode.  They are cheaper to access than calling walk.getFileMode(), which has to do quite a bit of work actually.
