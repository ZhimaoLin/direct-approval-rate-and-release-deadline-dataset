DESCRIPTION

TreeWalk: Do not close reader passed explicitly to constructor

The TreeWalk(ObjectReader) constructor is explicitly to handle the case
where the caller is responsible for opening and closing the reader.
The reader should only be closed when it was created in the
TreeWalk(Repository) constructor.
