DESCRIPTION

Fix path pattern matching to work also for gitattributes

Path pattern matching for attribute rules is different than matching
for excluded files.

The first difference concerns patterns without slashes. For
gitattributes those must match on the last component only, not on
any earlier segment.

The second difference is that directory-only patterns never match
since gitattributes deals only with files. This is also true if the
pattern would match a prefix or a containing directory.

And third, matches only on a prefix must match for gitattributes
only if the last matcher was "/**".

Add a new parameter for such path matching to IMatcher.matches() and
pass it through as appropriate (false for gitignore, true for
gitattributes). As far as gitignore is concerned, there is no change.

New tests have been added, and some existing attribute matching tests
have been fixed since they operated on wrong assumptions.

To validate that this interpretation is actually correct, new tests
that verify that JGit matches the same as C git have been added, for
both attribute matching (.gitattributes) and file exclusion matching
(.gitignore). These tests work by setting up a test repository and
test rules, and then determine excluded files or attributes both with
JGit and with the native C git, and then compare the results.

For .gitignore tests, we run

  git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard -o
  
and for attribute tests we use

  git check-attr --stdin --all
  
and pass the list of all files in the repository via stdin.
