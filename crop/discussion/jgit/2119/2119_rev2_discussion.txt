DESCRIPTION

RefDirectory: Use FileSnapshot for loose refs

Instead of relying only on the file modification time and guessing,
use FileSnapshot to determine if a ref needs to be read again,
or can be used as-is from the in-memory cached copy.

This fixes the "racy git" bug with loose references, but at the
additional memory expense of needing to allocate an additional object
(and several more fields) per loose reference.
