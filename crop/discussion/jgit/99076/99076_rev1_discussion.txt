Patch Set 1:

I'm getting PDE API errors and warnings. Looks like the api filters should be updated:

* CloneCommand.setCallback() and SubmoduleUpdateCommand.setCallback() newly return this,were previously void --> no API breakage
* The filter for ConfigConstants.CONFIG_KEY_LOGEXPIRY is apparently not used anymore, since the background GC was indeed added in 4.7.

I am comparing against the last minor release 4.7.0 and don't get any api errors (did clean project to rebuild everything).
Which version are you comparing to ?

these methods were introduced in 4.8.0 and changed in 4.8.0 which should not raise any issue

it was added in 4.7.1 so I suppressed this bending of strict API rules. Adding new API in service release is not allowed, but adding a constant is not really causing any issue so I suppressed it for 4.7.1. Though I then got an error in 4.8.0 so I suppressed it also in 4.8.0

Doh! You're right; I had switched branches but forgotten to also switch the API Baseline. Sorry for the false report.

I was travelling, this caused the delay.
