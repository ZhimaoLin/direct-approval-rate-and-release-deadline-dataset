DESCRIPTION

Handle short branch/tag name for setBranch in CloneCommand

Before, it was not clear from the documentation what kind of branch name
was accepted. Users specifying "branch" (instead of "refs/heads/branch")
got no error message and ended up with a repository without HEAD and no
checkout.

With this, CloneCommand now tries "$branch", then "refs/heads/$branch"
and then "refs/tags/$branch". C Git only does the last two, but for
compatibility we should still allow "refs/heads/branch".
