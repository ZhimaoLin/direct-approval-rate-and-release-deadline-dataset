Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:1223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Our style would prefer:

  List<ObjectId> heads = head != null ? Collections.singletonList(head) : null;

That also removes the need to import java.util.Arrays here.

Line:1234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Given how short the method is, maybe this is even shorter:

 File file = new File(getDirectory(), filename);
 try {
    byte[] raw = IO.readFully(file);
    return 0 < raw.length ? raw : null;
  } catch (FileNotFoundException notFound) {
    return null;
  }

On something this tiny, it isn't really worth trying to hoist the if outside of the try/catch.
