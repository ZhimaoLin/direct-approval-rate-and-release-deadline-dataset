DESCRIPTION

Support creating Mergers without a Repository

All that's really required to run a merge operation is a single
ObjectInserter, from which we can construct a RevWalk, plus a Config
that declares a diff algorithm. Provide some factory methods that don't
take Repository.

Line:831, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Whoops. Fixed.

(Before you ask, I use nonNullRepo() rather than db even following the null check because Eclipse nullness checker isn't smart enough to figure it out.)
