DESCRIPTION

Support creating Mergers without a Repository

All that's really required to run a merge operation is a single
ObjectInserter, from which we can construct a RevWalk, plus a Config
that declares a diff algorithm. Provide some factory methods that don't
take Repository.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> This means that setObjectInserter will close 'oi'. Should there be a boolean field to prevent that? Otherwise, please add a note to the javadoc to warn the caller.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> merge() also closes it. This API is a bit strange --- I suspect Merger should have been made AutoClosable but that's not related to this patch.

An ObjectInserter can be reused after closing, so I don't think this matters any more. Some API documentation explaining how oi gets used and who is responsible for closing it would still be useful.

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> Should be updated to describe the db == null case too

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> This is one reason Gerrit always passes an ObjectInserter.Filter that makes close a no-op :/

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> Updated the javadoc to mention under which conditions it will be closed. I agree that it seems like a manually passed in inserter should not be closed, but this behavior is consistent with setObjectInserter.

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> Done

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/Merger.java -> Done
