DESCRIPTION

Extract a class for signed push configuration

The default behavior is to read a repository's signed push
configuration from that repo's config file, but this is not very
flexible when it comes to managing groups of repositories (e.g. with
Gerrit). Allow callers to override the configuration using a POJO.
