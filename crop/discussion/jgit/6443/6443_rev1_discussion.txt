Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; Unclean IP, do not check in

- I think this script should run from any current directory, you already determine the script's path so simply to use that information to find the jgit source files you want to inspect
- the script shouldn't list exception classes or result classes as missing commands, you should probably check if API command classes are extending GitCommand and if pgm commands extend TextBuiltin
- some git commands map to multiple API commands, e.g. CreateBranchCommand. DeleteBranchCommand, these map to options of pgm commands, how do you want to map these cases ?
- do you also want to list pgm debug commands ?
- for all contributions from non-committers we need the contributor to assert the contribution questions [1], add them as a comment on this gerrit change

Guys, can any of you abandon the change. I think it doesn't make much sense keeping it alive.
