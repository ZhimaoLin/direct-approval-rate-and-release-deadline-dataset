DESCRIPTION

Use 'reused' bitmap to filter walk during bitmap selection

When building fullBitmap in order to determine which ancestor chain to
add this commit to, we were excluding the ancestors of reusedCommits
using markUninteresting.  This use of markUninteresting is a bit
wasteful because we already have a bitmap indicating exactly which
commits should be excluded (which can save some walking).  Use it.

A separate commit will remove the now-redundant markUninteresting
call.

No behavior change intended (except for performance improvement).

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

This is fine so far as it goes and is a good change. It still doesn't address the subtlety of how writeBitmaps, commitBitmapIndex, and CompressedBitmapBuilder.add() all work together. When I read the code, I think I should be able to remove the writeBitmaps.addBitmap() and writeBitmaps.clearBitmaps() calls from selectCommits(), but if I do, performance suffers greatly.

I just tried to make a suggestion here and realized it wouldn't work. It is subtle.
