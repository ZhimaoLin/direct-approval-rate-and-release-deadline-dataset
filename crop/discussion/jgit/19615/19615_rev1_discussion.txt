DESCRIPTION

Fixes stack overflow if there's a cycle in alternates

If certain operations are performed on a repository with alternates, where one
or more of those alternates itself has alternates, so that there is a cycle in
the alternates chain, then JGit will recursively load alternates until it runs
out of memory. This fix prevents that by passing in a reference to the original
repo to all methods that load alternates and providing methods for it to
remember what alternate repos it has seen and checks that prevent it from
cycling through them indefinitely.
