DESCRIPTION

Optimize RefAdvertiser performance by avoiding sorting

Don't copy and sort the set of references if they are passed through
in a RefMap or a SortedMap using the key's natural sort ordering.
Either map is already in the order we want to present the items
to the client in, so copying and sorting is a waste of local CPU
and memory.
