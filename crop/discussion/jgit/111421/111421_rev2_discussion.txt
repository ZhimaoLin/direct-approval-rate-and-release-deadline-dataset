DESCRIPTION

Yet another work-around for a Jsch bug: timeouts

Jsch 0.1.54 passes on the values from ~/.ssh/config for
"ServerAliveInterval" and "ConnectTimeout" as read from
the config file to java.net.Socket.setSoTimeout(). That
method expects milliseconds, but the values in the config
file are seconds!

The missing conversion in Jsch means that the timeout is
set way too low, and if the server doesn't respond within
that very short time frame, Jsch kills the connection and
then throws an exception with a message such as "session is
down" or "timeout in waiting for rekeying process".

As a work-around, do the conversion to milliseconds in the
Jsch-facing Config interface of OpenSshConfig. That way Jsch
already gets these values as milliseconds.
