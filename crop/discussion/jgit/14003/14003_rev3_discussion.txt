DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: allow custom RequestValidator instances

Make the existing concrete implementations public as well so custom
implementations may delegate to them where appropriate. Treat all custom
implementations as providing allow-tip-sha1 in want.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Don't do this. Instead of storing the enum in the UploadPack store the RequestValidator reference. When the caller invokes setRequestPolicy() always immediately switch to use the validator instance.

This means you may need to rearrange a bit of code that deals with the validator enum, but it avoids creating an ugly API artifact.

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done. This means there are a few more instanceof checks, and getRequestPolicy may return null, but that's probably ok. I made the public classes final so the instanceof checks are more reliable and to encourage composition rather than inheritance.
