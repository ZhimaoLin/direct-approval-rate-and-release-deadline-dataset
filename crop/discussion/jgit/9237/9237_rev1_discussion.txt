DESCRIPTION

Ensure that jgit p2 repository is self-contained

This ensures that the jgit p2 repository is self-contained and
downstream consumers don't need to find the dependencies elsewhere. We
don't add the jetty dependencies needed to install the test feature
org.eclipse.jgit.junit since this is only used by egit tests.
