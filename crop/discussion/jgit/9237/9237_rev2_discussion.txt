DESCRIPTION

Ensure that jgit p2 repository is self-contained

Add a new feature for the 3rd party dependencies jgit needs and include
this in org.eclipse.jgit.feature. This ensures that the jgit p2
repository is self-contained and downstream consumers don't need to find
the dependencies elsewhere. We don't add the jetty dependencies needed
to install the test feature org.eclipse.jgit.junit since this is only
used by egit tests.
