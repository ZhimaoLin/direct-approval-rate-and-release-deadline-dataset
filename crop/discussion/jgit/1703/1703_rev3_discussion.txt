DESCRIPTION

Add support for single-slash URI

In bug 323571 it is mentioned that if you call
'toURI().toURL().toString()' on a java.io.File you cannot pass
that string to jgit as an URIish. Problem is that the passed
URI looks like 'file:/C:/a/b.txt' and that we where expecting
double slashes after scheme':'. This fix adds support for this
single-slash file URLs.
