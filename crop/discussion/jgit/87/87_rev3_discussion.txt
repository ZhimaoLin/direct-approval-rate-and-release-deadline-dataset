DESCRIPTION

Add performance tests for MyersDiff

Add some tests which make sure that the diff algorithm really behaves in the
promised O(N*D) manner. This tests compute diffs between multiple big chunks
of data, measure time for computing the diffs and fail if the measured times
are off O(N*D) by more than a factor 10

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

I changed the test that they now use CPU time. Thanks for Robins comments/links on that. Now they are in a state that the test results are quite stable.
I also changed the tests in a way that they can live with not so accurate CPU time clocks. On my laptop the VM returned new CPU time values only 0,01 seconds which was to bad to measure fast diffs. Now diffs are repeated until we see the CPU time clock changed its value at least 10 times.

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiffPerformanceTest.java -> Can we get a more consistent copyright line for your work?  Here you use SAP AG with no email, but in your new CPUTimeStopWatch class you use a different copyright line that I guess is the same (you at a sap email address).

I'm not against two copyright lines for you if one is "stuff at work owned by SAP" and the other is "stuff on free time that SAP doesn't own", but if they are the same ("stuff at work that SAP owns") it'd be nice if they were consistent.

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiffPerformanceTest.java -> Since this is used only within the one test method, wouldn't it be a good idea to make it a local variable of that test method and avoid making it static?

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiffPerformanceTest.java -> Yes, you are right. This parameter is for performance tests where we diff random data. Such tests do not exist yet. I added the parameter just to be prepared when such tests are written.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiffPerformanceTest.java -> I see no other actual value than 1 passed here. Do we need this parameter?
Is it related to the worst-case behaviour for which there is no test?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiffPerformanceTest.java -> If I understood your code right, this loop never terminates if the stopwatch doesn't work correctly on this VM.  We never increment cpuTimeChanges because readout always returns 0, and interimTime is always below longTaskBoundary.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:164, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiffPerformanceTest.java -> Yes, you are right. That's a major bug. To be honest: this code never run on VMs which don't support CPU-time. I was not able to find such VMs and too lazy to mock the cpu-time feature. My idea was to skip test execution completely if cpu-time info is not available. I'll add this

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/CPUTimeStopWatch.java -> Why not private?  Were you planning to access this from another class?  How is that useful without the mxBean?

And why initialize to 0 when the JVM will automatically do that for you?

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/CPUTimeStopWatch.java -> Aren't you missing a test here on cpuTimeSupported flag?  This test always throws if the parameter was "true", even if the JVM actually supports the feature.
