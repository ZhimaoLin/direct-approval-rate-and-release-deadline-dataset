DESCRIPTION

Read user.name and email from environment first

According to [1] user name and email are taken first from the
environment variables:
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL

In case (some of) these environment variables are not set, the
information is taken from the git configuration.

JGit doesn not yet support the environment variables GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE.

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigTest.java -> When I leave this modification in but revert your changes in UserConfig then the tests still succeed. It seems that we don't have a test which fails without your modification but succeeds with your modification. Can you add one?
