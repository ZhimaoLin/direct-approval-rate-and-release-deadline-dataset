DESCRIPTION

Read user.name and email from environment first

According to [1] user name and email are taken first from the
environment variables:
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL

In case (some of) these environment variables are not set, the
information is taken from the git configuration.

JGit doesn not yet support the environment variables GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE.
