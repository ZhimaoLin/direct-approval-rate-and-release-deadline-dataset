DESCRIPTION

Fetch submodule repo before resolving commits

By default, this is turned off unless cmd.setFetch(true) is given.  It
will default to true in a future release to mimic c-git behaviour.

This is needed to prevent Eclipse from crashing with "Missing unknown
[REF]" when cloning a repo with submodules.
