DESCRIPTION

Fetch submodule repo before resolving commits

This is needed to prevent Eclipse from crashing with "Missing unknown
[REF]" when cloning a repo with submodules.
Command-line Git already does this.

Thanks for the change.

According to [1], git submodule update has a --no-fetch option. Until now that has been the default (and only) behavior of SubmoduleUpdateCommand. So I would presume existing users did until now do the fetch outside, before calling the update command. If we now start doing the fetch implicitly, such users will get multiple fetches. Also, if users did a recursive fetch before, fetching again would not be necessary. Is this a problem? Would it need to be mentioned somewhere in some release notes? Should the command have support for the --no-fetch option, and should the CLI support the option?

Besides these conceptual questions, see the inline comments.

It sounds like this would be better resolved in EGit, rather than changing behaviour that is relied on by other projects.  I'll refocus my efforts.

I didn't mean that. I don't know if we have to keep this SubmoduleUpdateCommand as is, or whether it should do the fetch. I think EGit does not do the explicit fetch before the update. JGit pgm doesn't seem to have submodule commands at all. Don't know if there are any clients besides EGit that would use this at all.

@Matthias: what's your take on this?

Patch Set 2:

Couldn't we add a setNoFetch() method to SubmoduleUpdateCommand and explicitly state in the documentation that the default is true (means, by default we don't fetch). Then we don't change existing clients but SubmoduleUpdateCommand users have the chance to say 'setNoFetch(false)' which would trigger a fetch. In the next release we could change the default from true to false to have a similar behaviour as c-git

I would prefer to name this method setFetch() and set the default to false
