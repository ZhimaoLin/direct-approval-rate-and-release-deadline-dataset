DESCRIPTION

Strip leading slashes in RepositoryFilter

If removing the leading slash results in an empty string, return
with an HTTP 404 error before trying to use the RepositoryResolver.
Moving this into a loop ahead of the length check ensures there is
no empty string passed into the resolver.

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/RepositoryFilter.java -> I know it's not an issue in practice but I don't like seeing this kind of quadratic loop. It's barely longer to do with a single substring call:

if (name != null) {
  int notSlash;
  while (notSlash <= name.length() && name.charAt(notSlash) == '/')
    notSlash++;
  name = name.substring(notSlash);
}

(or substitute your favorite for loop variant)

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/RepositoryFilter.java -> Its not really quadratic in Java. substring(n) returns a new String object that uses the same underlying character array. The cost is just the new String object construction, its quite low.

Most cases this loop runs at most once. Given both of these facts, it is more readable to use the shorter two-line version of the logic than to use the longer version that tries to avoid creating intermediate String objects in the case that additional unnecessary leading slashes are supplied.

Premature optimization being evil and all of that... :-)

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/RepositoryFilter.java -> Huh, ISTR hearing from a reputable source that substring didn't return a view of the same backing array due to creating uncollectable garbage. But I just checked the relevant JRE bug[1] and it seems to be working-as-intended.

I agree it is not an issue here due to the typically small number of trailing leading slashes.
