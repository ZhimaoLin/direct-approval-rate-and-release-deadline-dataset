DESCRIPTION

Implement core.safecrlf handling

When core.safecrlf is true any attempt to add a text file containing
a mix of CRLF and LF line ending will fail. Only CRLF or only LF
will be accepted, resulting in a clean up of the blob on checkout on
a system with CRLF line endings.

Patch Set 1:

...but it may illustrate an issue. Extending the GitAPI's are somewhat cumbersome. Adding new exceptions makes errors
show up all over the place. Shouldn√§'t we declare all call implementions to throw GitAPIException and recommend that everybody catches it so caller code doesn't break when we
add a new exception?
