MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> Here is the problem: What is returned by newSnake are two
positions (x, k+x). These two positions are 'folded' here into one int. snake2x() and snake2y() are used to 'unfold'. Stress test of the diff algorithm have shown that we reach the limits of int quite soon (when diffing strings of 100k size). Snakes should become pairs of ints. I'll post a fix for this

Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> Christian, would you prefer to submit this as-is to the repository and apply your IntPair type of fix on top of it, or would you prefer to squash your fix into this commit and just note your contribution in the commit message?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/MyersDiff.java -> I have the fear that when I start modifiying this change we have to restart the IP-review process on bugzilla bug (291083). Since this fixes for the change are not that easy (long vs. intpair) I suggest that we first try to get this change through without modifications. And and do my fixes in a new changes which succeeds this one.
I'll remove also my bug-fix attachment for the bugzilla.
