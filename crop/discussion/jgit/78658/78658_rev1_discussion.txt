Line:645, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> I agree with the warning, so I'd rather not suppress it. How about https://git.eclipse.org/r/78660?

Line:645, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> My reasoning was that they have different types so in most cases the compiler will tell us if we're using the wrong one.

But yes, fixing it is better than suppressing it, so I will abandon this in favour of yours.
