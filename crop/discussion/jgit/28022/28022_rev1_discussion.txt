DESCRIPTION

PackWriterTest: Set PackConfig.setDeltaCompress to false

Whether or not delta compression is applied depends on several flags; to turn if off both
PackConfig.setDeltaCompress and PackConfig.setReuseDeltas should be set to false. Before
only PackConfig.setReuseDeltas was set to false.

This commit sets PackConfig.setDeltaCompress to false in places where
PackConfig.setReuseDeltas is set to false. This should not change the expected behavior
of the test case.
