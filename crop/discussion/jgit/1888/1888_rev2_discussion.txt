DESCRIPTION

Fixed checkouts when HEAD is ignored

In the case where DirCacheCheckout was used to checkout a tree
without taking HEAD into account (e.g. during a clone or hard reset)
we didn't handle conflicts correctly. E.g. if there are conflicts
(entries with stage != 0) in the index and we tried to hard reset
we have been processing the conflicting pathes multiple times (once
for every stage). With this fix we will update the index with the
entry from the "merge" state (the state we want checkout) when we
detect existing conflicts.
