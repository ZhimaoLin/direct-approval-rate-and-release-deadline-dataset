DESCRIPTION

Set the delta depth before delta search in PackWriter.

Currently, the PackWriter does not carry forward the delta depth of
reused objects during delta compression.  The delta search only carries
forward the delta depth of new deltas.  In practice, this can cause
delta chain lengths to have no limit. Update the PackWriter to
calculate the delta depth of reused objects, based on the chain
that is actually being written.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

This doesn't work.  Apparently reused deltas are not included in the list passed to the DeltaWindow
