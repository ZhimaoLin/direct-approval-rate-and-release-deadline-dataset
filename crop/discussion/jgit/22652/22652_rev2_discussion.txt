DESCRIPTION

Fix NPE when WorkingTreeIterator does not have a repository set

It's strange that we have that member since it is not so clear
when it it set or not.

Line:976, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Theoretically also reader could be null. Look at line 806 (deprecated method, I know. But it may still be used) which could cause that we end up here with reader==null. I would add if reader is null and repository not null then to get a a reader from the repo.

  ObjectLoader open = (reader != null) ? reader.open(entry.getObjectId()) : repository.open(entry.getObjectId());

If both reader and repo are null then we are out of luck.

I overlooked that the change is already in. I'll propose my modification in a next change now.

Patch Set 2:

Pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22712/ for that. Not the exact same thing Chris suggested. I think we can demand that a reader is passed.
