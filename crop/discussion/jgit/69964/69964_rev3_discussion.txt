DESCRIPTION

Prepare Neon target platform

also use the Neon target platform as the default target platform.

Neon Eclipse platform requires BREE 8 so we have to use Java 8 at least
for the JGit packaging build (for the compiler settings we still stick
to source and target 1.7 since we want to still support Java 7)
otherwise unpacking platform pack200 archives will fail since they are
built using Java 8 and hence cannot be unpacked using Java 7's
unpack200.

Update org.junit from 4.11 to 4.11 and org.apache.ant from from 1.9.2 to
1.9.6 since the older versions are not available in Neon orbit version

Ignore a couple of tests in ResourceUtilTest which now fail [1] since
bug 476585 was fixed in Neon M6.
