DESCRIPTION

Prepare Neon target platform

also use the Neon target platform as the default target platform.

Neon Eclipse platform requires BREE 8 so we have to also use
it at least for the JGit packaging build (for the compiler settings we
still stick to source and target 1.7) since otherwise unpacking platform
pack200 archives will fail since they have been built using Java 8 and
hence cannot be unpacked using Java 7's unpack200.

Update org.junit from 4.11 to 4.11 and org.apache.ant from from 1.9.2 to
1.9.6 since the older versions are not available in Neon orbit version
