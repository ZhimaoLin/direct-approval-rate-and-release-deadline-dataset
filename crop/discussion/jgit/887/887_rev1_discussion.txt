DESCRIPTION

Refactor UploadPack to use GitRepository

Instead of requiring the file based repository implementation, we can
support the higher level generic one.  Packing however might be less
efficient, as the pack writer may not be able to perform delta reuse.
This is because the delta reuse code path is still hardwired into
methods that are only implemented by the file based ObjectDirectory
implementation.  We'll fix that in a later change as the storage APIs
are improved.
