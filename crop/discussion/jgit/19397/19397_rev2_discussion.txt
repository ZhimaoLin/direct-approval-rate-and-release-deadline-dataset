Line:877, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Could you adjust the comment, it's no longer necessarily a real change in this branch.

Line:886, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I wondered what 0 meant as argument, so I debugged this. All bytes of autoCrLfHash were 0, so this looks broken to me. I extended the test case to show this (see patch set 3).

Line:890, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Hm, should we default to true here? If there's an exception, is it safer to say "it is modified" or "it is not modified"?
