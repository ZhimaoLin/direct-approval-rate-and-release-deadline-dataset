I propose we accept this patch for 3.2 as it greatly improves support for autocrlf. Though we should fix handling of files with mixed line endings and there is some room for performance improvements.

+1 from me as well. Just one nitpick: Could you change the author to Juliet Cantu? I only contributed the test case.
