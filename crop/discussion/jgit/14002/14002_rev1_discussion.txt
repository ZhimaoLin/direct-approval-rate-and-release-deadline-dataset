DESCRIPTION

UploadPack: refactor want validation

Associate each RequestPolicy with an implementation of a
RequestValidator interface that contains the validation logic. The
checkWants method is only called if there are wants that were not
advertised, since clients may always request any advertised want
according to the git protocol. Calling the method only once at the
end of parsing the want list also means policy implementations need
not be stateful.

For the special handling of unidirectional pipes, pass a
biDirectionalPipe flag into checkWants, which implementations can use
to delegate to other implementations if necessary.
