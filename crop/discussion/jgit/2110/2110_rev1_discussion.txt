DESCRIPTION

Fix HTTP digest authentication

JGit's internal implementation of the HTTP digest authentication
method wasn't conforming to RFC 2617 (HTTP Authentication: Basic
and Digest Access Authentication), resulting in authentication
failures when connecting to a digest protected site.

The code now more accurately matches section 3.2.2 (The Authorization
Request Header) from the standards document.

Patch Set 1:

This plus some bug fixes in Gerrit (which I'll deploy shortly) should enable EGit to authenticate and push over HTTP.

This now running version of Gerrit (2.1.6-12-ge143def) should contain the necessary bug fixes to work with EGit.
