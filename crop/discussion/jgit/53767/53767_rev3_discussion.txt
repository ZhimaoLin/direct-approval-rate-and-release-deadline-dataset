DESCRIPTION

Fix InterruptTimer leak in BasePackConnection

When setting timeout on push, BasePackConnection creates a timer, which
will be terminated when push finishes. But, when using
SmartHttpPushConnection, it drops the first timer created in the
constructor and then creates another timer in doPush. If new threads are
created faster than the gc collects them this may stop the service if
it's hitting the max process limit. Hence terminate the timer if it
existed before BasePackConnection.init() creates a new timer.
