exists in the last pack. However, it forgot to avoid garbage pack for
the first iteration.

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReader.java -> If your new conditional above on 339 evaluates to false we can't skip lastIdx here.

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReader.java -> We will skip the pack anyway because of the line below which use the same condition.

Maybe refactor the condition check to a function will be helpful.

Line:335, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReader.java -> When trying to refactoring the condition, I found out whenever you use the avoidUnreachable flag, you assign it to a local variable. Is this necessary? There is no public method that take noGarbage as a param, only private methods.
