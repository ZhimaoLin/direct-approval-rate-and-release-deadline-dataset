DESCRIPTION

Fix smart HTTP client stream alignment errors

The client's use of UnionInputStream was broken when combined with a
8192 byte buffer used by PackParser. A smart HTTP client connection
always pushes in the execute stateless RPC input stream after the
data stream has ended from the remote peer. At the end of the pack,
PackParser asked to fill a 8192 byte buffer, but if only e.g. 1000
bytes remained UnionInputStream went to the next stream and asked
it for input, which triggered a new RPC, and failed because there
was nothing pending in the request buffer.

Change UnionInputStream to only return what it consumed from a
single InputStream without invoking the next InputStream, just in
case that second InputStream happens to be one of these magical
ones that generates an RPC invocation.
