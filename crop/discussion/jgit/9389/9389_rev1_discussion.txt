Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks good in general, a small typo in the commit message.

I'm still not sure if we can find a better, more general name for the class CherryPickResult and its method. Would you say that revert is a kind of generalized cherry-pick?

This API is a high-level API also used by Java programmers which know the semantics of basic git commands from command line. I don't like to confuse those people with a revert command which returns a cherry-pick result. Why should a user of this API know how similar revert and cherry-picks are. If it is not sufficient what the RevertCommand exposes with his own getters then I suggest to introduce a RevertResult (maybe extending CherryPickResult).
