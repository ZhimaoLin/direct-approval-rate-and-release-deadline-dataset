DESCRIPTION

IndexDiff: Use isModified() when comparing index-worktree

The isModified() is more efficient because it can skip over files that
are stat clean, without needing to scan them.

This is useful to efficently work on paths that were already staged
and thus differ between HEAD and the index, but not between the index
and the working tree.
