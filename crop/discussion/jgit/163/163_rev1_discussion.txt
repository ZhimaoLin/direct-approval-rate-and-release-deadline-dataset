DESCRIPTION

Added -crfl attribute for DiffFormatterReflowTest test data

The test data is expected to have unix new lines by tests, but it
is converted to crlf on Windows platform (with msys git). As result
DiffFormatterReflowTest tests fail. To prevent this problem,
crlf conversion is disbled for test data related to that test.
