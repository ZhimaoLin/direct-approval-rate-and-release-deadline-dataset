DESCRIPTION

Bazel: Restrict src globs to Java source files

Generating the src list with an unrestricted wildcard causes all
files in the source tree to be included. This results in junk files
such as .orig (generated during merge conflict resolution) to be
included, which causes in a build error:

  in srcs attribute of java_library rule //org.eclipse.jgit:jgit:
  file '//org.eclipse.jgit:src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java.orig'
  is misplaced here (expected .java, .srcjar or .properties).

Modify the globs to only include Java source files.
