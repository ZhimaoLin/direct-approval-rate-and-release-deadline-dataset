Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PathCheckoutCommandTest.java -> This does not work on windows. You must always use "/" for paths in jgit.

Line:260, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Better: treeWalk.setRecursive(true); (see above)

Line:271, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Better: startWalk.setRecursive(true); (see above)
