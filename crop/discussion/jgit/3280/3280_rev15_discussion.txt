Patch Set 15:

Hey guys, anything wrong with a setPaths(Collection ...) versus the current approach? It seems a bit odd to have a clearPaths() in our API... where people can just clear the paths by setting null on the setting (or any empty collection)

Thoughts?

I wasn't sure what the policy was.  AddCommand has just an addFilePattern method with no way of removing or clearing.

Line:251, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> The following lines of code have the purpose to transfer folder paths to the list of contained files, right? 

It took some time for me to figure that out, so maybe it would be useful to extract a method here.

Line:254, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CheckoutCommand.java -> Use treeWalk.setRecursive(true); instead of the if/else statement below
