DESCRIPTION

Shell utility to compile pre-release snapshots

Creating and deploying versioned snapshots helps external application
developers to obtain pre-release snapshot builds and integrate
them into their own development and testing.  If any issues are
discovered during testing, the base revision is easily determined
so patches can be written and submitted upstream.

Because these are unsanctioned builds made by individual developers
and are offered only through non-Eclipse sites we do not want to
use the Maven release plugin to create tags, as that would pollute
our otherwise clean project history.

We run Maven twice here, once to compile the world, and a second
time to deploy.  The first execution ensures the entire project
compiles and passes tests before the snapshot is written out to the
repository, avoiding simple and easily identified failed builds.
Because the first execution ran the tests and was succesful, we do
not need to run the tests again during the second execution.
