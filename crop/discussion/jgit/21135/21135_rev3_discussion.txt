Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I'd say this is not the path to go as spawning a shell for such low level commands will probably kill performance

Also this doesn't seem to match jgit's mission "JGit is an EDL (new-style BSD) licensed, lightweight, pure Java library implementing the Git version control system" http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/

You should add a note to the wiki page you created stating that this is work in progress which is still in review

Patch Set 3:

Today, only Linux-Java7 and Windows-Java7 (with administrator privileges) users can take advantage of symlinks. 

My goal was to allow to non Java7 users and all Windows users to also take advantage of, because I don't think the most part of EGit/JGit users are Linux-Java7 and Windows-Java7 (with administrator privileges) users.

I agree that performances will probably be lower with such implementation.

May be the solution can be an option in JGit/EGit that will be off by default, so the users still have the same performances than today, but have the choice to turn on the option and benefit for symlinks (with lower performances) if they absolutely need for.

What do you think about that ? Do you think it worth to allow to every users to take adavantage of symlinks ? Do you thinhk the 'option' solution is good ?

Patch Set 3:

Java 6 is past EOL, so if someone wants to support it, fine.

Cygwin's symlinks only works with cygwin, so if they don't help most EGit/JGit users. Btw, see my comments on the symlinks bugzilla.

Patch Set 3:

I think it is important is to get something out that the vast majority can use and that is reasonably easy to support moving forward. My preference would therefore be to get the Java-7 based support released A.S.A.P. and defer support for other environments until there's proven a need for it.

Patch Set 3:

I'd rather see people test the real symlink support first.

Abandoned

Abondon support for other environments because there's no need for it at the moment
