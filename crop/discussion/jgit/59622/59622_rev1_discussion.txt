DESCRIPTION

Include ancestors of reused bitmap commits in reuse bitmap again

Until 320a4142 (Update bitmap selection throttling to fully span
active branches, 2015-10-20), setupTipCommitBitmaps contained code
along the following lines:

	for (PackBitmapIndexRemapper.Entry entry : bitmapRemapper) {
		if (!reuse(entry))
			continue;
		RevCommit rc = (RevCommit) rw.peel(rw.parseAny(entry));

		reuseCommits.add(new BitmapCommit(rc));
		EWAHCompressedBitmap bitmap =
			remap.ofObjectType(remap.getBitmap(rc), OBJ_COMMIT);
		writeBitmaps.addBitmap(rc, bitmap, 0);
		reuse.add(rc, OBJ_COMMIT);
	}
	writeBitmaps.clearBitmaps();	// Remove temporary bitmaps

This loop OR-ed together bitmaps for commits whose bitmaps would be
reused.  A subtle point is the use of the add() method, which ORs in a
bitmap from the BitmapIndex when it exists and falls back to OR-ing in
a single bit when that bitmap does not exist in the BitmapIndex.

Commit 320a4142 removed the addBitmap step, so the bitmap does not
exist in the BitmapIndex and the fallback behavior is triggered.

Simplify and restore the intended behavior by avoiding use of the
subtle use of the add() method --- use or() directly instead.

Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> This line just looks wrong to me. We can't assume that all the reused bitmaps from a previous pack are all in a single linear history, so ORing in "reuse" here seems incorrect.

I think the way to move forward is to simplify and clarify semantics (like you are doing by replacing BitmapBuilder.add()) and add tests that verify those semantics. Then maybe things won't be so murky. I'll think about a test for this.

Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> I don't think there's any assumption of linearity. I wonder if it's a vestige of some code path that doesn't exist any more. I can do a little history mining tomorrow.

But (luckily?) if I am reading correctly it would be safe to remove this line. Consider where this bitmap is used after this line:

1. It gets recorded in tipCommitBitmaps
2. In the while((rc = rw.next()) != null) walk, we check if it contains each commit 'rc'. Luckily the commits in 'reuse' cannot appear as 'rc', since each commit in reuseCommits has already been marked uninteresting.
3. We then AND the bitmap against the complement of reuse.

So the OR-ing against reuse would have had no effect, since it was soon undone.

Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> I'm not making my point very well. This loop is setting up the full reachability bitmap for each branch tip. It may be the case that some of the commits for which we are reusing bitmaps are not reachable by a particular branch. If not, then the bitmaps for those commits should not be used to build the bitmap for that branch tip. This line seems to be violating that.

Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> Upshot of in-person conversation:

- the bitmap.or(reuse) and bitmap.andNot(reuse) calls do not appear to be needed. Will add a change to remove those calls
- the content of the BitmapBuilder in tipCommitBitmaps is underdocumented. Will add a comment in the same or a followup change.

Line:353, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> You lost this trim() call. Since this is a transient object that is immediately discarded, that is fine. I didn't look at what trim did but I shouldn't have carried it forward in the first place.
