DESCRIPTION

RevWalk: Allow disabling parent rewriting

Previously, setting any TreeFilter on a RevWalk triggered parent
rewriting, which in the current StartGenerator implementation ends up
buffering the entire commit history in memory. Aside from causing poor
performance on large histories, This does not match the default
behavior of `git rev-list`, which does not rewrite parent SHAs unless
asked to via --parents/--children.

Add a new method setRewriteParents() to RevWalk to disable this
behavior. Continue rewriting parents by default to maintain backwards
compatibility.
