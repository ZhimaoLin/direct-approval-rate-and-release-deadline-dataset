DESCRIPTION

TransportHttp: retry on IOException with another mechanism

When a 401 occurs on POST and the server advertises Negotiate, we
may get an exception from GSSAPI if the client isn't configured
at all for Kerberos.

Add exception logic similar to the GET case: keep trying other
authentication mechanisms if this occurs.

Patch Set 3:

@Matthias: I have two problems here:

1. I haven't managed to write a unit test for this. Looks like I would need a server that really does NTLM. Or a Windows machine. Or both.

2. I can't really test this since I have no git server that would do Negotiate or NTLM. The person who reported this in the Egit forum at https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1089090/ has offered to help with testing. But to what update site can I point him to install a JGit with this fix attempt to test if it helps?

If he cannot build it from source I can upload a build to the eclipse download server to make it available. The update site on Jenkins isn't reliable since the next change being validated will overwrite it with the build result from a different change

Manuel has confirmed at https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1089090/ that this indeed does solve that connection problem with TFS.
