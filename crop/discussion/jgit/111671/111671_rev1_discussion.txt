DESCRIPTION

TransportHttp: retry on IOException with another mechanism

When a 401 occurs on POST and the server advertises Negotiate, we
may get an exception from GSSAPI if the client isn't configured
at all for Kerberos.

Add exception logic similar to the GET case: keep trying other
authentication mechanisms if this occurs.
