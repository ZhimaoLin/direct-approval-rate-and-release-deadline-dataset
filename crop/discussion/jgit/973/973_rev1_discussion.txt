DESCRIPTION

Simplify ObjectLoaders coming from PackFile

We no longer need an ObjectLoader to be lazy and try to delay
the materialization of the object content.  That was done only
to support PackWriter searching for a good reuse candidate.

Instead, simplify the code base by doing the materialization
immediately when the loader asks for it, because any caller
asking for the loader is going to need the content.

Line:289, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> -1 An explanatory message here.

-2 Out of memory is not really the problem. This will most certainly lead anyone encountering this problem wrong. I'd prefer  IllegalArgumentException here,

Line:289, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Fixed by killing it in http://egit.eclipse.org/r/1045.  With the streaming stuff fully implemented, the code is unreachable.
