Line:109, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeResult.java -> you could simplify this by reusing the other constructor below:

 this(newHead, mergedCommits, base, mergeStatus, mergeStrategy, null);

Line:143, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeResult.java -> I think the other members of this class should also be added here, something like "merge of heads x and y with base z using strategy abc results in 13 conflicts (list of conflicts) and has description blabla"

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeResult.java -> style nit: blanks around operator <

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeResult.java -> style nit: blanks around operator ==
