DESCRIPTION

Enable public access to SimilarityIndex scoring function

The SimilarityIndex class implements the useful capability of scoring
the similarity between two files. That capability is required for a
feature that's being developed in another package, to detect files
derived from a set of potential sources.

This CL adds a public factory method to create a SimilarityIndex from
an ObjectLoader. It grants public access to the SimilarityIndex class,
the score method, an inner exception class and a special marker
instance of that exception class.
