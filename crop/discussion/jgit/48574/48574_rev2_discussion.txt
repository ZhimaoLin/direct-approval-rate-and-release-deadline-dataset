DESCRIPTION

Enable public access to SimilarityIndex scoring function

The SimilarityIndex class implements the useful capability of scoring
the similarity between two files. That capability is required for a
feature that's being developed in another package, to detect files
derived from a set of potential sources.

This CL adds a public factory method to create a SimilarityIndex from
an ObjectLoader. It grants public access to the SimilarityIndex class,
the score method, an inner exception class and a special marker
instance of that exception class.

I am happy with what we are exposing here. Mostly comments on documentation.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> There is no DiffEntry here. Moreover you have an ObjectLoader. We found the object once. A MissingObjectException at this point is a race with `git prune` where the object is no longer reachable and was deleted between the time the caller opened it, and now. This is rather unlikely.

I think you can just omit MissingObjectException and let it be IOException. MOE is just as unlikely as any other IOException at this stage and there is nothing the caller can do about either.

Line:242, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Compute similarity score between this index and another.

Line:248, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Explain more about the range of values returned.

I know it returns xxx@xxx.xxx maxScore} when both input files were empty length.

IIRC its returning an integer value in the range [0, maxScore] where score/maxScore*100 is the percentage of this file that matches the other file.

Line:422, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> /** Thrown by xxx@xxx.xxx create()} when file is too large. */
