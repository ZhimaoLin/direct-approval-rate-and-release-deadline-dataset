Hi Anton,
please change the indentation to use tabs instead of spaces. There are a few more rules EGit and JGit code follows in the contributor guide you can find at https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Coding_standards

Konrad, could you point out how should I add more commits to this change? I keep creating new changes (28049, 28095), which isn't probably the right thing to do (or is it?). When I set Change-Id to the change id of this change, I get "! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/for/master (duplicate request)" on push.

Anton: In this case I guess you should amend this commit, not add new commits. 

In any case each commit should have its own Change-Id. Only when amending commits, should the Change-Id be reused. The Change-Id is what tells Gerrit to replace a commit with another.
