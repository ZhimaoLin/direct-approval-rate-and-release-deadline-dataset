DESCRIPTION

Fix ReceivePack setEnsureProvidedObjectsVisible on thin packs

If ensureProvidedObjectsVisible is enabled we expected any trees or
blobs directly reachable from an advertised reference to be marked
with UNINTERESTING.  Unfortunately ObjectWalk doesn't bother setting
this until the traversal is complete.  Even then it won't necessarily
set it on every tree if the corresponding commit wasn't popped.

When we are going to check the base objects for the received pack,
ensure the UNINTERESTING flag gets carried into every immediately
reachable tree or blob, because these are the ones that the client
might try to use as delta bases in a thin pack.

Patch Set 2: No score

I haven't actually fixed the bug you seem to still see here.  

But I added a test case, and I _think_ the test case is validating the original bug I reported to you against this code.

Are you sure you were testing with this change in JGit in your Gerrit test instance, and weren't using an older copy of JGit?  I'll retry the manual test script tomorrow within Gerrit and see if I can better isolate the failure you are still seeing.  But at least this change tests for and fixes the first bug we found today.

I'm pretty sure I am using the most recent version of JGit. I merged this change with my debugging code, and ran it, and it works for the previous object where it was failing, and fails a little later, on a different object.

That other object is not present in the .git/ folder either...

Thanks for the unittest. I'll see if I can make that one trip.
