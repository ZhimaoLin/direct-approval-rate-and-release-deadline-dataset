DESCRIPTION

TestRepository: Make ref lookup in BranchBuilder#commit more precise

The refname stored in a BranchBuilder is already normalized by adding
refs/heads/ if appropriate in the TestRepository#branch method.  Make
this test helper more predictable by using the resulting refname as-is
instead of searching along the search path.
