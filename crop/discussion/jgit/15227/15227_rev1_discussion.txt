DESCRIPTION

Allow UploadPack requests with no options

UploadPack can be invoked with no capabilities selected by the
client if the client is an ancient version of Git that nobody in
their right mind should still be using. Or if the client is very
broken and does not want to use any of the newer features added to
the protocol since its inception.
