DESCRIPTION

Fix JUnit-tests checking file mode

This is a fast fix for the failing JUnit test after change 3fe5276. 
The code to get the file mode should be refactored to 
avoid code duplication.

Line:313, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/T0003_Basic.java -> I think we can just drop this test method.

test006_readCaseInsensitive in TestConfig already does the same thing, and doesn't require this OS specific test for the value being asserted.
