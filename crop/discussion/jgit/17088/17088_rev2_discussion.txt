DESCRIPTION

fix DateRevQueue to follow FIFO policy in case of tie.

DateRevQueue is expected to give out the commits that have higher commit time.
But in case of tie(same commit time), it should give the commit that is inserted
first. This is inferred from the testInsertTie test case written for
DateRevQueue. Also that test case, right now uses just two commits which caused
it not to fail with the current implementation, so added another commit to
fix it.

@Konrad: could you check why PullCommandTest is failing with this change ?

Patch Set 2:

@Matthias: The pull-with-rebase tests fail because both commits to rebase have the same commit timestamp and the child commit is now picked before the parent commit. This results in conflicts during cherry-pick and makes the rebase fail.
The problem appears in RebaseCommand.calculatePickList(RevCommit), the git log result there has the two commits reversed.
