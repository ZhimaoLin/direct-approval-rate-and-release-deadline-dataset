DESCRIPTION

fix DateRevQueue to follow FIFO policy in case of tie.

DateRevQueue is expected to give out the commits that have higher commit time.
But in case of tie(same commit time), it should give the commit that is inserted
first. This is inferred from the testInsertTie test case written for
DateRevQueue. Also that test case, right now uses just two commits which caused
it not to fail with the current implementation, so added another commit to
fix it.
