DESCRIPTION

Refactoring: extract method to write steps + providing public access

This is needed in order to change the rebase-todo file containing the
steps to be processed in the current rebase. This can be used to both
mimic "git rebase --edit-todo" and as an alternative to set the list of
steps with prepareSteps() in InteractiveHandler.
