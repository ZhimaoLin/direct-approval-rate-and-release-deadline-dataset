Patch Set 1:

Without this I get the error:

 The minor version should be incremented in version 4.7.0, since new APIs have been added since version 4.7.0

On the files:

  MANIFEST.MF	/org.eclipse.jgit.archive/META-INF	line 5	Version Numbering Problem
  MANIFEST.MF	/org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF	line 5	Version Numbering Problem

Abandoned

After setting jgit 4.6.0 baseline the error goes away.

Patch Set 1:

It seems that to get egit to compile I need to set the baseline to jgit 4.7.0, but when I do that, the errors appear in jgit.
