DESCRIPTION

Fix three-word command names

Command names like MakeCacheTree weren't coming up with hypens between
every word, so they read "debug-make-cachetree" rather than the
expected "debug-make-cache-tree".  On each lowercase character reset
the lastWasDash flag so the next uppercase will insert a hypen before
the next word.
