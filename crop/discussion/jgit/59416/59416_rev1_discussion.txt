DESCRIPTION

[performance] Speed up delta search in existing packs

Searching for deltas in an existing pack is O(N^2). The delta search is
partitioned into tasks, and each task contains one or more slices of work to be
performed. Once each DeltaTask works through its initial (small) set of
assigned work it attempts to "steal" additional work by searching for the
largest remaining slice via a linear search. So if N is the number of tasks and
K is average number of slices per task, then the number of comparisons performed
finding largest remaining slices is K*N * N.

I don't understand the delta compression algorithm well enough to know whether
choosing the longest remaining task is always required (the current algorithm
strongly suggests it is), or if there might be a better way to assign initial
work so that less "stealing" is required. The change here is modest and based
on the following understanding: tasks are set up prior to execution, and once a
task is completed no new work is added to it. So once a task is seen as
completed, it can be excluded from future searches. DeltaTask.Block.stealWork()
is already synchronized. This patch removes completed tasks from the
DeltaTask.Block.tasks member variable in that synchronized block. On the MSM
3.10 Linux kernel repository, this was seen to decrease the time in the
PackWriter.parallelDeltaSearch() method from (1615+1633+1458)/3 = 1568 seconds
to (465+479+477)/3 = 473 seconds.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Hold off on reviewing this. Shawn gave me some guidance that there is a breakage elsewhere. The number of tasks should never be more than the number of threads, but nearly 150k tasks are being created for this repository. I'll investigate.

Patch Set 1: -Code-Review

The creation of DeltaTasks needs to take into account objects that are marked as "doNotAttemptDelta". Pushing up what I believe is the correct fix now.
