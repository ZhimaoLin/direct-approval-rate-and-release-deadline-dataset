DESCRIPTION

WIP: Implement Bazel build

Prototype implementation of Bazel build and is work in progress.
Only packages consumed by Gerrit Code Review are implemented for now.
This commit doesn't implement test build and execution.

We prefer to consume maven_jar custom rule from bazlets repository,
for the same reasons as in Gerrit project:

* caching atifacts across different clones and projects
* exposing source classifiers and neverlink artifact

TEST PLAN:

  $ bazel build :all
  $ unzip -t bazel-genfiles/all.zip
  Archive: bazel-genfiles/all.zip
    testing: libjunit.jar             OK
    testing: libjgit-servlet.jar      OK
    testing: libjgit-archive.jar      OK
    testing: libjgit.jar              OK

File Comment: tools/BUILD -> labels are like //path/to/package:targetname.

The BUILD file is there to ensure that the package exists.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Assuming you mean core Gerrit?  The LFS artifacts are also not included, and they're used by the LFS plugin.

I can add those in a follow-up unless you plan to add them here.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> artifacts
