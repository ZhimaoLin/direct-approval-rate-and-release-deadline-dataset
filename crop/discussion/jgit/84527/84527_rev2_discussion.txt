DESCRIPTION

WIP: Implement Bazel build

This is prototype implementation of Bazel build and is work in progress.
Only packages consumed by Gerrit Code Review are implemented for now.
This CL also doesn't implement test build and execution.

Bazel 0.4.0 integrates error prone out of the box and WalkEncryption
class is flagged by error prone as having security vulnerabilities: [1]
and excluded from the build (and the classes that depend on it) for now.
Also note that due to this error prone bug: [2], the emmited URL should
probably be: [3].

TEST PLAN:

  $ bazel build :all
  $ unzip -t bazel-genfiles/all.zip
  Archive:  bazel-genfiles/all.zip
    testing: libjunit.jar             OK
    testing: libjgit-servlet.jar      OK
    testing: libjgit-archive.jar      OK
    testing: libjgit.jar              OK
