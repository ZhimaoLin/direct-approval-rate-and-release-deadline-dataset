DESCRIPTION

WIP: Implement Bazel build

This is prototype implementation of Bazel build and is work in progress.
Only org.eclipse.jgit package is implemented for now.

Bazel 0.4.0 integrates error prone out of the box and WalkEncryption
class is flagged by error prone as having security vulnerabilities: [1]
and excluded from the build (and the classes that depend on it) for now.
Also note that due to this error prone bug: [2], the emmited URL should
probably be: [3].
