DESCRIPTION

Implement initial framework of Bazel build

The initial implementation only builds the packages consumed by
Gerrit Code Review.

Test build and execution is not implemented.

We prefer to consume maven_jar custom rule from bazlets repository,
for the same reasons as in the Gerrit project:

* Caching artifacts across different clones and projects
* Exposing source classifiers and neverlink artifact

TEST PLAN:

  $ bazel build :all
  $ unzip -t bazel-genfiles/all.zip
  Archive: bazel-genfiles/all.zip
    testing: libjgit-archive.jar      OK
    testing: libjgit-servlet.jar      OK
    testing: libjgit.jar              OK
    testing: libjunit.jar             OK
  No errors detected in compressed data of bazel-genfiles/all.zip.
