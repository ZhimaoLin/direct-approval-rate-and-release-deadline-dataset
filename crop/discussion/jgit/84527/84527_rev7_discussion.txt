something went wrong there.

this is because the homebrew version is woefully out of date. I'll complain with the bazel team.

yes, it seems the version installed by homebrew is very outdated. AFAIR it claimed to be 0.4.0 but it didn't work for this change. Then I installed bazel using the installer and then this change just built fine :-)

Can you still find that homebrew binary that wasn't working?

Can you confirm that it actually self-reports as 0.4.0, i.e.

   bazel version 

and that it's that one complaining of the '.' ?

I uninstalled this brewed version of bazel before I installed it using the installer so I can't check this anymore without reinstalling bazel using homebrew

Patch Set 7:

this build works here

This version 41810506 is still using javaewah 0.7.9, lib/BUCK has this version and also org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.target/jgit-4.6.target

On master we use javaewah 1.1.6 since 5bb434. Maybe you rebased this change onto master ?
