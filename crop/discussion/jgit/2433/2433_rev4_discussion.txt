DESCRIPTION

RevWalk: Don't reset ObjectReader when stopping

Applications like UploadPack reset() and reuse the same RevWalk
multiple times in very rapid succession.  Releasing the ObjectReader's
internal state on each use, only to allocate it again on the next
cycle kills performance if the ObjectReader has internal caches, or
even if the Inflater gets returned and pulled from the InflaterCache
too frequently.

Making releasing the ObjectReader the application's responsibility
when it is done with the RevWalk, which most already do by wrapping
their loop in a try/finally block.
