DESCRIPTION

Add a getter for a list of RefSpecs to Config

Reading RefSpecs from a Config can be seen as another typed value
conversion, so add a getter to Config and to TypedConfigGetter. Use
it in RemoteConfig.

Doing this allows clients of the JGit library to customize the
handling of invalid RefSpecs in git config files by installing a
custom TypedConfigGetter.

Patch Set 1:

Example usage in EGit is shown in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/103424/ . As expected, greatly improves the user experience. With an invalid RefSpec in git config, the user is otherwise confronted with countless error dialogs; with these changes, there are nice warnings logged and the user can keep on working.

If this way of dealing with such problems is deemed good enough similar getters could be added as needed, for instance, for reading a list of URIishs. (Also used in RemoteConfig.)

Line:297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DefaultTypedConfigGetter.java -> What about using Java 8's stream API?

I.e. something like:

  return Arrays.stream(config.getStringList(section, subsection, name))
      .map(spec -> new RefSpec(spec))
      .collect(Collectors.toList());

Line:297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DefaultTypedConfigGetter.java -> Sure, that's a possibility, too. What would be the benefits?
Is it clearer? Debatable (as all matters of style). It's not significantly shorter. Is it more efficient? I doubt it. Is it safer in some way? I don't know.

Line:297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DefaultTypedConfigGetter.java -> I find it shorter (3 lines vs 6, although depends on line wrapping) but otherwise I suppose there's no real reason other than using Java 8 features :)
