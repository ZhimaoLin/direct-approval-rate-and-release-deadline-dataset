DESCRIPTION

Fix CheckoutCommand not setting up tracking

Instead of passing on the start point as is to CreateBranchCommand, the
resolved ObjectId was used. Given this, CreateBranchCommand did not set
up tracking.

This also fixes CreateBranchCommand with setStartPoint(null) to use HEAD
(instead of NPEing), as documented in the Javadoc.
