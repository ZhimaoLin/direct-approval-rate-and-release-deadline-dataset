DESCRIPTION

Tweak DeltaWindow to avoid many small copy islands

Don't attempt to examine a delta pair if the result object size is
smaller than 1/32nd of the base object. CGit determined more than
5 years ago such pairings are not likely to create a good delta.

Even if a delta is possible, recreating the result object requires
reading 32x the necessary data from the base, inflating that to a
temporary buffer, only to discard nearly all of it.  Such a pairing
slows down data decompression at read time and does not help readers.

JGit already had this rule, but it was set to 1/16th based only on my
gut instinct.  After some discussions with Junio, he alerted me to
CGit using 1/32th for this heuristic.

Updating to CGit's behavior should help JGit to create better packs
more quickly, as fewer candidates will need to be considered when both
large and small files appear in the window at the same time.

Hoist this check very early in the delta evaluation, even before
considering depth information.  The size is faster to access from
ObjectToPack, allowing DeltaWindow to rule out poorly matched pairs
with fewer instructions spent.
