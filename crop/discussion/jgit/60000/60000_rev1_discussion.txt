Silence API errors for new methods added to BitmapBuilder

These API changes were introduced in f523f21e and 73474466.

interface. According to OSGi semantic versioning rules breaking API
changes require update of the minor version only if implementors of the
API have to be adapted and the changes do not affect clients of the API.
