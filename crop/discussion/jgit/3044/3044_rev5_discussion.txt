Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtils.java -> Style-nit: These two sections are distinct, there should be a blank line between initializing encodingAliases and initializing digits10.

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtilsTest.java -> Don't rely on the JRE platform encoding here. Use a specific encoding, like Constants.encodeASCII(). This also applies to the other getBytes calls below.

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RawParseUtilsTest.java -> This is always true. You cannot throw the null object.
