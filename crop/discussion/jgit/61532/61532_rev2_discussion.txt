DESCRIPTION

Fix bare behavior of Repository class and its builder

A couple of fixes regarding the handling of the bare builder option in
Repository and BaseRepositoryBuilder classes are provided with this
change.

1. create() method of the Repository class was trying to produce a
non-bare repository regardless of whether
BaseRepositoryBuilder.setBare is called or not.
e.g.
   new RepositoryBuilder().setGitDir(file).setBare().build().create();
was failing with NoWorkTreeException. This method is fixed to respect
the bare option.

2. create(boolean bare) method of the FileRepository class was failing
either by throwing an Exception or by ignoring its parameter
completely for bare values that contradicts with its respective
builderâ€™s bare parameter. i.e. for cases in the form
builder.build().create(!builder.isBare()). This was completely
expected due to the immutable nature of the Repository class, and it
was the signature and the documentation of the method that was
fundamentally unorthodox. Furthermore, as another downside of this
function, concrete classes implementing it (such as FileRepository)
had two potentially contradicting sources to test bare. One was the
function argument and the other was the isBare method. To overcome all
this drawbacks, create() function is made abstract instead of
create(boolean bare) and create(boolean bare) is made concrete,
deprecated, final and explicit on what to expect from its parameter
which is practically nothing useful.

3. Some minor improvements on documentation are done.
