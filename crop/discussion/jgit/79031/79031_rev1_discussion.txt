DESCRIPTION

Handle all values of branch.[name].rebase

BranchConfig treated this config property as a boolean, but git also
allows the values "preserve" and "interactive". Config property
pull.rebase also allows the same values.

Replace private enum PullCommand.PullRebaseMode by new public enum
BranchConfig.BranchRebaseMode and adapt all uses. Add a new setter to
PullCommand.

Note: PullCommand will treat "interactive" like "true", i.e., as a
non-interactive rebase. Not sure how "interactive" should be handled.
At least it won't balk on it.

Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BranchConfig.java -> When looking at code using this method (e.g. PullWizardPage#hasDifferentUpstreamConfiguration) I am not sure whether it is ok. I am not sure but I guess for such users it would better to return true in all modes which do a rebase. Maybe returning getRebaseMode() != BranchRebaseMode.NONE would be better.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RenameBranchCommandTest.java -> I would use null as default value

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RenameBranchCommandTest.java -> I would use null as default value

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RenameBranchCommandTest.java -> I would use null as default value

Line:187, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RenameBranchCommandTest.java -> I would use null as default value

Line:614, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Because you are specifying BranchRebaseMode.NONE as the default for Config#getEnum(...) this test could succeed accidentally. I would choose a different default value (e.g. null or BranchRebaseMode.REBASE)

Thanks for the review, Christian.

Line:179, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BranchConfig.java -> But that's what this is doing?

Line:614, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> The logic here is unchanged from before. Previous code also succeeded if

* branch.test.rebase was not set at all
* branch.test.rebase = false

But I can tighten that to succeed only if not set at all by using null as default and assertNull.
