DESCRIPTION

LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase: Add clarifying comment in call to createRepository

Clatify that 'true' means 'auto close'. This makes it consistent with
other calls that have a boolean argument for 'bare'. It also makes it a
bit easier to see what's going on while stepping in the debugger, because
it's not necessary to scroll around to find the method declaration.
