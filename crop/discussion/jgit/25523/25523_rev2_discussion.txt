DESCRIPTION

Automatically reload known_hosts file

JGit caches the contents of the known_hosts file within JSch when
first started, and never attempts to re-read it.  If the contents
change (such as when using Gerrit replication), the new host will
never be found.

On failures, try reloading the knonwn_hosts and retry the
connection, in addition to reloading the credentials.
