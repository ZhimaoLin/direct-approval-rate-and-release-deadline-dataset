DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Return conflicting pathes and the reason from DirCacheCheckout

E.g. Fast-forward merge should not fail with an exception when work tree
is dirty. In that case a better result would be MergeResult with
MergeFailureReason.DIRTY_WORKTREE as the reason for the conflict.

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> maybe api version here

Line:298, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> According to the keySety() javadoc you can actually do this:

conflicts.keySet().removeAll(removed)

Line:188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/MergeCommand.java -> Yeah, makes sense. Would a comment here be enough, or should I mention the change in the javadoc too?

Line:298, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Cool.

Line:244, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StashApplyCommand.java -> TODO: this change is gone in the latest patch set.

Line:942, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> It's a map now.
