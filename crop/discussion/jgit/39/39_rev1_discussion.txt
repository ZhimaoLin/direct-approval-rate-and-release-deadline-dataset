DESCRIPTION

Fix some warnings regarding unnecessary imports and accessing static methods

My Galileo eclipse was complaining about unneeded import statements and
how static methods have been accessed in Diff.java. There was also one method
call which could be removed because he had no sideeffects and the return value
was not used. I fixed this so that there are no warnings anymore.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score

This should have been uploaded for the cq-diff branch as this depends upon code which is still actively pending in a CQ.  So you really wanted to use:

  git push ssh://..../parallelip-jgit HEAD:refs/for/cq-diff

I manually edited the database to retarget the commit to the proper branch.
