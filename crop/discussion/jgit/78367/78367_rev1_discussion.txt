Line:855, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> This javadoc is no longer correct.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why is it only "possibly" extraneous?

Because I'm making this change parallel to some changes to Gerrit I'm also working on, so this may or may not be necessary (looking more like the latter right now, so I wouldn't want this immediately merged in anyways) depending on how those play out. My apologies if that's a bad practice; I'm new to this development workflow.

Line:855, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Done
