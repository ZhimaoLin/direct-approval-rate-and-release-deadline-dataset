Line:854, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> There are three interesting cases here.

If the caller didn't call setAllowPushOptions(true), then we don't advertise that we can get push options and pushOptions is null. We can detect this case by checking the allowPushOptions variable directly. The caller was responsible for setting it to true, so if they didn't and they then turn around and call getPushOptions(), they are very confused. That makes it a good time to throw IllegalStateException().

If the caller did call setAllowPushOptions but the client doesn't support push options, then pushOptions is null. This is analogous to C git hooks --- Git sets the GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT envvar to 0 when the client supported push options and sent none and doesn't set the envvar when the client didn't support push options.

This method can behave similarly by xxx@xxx.xxx like you do here.

If I called setAllowPushOptions(true) but haven't called receive() yet, then enabledCapabilities will be null. This is another case where the client is very confused. That makes it a good time to throw RequestNotYetReadException.

Should I wait for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78645/ and make this a new CL, seeing as all the relevant code will have been moved to a different file (namely ReceivePack.java)?

Line:854, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Done
