DESCRIPTION

Handle initial checkout correctly

As described in native gits file "git-read-tree.txt" git has in a
special mode when doing the "initial" checkout. "Initial" means that the
index is empty before the checkout. This was not handled correctly in
JGit and is fixed in this commit. Also see
https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/git-read-tree.txt#L181

Patch Set 2:

Here is the history: All that was initiated by a forum entry: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=rview&goto=1397170#msg_1397170 . While fixing that (sorry for not insisting on a bug for that) I wrote tests and only these new tests revealed the problem. So, there is no bug and no forum entry for exactly the problem I solved here.
