DESCRIPTION

Handle initial checkout correctly

As described in native gits file "git-read-tree.txt" git has in a
special mode when doing the "initial" checkout. "Initial" means that the
index is empty before the checkout. This was not handled correctly in
JGit and is fixed in this commit. Also see
https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/git-read-tree.txt#L181

Small style nit.

Logic looks good to me! Wonder why I didn't catch that, the "initial checkout" case seems to have been there for some time (in git-read-tree.txt).

By the way, is there a bug report corresponding to this?

Line:754, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Could we add some braces here? It looks correct, but this is the case where it's hard to tell (for me at least).
