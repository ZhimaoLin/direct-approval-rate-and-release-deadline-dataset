Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> the bundle com.jcraft.jsch is available in Eclipse Orbit, see my comment in bug 359288. If it would not be available as a bundle it couldn't be installed in Eclipse. I think it's ok to replace RequireBundle by package import but the commit message should be changed.

style nit: we link to the bug in the commit message footer (last paragraph of the commit message like this:
