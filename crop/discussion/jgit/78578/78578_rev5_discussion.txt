Patch Set 5:

> Yes, the bundle com.jcraft.jsch is available in Eclipse Orbit, but
 > things get very much complicated when you try to reference the
 > bundle from your Maven build. Using the artifact "org.apache.servicemix.bundles:org.apache.servicemix.bundles.jsch"
 > from Maven Central simplifies usage of JGit in plain OSGi
 > environments.

would this be simpler if the Orbit bundle would be also deployed to the Eclipse maven repository https://repo.eclipse.org ?
