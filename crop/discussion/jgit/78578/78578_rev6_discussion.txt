That would be very nice, but we must ensure that both artifacts (the wrapped one from Orbit and the original one) are still distinguishable. Should we use a different groupId?

we can't decide this here since bundles provided by Orbit are used by many Eclipse projects so I think this should be discussed in the Orbit project, either post an email to the orbit-dev list [1] or file a bug against orbit [2] to kick off this discussion
