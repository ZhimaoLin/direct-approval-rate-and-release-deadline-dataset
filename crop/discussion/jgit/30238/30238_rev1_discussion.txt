Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I wouldn't do it by introduce two new classes. If you have a class defining JUnit tests and the only thing you want to change is to introduce a new flag (newLineAtEnd in your case) and let all tests run with and without that flag set then I would use Theories. Like RecursiveMergerTest. In your case I would suggest to stay only with MergeAlgorithmTest:

 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public class MergeAlgorithmTest {
  ...
 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public static newLineAtEnd;
  ...
 xxx@xxx.xxx
  public void testXYZ(boolean nl) {
  ....

JUnit will take care that testXYZ is called twice - once with nl=true and once with nl=false.

Patch Set 1:

Maybe it is a bit too much to test all permutations of nl/no-nl for all tests. Just add a few extra tests for the missing cases. That'd probably be good enough and we could avoid the parameterized/theorized tests alltogether

..and if we do that, all these commits could probably be squashed into one or two. Small commits are good, but this a bit much considering the real change.
