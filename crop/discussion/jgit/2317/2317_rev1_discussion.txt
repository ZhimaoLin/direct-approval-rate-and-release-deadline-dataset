DESCRIPTION

RFC Unpack small packs to loose objects

C Git unpacks pack streams with less than 100 objects into loose
objects, bypassing the pack system in the destination repository.  For
small pushes from a developer workstation to a central server, this
works well as the push size tends to be under the 100 object limit.
With the objects loose at the destination, repack will see them and
try to generate new deltas, resulting in better compression than if
the on-wire deltas were saved and reused by repack.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Totally untested.  I just finished writing what seems like the basic implementation.  :-)
