Line:1082, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> ok, with JDK 1.7u6 and 4.2 I also get a warning, why don't you close the stream in a finally block ?

Line:1124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Closing this stream closes the underlying stream early. Its wrong to close in either place here.
