DESCRIPTION

Support writing packs using bitmaps in pack index version E003.

Update the PackWriter to support writing out E003 indexes.
Bitmaps are selected at commits every 100 to 10,000 commits for
each unique path from the start. The most recent 20,000 commits
have a bitmap every 100 commits. From there, the distance linearly
increasing with the total number of commits in the graph. Commits
with more than 1 parent are prefered over ones with 1 or less.

Bitmaps are used to speed up the counting phase when packing, for
requests that are not shallow. The PackWriterBitmapWalker uses
a RevFilter to proactively mark commits with RevFlag.SEEN, when
they appear in a bitmap. The walker produces the full closure
of reachable ObjectIds, given the collection of starting ObjectIds.

For fetch request, two ObjectWalks are executed to compute the
ObjectIds reachable from the haves and from the wants. The
ObjectIds needed to be written are determined by taking all the
resulting wants AND NOT the haves.

For clone requests, we get cached pack support for "free" since
it is possible to determine if all of the ObjectIds in a pack file
are included in the resulting list of ObjectIds to write.

On my machine, the best times for clones and fetches of the linux
kernel repository (with about 2.6M objects and 300K commits) are
tabulated below:

Operation                   Index V2               Index VE003

Fetch (1 commit back)          75ms                 107ms

Line:1552, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> See this rule. The packer can't make bitmap data for the other non-head packs.

Line:1791, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> This causes long stalls for the client. The bulk of your latency is in findObjects here and 2 lines down building the wantBitmap. But you don't touch the ProgressMonitor until everything is computed and its virtually free to announce the count to the user.

When bitmaps are not available the traversal looking for a cached pack match updates the ProgressMonitor for each commit traversed. This gives the user some indication that we are working on their request and not just sitting around idle. If the repository isn't hot in memory we may have lower object throughput while parts of the data are read from disk.

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

There is a bug in this change that we have identified but not tracked down, it can omit objects that a client needs, leaving clients either failing fsck post fetch, or corrupt.

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> nit: the argument and the field are too close in name. Please prefix the field with "this." or rename the argument.
