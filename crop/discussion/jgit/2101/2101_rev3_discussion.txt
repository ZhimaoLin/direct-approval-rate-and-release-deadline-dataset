DESCRIPTION

File utilities for creating directories

The java.io.File methods for creating directories report failure by
returning false. To ease proper checking of return values provide
utility methods wrapping mkdir() and mkdirs() which throw IOException
on failure.

Also fix the tests to store test data under a trash folder and cleanup
after test.

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Why do we need this int when you use a boolean below?

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> I would put this on the failure path:

  if (!d.mkdir()) {
    if (skipExisting && d.isDirectory())
      return;

    throw new IOException(...);
  }

Because odds are the caller wants to make a new directory and we can reasonably assume it doesn't exist yet.  If it does, we'll fail on the mkdir and check its mode, if its a directory, we're fine, if its not, we fail.
