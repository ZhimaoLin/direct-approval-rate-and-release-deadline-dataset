DESCRIPTION

File utilities for creating directories

The java.io.File methods for creating directories report failure by
returning false. To ease proper checking of return values provide
utility methods wrapping mkdir() and mkdirs() which throw IOException
on failure.

Also fix the tests to store test data under a trash folder and cleanup
after test.
