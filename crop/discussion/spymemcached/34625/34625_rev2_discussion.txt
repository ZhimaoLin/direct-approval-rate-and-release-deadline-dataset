DESCRIPTION

SPY-157: Enhance auth capabilities (logging & timeouts).

This changeset adds logs for both the SASL list and SASL auth steps.
If the timings take longer than (currently) 250ms, a WARN will be issued,
otherwise just a DEBUG log will be issued.

This is especially helpful in production when authentication errors are printed
to check if there is a over-long delay in the authentication phase.

It also increases the authlatch timeout from 1 second to 2.5 (default op timeout,
because in cases where CRAM-MD5 and "sasl list" is used, instead of one a total
of 3 roundstrips is issued - this takes longer).
