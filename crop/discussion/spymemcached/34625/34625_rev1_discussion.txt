DESCRIPTION

SPY-157: Log auth step timings.

This changeset adds logs for both the SASL list and SASL auth steps.
If the timings take longer than (currently) 250ms, a WARN will be issued,
otherwise just a DEBUG log will be issued.

This is especially helpful in production when authentication errors are printed
to check if there is a over-long delay in the authentication phase.
