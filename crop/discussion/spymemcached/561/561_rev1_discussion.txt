DESCRIPTION

Fix compilation with JDK 1.5.

Don't use methods and enum's that only exist in JDK 1.6.

The changes successfully compile and the unit tests pass with JDK 1.6,
but with 1.5 I consistently get a unit test failure here:

    [junit] Testcase: testSimpleLoading took 0.265 sec
    [junit] 	      Caused an ERROR

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I guess I don't understand how this worked as much as it did.
