Line:20, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/GetAndTouchOperation.java -> Why not add the CAS here as well?? It is returned over the wire so it's no extra cost to let the user get it as well...

Line:49, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/AsciiOperationFactory.java -> For consistency you should probably use getAndTouch in the text as well...
