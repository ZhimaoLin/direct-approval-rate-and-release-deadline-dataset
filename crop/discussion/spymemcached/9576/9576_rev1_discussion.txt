DESCRIPTION

Operations statuses on errors are now handled by the operation

When asking for the status the future will no longer have to call
the get() function to get the status. This is also much cleaner
code than what was previously done.

Line:53, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/BaseOperationImpl.java -> Why do we create two of these, only to ignore either one or both?  Might it be better to have a method that constructs them on demand?

This is really memory-expensive on a per-operation basis.

Line:53, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/BaseOperationImpl.java -> This is a static variable so it is only created once ever. Wouldn't constructing this on demand be more memory intensive? Also, I have defined it once for consistency purposes.
