Line:5, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/RequestMessage.java -> Import from the same package?

Line:5, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/BaseMessage.java -> import from the same package??

Line:3, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/ResponseMessage.java -> import from the same package?  This one is really obvious!

Line:39, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/Util.java -> Should this be named differently?  I like the symmetry in the method name, but your comment is quite different.
