Line:243, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/TapClient.java -> Any reason not to call Thread.currentThread().interrupt() anyway?

Line:267, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/TapClient.java -> I think this is easier to read as:

    for (Map.Entry<Operation,TapConnectionProvider> me: omap.entrySet()) {
        me.getValue().shutdown();
    }

though barely (thanks, Java).  I typically don't like using a while loop when a for loop will do.
