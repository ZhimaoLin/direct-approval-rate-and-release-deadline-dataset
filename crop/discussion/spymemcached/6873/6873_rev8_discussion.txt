Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(6 inline comments)

Still need to read a bit more, but here are a few simple things that need to change.

Line:8, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/TapOperation.java -> This comment isn't really true, is it?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/BaseMessage.java -> Who is this membase company?  And what year is it?  :p

Just remove this section.

Line:16, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/BaseMessage.java -> I'm unsure why this class makes sense.  I may need to read more, but it seems like a lot of static stuff, and you'll have an instance of this somewhere with thread synchronization on the setters/getters?

Will read more, but if says it can't be instantiated and then describes something that can.

Line:138, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/AsciiOperationFactory.java -> The word protocol here could save someone a lot of confusion.  Like previous suggestions, ASCII should be capped.

Line:36, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/TapAckOperationImpl.java -> This at least seems worthy of some docs.  I know this isn't public for a user, but this would seem confusing if you just showed up.

Line:43, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/TapBackfillOperationImpl.java -> Again, seems slightly confusing.

Line:8, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/TapOperation.java -> Done

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/BaseMessage.java -> I have no idea how that got in there.

Line:138, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/AsciiOperationFactory.java -> Done

Line:30, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/TapCustomOperationImpl.java -> Added javadocs here too.

Line:36, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/TapAckOperationImpl.java -> Makes sense. I have added javadocs for this function saying it always returns null. If you think it can be better worded let me know.

/**
 * Since the tap ack doesn't specify any specific keys to get
 * this function always returns null;
 */

Line:43, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/TapBackfillOperationImpl.java -> Done
