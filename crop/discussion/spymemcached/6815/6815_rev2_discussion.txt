Line:148, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Use HashSet<SocketAddress> here.

Line:149, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Use ArrayList here.

Line:168, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> ArrayList here and the next three lines.

Line:192, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> It would be great to refactor the class so that much of the code in this constructor isn't duplicated in the existing constructors, ala DRY principle.

Line:257, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> As a style note, removing this. everywhere would be nice.  It really shouldn't be necessary, as requiring it implies that some shadowing is going on, which isn't a good pattern.

Line:259, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> What happens if conn.reconfigure() throws an exception.  Should reconfiguring be in a finally block?

Line:54, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/AddrUtil.java -> You can pass in the exact size from servers.size() so the ArrayList doesn't need to use its default size.

Line:60, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/AddrUtil.java -> Indentation is off here.

Line:66, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/AddrUtil.java -> addrs will only be empty is servers is empty, so better to throw an IllegalArgumentException, but even there, that may be questionable if it should do that,

Line:192, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> agreed, though probably not at the moment.  this ctor is to be killed here soon anyway.

Line:257, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> what happened to 'read more often than written'?  Style wise, I always thought it was good to see that... especially if you're not in the IDE where color indicates what's happening.  That said, it's not elsewhere in this file, so the precedent should be followed.

We should come up with some guidelines for the project.  Like "no tabs".

Line:259, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> good catch.
