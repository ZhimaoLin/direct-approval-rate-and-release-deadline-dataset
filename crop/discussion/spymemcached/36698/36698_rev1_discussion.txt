DESCRIPTION

SPY-169: Also clone observe calls on redistribute.

Motivation
----------
Observe calls also need to be cloned when redistributed, for example if a socket
gets closed or the op stil waits for an auth latch.

Modifications
-------------
The observe operation now gets cloned similar to get, gets and so on.

Result
------
No assert error is raised if an observe needs to be cloned.

It may be worth rethinking this cloning approach in the 2.0 client.  Per our discussion, I know you just did it this way since that's how the others were, but it seems we should have the operations own that rather than expose their inner state and unit test it well.

Line:37, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/BaseOperationFactory.java -> lovely comment there ^^
