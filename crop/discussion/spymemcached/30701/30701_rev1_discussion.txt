DESCRIPTION

SPY-146: Use correct length of key in observe.

This changeset makes sure that the correct length of the key is used in the
protocol. Since UTF-8 chars like the pound sign (currency) are represented
in two bytes but are one character in a string, the length of the key needs
to be determined after it is converted into a byte array.
