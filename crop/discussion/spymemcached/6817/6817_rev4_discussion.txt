DESCRIPTION

Add both hostnames and IPs to the nodes map.

Depending on the deployment environment and the configuration, we
may see either an IP or a hostname from the REST interface.  To ensure
we can look up the node later, simply add both to the internal Map.

Line:81, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> Use interfaces in the public API where you can change the implementation type, but here in a method, the compiler will need to make a virtual method call, which is a tiny bit slower.

Line:81, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> I wouldn't call it that :)  Why would you use a less explicit type there when you don't need to.  There's no design principle in work inside a single method.
