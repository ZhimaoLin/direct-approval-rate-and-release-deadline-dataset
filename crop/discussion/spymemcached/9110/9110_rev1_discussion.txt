DESCRIPTION

Fixed issue with the CouchDB connection not closing.

MemcachedConnection was returning false when the shutdown
function was called even when the connection was closed correctly.
As a result the CouchConnection wasn't shutting down properly. The
issue had to do with having false be the default return value when
it should have been true.

Patch Set 1:

Especially since it's so simple, and had been a bug for quite a while, it'd be good to add a unit test for this.  Build a connection, then call shutdown, verify that it's coming back correctly.
