DESCRIPTION

Operations can't timeout when writing to the write buffer

We implemented a mechanism for operations to be able to timeout
while waiting to be written to a socket, but failed to take into
account the fact that an item can timeout while in the middle
of writing to that buffer.

This commit adds a new OperationState called WRITE_QUEUED that
specifies that the operation is waiting to be written to the
write buffer. When an operation begins writing to the write
buffer it goes into the WRITING state. When an operation is in
the WRITING state it cannot time out

Minor bit to be fixed there with a missing line, but it can come later if needed.
