Patch Set 4: Fails

Tests fail after rebase.  Not clear if it's this commit or something else.  Investigating.

Patch Set 4: No score

Problem is not with this change.  The change in http://review.couchbase.org/#change,16255 introduced this test failure, but it looks like it's just a correct assertion now, where it wasn't before.

Patch Set 4:

Further update, it was actually another change, the ones with errorcodes that introduced this failure.  Those changes have been reverted.

Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)

was just about to submit this, but there's one line that will probably fail checkstyle.   will fix.

Line:120, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/ResponseMessage.java -> I think this will fail checkstyle.
