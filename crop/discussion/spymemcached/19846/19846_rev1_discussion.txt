DESCRIPTION

Add the node back to connected during reconnect.  Issue 225.

The connection was being added back a bit later than its
reconnect, causing operations to continue to timeout.  It's
not clear if this is platform specific or not, but this change
is reported to work.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This has already been added. I was having trouble pushing this patch set, but now I see Jasmin Rangel took it anyway even though it complained at the git level.
