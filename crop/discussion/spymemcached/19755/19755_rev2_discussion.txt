Patch Set 2: Do not submit

With this change, it compiles again but all of the documented defines no longer work.  This *might* be acceptable for a 2.9 with additioanl documentation updates, but I can't put it through for this 2.8.3.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

Looks like another change went through that does this.
