Patch Set 1: Fails

The code doesn't compile after a clean since it removes log4j.  

I can't put this in a .micro update if we remove existing logging either.  This would have to go into a 2.9 release.  We can't have people update a micro release and find their existing logging configured since spy 2.3 (or something like that) was just busted in a micro release.

I think we should be able to add this alongside the other, or even build the existing compat on top of slf4j.  It'd be a much bigger patch set, but it'd give some performance advantages too since spy's default logging doesn't parameterize many log messages.
