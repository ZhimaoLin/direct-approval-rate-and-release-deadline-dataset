DESCRIPTION

Added the ability for Spy to handle errors in views

If a node is down or an item is unavailable then Couchbase
will return a view response that contains a mix of errors
and successes. Previously Spy could only handle responses
that contained only successes. This commit adds the ability
to handle a mix of errors and successes returned in the same
view result.
