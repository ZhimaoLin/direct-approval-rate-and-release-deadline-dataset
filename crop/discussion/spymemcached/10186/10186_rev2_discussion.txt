DESCRIPTION

Merge branch 'refresh'

Note there are three public variables that don't pass our
checkstyle.  I'm proposing they be merged as is and then
fixed in subsequent changes.

  Revert "SPY-37 & SPY-38: Fixed redistribution performance issue"
  No need for old debugging string in test.
  Add compatibility with netty 3.2.0+.
  Refactored tap message classes.
  SPY-37 & SPY-38: Fixed redistribution performance issue

  Don't reconnect when a tap connection finishes.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Checked "Add compatibility with netty 3.2.0+.", looks good.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

My vote is on making the changes to make everything pass the checkstyle, but I am okay with a second fix too.

Patch Set 2: Verified

I agree with you Mike if the next step is obvious, but in this case I don't know that it is.  I could certainly add accessors, but I think the subject matter expert (you) may just want to think about how this should be done.

In refresh, it became public from private.  Depending on the types of mutations, there should perhaps just be a method about what kind of modifications are being made.

I don't think anyone else will +2, so I'm kind of looking to you mike for the +2.  :)

I thought 2 +1's was a +2.
