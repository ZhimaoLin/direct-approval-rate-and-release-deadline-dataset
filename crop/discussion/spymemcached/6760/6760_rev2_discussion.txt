Patch Set 2: Do not submit

Fails to compile due to earlier changes in code.

The main reason I publish this is to show where things are going.  The ConfigurationProviderHTTP owns it's entire object model (all of those classes people were worried about immutability on) and uses it in one place to build it out to support serving up of a configuration to the NodeLocator of a MemcachedClient who specifies this list of URIs.
