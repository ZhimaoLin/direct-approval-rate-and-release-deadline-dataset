Line:47, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/UnlockOperationImpl.java -> private static final String CMD = "unl";

Line:66, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/UnlockOperationImpl.java -> CMD, not "unlock"

Line:78, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/UnlockOperationImpl.java -> Print the cas out here.

Line:31, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/UnlockOperation.java -> No callback needed here. Just have a blank class as a place holder.

Line:88, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/OperationFactory.java -> OperationCallback, not UnlockOperation.Callback
