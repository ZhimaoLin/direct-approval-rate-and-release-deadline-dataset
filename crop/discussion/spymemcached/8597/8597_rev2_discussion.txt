Line:231, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> This constant should be somewhere else.

Line:225, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> should the timeout on these be per method invocation, following a default?  

for instance, should this really be 
asyncQuery(View view, Query query, int timeval, TimeUnit)

for the method that does stuff, and there is one that just uses the default?

Line:231, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> I would put it somewhere else if were going to be there permanently. What "should" be here is the operationTimeout variable. Since Couchbase isn't ready for a lower timeout I have this hardcoded. I would like to keep it this way because it is so obviously wrong that I will easily notice it in the future and change it back to operationTimeout.

Line:225, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> This can be configured through the connection factory. It might look slightly confusing because I hardcoded the timeout.

Line:231, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> Got it.  I still would have stuck it in a constant or changed it in the config, but that's fine.  In that case, probably good to mark it as todo && file a bug.

Line:225, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> Even with the connection wide default timeout, there may be times you want to call with a larger timeout.  We do that in the main client (I think).  This is particularly important in views, since they may go quite long.

Line:225, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> There isn't a way to make individual memcached calls and specify the timeout in the function parameters. We could add it, but the we begin getting into having a lot of query call permutations (Async vs Sync, Return with errors/Retun without errors, Specify a timeout per operation/ don't specify a timeout per operation)

Line:225, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> Yep, agreed.  We'll come back to that later if needed.  Ideally, views will be quick.
