DESCRIPTION

SPY-136: Do not timeout when waiting on the sasl mechs.

Since we also dont timeout on the return of the auth op, keeping
the process consistent. This avoids the situation where the server
is potentially rebooting and the timeout occurs. In combination with
code depending on the sasl list, exceptions can occur and the auth
thread dies.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Problem is, during reboot it will either return a TMPFAIL or won't be listening.  Also, we rely on timeout to detect certain kinds of broken networks.

This is something we should make better in the future.
