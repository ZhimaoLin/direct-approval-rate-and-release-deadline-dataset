DESCRIPTION

SPY-160: Avoid ConcurrentModificationException with the retry queue

Motivation
----------
ConcurrentModificationException will show up since the code can recursively
modify itself.

Modifications
-------------
Copy the original list into a temporary new one to avoid the exception.

Result
------
Redistribute on the retry list will work as expected, without an
exception.
