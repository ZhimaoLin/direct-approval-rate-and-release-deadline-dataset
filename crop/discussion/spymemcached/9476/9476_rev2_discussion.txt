DESCRIPTION

Made cmd variable a byte for binary operations.

This variable should have never been an int since it is defined in
the protocol as a byte. The reason for the change is that when we
have opcode that is greater have 127 the value of a byte and an int
are different (Ex. int = 128 byte = -127). This was causing an
assertion to fail, in this case for the getl command (0x94).

better, but it looks like there was an inadvertent squash here.

Line:29, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/DeleteOperationImpl.java -> This snuck into the wrong changeset.

Line:52, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/MultiKeyOperationImpl.java -> wrong changeset

Line:26, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/FlushOperationImpl.java -> wrong changeset, there are probably some others too

There was not an inadvertent squash here, I just rebased this over the toString() change which already got committed to the refresh branch.
