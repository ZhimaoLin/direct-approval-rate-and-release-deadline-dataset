oh so minor a change needed.  I should have caught this earlier, but I don't always see the copyright block.  

You have a +2 after updating the header for these files, it otherwise looks good.  Thanks!

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/TapResponseFlag.java -> 2012.

This applies to the others too.

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/TapResponseFlag.java -> So every time I change a file now I must extend the copyright?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/TapResponseFlag.java -> The guideline is that if you're creating a new publication (source code counts as a publication) you need to specify the year of the publication.  2012 is technically sufficient, but 2009-2011 is not, since in 2047 someone could run off with this code saying "I didn't know any better!"

"The year of first publication of the work. In the case of 
compilations or derivative works incorporating previously 
published material, the year date of first publication of 
the compilation or derivative work is sufficient."

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/TapResponseFlag.java -> Ok. I have a feeling this is going to both me because I will forget this a lot. Can we just mark everything 2015 so that we don't have to worry about this for a few years?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/TapResponseFlag.java -> Uncle sam says no.  Well, the pain would be in the court, actually.  It's just something we need to do.  I think it won't be that bad.
