DESCRIPTION

Changed all binary command opcode values to hexadecimal.

We intermixed hexidecimal and base 10 values throughout the code
for any given binary operation. This commit changes all the base
10 values to hexadecimal. This way the opcode definitions match
up better with the code in the memcached project.
