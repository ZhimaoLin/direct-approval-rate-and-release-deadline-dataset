Patch Set 4:

Here's the header to the file I copied our style from. We are using checkstyle which is a java style checker that will be required to run and pass before any code is checked in. The code to di this is currently on my local machine. The buildfile will be checked in as the next commit. Right now we should just look at it and decide whether we like the new look for the code.

<!--

  Checkstyle configuration for Spymemcached that is based on the sun_checks.xml file
  that is bundled with Checkstyle and includes checks for:

    - the Java Language Specification at
      http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/index.html

    - the Sun Code Conventions at http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/

    - the Javadoc guidelines at
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html

    - the JDK Api documentation http://java.sun.com/j2se/docs/api/index.html

    - some best practices

  Checkstyle is very configurable. Be sure to read the documentation at
  http://checkstyle.sf.net (or in your downloaded distribution).

  Most Checks are configurable, be sure to consult the documentation.

  To completely disable a check, just comment it out or delete it from the file.

  Finally, it is worth reading the documentation.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Note: I have just sampled some of the files, but if it is based on the java code style I'm for it ;-) (btw. It looks like the code use 3 indents, but I believe that the java style guide recommends 4?)

I am however a small contributor to the project so I'm fine adapting to whatever you decide. 

The stuff I really dislike and care about is:
* No tabs
* Always use {}, even where the language allows them to be absent
* No single-line if/for/do/while statements
* Don't spread "} else {" across multiple lines

As long as you don't violate any of these it's fine by me ;)

Patch Set 4:

My vote for style includes the additional constraints on the GWT project, which starts where the Java style code ends.  There's only a few additional sections:

Comments and Javadoc
Class Structure and Member Sort Order
Imports
Line Length and Wrapping
Acronyms in names
Parameterized type names

My only vote is for 80 character lines at most, as I open 9 terminals each at 24x80.

Patch Set 4:

Blair,

Comments and Javadocs - I will be doing a total revamp of this in a future commit. I plan on having this client documented really well, but I'm not going to do it right now.

Class Structure and Member Sort order - The checkstyle program already does class structure stuff, but I'm not sure if your looking for anything specific. As for Member sort order this sounds like a major pain for me at the moment. Unless you think this is important it won't be part of the commit.

Line Length and Wrapping - Already in the old commits

Acronyms in names - Not caught by this tool. No plans to implement it.

Parameterized Types - I get warnings already for these in Eclipse and I always fix them. This won't be part of the standard, but I always make sure everything is parameterized.

Let me know if the is anything else you think would be good to add.
