Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(10 inline comments)

The attribution, the inc and the trailing comma are the only big things.  After that, I think we're good to go.

Line:67, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/compat/log/DefaultLogger.java -> This became less readable.  

Many of these things that used to begin with || seem that way.  Perhaps grep for any lines in the diff that we're removing that start with whitespace and then ||

Line:156, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/DefaultConnectionFactory.java -> This section and a couple like it in this file have gotten less readable. in this file.

Line:458, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/TCPMemcachedNodeImpl.java -> This is another pace things ended up less readable.  Another grep for lines beginning with + would be good

Line:118, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthThread.java -> this .toString() isn't very readable broken up across multiple lines.  May be in more places too.

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseNode.java -> We've lost this attribution somewhere.  It should be maintained.

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseNode.java -> Missing . after the "Inc".

This is in many files.

Line:19, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseNode.java -> I just noticed this trailing comma too.  Very odd.  In every (c) header.

Line:112, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseNode.java -> Now that this is one line, it need not be concatenated.

Line:123, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/ViewFuture.java -> I've seen this pattern of breaking a .method() onto a new line a few times as well.  

This is also harder to read.  Perhaps we should grep for those line changes.

Line:49, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/spring/MemcachedClientFactoryBean.java -> Should probably move the "class" back to the next line.
