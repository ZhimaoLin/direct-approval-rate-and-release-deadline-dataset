Patch Set 5: (2 inline comments)



Line:98, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> this is not the best name for the properties file.  it probably needs to change.

this and the next comment aren't really for this review, but I noticed them now.

Line:99, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> I'm sure this code review should have gone on something else.  probably reviewed by someone else.  the default should be production mode, with a warning issued.
