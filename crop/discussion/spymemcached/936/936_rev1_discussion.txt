DESCRIPTION

Allow per-key transcoders to be used with asyncGetBulk().

This change allows the transcoder to save state for each key.  An
example is shown in the unit test that encodes into the byte array
sent to the memcached server the key along with the value.  Upon
decoding a value from memcached, the actual and expected keys are
compared.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This seems right, but I'm going to ask for a couple more opinions before pressing the "make API bigger" button.

Matt looked at it and didn't have anything bad to say, but didn't put a +2 down.
