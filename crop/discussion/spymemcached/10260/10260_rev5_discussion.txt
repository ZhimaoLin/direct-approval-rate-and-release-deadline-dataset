DESCRIPTION

SPY-58: Don't compress json objects

We don't actually parse the whole object. Instead we look
at the first character and if it looks like json then we
don't compress it.

Patch Set 5:

I think I just uploaded the same patch set you did. Anyways, it fails like it should for me when I comment out the check for json statement. I doesn't make sense to me that the WhalinTranscoder wouldn't compress this since both WhalinTranscoder and SerializingTranscoder execute almost the same code.

Patch Set 5:

There was a slight difference.  I'd reordered some tests.  Going to try to grok the compression problem here now.
