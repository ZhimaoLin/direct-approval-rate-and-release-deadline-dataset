DESCRIPTION

SPY-58: Don't compress json objects

We don't actually parse the whole object. Instead we look
at the first character and if it looks like json then we
don't compress it.

Patch Set 4: Fails

I think this looks good, but it failed my verification.

I tried to verify by commenting out the JSON check.  Only the regular serializing transcoder check failed.  I noticed the Whalin ones were not using a nicely compressable string, so I swapped it out.  They still pass.

I see no reason for passing there.
