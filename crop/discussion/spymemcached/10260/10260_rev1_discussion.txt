DESCRIPTION

Don't compress json objects

We don't actually parse the whole object. Instead we look
at the first character and if it looks like json then we
don't compress it.

Patch Set 1:

Might be better to just check for '{' here since I don't think it would make sense to not compress something like a json array. What do you think?
