DESCRIPTION

Support Libmemcached ketama weighted

- Add support for alternative Ketama Node key format

  Libmemcached uses the format for `[hostname or ip][port unless
  default]-[repetition]` while spymemcached has been using
  `[hostname]/[ip]:[port]-[repetition]` the added `KetamaNodeKeyFormat`
  allows to choose either format while retaining the caching
  optimization.

- Add support for weighted ketama
  Straight port of the weighting based on Libmemcached, configured via
  passing a map of node socketaddress to weight to the configuration.
  This code is only active if the weight is actually configured
  otherwise the old ketama code is used.
