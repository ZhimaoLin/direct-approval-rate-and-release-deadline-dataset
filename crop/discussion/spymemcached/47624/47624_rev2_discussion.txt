DESCRIPTION

Support Libmemcached ketama weighted

- Add support for alternative Ketama Node key format

  Libmemcached uses the format for `[hostname or ip][port unless
  default]-[repetition]` while spymemcached has been using
  `[hostname]/[ip]:[port]-[repetition]` the added `KetamaNodeKeyFormat`
  allows to choose either format while retaining the caching
  optimization.

- Add support for weighted ketama
  Straight port of the weighting based on Libmemcached, configured via
  passing a map of node socketaddress to weight to the configuration.
  This code is only active if the weight is actually configured
  otherwise the old ketama code is used.

Patch Set 2:

(3 comments)

In general I like it, I just need to do more check on the weightings..

I made some minor comments in the meantime

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please create a SPY ticket on jira and if you could follow the 

Motivation, Modifications, Result format of the other commit messages that would be great.

Line:46, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaConnectionFactory.java -> fields should be made final

Line:39, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaNodeKeyFormat.java -> Hmm somehow it is odd that you are using it in a getter (the inner class) like KetamaNodeKeyFormat.Format

maybe you could rename this class to "formatter"?
