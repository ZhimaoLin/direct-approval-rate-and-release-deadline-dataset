DESCRIPTION

Potential Refactoring of Java Client to couchbase-client and spymemcached

I had to make some minimal changes to spymemcache (changing access
modifiers) to make the refactoring happen.

This is not final(so no ant checkstyle yet :-)), but, if deemed
OK, we can make it final.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This looks good, and feedback from others/community was good (or at least not bad).  Let's go ahead with the refactoring.
