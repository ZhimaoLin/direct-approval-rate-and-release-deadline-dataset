Patch Set 8: Looks good to me, approved

I still think StringUtils and some of the base operation creations should come with tests.  I know these aren't critical path, but how will you verify these?

Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm strongly in favor of tests, especially in the code that's so trivial it almost doesn't need tests.

On the "would I do this" scale, I'd watch my coverage report and make sure all of the toStrings() were covered even if not explicitly (I've written reflection-type things to at least make sure the tests run the code, though if the code exists and our tests don't run it, it seems like we may have code in an unknown state).  I've actually had bugs in these and they usually show up when you're trying to look at a different bug..  I'm, in fact, surprised there's only one method in this whole codebase named testToString().

Patch Set 8: Abandoned

This is going onto the refresh branch now. I have taken into account the comments left here in that change.

Patch Set 8:

Is it urgent for the dot release?  Seems like it'd be easier to just leave it out of the refresh branch.

(no actual opinion, just asking)

Patch Set 8:

Not really, but there will be plenty of things to merge over to master so I don't think it will be a big deal to add this as well.
