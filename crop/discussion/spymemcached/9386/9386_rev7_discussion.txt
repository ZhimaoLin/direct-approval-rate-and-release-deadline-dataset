Patch Set 7: (3 inline comments)



Line:222, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> might be better to just always print Exp, and set it to 0 if it doesn't.  That more matches the API/protocol.

Line:224, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> Feeling spacy?  Why the extra space?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/util/StringUtils.java -> Given that it was written in 2011, shouldn't have this line.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Do we think this should have a test or two?  I'm okay without, but it'd check for NPEs and the like.

-1 based on the Exp in the get.  It's minor, but I think adds clarity.
