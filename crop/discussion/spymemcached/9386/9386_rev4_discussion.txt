Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

You definitely don't want to generate a bunch of garbage String and StringBuilder objects in a loop.  Most of these just need the + operator -- this one too if you have a separate string join (which I think you should, but it's not completely critical).

Line:78, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/MultiKeyOperationImpl.java -> "a" + "b" is not bad.  A loop of a += "b" is definitely bad.

It doesn't have to be Apache's actual implementation of StringUtils.join (I just made the name up, didn't know they had one).  You're doing the same thing in more than one place, I just meant to do it once and reuse it.
