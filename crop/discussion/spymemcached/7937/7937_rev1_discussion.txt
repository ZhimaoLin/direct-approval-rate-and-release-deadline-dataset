DESCRIPTION

Fixed test case regarding setting an item that is too big in memcached

I missed this earlier since I was only testing against Membase. The issue
here is that we changed the way that Membase handled errors from the
server. Before we threw an exception and reconnected. Now we catch the
failure gracefully.
