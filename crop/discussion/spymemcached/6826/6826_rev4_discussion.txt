DESCRIPTION

Added logging for manipulation of nodesMap in VBucketLocator.

Some situations have come up which are unexepctedly causing the
nodesMap to return a null when identifying the primary for a given
key.  We will now debug log how we build that map and look at the
insides of the nodesMap if this situation occurs.

Line:48, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> Can we put these two getLogger() lines into a single log message, this will save CPU and IO.

Line:50, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> In fact, cache the getLogger() result here so it's faster, since there's repeated calls to it.
