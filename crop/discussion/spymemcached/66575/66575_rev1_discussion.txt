Hi, thanks for your changeset!

Why are the methods you take away from the interface not visible by a client?

Patch Set 1:

I don't think anyone external client interacts directly with BroadcastOpFactory
(Not sure what reason they would have to?) They appear to be helper functions for flush(), getStats(), getVersions() and listSaslMechanisms().. I also don't see any reference to them in any unit test.. If you feel too uncomfortable with the change I revert it.

So my trouble is since we are following semver, taking public API away would only be allowed in a new major version with previous deprecation warnings.. I mean we can think about deprecating it now, but still I don't know if its really necessary - wdyt?
