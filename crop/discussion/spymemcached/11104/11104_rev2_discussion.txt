Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

Doing a +0, because I have a question here.

Line:47, ivy/spymemcached-test.xml -> I don't think these attributes are required per the documentation. 

http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.2.0/ivyfile/dependency.html

Is this why I wasn't getting the dependencies defined?

I need to remove the test depndencies

Line:47, ivy/spymemcached-test.xml -> Yeah. This might not be the best way to do this, but it is much more correct than what we had before where all of our dependencies were listed as optional by the maven pom file. I also don't think we need these test dependencies so I will remove them.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

Leaving the default is probably prudent for clarity.
