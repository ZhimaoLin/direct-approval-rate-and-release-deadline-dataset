DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with netty 3.2.0+.

Netty 3.2.0+ (NETTY-281) changed HttpMessage.setHeader(String, String) to
setHeader(String, Object), which causes NoSuchMethodErrors when spymemcached is
used with such a newer netty version. To prevent spymemcached users from other
library incompatibilities the netty dependency is not upgraded, but the
appropriate setHeader method is selected and invoked at runtime. This was
discussed on the mailing list:
http://groups.google.com/group/spymemcached/browse_thread/thread/4b9f0638bbcc96fb
