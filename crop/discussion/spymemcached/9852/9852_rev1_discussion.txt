DESCRIPTION

Add compatibility with netty 3.2.0+.

Netty 3.2.0+ (NETTY-281) changed HttpMessage.setHeader(String, String) to setHeader(String, Object), which causes NoSuchMethodErrors when spymemcached is used with such a newer netty version. To prevent spymemcached users from other library incompatibilities the netty dependency is not upgraded, but the appropriate setHeader method is selected and invoked at runtime. This was discussed on the mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/spymemcached/browse_thread/thread/4b9f0638bbcc96fb

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(1 inline comment)

Only going +1 on this now, and will verify it before doing a +2 and submit.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is one seriously long line!

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

You code looks good, but I didn't verify it. The -1 is for your commit message. Each line can only have 80 characters.
