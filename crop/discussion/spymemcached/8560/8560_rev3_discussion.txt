Patch Set 3:

Couple notes on the commit message (independent of the actual work -- I think Mike had some things to bring up here):

  1. The summary is very, very long.  Should fit within ~70 chars.  example:

    HashAlgorithm registry to add new algorithms from config

  2. Don't need meta info like "rebased".  That stuff doesn't matter in the long term.
