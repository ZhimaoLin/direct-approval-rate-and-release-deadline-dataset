DESCRIPTION

Increase the maximum size allowed.  Issue 106.

Though memcached still has a 1MiB size by default (overridable
with a flag), other engines may have their own maximum.  Membase
for instance has a 20MiB maximum.

At least for the remainder of the 2.6 series, rather than do
deep surgery on this issue, just bump up the maximum.

Patch Set 1:

It probably should be, but as I said in the commit message, rather than do deep surgery on this (it's not even consulted for most operations, but is all over the transcoder code), I'm just bumping it up for the 2.6 series.

I've already filed an issue for 2.7 to fix it more correctly or perhaps just eliminate it.

In the future the user should be able to change this and 100MB should be the default value.

Line:16, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CachedData.java -> It's specified on the constructor.  It *is* available for override somewhere.

It's more correct than before. We can provide a better fix later.
