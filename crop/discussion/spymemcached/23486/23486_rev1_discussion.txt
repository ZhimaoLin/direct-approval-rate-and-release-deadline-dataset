DESCRIPTION

JCBC-196: Allow Append/Prepend without CAS

To align the append and prepend commands with the others, this
changeset adds method signatures to be used without the CAS
value. This is done by passing 0 as the CAS to the others down
the stack making it essentially ignore it.

Line:897, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> "test" and 5 may be declared as constants.

Line:526, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> I guess this is not required ?

There's an unrelated change in here-- probably from the editor.

Also, I think the doc doesn't really represent what is done by the server.

Line:847, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> best to undo this.  My editor does the same thing.

Line:897, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> could be, but I wouldn't worry about this.

Line:419, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> This isn't strictly true, right?  0 isn't "ignored" by the server, it means no matter what, overwrite what's there.

This could be a SPY issue instead of JCBC.
