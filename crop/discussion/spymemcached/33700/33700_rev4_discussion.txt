DESCRIPTION

SPY-154: Also RETRY on binary NMVB response with bulk gets.

This changeset makes sure that even when one of the individual get
operations in the bulk request fails with a "Not My VBucket", the
whole bulk is scheduled for retry.

Note that while just scheduling the one failed get for retry would
be more efficient, this would mean a much larger change to the
overall system, so this should be a good tradeoff for this rather
special case.
