DESCRIPTION

Add visibility into operations

This commit allows the functionality for users to issue requests
and then check to see whether or not they succeeded. They can also
now access the error message that the server sends back to them
so they can see why the server rejected their request. Operation
status's also take into account operation timeouts and exceptions
so if an operation times out the operation says so. Also if an
exception is thrown while processing the operation the operation
status reports the message from that exception.

This commit also adds the ability for the user to be able access
the key that the operation asked for if one is present. This allows
users to be able to easily resend an operaiton on a given key since
they will no longer have to keep key-operation data structures
around in the case of failures
