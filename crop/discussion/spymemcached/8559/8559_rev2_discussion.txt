DESCRIPTION

Made HashAlgorithm to be an interface.

This is preferable over an Enum in order to allow client hash function
customization.

This change introduces HashAlgorithm interface and updates all references
to the former Enum with the default interface implementation.

Patch 2: fixed missed import from the previous commit
