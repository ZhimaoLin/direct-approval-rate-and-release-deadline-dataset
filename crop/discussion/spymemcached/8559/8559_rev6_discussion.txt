Patch Set 6: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I recently submitted a code formatting change for the entire project and that outdated this commit. I just fixed formatting and resubmitted this change. In the future you will be required to make sure your code passes a checkstyle test, but since this was posted before the formatting I went ahead and did it for you.
