Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Paul,

I -1'ed this change only because of the whitespace. Once that is fixed I will +1 it.

I was also curious why you chose to keep all of the hash algorithms as enum's? It seems to me that if we have an interface then each hash algorithm should be in its own class and implementing HashAlgorithm. I am ok with the code being submitted the way it is, but would you have any issues with me putting a fix in later that has each hash algorithm in it's own class?
