Patch Set 2:

(1 comment)

I'm a +0.  I so want to like this change, but the verifyConnected() all over the place is kinda annoying.  

Could we somehow extract all of this subclassing on the spot and put it in there?  Maybe an inner class that does the verifyConnected()?  I may not be thinking straight (it's late), but this is getting messier and messier.

Line:280, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> it's really verifying that it *has been requested* to connect at least once, right?
