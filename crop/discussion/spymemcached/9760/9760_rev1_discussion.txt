Line:50, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocatorTest.java -> this doesn't include the couchApiBase, so I don't see how this test can possibly be checking the right thing.

I think the issue here is that since we have a CouchbaseClient and a MembaseClient now, we need to ensure we get everything correctly to instantiate each object type.  This change seems to assume everything will have the couchApiBase, which will break the use of the MembaseClient with Membase 1.7.x.

Line:103, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/couch/CouchbaseClientTest.java -> why?  seems unrelated to this change.
