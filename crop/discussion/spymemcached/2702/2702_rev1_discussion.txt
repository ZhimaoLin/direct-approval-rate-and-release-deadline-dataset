Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)



Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit messages should be 65-70 characters on the first line.   

Then skip a line, then write as much as you want with the linewrap set to 70.

You can fix these one at a time using commit --amend

Thanks!
