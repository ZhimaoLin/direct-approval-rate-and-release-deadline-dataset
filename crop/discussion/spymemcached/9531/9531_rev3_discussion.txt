Patch Set 3: No score

Dropped it to a -0.  

I think it should still be able to go into TapClient, though I've not looked.  The reason I say this is that IIRC, TapClient extends MembaseClient.  Worst case, we may have to have a protected accessor or something like that.

Patch Set 3:

TapClient doesn't extend anything. Also, remember that there is a TapConnectionProvider and that is the object the resembles MemcachedClient most closely. The problem is that there could be multiple TapConnectionProvider's in a TapClient.
