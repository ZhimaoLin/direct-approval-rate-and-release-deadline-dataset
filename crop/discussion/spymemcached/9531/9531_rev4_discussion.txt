Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(1 inline comment)

I see my confusion now.  I'd forgotten this was at the MemcachedConnection level.

I am still slightly confused as to why the Hadoop Connector will need both a MembaseClient and a TapClient, or maybe it's multiple of them?

Would be good to see the code for the connector.

Line:279, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Recommend renaming to getCurrNumVBuckets() or currVBucketsNum() since it's less an accessor.  No huge opinion on this though.

Also, recommend saying that it's the current number of vbuckets.  Those could, theoretically, change while the client is connected to the cluster.  It's a further signal that you can't always rely on this number.

Line:279, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> I'm a bit less worried about that.  You need to keep a decent backlog of stuff to point back at me and say "told you so", though.  :)
