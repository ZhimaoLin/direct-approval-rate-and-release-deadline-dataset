DESCRIPTION

SPY-132: Adding Callbacks to Futures.

This changeset adds a onComplete callback to futures and executes
the callback in a configurable ExecutorService. By default, this
is a fixed size thread pool (threads = num of processors), but
configurable through the Factory.

Patch Set 12:

Oh, one comment here.  In the threadpool for the callbacks, are the threads named?  They probably should be as it will probably save a lot of hassle with debugging for someone someday.
