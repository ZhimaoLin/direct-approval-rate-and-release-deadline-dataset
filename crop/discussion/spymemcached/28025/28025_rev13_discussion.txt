DESCRIPTION

SPY-132: Adding Callbacks to Futures.

This changeset adds a onComplete callback to futures and executes
the callback in a configurable ExecutorService. By default, this
is a fixed size thread pool (threads = num of processors), but
configurable through the Factory.

+2, though at your option you may want to consider a name change for the thread.  It's rather generic.  Adding spymemcached or maybe just 'memcached' would make it more clear.

Your option though!

Line:116, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/AbstractListenableFuture.java -> Maybe better to be "spymemcached FutureNotifyListener"?  Or "spymemcached future notify listener"?
