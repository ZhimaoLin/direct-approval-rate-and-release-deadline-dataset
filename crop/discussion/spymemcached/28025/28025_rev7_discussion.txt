DESCRIPTION

WIP: Adding Callbacks to Futures.

This changeset adds a onComplete callback to futures and executes
the callback in a configurable ExecutorService. By default, this
is a 2 thread fixed size thread pool, but configurable through
the Factory.

TODO:
 - checkstyle + comments
 - Add test to override with a custom executorService
