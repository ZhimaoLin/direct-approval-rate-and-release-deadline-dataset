DESCRIPTION

ASCII get operations now return a false operation status on failure

get in ASCII always returns END at the end of the result from
memcached. In the current implementation of spy seeing END caused
spy to return operation success. We now check to see if a value
is returned before END and if one if not we return a failure
for OperationStatus of NOT_FOUND.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I think this is correct, but would like to maybe get Dustin's take.

Basically, what we're saying here is doing a get() would return null, but the OperationStatus associated with it would be success in the case of a get miss.  

So now when the server sends "END" before "VALUE" we'll set the operation status to NOT_FOUND when we didn't get any bytes to read.

Since it's all new stuff for end users, it makes sense to me.
