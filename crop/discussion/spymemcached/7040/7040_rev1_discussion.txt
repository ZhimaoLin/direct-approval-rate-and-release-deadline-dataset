DESCRIPTION

ASCII get operations now return a false operation status on failure

get in ASCII always returns END at the end of the result from
memcached. In the current implementation of spy seeing END caused
spy to return operation success. We now check to see if a value
is returned before END and if one if not we return a failure
for OperationStatus of NOT_FOUND.
