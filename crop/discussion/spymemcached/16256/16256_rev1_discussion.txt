Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

Some minor comments. Mainly interested in the tab and comment block with no comments.

Line:49, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/OperationFuture.java -> No comment contents?

Line:97, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/OperationFuture.java -> This function should just be deleted. Maybe in another commit though.

Line:100, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/OperationFuture.java -> I think we can delete this comment right here since I added the WRITE_QUEUED state.

Line:174, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/OperationFuture.java -> Tab.
