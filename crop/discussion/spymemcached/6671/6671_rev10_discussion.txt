Patch Set 10: (1 inline comment)

Just one thing about the JSON parser, do you want an explicit dependency on a specific parser here?  What happens if you ever want to swap out parsers.

Making a small memcached JSON parser interface that can be implemented by any of the many JSON parsers may be a nice way to break the explicit dependency.

Line:16, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/VBucket.java -> Make a defensive copy of replicas here so the that replica cannot be mutated by the caller of VBucket's constructor?
