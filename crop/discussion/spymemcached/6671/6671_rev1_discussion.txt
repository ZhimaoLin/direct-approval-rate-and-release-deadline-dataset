Line:7, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/ConfigFactory.java -> People normally use File for a file in Java...

Wouldn't it be sufficient with:

Config create(File);

Config create(String);

Config create(JSONObject);

Line:67, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/DefaultConfigFactory.java -> Shouldn't we throw an exception if we don't support the hash algorithm instead of falling back to native hash?

Line:9, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/DefaultConfig.java -> Make all of these final.

Line:63, buildfile -> Why not use Spring 3.0.5, it's the latest 3.0.x release?

Patch Set 1:
