I'm not sure about the JSON parser right now.  It *is* part of the API so it does matter some.  Writing a JSON abstraction is undesirable to me today, though.  :)

Patch Set 11: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I want to note that the changes around the addition of a vBucket map (This change and the next few) are not public api's. This code will never be touched by the user of Spy except for the creation of a MemcachedClient object, but in this case they are only passing in a list of URI's.

Mike, thanks.  If these classes don't infect user apps, I'm not worried about them.

Patch Set 11:

And further to Mike's comment, these are places that bugs can crawl in and hide, but we've been working to mainline a bunch of code that has been effectively in a fork here.  I could have fixed a bunch of this on the fork and merged it, but instead have been trying to fix it by reordering and cleaning up commits.

I believe that at the end of the process, we'll still have things that are below our desired standards, but we can clean that up with future commits.
