Patch Set 9: Looks good to me, approved

Just so it's said: I still think that adding a complete "module" without any documentation is a bad idea, because I don't think it will be done some time in the future ;-)

Patch Set 9: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I'm going to prove you wrong. I'll add documentation for 2.7.1.

Patch Set 9:

on tabs/spaces, I expect to do a big reformatting patch here after going through the backlog and before doing the final.  It's up to you, but I wouldn't fret minor whitespace issues at the moment

Line:52, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/DefaultConfig.java -> If you're going to check for serverIndex > servers.size() -1, how about checking for < 0.

Line:9, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/VBucket.java -> The servers is final, but in its usage, are its array elements ever changed, say by multiple threads?

Line:22, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/DefaultConfigFactory.java -> Wouldn't this be better as an IllegalArgumentException?

Next patch incorporates findings from Blair.

Line:52, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/DefaultConfig.java -> I'll just delete all of that.  It's a lot of work to add stuff that List will already do.

Line:9, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/VBucket.java -> Great find.  This revealed another error where unsynchronized mutations were occurring.  Fixed it up.
