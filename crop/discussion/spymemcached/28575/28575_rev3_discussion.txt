debug support. It is optional and can be enabled through the factory
or via a system property.

The collected values can be exported through:
 - The Console
 - JMX
 - CSV
 - SLF4J

These output reporters can also be configured through properties, by
default the console reporter will be used.

TODO:
----
 - (not included here) basic profiling to see perf impact on load
 - Run all Test for verification

Line:374, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/DefaultConnectionFactory.java -> nice, I think this is the right behavior, to allow it to be forced off via a property.

Line:3, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedNode.java -> just a copyright change?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/DefaultMetricCollector.java -> again, no Noah Dean needed here

Line:508, build.xml -> just be aware that optional has no meaning any more in maven.  They recommend separating into multiple jars when you need optional dependencies.   In other words, everyone would need to pick up this Jar.  :(

Line:168, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactory.java -> interface change means new dot-minor.

Line:53, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/MetricType.java -> this means DEBUG includes PERFORMANCE?  this may be a bit ambiguious.  That seems to be what you mean though?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/MetricCollector.java -> ixnay on the ustinday

http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ixnay

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/AbstractMetricCollector.java -> no Noah Dean needed here.

Line:29, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/AbstractMetricCollector.java -> Huh.  I guess this is useful.  Pretty bare though!
