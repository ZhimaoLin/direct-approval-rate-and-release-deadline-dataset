Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(1 inline comment)

Sorry for the delay in review, but I wanted to actually write some code against this.  I have one reasonably serious problem, and one minor problem that probably isn't for this code review.  

The serious issue is that the calling code working with the query  can still mutate it, which can really mess up the way a Paginator works.  

The minor issue is actually pretty much unrelated to this, but with the response, why is it getMap() and iterator() and not getMap() and getIterator()?

Oh, also, no javadoc on the paginatedQuery() in CouchbaseClient.

I don't see the change for the query, am I missing it?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:53, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/Paginator.java -> The caller still has a reference to the query, so I think you'll need to make a deep copy of it.  Otherwise, this thing can get messed up internally.  This could be here or in the method in CouchbaseClient.

Best thing to do is probably to create a copy constructor for Query.
