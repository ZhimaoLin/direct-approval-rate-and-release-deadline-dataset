Please address my questions, then I can +2 if good.

Line:301, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> What about the docs about shutdown()?

Line:275, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/DefaultConnectionFactory.java -> Will these be named threads?  It would be best if they are.

Line:301, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> good point.

Line:275, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/DefaultConnectionFactory.java -> they are indeed. currently they get named in the AbstractListener implementation when tasks are dispatched.
