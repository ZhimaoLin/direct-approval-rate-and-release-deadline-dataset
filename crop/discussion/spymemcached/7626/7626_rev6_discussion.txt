DESCRIPTION

Added constructor to MemcachedClient that takes a ConnectionFactory

Previously users of the vBucket Aware MemcachedClient of smart client
were unable to specify specific values for how connections are
createded. This commit allows uses to pass a ConnectionFactory into
a vBucket Aware constructor in the MemcachedClient object.
