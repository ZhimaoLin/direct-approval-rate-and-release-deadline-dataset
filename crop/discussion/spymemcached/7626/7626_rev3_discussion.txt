DESCRIPTION

Added constructor to MemcachedClient that takes a ConnectionFactory

Previously users of the vBucket Aware MemcachedClient of smart client
were unable to specify specific values for how connections are
createded. This commit allows uses to pass a ConnectionFactory into
a vBucket Aware constructor in the MemcachedClient object.

Line:216, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> I think it'd simplify the code a lot if you just passed in a new ConnectionFactory here instead of just handling the null case below...

Line:247, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> ... then we can throw an NPE if cf is null.

Line:256, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> whitespace here.

Line:267, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> And these five lines can go.  :)
