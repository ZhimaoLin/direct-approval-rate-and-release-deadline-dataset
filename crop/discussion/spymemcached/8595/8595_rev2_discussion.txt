DESCRIPTION

SPY-17: setStale() and setGroup(bool, int) make bad query params

This issue was found by a user and is now fixed. I also added a bunch
of unit tests that test each function in the Query class builds a set
of query parameters correctly.

The unit tests should be split out into another commit.  Also, this appears to be a work in progress.

Line:47, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/couch/CouchbaseClientTest.java -> This is certainly wrong.
