DESCRIPTION

Made MemcachedNode Generic

In order to reuse code for the implementation of the HTTP subsystem
we need to make MemcachedNode generic. The MemcachedNode will take
on the type of message that is sent by Spymemcached. For our current
purposes this type will either be an Operation or an HttpRequest.
