DESCRIPTION

Changed delay for selector in MemcachedConnection to 10ms

Previously we would wait forever to process data and this was ok
since we just had a MemcachedConnection. In the future we will have
a CouchDBConnection and blocking on the MemcachedConnection forever
will cause data not to be read off of the CouchbaseConnection when
no data is ready on the MemcachedConnection.

In the future I would like to have the blocking done higher up
if possible so that if there is no data ready on the CouchDBConnection
or on the MemcachedConnection we will be able to block.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm sorry, but I think I either need to understand the context a little better or need to see this one in context.  

View access will necessarily be two steps and I think both HTTP and a connection to each node have their own thread managing IO, so I'm fuzzy on why changes to the MemcachedConnection are required.  

It might be that this makes sense, I'm just missing something at the moment.
