Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm not sure this needs to be exposed, though I don't see much harm in it.  The only concern is that if it's there, it may get used.

The REST interface will soon define the URIs to be used for a given bucket when accessing Couch API, so it won't be necessary for anything outside the config to know the bucket name.

I can't see where this one is going at the moment, but maybe you can fill me in.
