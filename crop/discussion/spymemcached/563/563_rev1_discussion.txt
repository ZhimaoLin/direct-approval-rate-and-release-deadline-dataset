Patch Set 1: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think this is pretty good, but it needs a little bit of documentation work (and I'd like a better commit message -- this doesn't show how awesome it is).

I'll update fairly soon (unless Matt jumps on it).

Do note that it's missing a Change-Id, so an amend will need to include this at the bottom of the commit message:

    Change-Id: I3bac849cee69fd6b57b20139832193b97975f6f6
