Patch Set 2: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think this looks mostly good.  I'd really want the following though (sorry to be a pain):

1) A shorter commit summary (really needs to fit in ~70 columns as it's kind of unreadable on my screen: http://skitch.com/dlsspy/dejhk/truncated-log ).
2) A little bit better javadoc (similar -- short summary sentence then whatever other details might matter).
3) Whitespace fixes.

I know how to get the editors automatically dealing with #3, but the rest need humans.

I'm happy to make all these changes myself if you'd like.

I'd also like a test, but I can write those, too.

Line:20, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/BulkFuture.java -> I'd like to get this updated a bit more as well.

Patch Set 2:

I just looked at gitref's commit docs:  http://gitref.org/basic/#commit

Looks like the recommendation there is 50 character summaries.
