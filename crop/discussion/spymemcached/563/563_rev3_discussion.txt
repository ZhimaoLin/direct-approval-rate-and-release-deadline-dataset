Patch Set 3: No score; No score

Looks good overall, just some minor tweaks needed, better documentation on BulkFuture and trimming trailing whitespace.

Line:9, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/BulkFuture.java -> Needs better documentation on the class.

Line:10, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/BulkFuture.java -> Remove trailing whitespace here and in other parts of the file, which git diff should show.
