DESCRIPTION

Added a command line parameter for specifying server type

The user naow has the ability to specify the server type that
they are testing against by adding the parameter 'SPYMC_SERVER_TYPE'
to the command line. The default type is memcached and there are
three valid types, memcached, membase, and couchbase. An example
of how to use the parameter is below.

buildr test SPYMC_SERVER_TYPE="membase"

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

(3 inline comments)

Since it's test, I'm good with most of this but it seems like we still need to refine this a bit more.  We'll try to do so with CouchbaseMock.

Line:48, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> so, the isMoxi() stays?  

The problem I was trying to solve is that the original tests assumed certain stats responses that are not part of the standard stats, and therefore moxi and membase don't implement, but should be there if memcached.

I'm good with this, but we should clean it up further later.

Line:8, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> Should there be types for the moxi'd membase/couchbase/memcached buckets?

Line:15, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> Why is this needed?  Just to keep IDE whining at bay?

Oh, and if you remove that empty ctor, please feel free to push the changes based on the existing +2.

Line:48, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> Yes for now. We could add another command line parameter make things more consistent.

Line:8, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> Moxi can be inferred by based on whether the MemcachedClient or MembaseClient is used. Eg. MemcachedClient expects to go Memcached or Moxi and MembaseClient expects to go straight to Membase.

Also. I am going to remove the couchbase type for now.

Line:15, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> I want to make sure that no one can instantiate this class.
