DESCRIPTION

Added a command line parameter for specifying server type

The user naow has the ability to specify the server type that
they are testing against by adding the parameter 'type' to
the command line. The default type is memcached and there are
three valid types, memcached, membase, and couchbase. An example
of how to use the parameter is below.
