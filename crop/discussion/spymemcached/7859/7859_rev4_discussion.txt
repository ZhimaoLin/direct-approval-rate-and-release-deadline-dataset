It doesn't look like the thought of cache buckets has really been considered?  that's one thing that needs to be editable.  There are a few other things in there too.

On the test, the style of lots of object creation in one line usually makes it really hard to make sense of stack traces or debug things.  I'd probably break that out.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Given the gravity of this change, it'll eventually need more description.

Line:6, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClientIF.java -> Interface needs a basic javadoc description

Line:17, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseConnectionFactory.java -> no doc at all?  this one is public and intended to be used, potentially, right?

Line:17, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/VBucketMemcachedClientTest.java -> kill the author javadoc while you're at it.

Line:374, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> you mean, vbucket hash?  we definitely don't ketama hash with membase buckets.

Line:430, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> For cache buckets, this needs to be settable.

Line:39, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClientTest.java -> This needs to be different.  You've copied and pasted the whole test here ,when it's really just that the initClient needs to be overridden.  The rest of the code is the same.

Patch Set 4: (6 inline comments)

I fixed all of the minor things. The more significant comments however are about thinks that I think may have been done wrong before this commit. I wrote all of this code to imitate what was written previously and really just moved around functionality. Let's discuss these comments later today.

Line:6, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClientIF.java -> Done

Line:17, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseConnectionFactory.java -> Done

Line:17, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/VBucketMemcachedClientTest.java -> Done

Line:374, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> According to the previous code that was written KetamaHash hashing, and Retry failuremode are always specified when making a connection to a Membase vBucket aware server. I can change these if they were incorrect previously.

Line:430, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> See above comment

Line:39, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClientTest.java -> Maybe I'm missing something here, but I don't see how you think this should be done.
