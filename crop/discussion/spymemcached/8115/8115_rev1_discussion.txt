Line:46, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/NodeLocator.java -> Same issue with config

Line:58, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ArrayModNodeLocator.java -> Looks like the Config variable is unused here.

Line:125, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaNodeLocator.java -> Don't need config here either

I think this is generally okay, and now I see that the one bit of sillyness was just that we weren't getting the configuration change to the other NodeLocator implementations.  

Some whitespace fixes needed, and then this will be ready to go.

Line:41, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/NodeLocator.java -> whitespace issue here.  Sorry, but this project is (for now) tab based.

Line:58, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ArrayModNodeLocator.java -> Correct, but it's part of the interface.

This is pointing more and more to the fact that config and nodes should be part of the same object.  I have a change that does this, but not in an ideal way just yet.

Line:125, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaNodeLocator.java -> Doesn't matter, it's part of the call already.  This is part of the interface.

This is a place Erlang does things slightly better.

Line:58, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ArrayModNodeLocator.java -> Ok. I think there is a better way to do this, but this is good enough for now.
