Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Hi Venkatesh,

sorry but this was not the way I intended it :D .. you can just --amend your old commit and push it through. Jasmin Rangel will see it as a new changeset on top of the old one instead a new one!

So if thats okay can you do that and then abandon this commit? I can also do it for you if its too much hassle.

Cheers
