DESCRIPTION

SPY-144: Avoid growing callstack on get* clones.

This changeset makes sure that if an operation gets cloned over
and over again (which is not the norm, but can happen in certain
failure scenarios), it will not lead to a stack overflow.

Special thanks to Kirill Safonov for pointing out the right fix.

With a comment about the import in there...

Line:25, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/OperationFactoryTestBase.java -> I'm okay with an import of * if you think it's the right thing to do, but I've been taught to be more explicit.
