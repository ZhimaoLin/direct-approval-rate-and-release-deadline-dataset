Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Can you amend this to have a shorter commit message?  This will scroll off the screen in any viewer I have (including this one).

You typically want the first line (summary) to be no more than about 65 characters (e.g. this one may not need to say much more than "Spring FactoryBean support").  The rest should be fewer than 80 characters wide if possible.

Take a look at git log to see how other changes are written.


The code looks good , though there is a trailing whitespace showing up in one of the files (you can see it in the diff viewer).

If you'd prefer, I can rewrite the message.
