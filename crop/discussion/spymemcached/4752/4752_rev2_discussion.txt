Thanks so much for the work on this Eran!

The commit message is still not quite right, but we're close.

A commit message should have a first line with a summary, skip a line, then have a description following.  It doesn't look like a line has been skipped, and that would cause confusion when looking at the log later.

If you'd like, I can just fix it.

Line:60, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/spring/MemcachedClientFactoryBean.java -> Not important for this bean, but how would this be done with different methods of setting the server list?  For instance, with membase, we take a List<URI> of nodes.
