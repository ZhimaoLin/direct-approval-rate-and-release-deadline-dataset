DESCRIPTION

Ensure nodesMap updates are safe when topology changes.

This change much more closely (perhaps too defensively)
couples the Config and the list of nodes.  It also ensures
that the Map<String, MemcachedNode> is less prone to
concurrency problems and fixes a concurrency problem which
allowed nodes to be removed when receiving a not-my-vbucket
response.

This indicates we need to make some changes to how the entire
object model and config list are handled, but just to quickly
fix a race found, tie together the config and node list when
locating the right node.

Testing for this is rather manual at the moment.
