DESCRIPTION

Remove assertions that assert a completed op isn't timed out

Matt was trying to assure we weren't erroneously marking something
timedout that had been completed. The timeout can come from either
the IO thread or the latch from the asynch call. Now that we have
synchronized methods this shouldn't happen.
