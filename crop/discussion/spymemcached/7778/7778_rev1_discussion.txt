DESCRIPTION

Added MemcachedClient constructor with boolean to start IO thread

We want to be able to start the IO thread fromt the constructors
of subclasses, but at the same time be able to call super() in
those subclasses. This new protected constructor allows the
caller to specify whether the IO thread should be started at the
end of the constructor.
