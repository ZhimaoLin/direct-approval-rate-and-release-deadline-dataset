DESCRIPTION

SPY-125: Significant performance issue large number of sets

We now add an operation to the read queue when we transistion it
into a WRITING state. This guarentees that the operation is added
to the read queue once. As a result we no longer have to check to
see if the operation has already been added to the read queue
