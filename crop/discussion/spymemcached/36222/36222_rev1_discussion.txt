DESCRIPTION

Do not cache the selectedKeys.

Motivation
----------
Caching the selected keys may cause issues if the selector is accessed by different
threads, also the loop for the keys is not using the iterator correct.

Modifications
-------------
Make it not cache the keys and also correctly make use of an iterator to loop through
the keys.

Result
------
No stale/cached selected keys and correctly using the iterator should lead to better
stability during failure cases.
