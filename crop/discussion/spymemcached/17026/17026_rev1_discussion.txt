DESCRIPTION

Check if op is null before asserting in OperationFuture

On another note, the change Matt put in that added this causes
two other test failures that I didn't have time to fix. I should
have run make test before pushing his change.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Good call.  I wish op couldn't be null and maybe we should make that change.  It's only null on flush-- I remember finding that bug some time back.
