what should we do about adding to the interface?  1.3 it is?

Line:76, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClientIF.java -> technically, this should trigger a 1.3 :(

Tbh, I'd like to treat it as a bug, even if we can't be 100% precise.. we added the sync methods for this but didnt expose the async ones which is kind of a bummer.
