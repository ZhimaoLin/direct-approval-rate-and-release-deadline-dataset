Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Huh, funny.  I didn't even notice the getters were there.  I was tired after all of that reformatting.

Also odd, my checkstyle didn't pick up on the TestConfig change there.

Patch Set 1: Verified

Yeah, that's why I was sort of confused as to why you didn't want to do it as part of the merge.
