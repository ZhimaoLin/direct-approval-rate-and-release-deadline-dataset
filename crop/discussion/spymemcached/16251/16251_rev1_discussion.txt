Going to verify this with a test we have.

Needs a minor update.

Line:3, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/OptimizedSetImpl.java -> Copyright needs update.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(1 inline comment)

Verified with my test, going to try one other test now.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> CBSE issues shouldn't be referred to in commit messages, as they're case tracking not bug tracking.  They're also not public.  This should refer to a bug determined out of the case.
