code for the operation.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Whitespace cleanup would be nice.

It'd be great to see if stats vkey could help here (or exposing time travel via memcached protocol).  Sleep in the tests makes them harder to run.

Line:65, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryClientTest.java -> Giant red marker here.

Line:70, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryClientTest.java -> Is it possible to just inspect the value with stats key or something?  I'd expect this test to add a good 10 seconds or so to the build.

Patch Set 1:

+1 on the timetravel.  that said, I'd rather just have this for now.  

I think before going through with this, the stats key/vkey should be investigated.

Patch Set 1:

Given the amount of things that I have to do over the next few weeks I think it would be good to just submit this (minus the formatting stuff Dustin pointed out) as it is.

Both time travel and stats key/vkey are good ideas, but aren't straightforward to implement at this time. I would have to parse the stats and spend time making testing this.

Unless you guys feel that this is important/high priority, I would rather put it on my list of things to do and address it in the future.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Fine with that.  Please file a bug to yourself.  I have three of those to file to myself as well.  I've given a proactive +2.
