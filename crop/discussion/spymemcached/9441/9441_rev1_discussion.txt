DESCRIPTION

SPY-40: AbstractLogger should do more level checks

The cases in which debug and info don't check the logging levels
before calling into the abstract log() end up spending time on
getting a stack trace that doesn't get used. A noticeable performance
improvement is seen  when the log levels get checked first.

I don't see that this would hurt, but it also seems unnecessary, since it's the logger implementation that may do something with the stack trace.  Shouldn't this be handled by the individual logger?  I'm pretty sure it is with real loggers.

on further thought, I am pretty sure the right answer here is don't do this at this level.  We should change it in spy's default logger, but we want logger implementations to be somewhat in control over what gets logged, not us.  We want to just send it up with the level we think makes sense.  If they do something dynamic and we're doing something dynamic, there's too much dynamicism.
