Partially reviewed, will complete review later.

Line:29, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/PersistTo.java -> shouldn't ONE be in here as well?  I'd probably do this as a constant MASTER that equals ONE.  In any event, we should make this match the .NET client.

Line:732, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Okay with the debug message here, but it's not observe specific, so you should remove that.

Line:504, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> I'd like to see this CAS being added to CASResponse type things in a separate commit that this one would depend upon.

Line:69, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/ObserveOperationImpl.java -> This is where that Enum should be used differently.  We should just be able to pass it along.

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ObserveResponse.java -> Add the Couchbase copyright header.

Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ObserveResponse.java -> There are too many values in here, and I think I'd expect to see the hex values right in here.  The comparison should be against these enums.

Line:59, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> this has already been changed in the base I think-- in any event, it shouldn't be part of this commit

Line:200, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/OperationFuture.java -> Again, great change, but belongs in an earlier commit.

Line:93, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/OperationFactory.java -> "an Observe"
