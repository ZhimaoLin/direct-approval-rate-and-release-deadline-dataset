Patch Set 2:

Hmmm.  All other Response types are in the main package or are in internal.  I'll look at the next commits, but I'm not sure I see the need for this change.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I didn't see a need for this in future commits.  I'm not really opposed to it per-se.  I do like the idea of not cluttering up the other package, but then why wouldn't we move CASResponse as well. 

Please give me some feedback on this on Monday morning if possible.  Best would be to put rationale in the commit message.  We need to make a call on this so we can move forward.
