DESCRIPTION

Tiny performance improvement.

It's OK to have the method return an interface, but use the concrete
class name in the method so it doesn't need to invoke the methods
through the interface.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

That is kind of unfortunate (been doing too much c++).  I've measured the difference before and it actually matters in some places.  Not sure how much it matters here, but it doesn't add any confusion.
