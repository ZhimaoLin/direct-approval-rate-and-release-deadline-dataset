Thanks Venkatesh!  Makes sense to me.  I'd like Michael to look it over and we may want to update it with a JCBC.

I like the change, can you please fix the formatting issues pointed out?

If you don't have the time I can do that as well.
Thanks,
Michael

Line:73, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthThreadMonitor.java -> also, we're using 2-space indentation (not tabs) if you could fix that it would be great.

Max line length is 80 :)
