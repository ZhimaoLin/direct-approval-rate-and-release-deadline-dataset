DESCRIPTION

Changed IO thread from MemcachedClient to MemcachedConnection

This change will allow us to have multiple IO thread running within
a client. This is paricularly important for being able to have
a CouchbaseClient since we will need a connection to memcached and
a connection to CouchDB.

Line:36, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/spring/MemcachedClientFactoryBeanTest.java -> Why is this being removed?  It's misspelled, but it's correct already, right?

This also begs, do we need a spring factory bean for the MembaseClient and CouchbaseClient?

Line:38, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/TapConnectionProvider.java -> didn't I just see this renamed to mconn somewhere else?  Maybe that's unrelated here.

Line:36, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/spring/MemcachedClientFactoryBeanTest.java -> We moved the thread from MemcachedClient to MembaseClient and therefore are not in the correct scope to make this function call. As a result I removed the test.

As for the spring factory bean. This makes sense. Can someone verify that we actually need this. Also needing the spring factory bean shouldn't affect the correctness of this code. The factory bean can be added in another commit.

Line:38, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/TapConnectionProvider.java -> Yes, it's unrelated. A tap connection will only make a connection with the Memcached protocol so there is no need to differentiate between connections.
