DESCRIPTION

Separate the KetamaIterator for future dynamic configuration.

Some future implementations may want to have dynamic changes to
the nodes list, so the KetamaIterator has been refactored to its
own class so it can be replaced while a client is instantiated.

Patch Set 1: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This currently breaks a test, but it should be quickly fixable I think.
