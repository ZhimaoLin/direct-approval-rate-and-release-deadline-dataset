DESCRIPTION

Separate the KetamaIterator for future dynamic configuration.

Some future implementations may want to have dynamic changes to
the nodes list, so the KetamaIterator has been refactored to its
own class so it can be replaced while a client is instantiated.

Line:30, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaIterator.java -> I recognize the whitespace is not consistent on this, but a commit converting the whitespace handling to common Java formatting is coming soon.
