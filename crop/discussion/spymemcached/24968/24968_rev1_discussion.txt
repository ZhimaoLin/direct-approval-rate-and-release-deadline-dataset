Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Two things to note here:

- Don't submit null if those two values are null. Please recode to only add them to the output when set (or check safely and add "null" or something to the println output).

- More imporantly: are you sure this fixes the customer issue? The code looks to me that is a problem with the bucket/rec being null, not the ones you checked here.

- We can also think about moving it to the Couchbase layer (not spy), because the reconfigurable is only implemented there.
