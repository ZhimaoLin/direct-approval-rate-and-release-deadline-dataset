Patch Set 1:

Thanks for your contribution! The change looks good, the only thing I'd like you to do is change the commit message to the format we use:

as an example, see the last commit:
https://github.com/couchbase/spymemcached/commit/41cf86b39b0804cdb9bdf35574b7f8afbbef7102

I'v created SPY-190 for you to reference.

you can change it easily with git commit --amend, fix it and then push it again. 

Once this is done I'm happy to merge!
