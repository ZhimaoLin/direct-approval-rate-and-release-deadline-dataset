DESCRIPTION

SPY-174: Make sure MultiOperationCallback is threadsafe

First, special thanks goes xxx@xxx.xxx for reporting and fixing the issue
here: https://github.com/Noah Dean/java-memcached-client/pull/9

Motivation
----------
Certain operations like the multi get callback rely on the multi operation
callback which has a non-thread safe component to it.

Modification
------------
Make the callback atomic and thread safe.

Result
------
No race conditions with bulk get operation callbacks.
