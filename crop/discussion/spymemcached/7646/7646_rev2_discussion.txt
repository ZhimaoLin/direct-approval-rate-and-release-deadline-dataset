DESCRIPTION

Made SyncGetTest failures less sporadic

Moved the code that sets the items for this test so that it could
use a MemcachedClient that had a regular timeout. This allows us to
avoid a possible failure resulting from using the connection that
has a short timeout. Now only the get (which is surposed to fail)
uses this short timeout connection
