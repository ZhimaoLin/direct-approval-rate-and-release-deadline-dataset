Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm guessing this is to make your IDE happier since Throwable implements serializable?

I don't see any harm, but I don't see much reason either.  It's not super likely that someone is going to try to deserialize an OperationException on a build of the library created with another VM, for instance.

It just means we'll have to pay more attention now when we modify these classes.
