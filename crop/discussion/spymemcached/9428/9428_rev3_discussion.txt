Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

No unit test is too trivial.  The vast majority of bugs I've written have been in trivial code.

Also:  The unit test is the first thing I look at when reviewing code.  It's a trivial way to show what the code is expected to do.

Patch Set 3:

Oh, and in this case, I find the Ls unsightly, so I'd likely remove them at some point for looking stupid.  Good to have a test fail when that happens.  :)
