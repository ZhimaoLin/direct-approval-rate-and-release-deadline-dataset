Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Scary.  The fix looks right, but this should probably have a unit test.  When these kinds of things are encountered, it's best to add a failing test, then fix it.

This one is minor, but if there's time to add the test, that'd be good.

Patch Set 2:

There is a test attached to this bug. It felt weird to have as a unit test though.

Patch Set 2: Verified; No score

FYI, I do have a test for this and have confirmed that this is an issue, but I chose not to include it because it is so trivial (It's the test posted on this spymemcached issue page for this bug). If you would like it added anyways I will add it.

Patch Set 2:

It would be good to include a test.  I don't know why, but imagine someone changes the decodeLong() implementation, this is the kind of thing that should have tests for verification.
