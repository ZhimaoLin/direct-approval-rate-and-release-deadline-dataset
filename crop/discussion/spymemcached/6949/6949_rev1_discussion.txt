DESCRIPTION

Getl no longer removes the key from binary message.

Due to MB-3689 in Membase server we were required to provide a hack
in spymemcached that striped the key out of the body field of a
binary response message.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

need to make sure we release note this when releasing the fix.  risk is low though, as getl adoption must be very low.
