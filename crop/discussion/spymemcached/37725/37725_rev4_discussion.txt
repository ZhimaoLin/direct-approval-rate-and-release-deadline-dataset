DESCRIPTION

SPY-172: Wakeup the selector if idle.

Motivation
----------
Waking the selector up from time to time and providing implementations a chance to run certain checks helps to improve robustness in certain situations.

Modifications
-------------
The wakeup time is configurable through a system property, but is low impact even if set to a smaller value. If the added queue is empty (which means the selector has been woken up but no op has been added) a custom method is called where implementations can run custom code like idle polls.

Result
------
Better handling in idle situations.
