DESCRIPTION

Add test coverage for ResponseMessage and fix to get bytes.

This adds test coverage to the ResponseMessage.  This test was used
for finding and addressing a number of recent fixes and verifying
correct support for requesting the flags to be sent correctly in
network byte order.  These other fixes were added in recent commits.
