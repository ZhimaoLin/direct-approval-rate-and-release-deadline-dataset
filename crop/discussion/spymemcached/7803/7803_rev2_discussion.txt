Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

(2 inline comments)

Would like this to be better, but I know the issues are really deeper so approving.

Line:753, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> this use of instanceof has gotten to be a bit excessive.  I think we need to reconsider a lot of this.

for instance, in non-vbucket cases, that part of the packet is still there, it's just "reserved".  everything needs to fill it.  perhaps all binary ops should just have a getReserved?

not sure... this needs some more thought, but perhaps not today.

Line:758, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> lots of casting in here.  will probably cause an issue with some future change.
