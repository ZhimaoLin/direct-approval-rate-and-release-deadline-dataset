Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Line:376, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> There seems to be a bug here.  finishConnect() could come back false.

Line:438, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Looking at the javadoc for SocketChannel, it looks like it could throw a NotYetConnected exception. Are we guaranteed that the channel would be connected here?  Should we be more defensive?

I'm not certain we need to, but we should be sure that the qa.getChannel() is guaranteed to return a connected socket channel.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should reference a bug, not an escalation.  Also, the commit message should say what it does.

I do think this commit should be squashed into the other, but we need a much better description of what the problem was and how this commit fixes it.  I don't see any discussion of what the problem was.
