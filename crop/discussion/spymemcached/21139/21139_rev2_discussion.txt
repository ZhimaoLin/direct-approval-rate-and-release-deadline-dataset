DESCRIPTION

JCBC-070: Fix Authentication to non-default bucket

Authentication to newly connected nodes
was happening in the wrong order on the jcbc
side. Also,

The KetamaNodeLocator was not updating the Node
list that was obtained by getAll().

There were other issues in the code that have
been corrected with some defensive
programming.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

The code changes generally look good, but the integration of the manual test is pretty far off.  I wouldn't expect to have shell scripts in there and I definitely wouldn't expect it to ship a copy of the library in itself.  Those jar files shouldn't be in there.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think "on the jcbc side" really describes things well.  Why the hanging "Also,"?
