DESCRIPTION

JCBC-070: Fix Authentication to non-default bucket

Authentication to newly connected nodes
was happening in the wrong order on the jcbc
side.

The KetamaNodeLocator was not updating the Node
list that was obtained by getAll().

There were other issues in the code that have
been corrected with some defensive
programming.

Manual test for the fix is included. Following
the directions in readme.txt and executing the
scripts (or something along those lines) would
recreate the issue/fix.

The manual tests are not in tar ball format.

Patch Set 4:

I'm still -2 on this.  

Everything else in the manual test directory follows a pretty reasonable convention.  This comes with two shell scripts, and I'm doubtful either of them will even work on my system.  

The name of the directory doesn't follow the convention here

There are class files in here, that's definitely wrong.

My guidance on shipping the test with the change should have been interpreted as integrating the test into the changeset and making it work with the rest of the project.  Think of putting it in to the project, seeing it fail, then seeing the test work.
