DESCRIPTION

JCBC-070/SPY-102: Fix Authentication to non-default bucket

The KetamaNodeLocator was not updating the node list
properly.  As a result, CouchbaseClient which depends
on this project would not authenticate to the new nodes.

In the process of fixing this issue, a few other issues
have been addressed and log messages have been enhanced.

A manual test which demonstrates the issue has been
included and was donated by those who found the issue.
This will probably be moved to the appropriate project
and cleaned up in the future.

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaNodeLocator.java -> Why do you need this to be volatile ? Is is used in a multi-threaded context anywhere?
