DESCRIPTION

JCBC-070: Fix Authentication to non-default bucket

Authentication to newly connected nodes
was happening in the wrong order on the jcbc
side.

The KetamaNodeLocator was not updating the Node
list that was obtained by getAll().

There were other issues in the code that have
been corrected with some defensive
programming.

Manual test for the fix is included. Following
the directions in readme.txt and executing the
scripts (or something along those lines) would
recreate the issue/fix.

The manual tests are not in tar ball format.

Removed the class files. The shell scripts can
be run after the directions in readme.txt is
followed.

Patch Set 5: (10 inline comments)

Some of the specific concerns I'd had have been addressed, but the general concern of making this look like all of the other manual tests hasn't really been addressed at all.  I'd really like to see this much closer to the other manual tests.

For example: 
- Why have shell scripts for building?  If anything, we'd want an ant target.  I know it's porting work, but the shell scripts here don't seem very appropriate to me.
- Why does this require log4j?  The rest of the project uses the built in logger.
- Style rules still apply.  There is a lot of whitespace and commented out code around here.  I don't see any excuse for not at least cleaning this up.

Also, since this is spymemcached, it should have  SPY bug, even if the JCBC bug references it.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is on SPY, not JCBC, so if the bug was on SPY it should be moved or reference a SPY bug.

(mentioned this in an earlier review)

Line:9, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/cache/prototype/POJO.java -> And, what would I do with this comment?

Line:1, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/conf/config.properties -> I don't think this is likely correct for most attempts to run this test.

Line:6, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/conf/config.properties -> commented out because...?

Line:41, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/cache/prototype/CouchCacheConnector.java -> Random commented out code here and other places in this file.  Not even a comment with the commented out code.

Line:1, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/bin/driver2.sh -> In general, I'm still opposed to having shell scripts in here.  None of the other manual tests require it.  I don't see any reason these would either.

If we were to do anything, we'd add to the ant targets, I think.

Line:6, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/bin/driver2.sh -> We'll need to get a contribution agreement from Sabre, etc.

We can't commit arbitrary code with other people's copyright without agreement.  Especially ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

Line:51, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/bin/driver2.sh -> whitespace

Line:1, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/conf/log4j.xml -> Why is this file here?  None of the other manual tests require a particular logger, why should this one?

Line:129, src/test/manual/jcbc-070/cache/prototype/Driver.java -> Random commented out code again.
