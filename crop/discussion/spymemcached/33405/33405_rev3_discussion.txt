DESCRIPTION

SPY-153: Adding a typesafe StatusCode for OperationStatus instances.

This makes it possible to add easier checks on futures, while not
having to rely on string matching in the status message. This is
an addition, so old behavior will not be changed, its just more
convenient and can be better documented (it does not directly rely
on a server response).

Line:80, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/StatusCode.java -> Might it be better to have a generic client error to avoid the possible NPE later?

Line:97, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/StatusCode.java -> Same here.

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> aren't LOCK_ERROR and TMPFAIL different semantically?  Both could be treated the same way, but...

Line:67, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/OperationStatus.java -> Arguably someone might rely on pattern matching this, but it's not that likely.

Line:30, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/OperationImpl.java -> Attack of the IDE!
