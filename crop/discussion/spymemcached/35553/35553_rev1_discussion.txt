DESCRIPTION

SPY-162: Also respect nagle setting on reconnect.

Motivation
----------
If a server connection is reset (because it is lost or a reconnection
is triggered), the nagle setting is not re-set properly.

Modifications
-------------
During the reconnect phase, properly re-set the nagle setting so it is
respected on the new connection.

Result
------
The custom nagle setting is respected and used even across new connections.
