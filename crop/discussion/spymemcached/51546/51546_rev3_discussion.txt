DESCRIPTION

SPY-187: Expose a few more attributes of MemcachedClient

Motivation
----------
Extending MemcachedClient to access some of its protected attributes is
not always desirable as it makes harder writing mocks for unit testing.

Modifications
-------------
MemcachedClient now exposes operationTimeout,
mconn, tcService and executorService.

Result
------
One does not have to extend MemcachedClient any more to write custom
commands.
