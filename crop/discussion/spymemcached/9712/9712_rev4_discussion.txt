DESCRIPTION

Refactored tap message classes.

These needed to be more readable and were horribly coded (by me). I
started seeing issues with conversion from bytes on the wire to
variables in spy so I changed how this was done.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

Approved, predicated on the idea that we're going to make enginePrivate something better in a subsequent commit before release.  Mike and I discussed this.
