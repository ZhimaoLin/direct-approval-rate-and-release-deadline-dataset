DESCRIPTION

Issue 96: ClassPathException fix

The issue here was that we were combinding multiple types of
get operations in the same class, but each operation would
have a different Claaback type. When we would go to optimize
get operations it would optimize get, getl, gat, and gets
operations and since they have different callback types we
would throw an exception.

Each operation now has its own class.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Still reviewing, but I think the test needs to be separated out with a different author, just to make it possible to establish where the code came from later.  It should be a separate commit on top of this one.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> callback, I think you mean.
