DESCRIPTION

SPY-141: Do not assume positive CAS.

This changeset makes sure that when loading the CAS value, there
is no assumption of the actual value done on the client side.
Especially, -1 is a valid CAS and can cause issues when running
with -ea in production (since the callback is executed on the
IO thread, it can die for no reason).
