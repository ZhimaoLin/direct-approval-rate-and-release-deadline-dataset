DESCRIPTION

Changed ViewOperation,ViewsOperation to GetViewOperation, GetViewsOperation

This renaming makes more sense for what the classes really do. These
are also none user facing classes so the long name will only be an
issue.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

(1 inline comment)

I like the idea of renaming, but perhaps this isn't the best name given what "Get" usually means in Java.

Something like "ViewFetcher" makes more sense to me.

Generally speaking, methods read like verbs and classes read like nouns.  "GetViewSomething" reads like a verb.

I'll leave it up to you though.  I'm okay with these names if you think they're right.
