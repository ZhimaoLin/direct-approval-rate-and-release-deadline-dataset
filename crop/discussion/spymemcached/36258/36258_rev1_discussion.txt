DESCRIPTION

Only readd a WRITE_QUEUED operation, not clone it in addition.

Motivation
----------
When a WRITE_QUEUED operation is redistributed, it needs to be readded
but not cloned (since its still in a sendable state).

Modification
------------
Return after adding the operation again.

Result
------
The operation is readded and not cloned afterwards too.
