DESCRIPTION

SPY-170: Fix concurrency issue in StringUtils.isJSONObject()

Motivation
----------
A concurrency issue was reported in the StringUtils class, pointint towards
the pattern matching of the JSON string.

Modifications
-------------
It turned out that the matcher is not thread safe and there is a race condition
between clearing it and then maching on it. By falling back to the thread-safe
builder directly the race condition goes away.

Result
------
No concurrency issue anymore in the helper method.
