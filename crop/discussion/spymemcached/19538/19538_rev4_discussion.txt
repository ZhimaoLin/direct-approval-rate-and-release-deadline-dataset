for now.

Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Pushing this through is not ideal, but it's an improvement.

Possible responses are just not handled.  Rather than hold up this minor fix for handling of all responses, I've filed an issue to make sure we fix up all possible responses in the not too distant future.
