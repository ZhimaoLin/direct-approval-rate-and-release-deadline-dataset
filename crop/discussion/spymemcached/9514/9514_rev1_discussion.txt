DESCRIPTION

SPY-37 & SPY-38: Fixed redistribution performance issue

This issue was caused by a O(n^3) algorithm used when redistributing
operations among nodes. It turns out that one of the loops was not
neccessary because the clone operation is gaurenteed to return a
list of single key operations. Multi-key operations are never
returned as part of this list.

The fix involves removing the one of these loops. which frequently
queued duplicate operations for transmission. Since the
operations are all single key, the list returned by the call
getKeys() is gaurenteed to have only one operation.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Good to have a test, but that test doesn't check what you think it does, I think.  :)  looks like an inadvertent inclusion there.

Also, minor misspelling a couple of times in the commit message.
