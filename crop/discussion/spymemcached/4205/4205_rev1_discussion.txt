DESCRIPTION

Keep track of op creation time.

In order to avoid needing to rely on the latch which is
in a different thread, this allows us to keep track of the
creation time of the operation and check for whether or not
it has timed out via the isTimedOut() method on the operation.

Doing this correctly and with as little API change as possible
required getting the default operation timeout down to the
MemcachedNode level.  That information was not previously known
to the Operation or the node, but simply relied on a latch.

This one builds.  Maybe squash it into the previous one?

Patch Set 1:

My only comment is that with creationTime in nanos and other times in millis, for somebody not familiar with the code, it would go good to name the variable with the time units in it.  This would also reduce bugs if a time in millis is ever used with a time in nanos as it would be clear a factor of 1,000,000 needs to be included.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Shouldn't this be squashed with the previous commit? It seems to me that this patch add the missing pieces from the previous commit ;)
