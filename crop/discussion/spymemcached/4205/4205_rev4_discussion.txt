DESCRIPTION

Keep track of op creation time.

In order to avoid needing to rely on the latch which is
in a different thread, this allows us to keep track of the
creation time of the operation and check for whether or not
it has timed out via the isTimedOut() method on the operation.

Doing this correctly and with as little API change as possible
required getting the default operation timeout down to the
MemcachedNode level.  That information was not previously known
to the Operation or the node, but simply relied on a latch.

This change has been squashed into the previous.

Blair's recommendations on the variable name have been addressed there along with changes to documentation on the IllegalArgumentException.
