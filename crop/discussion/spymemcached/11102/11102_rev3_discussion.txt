DESCRIPTION

mvn-install publishes spymemcached test cases

Since we will be creating projects based on Spymemcached
we will want to be able to import the Spymemcached test
cases into those projects so we can extend and use some of
the existing test cases. This change allows us to publish
a jar of Spymemcached tests into maven.
