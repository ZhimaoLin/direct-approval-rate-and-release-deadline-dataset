DESCRIPTION

Made vbmap in MultiKey operation synchronized

There was a concurrency issue here that has to do with accessing a
two threads accessing the same set. One thread is iterating over
the set and the other is modifying the set. This modification
causes iteration to undefined and therefore java throws an error.
