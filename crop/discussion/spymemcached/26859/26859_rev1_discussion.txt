DESCRIPTION

WIP: Only connect when not already connecting.

This changeset should solve the potential issue of connecting
to a server while its still trying to connect. This may be triggered
by lots of reconfigurations going on at the same time.

It uses a thread-safe set to manage the currently connecting nodes.

Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)

I don't see a problem with this change.  I may be missing it, but I don't see how it'll make a difference.  If I trace all of this backwards, it's all called at the time of the constructor.  Maybe there's a case where this is being created during cluster outage that you're thinking of.

Line:139, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Does this need to be concurrent?  If so, then the section below should be synchronized on something.

Line:161, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> While I'm being pedantic about log messages, better to end in a "."

Correct! In spy its only called in the constructor, but with jcbc it gets called from reconfigure() - thats the codepath I had intended because the file issues show the stack trace going down reconfigure into here
