DESCRIPTION

WIP: Only connect when not already connecting.

This changeset should solve the potential issue of connecting
to a server while its still trying to connect. This may be triggered
by lots of reconfigurations going on at the same time.

It uses a thread-safe set to manage the currently connecting nodes.
