DESCRIPTION

SPY-157: Fix auth logging times.

Motivation
----------
In the previous commit which added logging, it measured nanoseconds and printed
milliseconds. This also screwed up the debug/warn metric.

Modifications
-------------
Correctly convert nanoseconds to milliseconds.

Result
------
Timings are now properly warned and formatted.
