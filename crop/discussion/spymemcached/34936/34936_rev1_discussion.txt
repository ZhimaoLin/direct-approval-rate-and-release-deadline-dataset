DESCRIPTION

SPY-157: Fix auth logging times.

Motivation
----------
In the previous commit which added logging, it measured nanoseconds and printed
milliseconds. This also screwed up the debug/warn metric.

Modifications
-------------
Correctly convert nanoseconds to milliseconds.

Result
------
Timings are now properly warned and formatted.

Line:210, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthThread.java -> When it comes to times like this, sometimes I like to put the unit in the variable name.  Not needed here, obviously, but it could help when debugging later.
