Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(4 inline comments)

The main changes look okay here, especially based on our other reviews.

There are problems with the commit message, see my comments in there.

One other change that has to happen is include the manual test in a different format.  It definitely should not be a tarball in the commit.  Please follow the pattern there in the manual tests.  any info in a readme can appear in the source code.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do not use CBSE references in commit summaries.  a CBSE is an escalation, a JCBC is a bug.  If this fixes a bug, there should be a JCBC.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> A much better commit message would describe what the problem was and what the fix was.

The fact that it's a patchset implies that it's a fix for something.  :)  Well, it could be a new feature or an improvement, but you see what I'm saying.


For example:
JCBC-NNN: Ensure authentication occurs on reconnect

Before this fix, reauthenticating would not occur becuase the stars didn't align.  Now by sprinkling some magic fairy dust over the knick-knack, stars align and auth is always successful.


Obviously a fake message, but see the approach??

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This shouldn't be a tarball, and certainly shouldn't be named cbse-218.tar.

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaNodeLocator.java -> why dropping final?
