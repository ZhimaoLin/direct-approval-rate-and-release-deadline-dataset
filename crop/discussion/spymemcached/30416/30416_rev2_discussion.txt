DESCRIPTION

This changeset refactors the MemcachedConnection class.

It also breaks out certain large blocks into their own methods
to make it better readable and easier for the JIT to inline
the code.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

Let's rename later because I fear this would break something in the CouchbaseConnection.
