It also breaks out certain large blocks into their own methods
to make it better readable and easier for the JIT to inline
the code.

I'll +2 this, but I think it would be better if you change addOperation to enqueueOperation.  Or offerOperation to be more like the Queue interface.

Line:882, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> While we're refactoring, I think this should be renamed enqueueOperation.  We did so on the CouchbaseClient side, but haven't done that here yet.

In memcached "addOperation" could mean something else.

Line:190, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Would be better to explain what this is in a bit more detail

Line:205, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> "after finish_ing_ connecting"

Line:552, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> usually I don't think you need a "final" modifier for such a  short method.
