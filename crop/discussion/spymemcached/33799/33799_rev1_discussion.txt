DESCRIPTION

Add the CAS to the callback for ReplicaGetOperation.

In order to be more flexible when analyzing the response of a
ReplicaGet request, the response now also has the flexibility
to look at the returned CAS value. This can be utilized either
as a regular "get" or as a more rich "gets" response.
