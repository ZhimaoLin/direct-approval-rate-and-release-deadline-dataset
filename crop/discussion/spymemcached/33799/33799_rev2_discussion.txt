DESCRIPTION

Add support for replica get with CAS (ReplicaGets).

This changeset adds the underlying operations and clone-logic for
replica get operations including the underlying CAS value.
This can be utilized by the upper layers to provide responses that
not only include the raw value from a replica, but also their
corresponding CAS value.
