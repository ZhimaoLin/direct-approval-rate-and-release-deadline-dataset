DESCRIPTION

Add support for replica get with CAS (ReplicaGets).

This changeset adds the underlying operations and clone-logic for
replica get operations including the underlying CAS value.
This can be utilized by the upper layers to provide responses that
not only include the raw value from a replica, but also their
corresponding CAS value.

Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/AsciiOperationFactory.java -> I think your IDE did this again.

Line:33, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/ReplicaGetsOperationImpl.java -> In the code, this is:
#define CMD_GET_REPLICA 0x83

Might be better to have the word replica in there somewhere.
