Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

There's one trivial test missing.  Shouldn't there be a test for the StringUtils join?  I know it's a trivial function, but better to get in the habit of writing the code like you'd use it, see the test fail, write the code, see the test succeed and continue with confidence.

Patch Set 1: Verified

I'm not going to add it just because join(2) gets called from the other tests so adding a specific test will not increase code coverage.
