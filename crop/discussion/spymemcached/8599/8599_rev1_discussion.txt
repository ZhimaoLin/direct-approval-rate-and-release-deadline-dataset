DESCRIPTION

SPY-8: Added a limit on how many gets can be optimized

We have a limit on the amount of sets that can be optimized so we
should have a limit on how many gets can be optimized as well. This
way people don't run into any issues with optimizing too many get
requests and having the client timeout as a result of the server
being too slow trying to fill all of the requests in the multi-
get.

The max number of gets that can be optimized into a single
request is 4096.

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/BinaryMemcachedNodeImpl.java -> is the instanceof needed here if all optimized operations should have a size()?  It'd be nice to get rid of this if the change here will allow us.

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/BinaryMemcachedNodeImpl.java -> We can't get rid of the instance of. The size() is checking the size of the optimized get and the instanceof is checking to make sure the next item in the queue is the correct type of operation.
