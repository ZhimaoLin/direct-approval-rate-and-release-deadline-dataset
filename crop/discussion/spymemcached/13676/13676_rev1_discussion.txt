Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This will break user code if it is pushed through as is. I'll upload a patch that's a bit more comprehensive a little bit later.

Patch Set 1:

Mike, what was your alternate approach?  We'll need to move forward with something here soon, and I think I'm actually in favor of this.  Yes, it does break existing user code, but I think we're going to end up making some changes in here anyway.

I'll find you to discuss further.

Patch Set 1:

Marty,

This change looks pretty old. Can you abandon it?

Old change, no longer needed by me.
