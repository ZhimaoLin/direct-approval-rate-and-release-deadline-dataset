DESCRIPTION

Catch RuntimeException instead.

Timeouts from the get() without a time value specified will return
simply a RuntimeException, while those from calling the get() with
a time value can receive a TimeoutException.

This also removes some debugging traces that were left in
unfortunate places which could also cause test failures.
