Patch Set 4: Verified

* Took care of Dustin's Integer conversion change
* Updated java docs to include default max timeout info
* Rejected the comment on having a guard against timeout being greater than max timeout
* Deferred changing the ClassCastException code that decides which operation was set for a future change.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Just a minor nit on the Integer thing again.  Seems a bit excessive.

Line:995, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Does this render correctly in javadoc?  (I generally don't put that much in a param doc, so I'm not quite sure how that works)

Line:158, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> Just do String.valueOf(exp).  (exp + "") does roughly this:

  new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(exp)).append("").toString()

Line:995, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> It will, but I'll move this information to the function description since I think it fits better there anyways.

Line:158, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> Sounds good.
