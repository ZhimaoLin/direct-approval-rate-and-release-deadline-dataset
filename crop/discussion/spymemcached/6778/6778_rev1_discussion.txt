I suggest a better name, such as asyncGetWithLock() or asyncGetAndLock().  When I first saw the name, I thought it was short for getLong().  We don't need to save bytes and code is read more than it is written.

Line:25, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> Since exp and hasExp are related, have them next to each other.

Line:25, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> Your quick. I'm still cleaning a few things up. I'll have this in the next patch set.
