Line:25, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> Config should be final. Also why do we need a setter function to set the config. Can't we just set it here (this.config = config). This would be more consistent with the rest of the code.

Line:59, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> New Line

Line:69, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> We don't need a setter function for config.

Line:72, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> No need to use Collection here if it's always an ArrayList, it'll be a little faster this way.

Line:271, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/OperationImpl.java -> this. isn't necessary here.

Line:39, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/BaseOperationImpl.java -> Looks like some whitespace changes  snuck in here, best to remove.
