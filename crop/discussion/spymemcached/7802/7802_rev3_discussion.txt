DESCRIPTION

Made an addOperation function private in MemcachedConnection

addOperation(MemcachedNode, Operation)

This function isn't used outside of MemcachedConnection and it is
the only one that doesn't put vbucket information into operations.
It is a helper function of the addOperation(String, Operation) call
so it doesn't need to add vbucket data but calling it from outside
the MemcachedClient scope could cause issues.
