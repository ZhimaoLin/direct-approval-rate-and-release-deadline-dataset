DESCRIPTION

SPY-193: Allow to override wakeupDelay

Motivation
----------
As part of SPY-172, a new wakeupDelay setting has been introduced,
but as part of a mistake it has never been used to actually set
the wakeup time, which is still hardcoded to 1000.

Modifications
-------------
This simple change modifies the code so it accepts the wakeupDelay
setting, still having the default at 1000 but making it possible
to override it through the system property.

Result
------
The wakeupDelay can now be configured via a system property.
