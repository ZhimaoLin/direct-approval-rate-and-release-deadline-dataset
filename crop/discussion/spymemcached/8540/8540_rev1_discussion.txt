DESCRIPTION

Made HashAlgorithm to be an interface.

This is preferable over an Enum in order to allow client hash function
customization

Also:
- uptick to junit 4.7 in build file to correspond
  .classpath file
- introduced HashAlgorithm registry in order to support
  adding of new hash
  algorithms while initializing from configuration files
- updated tests

Patch Set 1:

I'm not completely sure how I feel about this.  I haven't read the code, but it seems like it could be a good thing to do.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Generally the code looks good but I would like to see this split into 2-3 commits. I have a few minor comments about the code too but I'm on my iPad so I can't add them right now. I'll update the review on Sunday.
