DESCRIPTION

Views results will now be null when an error occurs

Previously view results were returned whether there was an error
or not, the result would just contain empty lists. The new behavior
of returning null is more consistent to the way spymemcached handles
things and it is easier for developers to detect when they have made
an error.
