DESCRIPTION

Minor performance improvement for bulk gets.

If the size of an ArrayList is known before construction, then pass
the size to the constructor.  This will either save a tiny bit of
memory or save reallocation's, depending upon the number of elements
that will be inserted into the ArrayList.

Sorry for the delay on this, I wasn't initially a reviewer and I think Dustin was waiting for me to marshal it through.
