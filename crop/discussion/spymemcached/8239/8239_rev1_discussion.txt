Line:290, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> What is this overriding?  Never caught this before, but at the moment it seems wrong.

Line:309, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> What is this overriding?

Line:414, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> whitespace funkyness here?

Line:115, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Maybe I asked this before, but I think this still needs to be reconfigurable.  What about memcached buckets?  Must they use MembaseClient?

Line:158, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Maybe there's a good argument for this being public?

Line:27, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Isn't this a MembaseClient?

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Same comment as above.

Line:104, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Need minor javadoc here.  This is probably a bug in existing MemcachedClient object, but I think this is effectively something saying this is intended for internal use.

Line:214, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Why is this overridden?  Looking at the superclass, the implementation seems the same.

Line:290, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> I'm pretty sure that there are many random issues like this that should be addressed in a large commit that fixes this type of thing. Let's have this done with the code formatting.

Line:309, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> This code is mostly copied so that is why the override is there. I removed it though.

Line:414, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilder.java -> Again copied, but I will fix it.

Line:115, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> My understanding is that you use MembaseClient for Membase server and MemcachedClient for memcached server.

Line:158, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Let's wait for someone to make that argument since it won't affect backward compatibility in the future.

Line:27, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Done

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Done

Line:104, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> Done

Line:214, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> The if statement for reconfiguring isn't in the superclass.

Line:230, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MembaseClient.java -> found another memcached here!
