DESCRIPTION

Added logging for manipulation of nodesMap in VBucketLocator.

Some situations have come up which are unexepctedly causing the
nodesMap to return a null when identifying the primary for a given
key.  We will now debug log how we build that map and look at the
insides of the nodesMap if this situation occurs.
