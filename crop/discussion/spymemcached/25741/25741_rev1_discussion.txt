DESCRIPTION

Replaced internal log implementation with slf4j

slf4j allows clients to choose the log implementations that works best for their
needs (logback, log4j, jdk14, avsl, commons-logging, etc).

Less code to mantain in spymemcached codebase :)

Attribution goes to xxx@xxx.xxx I'm only pushing on his behalf.

Nice!  I've had it on my list to do this for Jonas recently.  Thanks for picking it up.  I really want to see slf4j in here soon too.
