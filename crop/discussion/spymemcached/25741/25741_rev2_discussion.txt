DESCRIPTION

Replaced internal log implementation with slf4j

slf4j allows clients to choose the log implementations that works best for
their needs (logback, log4j, jdk14, avsl, commons-logging, etc).

Less code to mantain in spymemcached codebase :)

This was put through the Jasmin Rangel review flow by Phoenix Mendoza

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

Unfortunately, this completely removes an interface which we wouldn't normally want to do without a major release.  I think it can be done a different way to where the legacy interface is still there, slf4j is the default, etc.  We'd still end up in the same place for default usage, but wouldn't run the risk of breaking people's code when they apply a maintenance update.

Ryan: do you want to try to rework this, or shall I?

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I don't think removing an internal interface is a problem. It will break client's code only if they are using spymemcached as a log api!!

Anyway, I think is always healthy to change the minor version when we make a new release. We can update the version in a second patch, this way everybody is safe :)

Patch Set 2:

I understand where you're coming from Jonas, but we try to follow semver.org, so taking an interface away would mean we have to do a 3.0.

Also, I think it's slightly worse if we just change it, since there may be many folks who do not set their logging preferences at all.  They just have the stdout/stderr logging and we'd suddenly force a new dependency and change that behavior in a micro update.  

Don't get me wrong, in a vacuum, I'd love to just make this change.  I just don't want to break people.  I think we can fix it up and have asked Michael to look at it.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

While we liked this change, we decided that we could not change the old logging support to be completely different without a major version change, so it was integrated differently.  Please see the changelog.
