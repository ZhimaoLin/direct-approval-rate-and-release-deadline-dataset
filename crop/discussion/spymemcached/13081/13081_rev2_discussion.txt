DESCRIPTION

Created TapStream abstraction

Previously when we created a tap stream we would only send it
to a single node in the memcached cluster. This fix creates
a tap stream abstraction that aggregates the tap streams
sent to each server and treats them as a single tap stream.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Going to clean up the documentation here.

Line:165, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/TapClient.java -> I prefer not having these marked as final, as it only protects within the method.  you don't actually use them in the method (except to pass it along to someone else), but this tells me to look for something.

Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/TapStream.java -> This documentation seems incomplete.

Line:165, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/TapClient.java -> My mistake, didn't consider the inner class usage here.
