DESCRIPTION

SPY-164: Clone gets correctly.

Motivation
----------
When a gets operation is cloned, it currently gets incorrectly cloned into
a regular get operation. This can cause issues later on.

Modifications
-------------
Make sure that a gets() gets correctly cloned into a new gets().

Result
------
The cloning is now properly done, based on the operation type.

Thanks to Brad Svee xxx@xxx.xxx for the fix suggestion.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

makes me wonder if we should have a separate get from gets, but I guess that's a bit of a legacy.
