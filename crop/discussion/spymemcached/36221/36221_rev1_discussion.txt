DESCRIPTION

SPY-164: Clone gets correctly.

Motivation
----------
When a gets operation is cloned, it currently gets incorrectly cloned into
a regular get operation. This can cause issues later on.

Modifications
-------------
Make sure that a gets() gets correctly cloned into a new gets().

Result
------
The cloning is now properly done, based on the operation type.
