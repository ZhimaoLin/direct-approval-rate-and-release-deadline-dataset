DESCRIPTION

Refactored Operations to improve correctness of vbucket aware ops

Previously we had operations that implemented classes that they
should not have been implemented. For example, there were ASCII
operations that implementing the VBucketAware interface. Since
ASCII operations must go through moxi and don't contain vbucket
numbers there is no reason for them to implement this interface.

This commit also contains the addition of SingleKeyOperationImpl
and MultiKeyOperationImpl which subclass OperationImpl and are
superclasses to binary operations that contain one or more keys
correspondingly. This abstraction allows these type of operations
to deal with vBucket awareness and the amount of keys the operation
contains in different ways

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

(4 inline comments)

The setVbucket() issue is the main one that needs to be fixed, or there's something you're doing there that I don't quite understand.

I think if it's error handling, either logging or throwing an exception when the key doesn't match is the right thing to do.

Line:709, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> this was void and now returns a boolean, but the boolean isn't handled here.  It looks like you were prepping for some error handling, but aren't actually doing the error handling?

Line:6, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/VBucketAware.java -> Please add least a line or two of javadoc to say what this is about.

Line:11, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/MultiKeyOperationImpl.java -> Needs at least a line or two of javadoc to explain what this class is about.

Line:11, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/SingleKeyOperationImpl.java -> This needs some basic javadoc to explain what the class is about.
