Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I'm not certain we need the checkState() method there and this moves it to (I think, I should look) a place it'd be called and possibly throw an exception from much more often.  Will look further.

Line:644, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> I'm not sure why this is here.  It would seem that if this is needed, there's otherwise a race in this method.

I see it came in from the refactoring.  Just not sure why it's needed.

Line:1616, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> prefer this code style anyway, so nice change here
