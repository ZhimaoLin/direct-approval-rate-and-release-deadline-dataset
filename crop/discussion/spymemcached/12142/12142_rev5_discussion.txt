not needed to make a change with the finals here, please self verify

Line:636, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> finals aren't really needed here.  it only protects it during this method, and I can visually see it won't be mutated in this method.

I used to make this mistake a lot until recently.  One of our reviewers pointed out my sillyness.
