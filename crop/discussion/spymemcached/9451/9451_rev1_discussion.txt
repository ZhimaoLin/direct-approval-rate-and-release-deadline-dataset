DESCRIPTION

Made cmd variable a byte for binary operations

This variable should have never been an int since it is defined in
the protocol as a byte. The reason for the change is that when we
have opcode that is greater have 127 the value of a byte and an int
are different (Ex. int = 128 byte = -127). This was causing an
assertion to fail, in this case for the getl command (0x94).

Line:52, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/MultiGetOperationImpl.java -> I'm not sure I understand what this is doing.  It's calling the superclass with 0x08, but then later we just override it in this class  I guess it's roughly the same change (converting cmd to a byte), but I don't even know why we're intializing this stuff.

Not going to block this commit based on this though.

Line:35, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/FlushOperationImpl.java -> I know the delay is silly anyway, but this would seem like something else would need to change and it's not really related to the change of the command type to byte.  

Looking further, nothing calls this, even though it's public and in a non-public class.  I'm pretty sure this whole ctor should just go away.

In any event, there'd either need to be a change to MemcachedClient, and that should come in a different changeset.

I don't think this could have compiled.

Why was this given a -2? This review might have exposed other issues, but I certainly didn't break anything. If there are other issues that should be fixed they need to go into a different commit anyways.

Line:52, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/MultiGetOperationImpl.java -> Not sure what your getting at here.

Line:35, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/FlushOperationImpl.java -> It compiled for me. If you want the constructor removed I can do it in another commit.
