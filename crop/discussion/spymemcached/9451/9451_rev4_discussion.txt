DESCRIPTION

Made cmd variable a byte for binary operations.

This variable should have never been an int since it is defined in
the protocol as a byte. The reason for the change is that when we
have opcode that is greater have 127 the value of a byte and an int
are different (Ex. int = 128 byte = -127). This was causing an
assertion to fail, in this case for the getl command (0x94).

Patch Set 4: (2 inline comments)

So close, but two inconsistencies.  One is my fault for not explicitly tagging it an issue earlier.

Line:34, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/GetlOperationImpl.java -> why the cast here?

Line:61, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/OptimizedSetImpl.java -> slightly inconsistent here, right?  I'd not mentioned this with the other call to the superclass ctor I'd mentioned earlier.
