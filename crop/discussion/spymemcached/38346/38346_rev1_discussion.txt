DESCRIPTION

Updated DefaultLogger to only System.err messages of WARN or higher level.

The comments indicated it should not log INFO messages, but it
currently does and it causes a lot of errors to be generated for
normal behavior.

Do you think we can get this in a bugfix release? If one has been using spy/jcbc for a while this might come as a surprise? On the other hand though someone using the default logger might not be putting much attention on it anyway

If it's a defect as it sounds to be based on the comment in there, then yes we can put it in a bug fix release, sure.
