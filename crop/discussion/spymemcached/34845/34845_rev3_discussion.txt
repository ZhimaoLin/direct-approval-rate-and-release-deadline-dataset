DESCRIPTION

Add development pom.xml

Motivation
----------
While ivy/ant works for years now, it is a little too hard to get
started when contributing simple patches with IDE setup. Since most
IDEs have good maven support, adding a pom.xml to get up and running
quickly makes it easier to contribute and develop.

Modification
------------
Add a pom.xml which is inteded to get up and running quickly. It is not
designed to do release management, which still happens through the
ant/ivy pipeline.

Result
------
Contributors and developers can import the project more easily and
contribute patches.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

(2 comments)

Line:17, pom.xml -> shouldn't this be rebuilt based on the tag?  or are you avoiding that for windows reasons?  if so, I might suggest something like 2.999.999 so it doesn't accidentally look like a release.

Line:42, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/ResponseMessageBaseCase.java -> Unrelated to this change.

Line:17, pom.xml -> good idea, I'll fix that!

Line:42, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/ResponseMessageBaseCase.java -> no, unfortunately its not :/

without this change, when you run tests in intellij from the maven files, things fail because thats a base test class and it messes up the tests
