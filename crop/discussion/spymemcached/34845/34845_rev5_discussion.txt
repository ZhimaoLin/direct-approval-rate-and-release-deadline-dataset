DESCRIPTION

Add development pom.xml

Motivation
----------
While ivy/ant works for years now, it is a little too hard to get
started when contributing simple patches with IDE setup. Since most
IDEs have good maven support, adding a pom.xml to get up and running
quickly makes it easier to contribute and develop.

Modification
------------
Add a pom.xml which is inteded to get up and running quickly. It is not
designed to do release management, which still happens through the
ant/ivy pipeline.

Note that the test case fix is by intention, because otherwise the
unit tests get messed up when ran through IntelliJ with the maven
file imported.

Result
------
Contributors and developers can import the project more easily and
contribute patches.

Line:17, pom.xml -> sorry to be nitpicky, but it'd be good to add a -SNAPSHOT on the back of that so maven won't be sticky about it.
