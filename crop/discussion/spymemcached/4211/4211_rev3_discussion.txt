DESCRIPTION

Fixes to testSyncGetTimeouts.

Previous to enforcing the timeouts at an operation level, this test
would pass.  In fact, Dustin said the test had never failed before.

However, it turns out that the really short default timeouts would
be too short and not waiting a bit after encountering a timeout would
still see timeouts.
