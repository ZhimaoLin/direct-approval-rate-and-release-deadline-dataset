DESCRIPTION

Create an ErrorCode class for error codes

This allows us to use error codes in other places than just
operations. This class defines all of the Memcached error codes
as well as two client specific codes (timed out and canceled). The
reason for client specific error codes is that is gives the user
something definitive to test against when error cases happen.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

Very close.  Typo in the javadoc comment.

Also, were you planning to change the error code to short to get rid of that cast?

Line:111, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/ErrorCode.java -> Typo.  Should be "unknown"
