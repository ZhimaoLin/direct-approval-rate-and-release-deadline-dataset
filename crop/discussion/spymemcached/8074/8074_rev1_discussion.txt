Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Would like to get Chiyoung's take here, since I'm missing context on what this is fixing.  No bug number specified, no test included.

Patch Set 1: Verified

The issue here was that they weren't being added to the message (which is very wrong). This was ok when we were doing backfill before because no message will start backfill. The tap dump test in the commit after this will not work without this fix so that is the test.
