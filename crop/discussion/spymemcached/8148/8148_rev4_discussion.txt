Patch Set 4: Do not submit

I really don't like this very long commit summary.  It looks like three changes, but it's not going to be visible in any viewer.

Please keep the summary below 70 lines.  If you did three things, please send three commits.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I missed that. There aren' three things here. Vitaly, you don't need to add new comments for things you removed when you do a rebase. The commit message should just read "Memcache topology reconfiguration tests were implemented"
