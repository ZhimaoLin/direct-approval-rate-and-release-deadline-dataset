Vitaly,

This is going to go into the 2.8 release and this code is quite behind. Please rebase it over the latest code. If you have any issues let me know.

Line:58, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> This function throws Exception so you don't need try-catches for Thread.sleep(). As a matter of fact you shouldn't have any try catches in your tests unless you are specifically testing that an Exception should be caught.

Line:69, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> No try-catch needed.

Line:83, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> No try-catch needed. Fix others below too.

-------------------------------------
