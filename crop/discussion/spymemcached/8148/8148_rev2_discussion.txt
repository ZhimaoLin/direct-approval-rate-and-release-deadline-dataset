Line:48, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Spy has it's own logging system so you should never be using other loggers.

Line:52, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Since you are throwing Exception here you do not need to have try-catches in any of these functions unless you are expecting an error to be thrown by the test.

Line:63, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Print logging messages to standard error.

Line:77, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> This looks incorrect. The username and password here should be the bucket name and the bucket password.

Line:102, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Indentation error

Line:103, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> I think with this assert statement should look like this:

assertEquals(OBJ_KEY, memcachedClient.get(OBJ_KEY)) : "Fail during getting data with primary non active node";

Then you can remove all of these try-catches

Line:111, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> You probably want to call flush here to remove any objects from Couchbase you added during the test.

Line:120, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Formatting error.

Line:152, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> There is a fix in Jasmin Rangel that fixes an issue with the base64 encoder and I believe it has to do with stripping off the \n\l. Please make sure this code works correctly with this change.

Line:153, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Have

org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64

as an import above.

Line:187, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AbstractMultiNodeFailure.java -> Print to standard error.
