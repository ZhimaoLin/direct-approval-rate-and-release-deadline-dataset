DESCRIPTION

SPY-106: Allow GetAndTouchOperation to be cloned.

This fixes an issue where GAT called during rebalance, causing it
to be cloned potentially, fails the IO threads since its not
supported in there properly.

I'm pretty sure that we removed get and touch from the ascii protocol in Couchbase. It might be good to add a test to verify that.

Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/GetAndTouchOperationImpl.java -> I think it might be better to just make exp in BaseGetOpImpl protected so that we don't have 2 copies of this value.

jeah but its in the ascii factory in general, note that I put the test in the binary factory because it will throw an unsupported ex if you want to create one on ascii.
