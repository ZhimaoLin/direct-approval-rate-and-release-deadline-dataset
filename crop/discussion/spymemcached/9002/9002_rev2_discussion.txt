Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)



Line:227, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> out of curiosity, you have include_docs false below, but it's equally valid here since we're going back in over memcached protocol, right?  Why wouldn't we use it here?

Line:26, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> namespacing wise, isn't this NoDocsOperations  (with an s?).  I'm not sure it needs to be namespaced this deep anyway.

Line:153, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/couch/CouchbaseClientTest.java -> definitely cleaner looking.  I like it.

Line:227, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> It's actually false by default and there is no way to set it in the Query class (So technically it's redundant below.). Let's leave this as is for now since in a future commit I remove the two lines of code above this comment anyways.

Line:26, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CouchbaseClient.java -> I think the way this is named is consistent with the project. For example in the memcached protocol we have an Operation class, not an Operations class. I am open for renaming of any of my new classes, but I think it should happen in a future commit.

Line:153, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/couch/CouchbaseClientTest.java -> And it gets better after a few more commits.
