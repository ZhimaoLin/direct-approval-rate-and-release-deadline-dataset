DESCRIPTION

Revert ErrorCode and OperationStatus changes.

This is a squashed revert of two separate commits. After
disabling optimization, I still found failing tests. I had
thought it was related at first, but after doing a bisect
it clearly identified the "Create an ErrorCode class" as
the culprit. In combination with the OperationState
correctly being volatile, it would regularly fail in the
midst of bulk operations.

This commit reverts:
"OperationStatus now has an error code"
 commit cdc26cdfaeecc63714c1edcf297d6ffc2c9b8554 and
"Create an ErrorCode class for error codes"
 commit 82ad6cb4629a2c98fdebc55ad10f058cd2767ff9.

Patch Set 1:

That'd be great!  I spent just a couple minutes looking into it, as I need to get the best of what we have together for a 2.8.2 release.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

A better change is to leave this in place and simply revert the commit that added the assert along with disabling optimization.  That assert seems to be correct, but it is a change and there are indications that the problem lives elsewhere.

Patch Set 1: Restored

Found this actually is needed, in more than one environment.

During testing, Rags had exactly the same issue I did, and we had him try this revert.  That fixed the issue.  We'll need more debugging, but it's best to take this out for now.  Note, this was still an issue, even with the disabling of optimization and the removal of the assert in "Disable optimization by default, remove assert. SPY-88."
