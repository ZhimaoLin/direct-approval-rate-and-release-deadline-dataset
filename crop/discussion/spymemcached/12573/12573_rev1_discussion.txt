Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(8 inline comments)

Thanks for trying to be thorough, but some of these comments will just be in the way when read in the future.  They tell me quite a bit about what you've done in this commit, but if I were to look at it a year from now it could be confusing. 

I'd say go ahead and remove those.

Line:25, ivy/spymemcached.xml -> unnecessary comment

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not really "More changes" is it?

Line:25, ivy/spymemcached-test.xml -> same comment

Line:78, build.xml -> You really don't need this comment, but the comment should perhaps be in the commit message.

Line:448, build.xml -> Again, don't think you need this comment.  It makes sense today (when being committed), but in the future this comment pretty much states the obvious.  These property setting statements set properties.

Line:45, ivy/ivysettings.xml -> We might want to consider something other than "repo", since it's so generic.  Maybe "mpub-stage" which means staging for Maven publishing?

Line:23, ivy.xml -> don't really need this comment

Line:25, ivy.xml -> don't really need this comment either.  The code shows it, and a diff would show that this change set would add revision.
