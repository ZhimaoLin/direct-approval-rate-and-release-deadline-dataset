(4 inline comments)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be good to add a comment in this commit message telling people where these changes came from.  Reference the blog we grabbed 'em from.

Line:46, ivy.xml -> I'd kill these extraneous comments.  They make sense in draconianoverlord's tutorial, but not here.

Line:51, ivy.xml -> same

Line:57, ivy.xml -> same
