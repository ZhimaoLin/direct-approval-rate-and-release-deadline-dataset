DESCRIPTION

Fix concurrent access to operations objects, especially near timeouts.

We discovered that having one thread call get() on futures with a
timeout much shorter than the timeout built into the client could
(after a while) reliably kill off the IO thread with a
NullPointerException. After restarting with assertions enabled, we
found many other ways to make the IO thread die relating mostly to
operations that were canceled or timed out in one thread while they
were being used in another thread.

The solution to this is to make "timing out" an operation something
similar to "cancel" - that is, not a state of the operation's state
machine, but just a flag. Then, since this flag (as with the cancelled
flag) can be read and set from multiple threads, synchronize the
methods that do that.

Ideally, transitionState and getState would never be called outside
the IO thread; however, since at least getState is currently, both
getState and transitionState should then also be synchronized.

With these changes, we don't end up killing off the IO thread anymore.
