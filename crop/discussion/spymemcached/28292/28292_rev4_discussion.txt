DESCRIPTION

JCBC-346: Supporting CRAM-MD5 as a SASL mechanism.

This changeset implements support for CRAM-MD5 as SASL mechanism,
by sending a "list sasl mechs" first. Depending on the response,
either CRAM-MD5 or PLAIN will be used.

Regular memcached servers wil make use of PLAIN as before, but
systems that support it (like couchbase) will use the more secure
variant.
