DESCRIPTION

SPY-125: Significant performance issue largse number of sets

We now add an operation to the read queue when we transistion it
into a WRITING state. This gaurantees that the operation is added
to the read queue once. As a result we no longer have to check to
see if the operation has already been added to the read queue

It'd be nice to fix the typo in the commit summary, but it's not required.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo there.  "largse"

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> guarantees
