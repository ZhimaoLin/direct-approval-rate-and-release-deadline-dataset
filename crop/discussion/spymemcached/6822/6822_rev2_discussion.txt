Line:66, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketCacheNodeLocatorTest.java -> Is this test commented out because it is wrong or because it showed something was broken and you forgot to uncomment it?

Line:27, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> Seems some code is missing from here that is really easy to add.

Line:47, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> Pretty sure need this function for sync.

Line:66, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketCacheNodeLocatorTest.java -> it was copied over from tests for vbucket based membase buckets.  It was also broken there (which I fixed).

There are other things that test this already, since it's not a new node locator.  It's just configuring existing nodelocators.

Line:27, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> This is for the cache config type, which has no concept of replicas, vbuckets, etc.  The refactoring needed would remove this from the config interface and maybe add a new interface.

Cache bucket types were hastily added in the server's REST interface, and it shows.

Line:47, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> Maybe, but sync will fail with a cache bucket anyway.  :)

Line:66, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketCacheNodeLocatorTest.java -> Can we remove this code then?

Line:27, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> This makes sense. Can we have better error messages in the exception then?

Line:47, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/CacheConfig.java -> Done
