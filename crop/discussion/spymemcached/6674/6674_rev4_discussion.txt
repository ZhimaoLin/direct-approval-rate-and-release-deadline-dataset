Line:28, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketUpdateResponseHandler.java -> Better to use StringBuilder if you don't have to worry about multiple threads since StringBuilfer isn't synchronized, unlike StringBuffer.

Line:19, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitorPipelineFactory.java -> No need for final here.

will address other code comments in a moment

Line:22, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitor.java -> Done

Line:95, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitor.java -> The logging here is kind of a problem, since spy's logger requires everything to extend SpyObject, and this is using java.util.Observable.  I'd love to fix it now, but I think for expediency I'll leave it as a bug to be addressed in the future.

Both will go somewhere reasonable if a system is configured properly.

Line:28, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketUpdateResponseHandler.java -> Same logger problem.  Deferring for now.  These are developer time logs, generally speaking.
