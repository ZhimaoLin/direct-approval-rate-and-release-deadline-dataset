Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, approved

Could need some cleanup, but let's do that as part of the overhaul of spy...

Line:94, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitor.java -> Why not have a static final logger = Logger.getLogger(BucketMonitor.class.getName()) and then remove the logFiner and just use log.finer(), log.info etc?

Line:167, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitor.java -> Why not use String.substring(beginindex, endindex) ?

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I can see why it was done this way, but I do think it's best to use the same logging framework so log4j users don't get confused when only half the things are logged.

Line:94, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitor.java -> I don't much like that convention.  Most of the spymemcached code has a lazily initialized default logger and you just do

getLogger().warn("whatever");

This extends java.util.Observable, though.  Apparently that predated "everything is an interface" java and java just generally prevents you from having any kind of mixin.

Patch Set 5:

This also doesn't compile for me in eclipse.  I think it'd be good to update .classpath when dependencies change (or we should remove it, I like it, though).

Patch Set 5:

well, .classpath was not really known to me, being hidden and all.  I'll look out for changes to it when adding more deps, but I'd rather not add more deps.

Line:167, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/BucketMonitor.java -> because it's removed later?  :)
