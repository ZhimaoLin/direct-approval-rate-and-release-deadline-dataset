Line:28, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthThreadMonitor.java -> not needed

Line:102, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/auth/AuthThreadMonitor.java -> this should not be public.

make it package private, this should be enough for testing in the same package.

Also, your comment is somewhat redundant (everyone knows its a getter). When you make it package private just add a note what it is for.
