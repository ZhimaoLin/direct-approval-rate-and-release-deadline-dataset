DESCRIPTION

Enhanced auth logging on sasl failure.

Motivation:
-----------
In case of long-taking auth roundtrips, it could be the case - for one reason or another - that a empty sasl list gets returned or the auth thread gets interrupted, leading to the same effect. This needs to be better debugable from the logs.

Modifications:
--------------
Better logging has been added for auth failure scenarios, and also the sasl mechs response has been refactored a bit so that the timing is also reported in case of an error.

Result:
-------
Auth errors are now easier to debug from the logs.
