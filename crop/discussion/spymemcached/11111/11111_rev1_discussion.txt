Line:110, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/StoreOperationImpl.java -> Slightly weird style here.  I had to wNathalie Landry through this a bit to be sure I understood it.  

in L108 you get the callback and cast it.  

In L109, you call it with the key and the cas.  Since we've just stored something, shouldn't we be storing the new CAS?  That's what we'll have to go back later with on the observe command

In L110, you again call the getCallback() to set it OK.  Is it always okay by this time?  Why not use the local gcb variable from L108?  That makes it kind of confusing to read.

Patch Set 1:

Shouldn't this include a test that demonstrates the CAS is different after the result?
