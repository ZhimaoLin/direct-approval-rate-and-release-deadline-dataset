DESCRIPTION

SPY-171: More robust shutdown handling characteristics.

Motivation
----------
It has been reported several times that the IO thread kept lingering
around even after a shutdown() call.

Modifications
-------------
Since its run() method is kept alive by the "running" variable, the
code now makes sure to always set it to false, even if an exception
occurs during the connection shutdown process.

Also, a slightly misleading IOException has been removed in favor of
just silently moving on if shutdown is in progress.

Result
------
More stable and predictable shutdown behavior.

Line:392, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> might have been nice to keep debug level logging here in case some future change ends up here, but this is good.

Line:392, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> ah! the code will end up here, but we also return in other places. In fact I had a debug in here but then thought about removing it.

But if you want I can add it for sure - it won't hurt.
