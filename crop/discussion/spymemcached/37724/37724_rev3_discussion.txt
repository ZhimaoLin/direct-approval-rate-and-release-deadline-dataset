DESCRIPTION

SPY-171: More robust shutdown handling characteristics.

Motivation
----------
It has been reported several times that the IO thread kept lingering
around even after a shutdown() call.

Modifications
-------------
Since its run() method is kept alive by the "running" variable, the
code now makes sure to always set it to false, even if an exception
occurs during the connection shutdown process.

Also, a slightly misleading IOException has been removed in favor of
just silently moving on if shutdown is in progress.

Result
------
More stable and predictable shutdown behavior.
