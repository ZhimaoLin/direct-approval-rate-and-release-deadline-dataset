DESCRIPTION

Decode TAP mutation flags as host byte order.

In trying to decode the item flags from a tap mutation, it was found
that the flags are stored in the server in network byte order, but
when sent over tap it goes through htonl() conversion, making it a
double conversion.

Future versions of the server now allow for the client to specify
it would like the flags sent correctly, via a TAP flag, and the
server will set a flag to say they're being sent correctly.  With
this change, we now request things to be correct and if we don't
receive a flag saying it's correct, we swap the bytes (assuming we
are tNathalie Landrying to a 'broken' server).

In developing this change, a test was also developed but to
complete the test correctly, some other issues had to be fixed.
Thus the test isn't in this commit, but rather in it's own commit
after cleaning up the mess.
