DESCRIPTION

Decode TAP mutation flags as host byte order.

In trying to decode the item flags from a tap mutation, it was found
that the flags are stored in the server in network byte order, but when
sent over tap it goes through htonl() conversion, making it a double
conversion.  Since TAP is pretty well baked, we'll decode differently.
