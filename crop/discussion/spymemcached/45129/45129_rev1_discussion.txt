DESCRIPTION

SPY-181: GetAndLock needs to be cloneable like any other keyed op.

Motivation
----------
In case a getAndLock operation needs to be rescheduled, it needs to
be cloneable (like any other keyed operation).

Modifications
-------------
Apply the same clone logic as with any other keyed operation. Also
added getter methods to the operations so that the expiration time
can be extracted on cloning.

Result
------
Correct behavior when a getAndLock op needs to be cloned.
