Patch Set 2: Verified

I usually do, but I submitted this one right before I left so I didn't get a chance to check all of the code. It should be ok now.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

With these changes, we may need to consider yet another minor version update, unfortunately.  We're changing interfaces here which will require people to implement those as well, if they'd already done so.  That's usually for testing, but still, one expects to drop in a .minor update without any need to change code.

Looks good though.
