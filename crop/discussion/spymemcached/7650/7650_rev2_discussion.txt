DESCRIPTION

Added the ability to specify the ip address of the testing server

We now have the ability to specify the ip address of the server we
want to test against on the command line. If none is specified then
the tests will run against localhost. The command line parameterâ€¨to
specify the testing server is 'server' and can be used as follows

server=10.2.1.58

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(5 inline comments)

I think the commit message should show a complete example.  It looks like that can go on the left of the buildr commandline if you're using bourne shell.  is that how you're doing it?

Line:16, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryIPV6ClientTest.java -> V6

Line:5, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> IPV6 locahost is ::1 -- I'm not exactly the right thing happens when we do IPv4 address mapping in IPv6.  It might be good enough.

Line:16, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AsciiIPV6ClientTest.java -> This should be V6

Line:11, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AsciiClientTest.java -> I don't think calling the environment the commandline makes sense here, though the build system seems to blur that a bit.

Line:17, buildfile -> SERVER = ENV['server'] || '127.0.0.1'

I don't think "server" is a good environment variable name.  Maybe SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4 or similar, and then another for V6.
