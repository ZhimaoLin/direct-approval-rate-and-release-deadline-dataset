DESCRIPTION

Added the ability to specify the ip address of the testing server.

We now have the ability to specify the ip address of the server we
want to test against on the command line. If none is specified then
the tests will run against localhost. The command line parametersâ€¨to
specify the testing server are 'SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4' and
'SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V6. An example usecase is below.

buildr test SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4="10.2.1.58" SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V6=
"some_ipv6_addr"

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(6 inline comments)



Line:17, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryIPV6ClientTest.java -> Again, testing the impossible?  I may have it wrong.

Line:12, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> What the heck is going on here?  Seems worth a comment.

Line:27, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/ConfigurationParserMock.java -> Again, replacing a hostname which would resolve with a very specific IPV4, in the default case.

Line:69, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> With this change, you'd no longer call getUnresolved with a hostname in the default case.  I'm not sure this is what we want here... not sure what it's trying to do but it's a flag that something is amiss.

Line:17, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AsciiIPV6ClientTest.java -> from what I just read in TestConfig, it seems like you're testing something impossible here.

Line:61, buildfile -> Are these the only tabs in this file?

Line:17, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryIPV6ClientTest.java -> Done

Line:12, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/TestConfig.java -> Comment added. And my code was actually wrong here.

Line:17, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/AsciiIPV6ClientTest.java -> At one point this made sense to me. This is fixed now.

Line:61, buildfile -> I screwed up a rebase and these changes actually went in with the commit about adding the server type parameter. I might look weird but I'm addressing this issue in this commit.
