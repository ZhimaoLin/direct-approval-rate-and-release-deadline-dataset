DESCRIPTION

Added the ability to specify the ip address of the testing server

We now have the ability to specify the ip address of the server we
want to test against on the command line. If none is specified then
the tests will run against localhost. The command line parameters to
specify the testing server are 'SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4' and
'SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V6. An example usecase is below.

buildr test SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V4="10.2.1.58" SPYMC_TEST_SERVER_V6=
"some_ipv6_addr"
