DESCRIPTION

DefaultConnectionFactory#isDaemon() is false while ConnectionFactoryBuilder
builds a ConectionFactory that by default returns true for #isDaemon(), so
to make them consistent, modify ConnectionFactoryBuilder to have #isDaemon()
be false.

push Jasmin Rangel HEAD:refs/for/master

which seemed to pick up more than I was expecting.
