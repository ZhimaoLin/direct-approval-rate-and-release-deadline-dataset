DESCRIPTION

Rename and fix VBucketMemcachedClientTest to VBucketMembaseClientTest.

This test was causing other test failures because it didn't clean up
after itself.  When trying to determine why the test was even used
here, I realized it had not been renamed in the refactoring between
2.7 and 2.8.
