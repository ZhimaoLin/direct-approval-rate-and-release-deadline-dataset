Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There's that one little part of the pool URI thing that I think needs to get cleaned up.  It doesn't seem necessary to be mutable, but if it is, it seems incorrect since we can't guarantee when it is modified relative to usage.

Line:16, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/Pool.java -> I think this should be final, but I don't understand enough about what this is doing to make it so.

Is there any reason we can't know this information before constructing a Pool?

I do see there's a lot here.  I'm pretty confident immutability is key to correctness and general success.  I'd be happy to help get it there, but I don't quite know where it's going just yet.

Patch Set 4:

Well, now it's a complete mess.  Some of Dustin's changes have made pulling in other changes impossible.  This happened during the pair programming exercise on bringing in the jvbucket classes during which I wasn't able to really comment.

I'll bring over the next commit but put a big -2 on it, since it doesn't even compile any more.  You'll see where it's going.

I'm beginning to think I should have done this as a merge afterall.
