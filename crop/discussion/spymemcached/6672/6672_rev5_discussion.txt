:( Sorry about the mess.  I'll look at the other end and get it straightened out.

Patch Set 5:

My fault for trying to put some things up there for review without giving the whole context.  I'd hoped that some of this could be taken given that it would be cleaned up by following commits, but instead we've focused on programming best practices while I can easily point to much larger bugs.

There are still more commits that ride on top of these, and there is so much change that it's feeling like rewrite.

I could have squashed the whole thing down into one big blob then cleaned up.  Still can.  Seems like a merge would be better though.

Anyone have a spare week I can borrow?

Patch Set 5:

Oh, and I'm already straightening.  Probably best for me to acquire the lock here and others to stay away for a bit.

Patch Set 5:

Oh.  This reverted my change here.  If you want to squash, that's probably fine.

I did have some issues compiling the one that brought in netty -- needed a new repo (and corresponding "buildr eclipse" run).
