Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved

There are some minor formatting issues and use of final where it don't make any sense (at least to my knowledge).. I think we're better off getting the stuff in and fix the formatting and finalizing as separate commits later on (and perhaps some documentation....)

Patch Set 6: Fails

(1 inline comment)

I'd still like to get some minor fixes in here.  At the very least, a compile fix.

Line:92, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/ConfigurationParserJSON.java -> This doesn't compile.  Should just be create()

-------------------------------------
