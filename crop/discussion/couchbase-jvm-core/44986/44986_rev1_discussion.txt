DESCRIPTION

Correct KeyValueHandlerTests on master

Motivation
----------
Tests were failing after a modification ported from release10 to master.
This is due to the fact that on release10, JVMCBC-84 has not been ported
and thus KeyValueHandler still copy() the responseBuffer.

On master, said buffer is retain()ed, leading to a refCnt of 1 on the
response buffer.

Modifications
-------------
Fixed the assertions, content.refCnt() is expected to still be 1 since
it is the response buffer, retained in KeyValueHandler.decodeResponse.

Result
------
Unit test KeyValueHandlerTest now pass again on master (as it is passing
on release10).
