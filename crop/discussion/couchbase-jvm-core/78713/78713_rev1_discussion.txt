DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-428: Correctly map HTTP 401 on ResponseStatus.

Motivation
----------
HTTP 401 (unauthorized) has not been mapped properly on the ResponseStatus
code, which can lead to generic FAILURE responses instead of more specialized
ones.

Modifications
-------------
The ResponseStatusConverter now correctly converts 401 into an "access error",
similar to the KV conversion.

Also, a test case has been modified so it doesn't fail against Couchbase Server
5.0.

Result
------
Test case passing against Server 5.0.
