DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-324: Allow some requests (n1ql) to target specific node

Motivation:
-----------
The need has come up for some N1QL queries to be able to target specific
nodes, in order to emulate a broadcast or multicast on some operations.

Modifications:
--------------
Introduced the CouchbasePrelocatedRequest interface that can be used to
mark such requests (and has a getter for the address on which to
dispatch the request).

Only QueryLocator takes that interface into account (for now), and any
GenericQueryRequest could be targeted at a specific node that way.

Results:
--------
GenericQueryRequests can be targeted at specific nodes instead of
delegating to QueryLocator strategy.

(2 comments)

Line:42, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/query/GenericQueryRequest.java -> why not another constructor param (keep the old one for compat?) then we can make it final and if not set just null.

Line:39, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/CouchbasePrelocatedRequest.java -> Let's just use PrelocatedRequest, the others are also not prefixed? :)
