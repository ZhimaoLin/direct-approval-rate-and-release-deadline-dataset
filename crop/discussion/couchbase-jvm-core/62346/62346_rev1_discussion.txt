DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-324: Allow some requests (n1ql) to target specific node

Motivation:
-----------
The need has come up for some N1QL queries to be able to target specific
nodes, in order to emulate a broadcast or multicast on some operations.

Modifications:
--------------
Introduced the CouchbasePrelocatedRequest interface that can be used to
mark such requests (and has a getter for the Node on wich to dispatch
the request).

Only QueryLocator takes that interface into account (for now), and any
GenericQueryRequest could be targeted at a specific node that way.

Results:
--------
GenericQueryRequests can be targeted at specific nodes instead of random
ones through QueryLocator strategy.
