some notes ,but otherwise awesome progress!

Line:416, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/RequestHandler.java -> this should not be done here, but as part of loading the config? Does the server expose it through services? I think it should.. if it does not, we at least need to do it conditionally here (or in the config) based on the server versions, since as it stands here it will be done for every server version

Line:118, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/DefaultNodeInfo.java -> if you do it here, you don't need to do it somewhere else where you also added it. But note that we need to either grab it conditionally from the config OR at least check the server versions

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/service/strategies/DirectSelectionStrategy.java -> you probably want to return null here as well so the op gets rescheduled? For example it will come here if still in bootstrap and no endpoint is connected yet.

Line:50, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> dcp is not going through 11210?
