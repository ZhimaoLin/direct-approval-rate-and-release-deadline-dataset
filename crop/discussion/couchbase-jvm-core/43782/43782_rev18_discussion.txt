Line:46, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/node/locate/DCPLocator.java -> add to imports rather than prefix the class ;)

Line:52, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/service/DCPService.java -> maybe extract as a constant?

Line:651, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> dcpEnabled not sslEnabled
