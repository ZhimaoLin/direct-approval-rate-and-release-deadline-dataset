Heyo.. looks great!

some more comments:

- you have the 1.0.2 tags in there, it should be 1.1.0
- most of the classes should have docblocks for better understanding ;)
- Some requests do not have responses? Please double check if this is okay or an oversight :)

Most importantly:
- we need to have a check in the config in place to see if DCP is supported (min server version). Simon has been working on feature and version detection, we might need to converge them at some point.

Line:145, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/node/locate/KeyValueLocator.java -> unrelated change?

Line:29, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/dcp/SnapshotMarkerRequest.java -> no response for the marker?

Line:32, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/service/strategies/DirectSelectionStrategy.java -> maybe the name should reflect which one it is picking, like FirstConnectedSelectionStrategy.. what do you think?

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/service/strategies/DirectSelectionStrategy.java -> you probably want to return null here too, since then it will be rescheduled?

Line:111, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> when the content() is not passed up the stack, we need to release() it in order to avoid leaking I think.
