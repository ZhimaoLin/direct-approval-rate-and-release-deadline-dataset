DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-136: Automatically release not subscribed ByteBufs on View and Query

Motivation
----------
When View or N1Ql queries are run and then not all subjects are properly subscribed
to (which can easily happen if for example an error happens and one only listens to
rows) then the code leaks bytebuffers.

Modifications
-------------
The changeset borrows a unicast auto release subject from RxJava which handles
autoreleasing after some peroid, which is set to the maxRequestLifetime of the
environment.

Result
------
Avoid leaking even if requested but not subscribed.
