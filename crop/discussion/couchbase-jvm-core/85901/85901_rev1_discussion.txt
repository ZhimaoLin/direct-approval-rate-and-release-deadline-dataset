DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-479: Add completion methods for observable.

Motivation
----------
Right now throughout the library we are writing into the
observable from all kinds of places, but this ideally should
be centralized.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset lays the foundation for future refactoring by
first providing the encapsulation methods to either fail
or complete the underlying subject.

Result
------
Lays the groundwork for future refactoring around encapsulation.
