DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-457: Make new query parser the default.

Motivation
----------
The new generic streaming query parser is more reliable and
makes it possible to avoid one-off response parser that are
fragile.

Modifications
-------------
This one has been in the making for a while but behind a feature
flag. With the upcoming minore release its time to promote it to
active by default, but it can always be disabled as a workaround
if any bugs should surface that haven't been covered.

Result
------
The new response parser is enabled by default!
