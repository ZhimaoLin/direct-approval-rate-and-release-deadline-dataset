DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-298: Implement 0x97 to get last closed checkpoint

Motivation
----------
DCP stream continuation requires the point in history of partition. One
way is to persist it on the consumer side. But to implement "listen from
now" strategy there is should be a way to get the last sequence number.

Modification
------------
Implement handler for command 0x97 which returns sequence number for
given partition.

Result
------
It is possible to fetch sequence number for arbitrary partition, and use
it to initialize DCP stream.
