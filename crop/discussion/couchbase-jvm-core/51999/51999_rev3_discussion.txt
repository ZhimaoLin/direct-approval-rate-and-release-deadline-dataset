DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-205: Clarify MutationToken

Motivation
----------
The MutationDescriptor, while accurate, should be replaced with a
more descriptive name: MutationToken. In addition, the vbucket id
needs to be added in order to be useful for RYOW.

Modifications
-------------
Renaming of the value object to MutationToken, as well as all related
methods and accessors.

The vbucket ID has been added as a member of the value object.

Result
------
Consistent naming across SDKs, as well as the addition of the vbucket
ID to the value object.
