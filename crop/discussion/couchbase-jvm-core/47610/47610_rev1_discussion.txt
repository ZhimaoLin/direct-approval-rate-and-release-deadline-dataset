DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-157: Centralize ResponseStatus conversion

Motivation
----------
The response status is converted in many places, since
every handler needs to do this of some sort. It turns out
that the functionality itself is very redundant, so it
can easily be centralized.

Modifications
-------------
Centralize response status conversion into its own helper
class and call it from every handler.

This code also does some minor cleanup on the dcp handler,
mainly comments.

Result
------
Less code duplication on response status conversion.
