DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-448: Handle select bucket response status 0x01

Motivation
----------
The server might return with a 0x01 status on select bucket if
it is not found, and we should handle it.

Modifications
-------------
The 0x01 status code (ENOENT) is covered and a descriptive error
message is returned upstream.

Result
------
0x01 response status as error is handled on select bucket.
