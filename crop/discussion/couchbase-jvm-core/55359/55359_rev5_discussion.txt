DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-253: Allow partial initialization of DCP streams aggregator state

Motivation
----------
It is useful to listen only for some streams of the cluster (for example
when splitting load between several kafka producers).

Modification
------------
Push partition() field into stream state, and use map instead of plain
array as baking storage for aggregator.

Result
------
It is possible to initialize DCP stream aggrepator for only few partitions.
