DESCRIPTION

[chore] rename netty native lib in the shaded jar

This change modifies the pom so that Netty newly integrated epoll native
library is integrated in the shaded jar as a renamed/relocated version.

Due to the way the Shade plugin transformer works, this implies:
 - extracting the .so from the dependency itself, using the dependency
   plugin, during prepare-package.
 - using a transformer in the Shade plugin to rename that extracted lib.
 - using a filter to ensure the Shade plugin doesn't also include the
   original lib.

This is the most straightforward way we found to achieve this goal while
not being to intrusive on the IDE (eg. avoid IntelliJ picking the
unpacked .so as a resource folder).
