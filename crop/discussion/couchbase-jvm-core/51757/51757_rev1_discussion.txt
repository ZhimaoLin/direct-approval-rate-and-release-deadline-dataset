DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-203: replace loaded services Set with bitset in config.

Motivation
----------
As part of a larger effort to make the hot code path even faster,
we can make some hot methods even more performant.

Modifications
-------------
The Set which contains all the currently enabled service types
does not need to use HashSet lookups, instead it can be projected
onto a bitmap. The runtime lookup results in one logical AND which
can't be done any faster.

Result
------
Less code in the hot code path when looking up if the service
is enabled on the current configuration.
