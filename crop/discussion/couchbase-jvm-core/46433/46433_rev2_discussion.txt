DESCRIPTION

JVCBC-140: Extract buf processing utils and add tests

Motivation
----------
Some methods in QueryHandler could be more generally applied.
Furthermore they lack unit tests.

Modifications
-------------
Compiled them and added a few variants into ByteBufJsonHelper.

Added test for both ByteBufJsonHelper and ClosingPositionBufProcessor,
and refactored QueryHandler to call util methods.

Results
-------
All test pass.
