DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-240: improve readability of messages about unknown KV status

Motivation
----------
When unknown error code detected by ResponseStatusConverter, it just
outputs the number to the log. It will be much better if it can also
include some explanation and human-readable representation of the
protocol status code.

Modification
------------
Codes from the status list in protocol_binary.h wrapped into enum, with
text explanation.

Result
------
KeyValueStatus carries enough information to display it in human
readable format
