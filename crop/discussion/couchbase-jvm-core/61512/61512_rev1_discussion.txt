DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-312: use the same logical connection for all DCP nodes

Motivation
----------
DCP connection have to be opened on each node separately, but from the
SDK perspective, there is only one logical connection and stream. But
current implementation was creating logical connection for every node,
and only first connection was actually visible to the consumer.

Modification
------------
Maintain map of logical connection, and reuse it when new DCP connection
with the same name has been requested. Also dispose the connection only
when all streams from all nodes has been closed.

Result
------
No missing messages anymore
