DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-312: use the same logical connection for all DCP nodes

Motivation
----------
DCP connection have to be opened on each node separately, but from the
SDK perspective, there is only one logical connection and stream. But
current implementation was creating logical connection for every node,
and only first connection was actually visible to the consumer.

Modification
------------
Refactor DCPConnection class and remove complicated
BucketStreamAggregator to make DCP subsystem more straightforward, and
easier to maintain

Result
------
Flow control buffers are bound to the channels now, so they won't stall.
