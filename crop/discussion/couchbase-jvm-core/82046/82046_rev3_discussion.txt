DESCRIPTION

Allow to mock the ServiceFactory for Node tests.

By changing the CouchbaseNode instance to allow mocking
the ServiceFactory, the test case can be modified to pass
in a custom one which avoids going to the network at all.

This makes sure the unit tests don't actually try to open
a socket against port 0, leading to failures on jenkins.
