DESCRIPTION

Use admin properties for test authentication.

Motivation
----------
With Couchbase Server 5.0 and RBAC coming, it isn't enough to just
use bucket credentials, also users need to be in place (especially
when working with buckets without passwords!).

Modifications
-------------
Because the admin user has all credentials and is always available,
it makes sense to just authenticate with that user in order to run
the test suite completely.

Result
------
The test suite doesn't fail on the int test with invalid credentials.
