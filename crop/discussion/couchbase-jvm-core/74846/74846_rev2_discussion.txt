DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-399: Perform HELLO before AUTH

Motivation
----------
In preparation for the extended error codes the hello
negotiation should come before authentication so that
already as part of auth the server can send more
detailed error messages.

Modifications
-------------
The handler is moved in the pipeline before authentication
instead of afterwards.

Result
------
HELLO now runs before auth, not afterwards. Right now this
doesn't change anything but lays the groundwork for future
enhancements
