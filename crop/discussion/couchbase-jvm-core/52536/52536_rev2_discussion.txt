DESCRIPTION

JCBC-778: Do not try to interpret vbucket as status

Motivation
----------
DCPHandler might generate warnings about unknown status code. The reason
of these warnings is that the handler processes not only responses, but
also DCP requests, which carry vBucket ID at that offset.

Modification
------------
Do not extract message status until it really needed

Result
------
No warnings
