DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-226: Implement API to serialize DCP stream state

Motivation

Define state to serialize DCP state, and integrate it into
BucketStreamAggregatorState.

Result
------
The clients of the libraries can inject serialization code for DCP
streams.

Patch Set 1:

I initially thought that Serializer referred to java serialization and such... I wonder if that functionality would better be named Listener (with onXXX methods rather than dump) for better coherence with the names in the Java world, michael any thoughts?

out of curiosity, what was the usecase that sparked this change?
