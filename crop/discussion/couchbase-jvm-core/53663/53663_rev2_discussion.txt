DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-226: Implement API to serialize DCP stream state

Motivation
----------
To simplify DCP state serialization, the BucketStreamAggregatorState
should call user-specified hooks each time the state updated.

Modification
------------
Define state to serialize DCP state, and integrate it into
BucketStreamAggregatorState.

Result
------
The clients of the libraries can inject serialization code for DCP
streams.
