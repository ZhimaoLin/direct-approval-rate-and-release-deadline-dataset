DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-264: Handle 0x55 DCP opcode to complete stream observables

Motivation
----------
When end sequence number specified, the producer sends message with 0x55
opcode, it should used to signal onCompleted() on DCP connection if
there are no active streams.

Modification
------------
Implement StreamEndMessage to represent 0x55, and complete DCP
observable, when all streams ended.

Result
------
Graceful shutdown of DCP consumers is possible now.

I wonder about the concurrency safety of DcpConnection's streams List.
Otherwise looks good to me.
