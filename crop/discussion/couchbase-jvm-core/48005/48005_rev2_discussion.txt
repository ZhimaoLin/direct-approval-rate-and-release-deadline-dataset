DESCRIPTION

extract dumping of env parameters for JCBC-724

Motivation
----------
In the java-client, subclass of DefaultCoreEnvironment has several
specific parameters, that should also be dumped in the toString. This
change is needed in order for this subclass to use core's dumping of
parameters

Modifications
-------------
A new protected method that dumps core environment parameters into a
StringBuilder has been put in place, and toString relies on it.

Results
-------
Subclasses can now dump the full range of environment parameters in a
StringBuilder.
