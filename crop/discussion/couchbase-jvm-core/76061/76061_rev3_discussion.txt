DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-409: Resolve addresses when parsing ConnectionString

Motivation
==========
Otherwise it might be get resolved internally when it is too late.
Or netty will raise error if it will see InetSocketAddress, which
is not resolved.

Also before JDK 7+ it is not possible to get original value of the
hostname, and using getHostName() might trigger reverse-lookup if
it was initialized by raw IP address.

Modification
============
Use constructor when adding new hosts in the parser, which will
result in resolved InetSocketAddress.

Result
======
Behaviour will be more determined, and user will see any name errors
earlier.
