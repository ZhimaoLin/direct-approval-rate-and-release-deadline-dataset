DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-227: BLANK state for DCP stream is invalid

Motivation
----------
BucketStreamState.BLANK has invalid snapshotEndSequenceNumber which
might cause ERANGE errors from the server.

Modification
------------
Use correct value for snapshotEndSequenceNumber. Also implement
toString() for BucketStreamState to improve debug experience.

Result
------
Using BLANK states does not cause ERANGE errors anymore.
