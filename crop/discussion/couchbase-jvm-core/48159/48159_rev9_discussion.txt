DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-169: Make Observables cold and auto release them.

Motivation
----------
In order to prevent accidential leaks in user level code when hot
observables (our AsyncSubjects) are requested but never subscribed
(or unsubscribed before the result is consumed), the core should
make sure that they are cold and if necessary get auto-released.

Modifications
-------------
The Core has been modified to wrap the hot observables with the
proper cold&release logic. In addition a package private "sendHot"
method has been added to alow for fast reschedules in the retry
case.

Tests have been modified (some did not subscribe even if they should
have always) and extended. The previously wrapped carrier loader and
referesher have been reverted back to the old code since it would've
been duplicated now.

Result
------
Cold observables returned by the core.send method and automatically
released if subscribed but then quickly unsubscribed.
