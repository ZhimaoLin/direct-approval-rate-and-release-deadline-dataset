Line:61, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> I would allow to pass feed name and and define overridden method with default stream name

Line:68, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> Does it mean that we will call partitionSize() several times potentially?

Do you think we should also rename DCPRequest do DCPMessage or Event? the stuff that is consumed I mean

Line:61, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> yes, we also need to allow to pass in the snapshot marker to start from a specific point.

Line:68, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> no, just once, since there is only one connect response, right? or are there more?
