DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-391 Fix empty request content when rescheduling, which happens only with SSL

Motivation
----------
Netty ssl handler being the last one consumes readable bytes for
encrypting. (See https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.0/handler/src/main/
java/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslHandler.java#L836-L837)
This is a problem when rescheduling the request on NMV,
because the request content says there is nothing more to read and
document ends up as empty.

Changes
-------
Copy content of requests with contents while encoding only if ssl is enabled.

Results
-------
Content of the requests are available even when rescheduling
