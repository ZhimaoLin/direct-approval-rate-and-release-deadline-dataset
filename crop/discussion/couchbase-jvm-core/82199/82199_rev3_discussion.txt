DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-449: Sanity check delay upper and lower bounds.

Motivation
----------
The lower and upper boundaries can be easy to mess up and a user
was running into troubles because of this. We need to sanity
check on creation, making it easier to spot user errors.

Modifications
-------------
For linear and exponential delay, the upper and lower boundaries
are asserted and an exceptio is raised immediately if the lower
boundary is larger than the upper one.

Result
------
Immediate feedback on parameter misuse/switch without knowing
whats going on otherwise.
