DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-228: Implement an Event Logging Consumer

Motivation
----------
For easy access, an event logger should be in place that can be used by the user
to log events which are incoming over the event bus.

Modifications
-------------
A LoggingConsumer has been implemented which consumes the event bus and logs
according to the specified log level and in the confiugred format.

To make things easier, a utility class has been added and all events now support
a versatile toMap() function that converts the objects into simple types. This
is then utilized to convert into a JSON representation if needed.

Result
------
Easy logging of system events either as toString or through JSON.
