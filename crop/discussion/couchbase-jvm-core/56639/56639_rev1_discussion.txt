DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-262: CarrierRefresher needs to skip non-kv nodes.

Motivation
----------
In a MDS scenario, the refresher previously tried to talk
to any node in the cluster list, even if it doesn't have
a KV service enabled.

Modifications
-------------
The refresher code now checks if the node actually has the
BINARY service enabled, and only in this case it will try
to send a config request to it.

Unit tests have been updated.

Result
------
In an MDS scenario the client now doesn't try to load a
config over CCCP from a node where no KV service is
enabled.
