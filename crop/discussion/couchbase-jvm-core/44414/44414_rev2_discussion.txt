DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-86: Do not manually cancel subscription on retry.

Motivation
----------
When an operation is scheduled for retry, the subscription should
not manually be removed. This can cause NPEs since its subject to
a race condition. In addition, this code is not known to bring
an actual benefit.

Modifications
-------------
Remove the manual subscription management and instead let the
scheduler handle it as expected.

Result
------
No potential NPE and more predictable behavior
