DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-66: Also relocate shadowed libs in sourceJar

Motivation
----------
When debugging, stepping into relocated shadowed dependencies fails (for
example going into Netty sources), because the namespace has by then
been rewritten.

Modifications
-------------
Added a large Gradle task that retrieves the relocated dependencies
sources, rewrites them to replace occurrences of their base package by
the relocated one.

Add said sources to the sourceJar.

Upgraded the build.gradle to use Gradle 2.2 instead of 1.x (needed for
the retrieval of dependencies sources).

Results
-------
The source jar now also contains sources for Netty, Lmax and Jackson,
all with correctly rewritten package hierarchy.

Users can now debug into these libraries and see the full javadoc.
