DESCRIPTION

Extract PartitionInfo in its own class.

Motivation
----------
The PartitionInfo, originally part of the CouchbaseBucketConfig, needs to be extracted
out so that proper unit tests can be added. It is large enough to stand alone.

Modifications
-------------
The class has been refactored out into the CouchbasePartitionInfo and along the way, the
forward map has been optimized away (only needed to check if tainted or not). In addition
one List is stored as an array since it never changes.

Result
------
Better testability and a unnecessary Lists removed.
