DESCRIPTION

Refactor CouchbasePartitionInfo.

Motivation
----------
The PartitionInfo is better suited for an external class for testability and
reusability.

Modifications
-------------
The class has been moved out into a standalone class. Also, the forward partition
map is not exposed anymore, the tainted value is calculated directly.

Result
------
Better testability and a unnecessary List removed.
