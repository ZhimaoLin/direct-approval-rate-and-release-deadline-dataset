DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-294: Apply credentials on search requests.

Motivation
----------
FTS now expects the request to contain appropriate credentials.

Modifications
-------------
As with the other query methods, the search handler now properly adds
credentials to the http request.

Since the same code had been duplicated across the handlers, it is now
unified into a single helper method in the AbstractGenericHandler.

Result
------
FTS queries can be performed against password protected buckets.
