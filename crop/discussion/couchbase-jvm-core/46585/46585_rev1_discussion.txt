DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-145: Check for the correct flags on Observe

Motivation
----------
When debugging some Observe related issues, two flaws in the flags checking were
identified:

	- remove persistence used the wrong flag
	- mutation replication used the wrong flag

Which in turn resulted in timeout exceptions because the needed states were never
reached.

Modifications & Result
----------------------
The identifiers now use the proper enum to reach the desired states.
