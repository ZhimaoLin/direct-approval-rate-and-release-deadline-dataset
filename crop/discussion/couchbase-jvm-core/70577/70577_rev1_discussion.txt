Line:19, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/RequestCancelledException.java -> this is great, but as a convention try to stick to the first line as a sentence which acts as a summary. then add the list as below

Line:28, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/RequestCancelledException.java -> in the second paragraph it makes sense to clarify that it is retried and eventually cancelled based on the retry strategy configured.

the best effort one will retry until the maxRequestLifetime is over, the fail fast one will cancel it immediately.

Line:29, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/RequestCancelledException.java -> a final note ;-) ... in both sections you say when it can be retried, but in fact the user can't distinguish between both cases in practice when it is thrown. So maybe add a general section on retry before the two conditions.
