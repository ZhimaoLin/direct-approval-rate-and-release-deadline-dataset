Patch Set 1:

This implementation works, but it have to be cleaned up a bit

Right now my biggest concern is that I have to put channel context into DCPConnection to be able to send acknowledgment packet later. Just using send() on endpoint does not really work there, because after DCPHandler receives StreamRequestResponse, it switches into the streaming mode (somewhat like views) and all coming requests which scheduled by send() does not work with this pipeline
