DESCRIPTION

JCBC-970: DcpConnection.getCurrentState should return immediate state

Motivation
----------
Sequence number of last closed checkpoint is not suitable for the cases
where getCurrentState used. It should rather return the same values as
'high_seqno' from 'vbucket-details' STAT.

Modification
------------
Fix GetAllMutationTokensRequest(0x48) to allow to send it to specific
node in the cluster. Update implementation of getCurrentState to use
GetAllMutationTokensRequest.

Result
------
Sequence numbers returned by getCurrentState now match 'high_seqno'
from stats.
