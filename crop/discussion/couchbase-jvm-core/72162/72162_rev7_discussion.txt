DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-384 Add XATTR support

Motivation
----------
Allow extended attribute access using subdoc requests

Changes
-------
Added flag which allows access to extended attributes. Builders are
added for lookup and mutation commands in multi path commands to allow
for access flag or other attibutes to be set. For single path requests,
the abstract request class has the extra attributes. HELLO commands also
requests for extended attributes feature if available to be turned on.
Hello request change is backward compatible, server ignores the command
that are not available. Verified using unit tests in
SubdocumentExtendedAttributeAccessTest.

Results
-------
Extended attributes can be accessed by setting accessAttribute value to
true.
