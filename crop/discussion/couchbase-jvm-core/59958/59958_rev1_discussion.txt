DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-292: Allow different base for ExponentialDelay powers

Motivation:
-----------
ExponentialDelay growth is based on powers of 2. It could be interesting
to allow steeper growth by providing a different one (eg. powers of 10).

Modifications:
--------------
Added a powersOf parameter that allows to use powers of a different base
and not just powers of two. Added related Delay factory method and unit
tests.
The powersOf lowest value is 2, which uses the bitshift optimization.
Other bases use Math.pow.

Result:
-------
ExponentialDelay can have steeper growth curve by using power base that
is larger than 2.
