Patch Set 1: Verified-1

In testing, I found that it doesn't handle the case where there is only one item in the array.  It always needs more than one item.  Otherwise, it worked well.

that's great input :) simon let's add a couple more test cases, like with 1 string, 1 number and also if we don't have already with an empty results array (but I bet we have that one already)
