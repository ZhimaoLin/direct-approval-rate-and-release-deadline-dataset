DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-471: EndpointHealth needs to be resilient to null on addrs.

Motivation
----------
It is possible that when asked for EndpointHealth the endpoints
are setup but not connected yet, so the channel is still null
and as a result so are the local and remote addrs inferred.

Modifications
-------------
This is a legit situation, so the code simply needs to cope
with the possibility of being null and should properly react
with safety measures.

Result
------
The code now handles the situation outlined above. Regression
test added for good measure.
