DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-337: Subdoc Multi Lookup needs to expose CAS.

Motivation
----------
Due to an oversight the multi lookup in subdoc currently does not
carry the CAS as part of the response message, even if it is returned
from the server.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the cas value to the MultiLookupResponse and modifies
test cases to assert for it.

Result
------
The CAS can now be carried over in higher level implementations.
