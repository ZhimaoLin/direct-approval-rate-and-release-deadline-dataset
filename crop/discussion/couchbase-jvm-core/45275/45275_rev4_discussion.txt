DESCRIPTION

Properly release byte buffers (content) in integration tests.

Motivation
----------
All buffers should be properly release to not falsely report
leaking buffers.

Also the KVHandler content access for counter has been renamed for 
clarity, no behavioural change (since in 1.1 we retain() the msg content 
instead of copying it).
