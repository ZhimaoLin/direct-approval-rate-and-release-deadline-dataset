DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-105: parse dp4 responses in QueryHandler

Motivation
----------
Between DP4 and DP3, response format was modified and enriched.

Modifications
-------------
Added new parsing steps for the new possible response sections :
 - signature
 - results (instead of resultset, still an array of json objects)
 - warnings (array of error objects)

 Modified initial parsing and GenericQueryReponse to include streams of
 errors (instead of putting them in info), an observable for the status
 that can only come once all rows have been processed and for IDs (with
 a requestId and a clientContextId).

 Modified parsing of existing steps to accomodate changes:
  - resultset is now "results"
  - info section is now "metrics", with a fixed schema (named fields,
  not a generic structure)
  - errors can be multiple (same format as warnings)

 Modified test data to reflect changes in response format, modified
 and added tests.

 Single emission items are now fed into an AsyncSubject instead of the
 ReplaySubject which has more overhead.

 Note: clients (the java SDK) should be updated to take these changes
 into account:
  - ResponseStatus is not definite (there still could be execution
  errors, one has to also look at queryStatus())
  - errors (and warnings) could be multiple, and are fed into errors()
  - info() now contains a single element with named metric fields

Result
------
QueryHandler now can parse DP4 responses. Tests pass.
