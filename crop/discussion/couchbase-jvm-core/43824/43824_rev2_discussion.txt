DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-78: Upgrade RxJava to 1.0.2 GA

Motivation
----------
1.0.2 contains an important enhancement which makes sure that
scheduled actions are not interrupting themselves, which reduces
the bookkeeping that the JVM needs to do, leading to better performance
and less GC cycles.

Fore more information, see https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1913

Modifications
-------------
Updating the dependency.

Result
------
Less bookeeping in the JVM, leading to a more smooth steady state.
