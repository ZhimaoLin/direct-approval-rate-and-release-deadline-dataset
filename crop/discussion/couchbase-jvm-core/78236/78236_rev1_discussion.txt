DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-422: Adapt codebase to use the NetworkAddress.

Motivation
----------
The previous change did introduce the NetworkAddress wrapper,
this change modifies the codebase to make use of it.

Modifications
-------------
Code and tests are adapted, various interfaces changed to expose
the new signature. Note that for backwards compat on external
interfaces, the event bus message getters have not been changed.

Result
------
The code now makes use of the address wrapper and allows more
control over the reverse DNS behavior.

Line:63, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/event/system/ConfigUpdatedEvent.java -> Maybe also add another version which returns NetworkAddress to allow users slowly migrate to it?

And make this method to convert from NetworkAddress, just like NodeConnectedEvent

Line:40, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/event/system/ConfigUpdatedEvent.java -> Shouldn't it use NetworkAddress?

Line:120, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/node/CouchbaseNode.java -> Can it use NetworkAddress.ALLOW_REVERSE_DNS?

Line:21, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/AbstractBucketConfig.java -> Maybe also scan for InetAdress in imports too? This seems like unused

Line:24, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/cluster/SeedNodesRequest.java -> sun APIs?
