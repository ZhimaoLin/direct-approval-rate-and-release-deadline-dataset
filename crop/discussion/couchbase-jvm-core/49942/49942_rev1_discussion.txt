DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-187: Properly encode keys with special chars.

Motivation
----------
Keys with special characters that require more than one byte to
represent it have a different byte length than string length in
java.

In order to properly store those characters, the code needs
to take the encoded byte length rather than the originating
string length.

Modifications
-------------
The code has been modified so that the actual key length is
computed from the UTF-8 encoded byte array, rather from its
original string representation.

A test has been added to verify this assertion.

Result
------
Correct encoding of keys which require more bytes on the
wire than their java string representation characters.
