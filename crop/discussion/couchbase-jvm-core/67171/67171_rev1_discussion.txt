DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-364 - Fix query parsing of empty row & split at status

Motivation:
-----------

Modifications:
--------------
decideBetweenRawAndObjects now correctly calls sectionDone() when it
detects that there is no results (empty array) and the next token
should be looked up.

Additionally, mainly for testing purposes, the status of both
AbstractGenericHandler and QueryHandler are exposed in getters.

A test has been added for this particular failure case.

Results:
--------
Parser now succeeds on parsing response with empty results and split
at "status".
