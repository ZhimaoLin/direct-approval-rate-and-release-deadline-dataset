DESCRIPTION

Fix deadlocking environment test.

Motivation
----------
The trampoline scheduler is a poor choice if other code depends on
it since its executing on the same thread. Together with the recent
metric additions, a different scheduler is needed.

Modifications
-------------
The newThread scheduler does the job as well in this test case.

Result
------
No deadlock in the test.
