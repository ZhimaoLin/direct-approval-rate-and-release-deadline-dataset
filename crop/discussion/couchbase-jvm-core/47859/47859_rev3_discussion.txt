DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-162: Do not flush if not active.

Motivation
----------
Much like on write(), flush() needs to check if the channel is
active and only then send the flush signal.

Modifications
-------------
Check if the channel is active and only then flush. It makes no
sense to flush if the channel is not active, error handling
facilicities inside of the handler perform the necessary
cleanup tasks.

Result
------
No flushing when the channel is not active.
