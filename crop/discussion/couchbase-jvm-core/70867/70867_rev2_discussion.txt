DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-378: Support for optional IO pool per service.

Motivation
----------
In certain cases it has been found that segregating the IO
event loops for different services provides better performance
since they don't disturb each other. This is especially true
when short-lived but many KV operations interleave with longer
running N1QL or view queries.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset makes it possible to optionally plug in different
event loop groups for different services. If none are provided
the default ioPool is used as before to make sure its 100%
backwards compatible.

If a custom event loop group is passed in the hook lifecycle works
as with the general ioLoop one.

Result
------
It is now possible to configure one Environment to segregate different
services into different event loops for better performance without
having to create different environments.

thanks for the quick review, the tests pass but I want to do some more manual testing, especially with YCSB and so on it :)

Line:476, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> we trust user and allow to provide null, but why not check it here for null?

or implicitly assign NoOpShutdownHook as with ioPoolShutdownHook

Line:476, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> isn't that what I did in the line block 341 and up? if its null set up the NoOpShutdownHook?

Line:476, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> i mean if the builder.searchIoPool is not null, but this.searchIoPoolShutdownHook is null.

compare with line 310
