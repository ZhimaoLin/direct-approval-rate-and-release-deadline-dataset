DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-378: Support for optional IO pool per service.

Motivation
----------
In certain cases it has been found that segregating the IO
event loops for different services provides better performance
since they don't disturb each other. This is especially true
when short-lived but many KV operations interleave with longer
running N1QL or view queries.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset makes it possible to optionally plug in different
event loop groups for different services. If none are provided
the default ioPool is used as before to make sure its 100%
backwards compatible.

If a custom event loop group is passed in the hook lifecycle works
as with the general ioLoop one.

Result
------
It is now possible to configure one Environment to segregate different
services into different event loops for better performance without
having to create different environments.
