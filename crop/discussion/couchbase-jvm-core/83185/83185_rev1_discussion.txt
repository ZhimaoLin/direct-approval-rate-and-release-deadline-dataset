(2 comments)

Line:222, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironmentTest.java -> Want to specify a suitably large timeout here so the test job doesn't hang forever if the event is not emitted?

Line:223, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironmentTest.java -> Unless you expect some code somewhere to actually interrupt this thread, I'd just declare that the `shouldEmitEvent` test method `throws Exception`.
