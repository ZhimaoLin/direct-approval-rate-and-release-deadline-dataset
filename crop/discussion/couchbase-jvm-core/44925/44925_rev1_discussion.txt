DESCRIPTION

Fix failing unit test

Motivation
----------
We want all tests passing on any point of history

Modification
------------
The library does not expect null for the GetBucketConfigResponse
content, so throws NPE. The patch fixes the test to pass empty buffer
there.

Result
------
The tests are green again
