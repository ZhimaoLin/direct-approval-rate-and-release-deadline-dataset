DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-344: Replace deprecated Disruptor APIs.

Motivation
----------
The code uses two methods that are deprecated and require minor
code changes to move them over to the new APIs.

Modifications
-------------
The exception handler now sits on a new method and also when
creating the Disruptor now only the ThreadFactory is passed in
instead of the ExecutorService since thats not needed.

Result
------
Code is on stable disruptor API.
