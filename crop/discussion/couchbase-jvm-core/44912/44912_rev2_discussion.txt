DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-112: fix assertions & release resp buffers

Motivation
----------
The integration test has several assertions checking the wrong response
of the test, and all these tests check responses but never release them
(or rather, their content ByteBuf).

Modifications
-------------
Every response received in the various tests has its content ByteBuf
correctly and explicitely released.
Some assertions that would check the wrong response (eg. a previously
asserted UpsertResponse instead of the more recent GetResponse) have
been fixed.

Result
------
Test has been improved, and there should be less leaks false negatives.
