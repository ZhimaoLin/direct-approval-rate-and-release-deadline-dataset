DESCRIPTION

Relax test assertions for metrics.

Motivation
----------
Because the metrics tests is not deterministic since it can interleave with other tests,
the constraints on the get assertions are relaxes (random failures have been found on
the assertions while running the tests standalone and/or the full suite).
