DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-232: Always log metric events.

Motivation
----------
To actually use the metrics we collect in an "always on" fashion,
th default implementation needs to consume metrics and log them.

Modifications
-------------
The environment spins up the logger, listens on metric events and
logs them in a JSON format. The user can disable this completely
or modify the settings of the logger.

Result
------
The metrics will be logged on the default interval unless turned
off by the user explicitly.
