DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-439: Fix prepared statement dispatching with node hostname

Motivation
----------
This is a regression. When the NetworkAddress has been introduced
this codepath in the QueryLocator has not been modified and now
the equality comparison always fails between InetAddr and NetworkAddress
- thanks java for not failng to compile ;-)

Modifications
-------------
Convert to a NetworkAddress on the fly and as a result handle the
equality comparison properly, fixing the regression and allowing the
Prelocated Requests to dispatch properly.

Result
------
Regression fixed.
