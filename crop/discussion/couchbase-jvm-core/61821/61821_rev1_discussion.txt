DESCRIPTION

Fix subdoc counter test (JCBC-931, error code change)

Motivation:
-----------
Between Couchbase 4.5 DP and BETA, an error code change was implemented
for counter operations, from SUBDOC_DELTA_RANGE to VALUE_CANTINSERT.

Modification:
-------------
Fixed the integration test to assert the new error code rather than the
old one.

Result:
-------
Subdoc integration tests pass with Couchbase Server 4.5 builds after DP.
