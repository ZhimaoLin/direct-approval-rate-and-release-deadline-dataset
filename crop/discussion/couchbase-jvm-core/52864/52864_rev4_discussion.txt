Line:42, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregatorState.java -> in my opinion the set() with the list is kinda unsafe.. In this case, you may want to change it to plain BucketStreamState[], since then the array is preallocated and doesn't change in size you can safely access the partitions.

Line:91, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> can we make this private?

Line:91, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> I added it public to allow users to access failover logs which comes in StreamRequestResponse
