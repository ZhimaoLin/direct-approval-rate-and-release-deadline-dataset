DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-182: Refactoring of the KeyValueHandler

Motivation
----------
The JIT reports that the decode methods is hot but way too big to
be optimized.

Modifications
-------------
The response decoding part has been refactored and should now be
inlineable by the JIT. The refactoring only consists of splitting
up the methods.

Result
------
Inlineable code by the JIT.
