DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-469: Set dispatch hostname as early as possible.

Motivation
----------
Previously the dispatch hostname was only set one written down into
netty/after the endpoint. The problem with this approach is that if
we never end up writing down the operation and it times out on the
user side, it might be "null" even if we knew where it should've
gone in the first place.

Modifications
-------------
Once the request reaches the node where it should belong, the
dispatch hostname is set immediately, which in effect labels
the request even if the underlying service (and/or endpoint) is
not available at the moment.

The stringified network address is cached in order to avoid creating
it over and over again on each incoming request.

Result
------
More reliable dispatch hostname detection, which can be utilized
better in higher level code.
