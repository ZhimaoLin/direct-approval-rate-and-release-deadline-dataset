DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-201: Ignore IO pool errors on shutdown.

Motivation
----------
When onComplete is called on the subscriber, it can be the case that
it ends up on the computation pool, which is also shut down
concurrently.

Modifications
-------------
Errors are properly ignored during pool shutdown, since the only
important task is to get rid of the threads. Any race conditions
that throw errors and confuse users/spam logs are ignored on
purpose.

Result
------
No confusing errors on shutdown.
