DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-411: Use ports when building partitioned nodes list

Motivation
----------
ns_server/cluster_run script allows to run multiple Couchbase Server
nodes on the same network interface just by assigning all services
different ports.

Currently java core assumes that the all nodes will have different
network addresses, and ignores port during reordering addresses for
partitioning algorithm. Because ordering algorithm does not look at
ports, it might lead to duplicates and eventually parse failure.

Modification
------------
Do not trim ports when parsing partition info block.
Check both address and ports when building partitioned nodes list.

Result
------
JVM core library work with ns_server/cluster_run script
