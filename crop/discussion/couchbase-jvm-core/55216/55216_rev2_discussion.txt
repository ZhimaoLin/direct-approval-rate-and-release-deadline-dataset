DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-241: Handle ERANGE and ROLLBACK during stream open

Motivation
----------
During opening DCP stream, server might respond with ERANGE(0x22) or
ROLLBACK(0x23), and at the core library does not handle these errors,
which leaves to inability to resume state.

Modification
------------
Define appropriate error codes, extract rollback sequence number in
DCPHandler, and update BucketStreamAggregator to handle scenarious,
described above properly.

Result
------
Now DCP streams could be resumed seamlessly.
