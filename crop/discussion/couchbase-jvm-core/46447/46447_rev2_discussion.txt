DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-144: Ensure memcached netty not rewritten

The SDK adds some memcached specific handlers and messages into the
deps.io.netty namespace directly so when rewriting sources for shadowjar
we need to detect io.netty is actually already prefixed and not rewrite
that to com.couchbase.client.deps.com.couchbase.client.deps.io.netty...

Remove a couple extra FQN and took the rewriting of project sources out
of the previous loop (preventing it being done several times).
