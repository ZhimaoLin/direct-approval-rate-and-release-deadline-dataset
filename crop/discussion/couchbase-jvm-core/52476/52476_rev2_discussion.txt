DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-214: Add hasSubscribers method to the EventBus

Motivation
----------
If publishers can check upfront wheter there is a subscriber listening
on the other end, creating events can be potentially avoided.

Modifications
-------------
The interface has been extended and the event bus implementation publishes
the subscriber count through a boolean.

All publishing methods have been extended to take the new method into
account before publishing.

Result
------
More flexibility on the publisher side to eventually avoid expensive
event creation.
