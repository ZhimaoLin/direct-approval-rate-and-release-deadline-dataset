DESCRIPTION

WIP: support ephemeral buckets

this change makes sure that views are not initialized as a service
when the bucket doesn't support it on this node (signified by the
absence of a couchApiBase).

Since its just a service disable we get the fail fast for free like
if the service is just not enabled (same with memcached buckets).

TODO
 - add unit test case which checks ephemeral() getter on eph and
   non eph bucket.
