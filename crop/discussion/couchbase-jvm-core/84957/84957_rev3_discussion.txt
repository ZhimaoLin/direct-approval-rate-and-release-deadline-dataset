DESCRIPTION

Add useMock configuration option

MOTIVATION
----------
JVM-Core integration tests should be able to execute against a running
instance of CouchbaseMock. Internally, there is a useMock property
that can be used, however this defaults to false and requires code
changes to get the integration tests to execute.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add useMock property to TestProperties and integration.properties
- Remove useMock property from ClusterDependantTest.connect
- Update all usages of ClusterDependantTest.connect to note provide
  useMock

RESULT
------
Setting useMock in integration properties allows integration tests to
execute against a CouchbaseMock instance at the seedNode URI.
