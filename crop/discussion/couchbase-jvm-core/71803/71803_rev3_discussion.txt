DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-382: Extract interface needed for BucketConfigParser

Motivation
----------
Right now it is necessary to implement CoreEnvironment to parse
the configuration with BucketConfigParser.parse, which is
not really necessary, and ClientEnvironment in JDCP does not
implement full CoreEnvironment.

Modification
------------
Extract minimal interface, needed for parser and inherit in it
CoreEnvironment.

Result
------
JDCP could inherit ConfigParserEnvironment too in its ClientEnvironment.
