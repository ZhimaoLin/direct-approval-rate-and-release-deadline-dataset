DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-295: Use Yield instead of BlockingWaitStrategy for lower latency.

Motivation
----------
When investigating potential improvements in throughput and latency, it
was discovered that th default BlockingWaitStrategy on the RingBuffer is
probably not the best choice.

Modifications
-------------
The code now uses the YieldWaitStrategy which instead of using a lock
now uses Thread.yield. This also reduces GC slightly since those locks
don't need to be collected all the time.

Result
------
Slighly better performance in general.
