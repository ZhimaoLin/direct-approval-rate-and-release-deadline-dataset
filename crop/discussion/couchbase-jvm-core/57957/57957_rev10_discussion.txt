DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-273: Implement sub-document protocol in core

Motivation:
-----------
Subdocument is a feature in development that allows to read and mutate
values deep inside a JSON document, without paying the extra cost of
retrieving the whole document.

Modifications:
--------------
All subdocument operations have been implemented at the protocol level.
All subdocument status have now also a corresponding ResponseStatus.

The KeyValueHandler is able to encode and decode subdocument requests
and responses.

Messages for single operations (GET, EXIST, DICT_ADD, DICT_UPSERT,
DELETE, REPLACE, COUNTER) and array ops (PUSH_FIRST, PUSH_LAST, INSERT,
ADD_UNIQUE) have been added to the message.kv.subdoc.simple package.

Messages for multi-operations (performing several lookups or several
mutations in an atomic fashion inside a single document) have been added
to the message.kv.subdoc.multi package.

The protocol messages are tested in the SubdocumentMessageTest testcase.

Result:
-------
The core layer of the Java SDK is ready for SubDocument feature.
