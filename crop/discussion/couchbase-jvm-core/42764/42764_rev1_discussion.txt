DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-64: Enhance javadoc building

Motivation
----------
We need a simple page to welcome the user and guide him to the best
place to get started. Also, external links to netty and other projects
are needed so that javadoc can resolve them.

Modifications
-------------
This change adds a welcome page with a simple pointer to the best
starting point, as well as external link references to the build
so they are picked up and the user can click his way through.

Result
------
Better navigateability through the javadocs.

Even if this is for 1.0.2, I already built the 1.0.1 docs with that change which will be up later.
