DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-272: Fix DCP flow control buffer accounting

Motivation
----------
Not all packets have to be accounted, otherwise the server will just
stop transmission.

Modification
------------
The library counts all bytes going through the socket, instead it have
to count only specific types of messages:

* OP_STREAM_REQUEST = 0x53
* OP_STREAM_END = 0x55
* OP_SNAPSHOT_MARKER = 0x56
* OP_MUTATION = 0x57
* OP_REMOVE = 0x58

Result
------
The server does not stop data transmission with flow control enabled
