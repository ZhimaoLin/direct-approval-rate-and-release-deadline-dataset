DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-275: Encode CAS for subdoc multi mutations

Motivation
----------
The subdocument message for multiple mutations didn't encode the CAS
even though it can be provided in the BinarySubdocMultiMutationRequest.

Modifications
-------------
CAS is taken into account and encoded in the message.

Result
------
Multi-mutations can take the CAS into account.
