DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-166: More Observe-related fixes and tests.

Motivation
----------
The previous changeset for JVMCBC-166 (24fdfdf6cbbcd3b8519379b6e1545244cfcc9e90)
introduced a regression with removal requirements.

Modifications
-------------
The code now properly makes sure that on a real delete the cas can be zero and
properly accounts for that.

In addition, an issue has been uncovered where master persistence was observed
too quickly and therefore not properly returned.

A large set of integration tests has been added to correctly assert the
functionality in the future.

Result
------
Correct behaviour also when removal obs are observed as well as more correct
observe reportings during master observes.
