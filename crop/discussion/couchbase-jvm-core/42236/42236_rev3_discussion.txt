DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-44 : let all ConfigRequest pass and adapt RequestHandlerTest

Motivation
-----------
All ConfigRequest should pass through the test for bucket presence in configuration.
Furthermore, after previous refactors the RequestHandlerTest's
test shouldRouteEventToNode would fail (config is empty in dummy).

Modifications
-------------
BootstrapMessage marker interface now on ConfigRequest instead of specific subtypes.
RequestHandlerTest modified to take into account the new need for a configuration that
can respond to hasBucket().

Result
------
All tests now pass.
