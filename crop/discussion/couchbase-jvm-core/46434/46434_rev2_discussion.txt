DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-141: Detect and ignore string in processor

Motivation
----------
ClosingPositionBufProcessor currently doesn't account for strings in
JSON, which could throw its detection off if the string contains an
uneven number of opening and closing characters.

Modifications
-------------
The processor now has an option to detect and ignore strings after the
first detected section opening. Added tests for this behavior.

Results
-------
All test pass and the processor can now ignore strings in the processed
content (provided it is JSON data, not starting inside a JSON string).
