DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-395 Also add xattr to bucket capabilties

Motivation
----------
Recent spock build has bucket capabilies with xattr. Cluster configuration
parse fails with "value not one of declared Enum instance names".

Modification
------------
Add xattr to bucket capabilities. This is also backward compatible as we
ignore any unknowns.

Result
------
Configuration parse is successful with spock nodes
