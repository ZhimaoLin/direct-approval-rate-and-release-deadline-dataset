Line:259, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> this makes me wonder: does the local "extras" buffer serve any purpose? why not directly readLong on xxx@xxx.xxx any insight?

Line:259, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> there is a similar patter in KV handler, but you are right. I also don't see why this would be useful. I will optimize it

Line:259, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> I think that the only reason is that by reading it here, we are advancing it, so that another reader will get the reader index on the end of the buffer.

in this particular place, dcp handler is the only reader, so it would be okay if it will advance
