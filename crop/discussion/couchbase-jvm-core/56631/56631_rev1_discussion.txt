DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-258: Migrate DCP streams to single observable

Motivation
----------
Using observable per DCP stream makes it hard to get a single stream
abstraction because of merge limits in Rx.

Modification
------------
Pull subject to DCP connection, and submit all DCP changes through it.

Result
------
There is no need to merge streams, so it will not miss the messages.
