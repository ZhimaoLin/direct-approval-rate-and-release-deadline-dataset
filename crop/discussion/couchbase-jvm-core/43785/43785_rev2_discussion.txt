DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-76: Listen on IO write operations to log failures.

Motivation
----------
If the void promise is used, less GC is produced, but we are loosing
the ability to see if something goes wrong during the write process.

Modifications
-------------
This code add listeners to write operations and logs when they fail. This
provides better insight by the slight penalty of more GC. Those callbacks
should be short-lived though, so they should die young.

In the future, this can be changed based on the debug level used to achieve
greater performance, but for now correctness is more important than the
last drop of performance.

Result
------
Better debugability of write failures.

Line:340, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/AbstractEndpoint.java -> can't we create single static instance of GenericFutureLister and pass it each time?
