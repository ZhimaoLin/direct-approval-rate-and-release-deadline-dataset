DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-371: Safeguard connect callback on endpoint.

Motivation
----------
Previously it has always been expected (as the contract states)
that when connecting a channel the future always returns with either
success or failure eventually. It has been observed that in some
environments it is possible that this contract doesn't hold.

In the end, it doesn't really matter if its an environmental
issue or a bug in netty, we should safeguard it with a finite
timeout and then enter the retry loop just to be safe.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset leaves the actual retry logic on failed connect
attempts unchanged, all it does is wrap the original callback
into an rx Single and then add an explicit timeout, which is
currently set to 500ms above the socket connect timeout. If
this timeout hits, it gets converted into a socket connect
timeout so the previous logic of error handling works as
usual.

Note that the only thing that had to be added is that
if the channel is null, we need to schedule the retry
on an event loop from the ioPool. In theory we could
always do this, but I wanted to leave as much logic
as possible the same as before to avoid regressions.

Result
------
If the connect callback never returns we now have
a safeguard in place that lets the client retry with
the normal logic.

Patch Set 6:

I modified it a little, adding a system property if we run into issues in the field as well as adding a little higher timeout to allow for more room when doing the rest of the connect setup like auth.
