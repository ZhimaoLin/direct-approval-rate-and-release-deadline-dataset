DESCRIPTION

Refactor configuration handling.

This changeset gets rid of the config depdencency and adds all needed properties for the
environment with an elegant builder which also respects system properties that take
precedence. The architecture also allows to be later extended on dynamic properties
that can either poll during the app lifetime or also be exposed through JMX.
