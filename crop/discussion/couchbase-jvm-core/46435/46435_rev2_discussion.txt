DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-142: Ignore escaped quotes in clientID

Motivation
----------
When parsing a clientContextId, the id could contain escaped quotes.
Currently the parser doesn't manage that and it will result in bad
parsing.

Modifications
-------------
Parsing of clientContextId now uses the method that ignores escaped "
when searching for the closing quote.

Results
-------
ClientContextId containing an escaped quote are now correctly parsed.
