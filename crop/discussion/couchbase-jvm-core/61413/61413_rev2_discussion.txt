DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-309: Gracefully handle errors during metrics collection.

Motivation
----------
Since the underlying histogram can have bugs or we feed it invalid
timings somehow, it can throw an exception and as a result it will
bubble into our IO event loops.

Since metrics collection is considered support functionality, it
should under no circumstance interfer with the actual IO processing.

Modifications
-------------
try/catch is placed around the metrics collection logic and if an
error is detected it is logged for proper inspection.

Result
------
If errors happen during latency metrics collection, they are not
affecting the actual IO workload  but are logged for proper
supportability.
