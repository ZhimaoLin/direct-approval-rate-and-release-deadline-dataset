DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-167: Allow to disable buffer pooling.

Motivation
----------
It might pay off in the future to have a "kill" switch to disable
buffer pooling. This can be used as a temporary workaround if a
leak in the client is suspected (and not in the user level code).

Modifications
-------------
Add the environment option which is enabled by default. The endpoint
selects the proper allocator based on the environment setting.

Result
------
As a last resort it is possible to disable buffer pooling, but of
course not recommended.
