DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-423 Dont send timed out operations over network

Motivation
----------
It is not very ideal to send timed out operations on the application to
the server.

Changes
-------
Allow to store a reference to the subscriber in the CouchbaseRequest and
add check to see if the subscriber has unsubscribed from the subscriptions list.
If the subscriber has unsubscribed, the request handler will not further
process the request.

Results
-------
Timed out requests will not be sent to the server. Tests are covered
in java-client.

Couple minor things. In addition to the comments:

- I think the alive check should also be in place somewhere in the retry path (I was thinking right after the op is waited for retry and right before its put into the ringbuffer. this would make sure we keep the ringbuffer as clean as possible and not put inactive ops in there in the first place)

- can you please add a couple of unit tests which assert this? I think you can use the TestSubscriber for this
