DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-232: Add simple disabled() config factory methods.

Motivation
----------
If a user needs to disable the metrics collection, while setting the time
to 0 is okay, providing an explicit disabled() factory method is much better.

Modifications
-------------
disabled() factory methods provided on all of the exposed config types available.

Result
------
Easier disabling of the individual metric collectors.
