DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-402 Fix ignored callbacksOnIoPool in N1ql & Analytics query row callbacks

Motivation
----------
Async query row will always emit response on a computation pool thread
even if callbackOnIoPool is set

Changes
-------
Use callbacksOnIoPool value to decide if the observeOn computation
thread scheduler should be set for query observables. If the value is
set to true, the callback will continue using the Io pool thread. This
may give a slight performace gain to application by removing the
overhead of thread switching.

Results
-------
CallbacksOnIoPool value is no longer ignored
