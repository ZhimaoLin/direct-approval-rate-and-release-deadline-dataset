DESCRIPTION

Correct KeyValueHandlerTests to properly assert request releasing.

Motivation
----------
This changeset makes sure the KV Handler test properly assers the request
content release part, in addition to the (before wrongly asserted) response
content part.

Modifications
-------------
Properly assert the right content in the tests. In addition, more checks
have been added to the handler to avoid NPEs and refcount issues in the
first place.

Result
------
Tests now run through correctly.
