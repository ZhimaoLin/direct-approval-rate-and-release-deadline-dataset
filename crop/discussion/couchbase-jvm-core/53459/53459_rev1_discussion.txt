DESCRIPTION

Fix 2 unit tests with context problems

DefaultCoreEnvironmentTest should only consider interesting threads like
"cb-*" and "*Rx*".

DefaultMemcachedBucketConfigTest: the test would assert on resolved
hostnames while the config contains an IP, which fails if the hostfile
of the machine is not tuned.
