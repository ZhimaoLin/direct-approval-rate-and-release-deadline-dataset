DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-178: Add toString() to Delay implementations.

Motivation
----------
The environment dumps the delay settings, but they provide very little
details if the delay itself also doesn't implement a meaningful toString()
method.

Modifications
-------------
Proper toString() overrides for all delay implementations which also expose
their internal values like boundaries, time unit and delay time.

Result
------
It is now possible to see which delay is configured in the environment dump
on startup.
