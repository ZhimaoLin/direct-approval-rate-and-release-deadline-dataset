DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-232: Add toString() various events

Motivation
----------
When the event is printed out, just seeing the hash code doesn't help
much when debugging events.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset makes sure that all events that are emitted have toString
representations available.

Result
------
Correct output when printed out.
