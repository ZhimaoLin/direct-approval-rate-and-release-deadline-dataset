DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-283: Allow to check if services are enabled on a per node basis.

Motivation
----------
On the hot code path we need to add proper checks if a service is enabled
and this can be cached and looked up on the config.

Modifications
-------------
Cache the per-node service info in a map so its only on map lookup away,
not slowing down the hot code path a lot.

have you considered storing the service info on the Node object themselves?
