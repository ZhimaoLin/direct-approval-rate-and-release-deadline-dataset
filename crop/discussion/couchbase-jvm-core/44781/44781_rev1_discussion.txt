DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-106: Do not retain content on encoding.

Motivation
----------
While the extras need to be retained (because they are released
down in the memcache protocol encoder), the content should not
be encoded, otherwise it leaks into the pool.

This does currently only show up with Observe operations (because
there the content is allocate from the pool), but once the code
actually encodes more content from the pool it needs to be
properly released.

Modifications
-------------
Remove the code which retains the content and only keeps the
extras to be retained.

Result
------
Operations encoded with pooled content do not leak out of
the pool.
