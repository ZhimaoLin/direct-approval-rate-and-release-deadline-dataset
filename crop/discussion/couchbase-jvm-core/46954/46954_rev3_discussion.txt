DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-152: query keepAlive GET on admin/ping

Motivation
----------
Currently, keepalive makes a HEAD request on /, and this returns 404 in
some versions of the cbq-engine. This is not a suitable endpoint.

Modifications
-------------
Issue a GET on the more suitable endpoint /admin/ping instead.

Results
-------
Query keepAlive isn't met with a 404 error anymore.
