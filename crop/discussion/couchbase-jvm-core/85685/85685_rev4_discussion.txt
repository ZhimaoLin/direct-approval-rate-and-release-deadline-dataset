DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-477: Add SDK compatible memcached hashing.

Motivation
----------
Current memcached bucket ketama hashing strategies are
not compatible with libcouchbase and go sdk derivates,
since the way the key is hashed is a bit different.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds a new strategy to provide
lcb-compatible hashing and as a result it can be used
alongside lcb-built sdks.

The NodeInfo had to be adapted a bit to store and
expose the raw host string exposed from the config
in order to guarantee determinism in how the key
is hashed.

Result
------
libcouchbase-compatible hashing support.
