DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-322: Getter for version and build number in env

Motivation:
-----------
Currently there is no way to get only the version string or the build
string (git describe) for the core (they are combined in packageNameAnd
Version).

Modifications:
--------------
Added two methods that output the build-provided version number and
build number (coreVersion() and coreBuild()).
