DESCRIPTION

Set ByteBuf leak detector to paranoid in integration tests.

Motivation
----------
In order to more quickly detect ByteBuf leaks, all integration tests
should be run with the leak detector switched on and in the "paranoid"
setting to detect as many leaks as possible.

Modifications
-------------
Since the ClusterDependentTest is the parent class for all integration
tests, the static property is set there.

Result
------
Potentially better results in early identifying ByteBuf pool leaks.
