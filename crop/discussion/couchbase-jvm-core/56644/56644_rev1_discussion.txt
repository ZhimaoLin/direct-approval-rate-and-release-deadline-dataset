DESCRIPTION

Bump RxJava to version 1.0.15

Motivation
----------
RxJava 1.0.15 most notably comes with the ability to shutdown the
schedulers, allowing to avoid memory leaks in containers like Tomcat.

To do so, call Schedulers.shutdown(). This will prevent RxJava from
working so only invoke it when shutting down the application, after
having called cluster.disconnect() (since this could still use Rx).
