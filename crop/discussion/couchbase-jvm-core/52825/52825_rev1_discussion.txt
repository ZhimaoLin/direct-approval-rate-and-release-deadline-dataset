DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-216: Replace Atomic* with plain volatile if possible.

Motivation
----------
In a few places, AtomicReferences and similar are only used to wrap objects
with plain get() set() semantics. Since those methods are only facades over
volatile stores and reads, they can be omitted and replaced with plain volatiles.

Modifications
-------------
In all places where the code uses atomic* classes and only uses get() and set()
on them, they have been swapped out with plain volatiles instead.

Result
------
No unnecessary use of atomic classes.
