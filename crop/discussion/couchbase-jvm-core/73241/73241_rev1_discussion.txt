DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-385: Make sure free is enabled on start.

Motivation
----------
The free on start flag was only set in one constructor by mistake,
rendering some other higher level functionality not working as
expected.

Modifications
-------------
Properly set an endpint to free on start.

Result
------
Endpoints are now ready to always take requests from the upper
level selectors.

Line:207, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/AbstractEndpoint.java -> nope, I just had it removed to double check and then just put it at the end since I forgot where it was :D
