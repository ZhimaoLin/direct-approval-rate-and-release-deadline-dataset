DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-132: Enhance KV error status codes.

Motivation
----------
Previously, lots of memcached errors codes were swallowed under a common
failure status code. This makes it impossible to better inform the user
what happend on the language binding level.

Modifications
-------------
All status codes also used in spymemcached are properly imported and now
handled in the response status. They have been generalized a bit so they
provide reusability across services.

Result
------
Easier handling for different error types at the upper levels.
