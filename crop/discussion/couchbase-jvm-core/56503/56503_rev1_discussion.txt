Patch Set 1:

They might have buffers, but they are released. I use this subject  not because I need to actually reply same data to every subscriber, but rather to collect everything before first subscriber will connect

would the semantics of UnicastAutoReleaseSubject (our internal implementation) be better suited? the ReplaySubject will replay its whole buffer to new subscribers before passing them "live" data...
