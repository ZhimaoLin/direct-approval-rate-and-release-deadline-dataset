DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-355 (Fix bad AssertJ dependency to Java8)

Motivation:
-----------
In the related UnicastAutoReleaseSubject change, the AssertJ
dependency was using wrong version that hides a dependency to
Java8 classes. This has come up during QE, and the version must
be fixed.

Modifications:
--------------
AssertJ 1.x is Java6 compatible while 3.x requires Java8.
Using 1.7.1 like in java-client now.
