DESCRIPTION

Improve integration test version check utility methods

Motivation:
-----------
The current version check utility method in ClusterDependentTest only
considers the major version. An upcoming test needs to check on the
minor version.

Modifications:
--------------
Made the version check utility method return an int[] instead of Integer
thus allowing both major and minor versions to be checked.

Added several flavors of version check utility methods, including one
that directly perform a Assume.assumeTrue given a target minimal
major.minor version.

Result:
-------
Ignoring a test depending on the minor component of the lowest Couchbase
version in the cluster is now possible.
