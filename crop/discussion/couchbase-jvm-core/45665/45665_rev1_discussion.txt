DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-131: fix query response section detection

Motivation
----------
Current detection involves checking if next colon is before opening of
brackets. But if there's no next colon at all, nextColon becomes -1, and
this is always considered to be before the opening bracket.
This in turn triggers a state change, which fails because no actual
section header is anywhere to be found.

This can happen in large chunked responses where a chunk contains only
empty rows, for example SELECT toto FROM `beer-sample` (because toto is
not an existing field, the server returns as many empty rows {} as there
are documents in the bucket).

Modifications
-------------
Parser now checks if the colon is really there. Extracted the code into
a dedicated method "isEmptySection".

Result
------
Parser correctly parses large responses with empty row values.
