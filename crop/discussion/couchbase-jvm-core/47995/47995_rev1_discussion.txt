DESCRIPTION

fix detection of ServiceNotAvailable (JVMCBC-120)

Motivation
----------
Since the exception has been changed from UnsupportedOperationException
to ServiceNotAvailableException but the RequestHandler then only catches
the old one, clients would not get notified of the error other than in
logs.

Modifications
-------------
RequestHandler now catches the correct exception type.

Results
-------
Clients will correctly get notified of a ServiceNotAvailableException
(and not eg. timeout) if there no service able to handle a request.
