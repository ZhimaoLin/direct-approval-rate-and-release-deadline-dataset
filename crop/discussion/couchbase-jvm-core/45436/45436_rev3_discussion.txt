DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-126: Avoid IndexOutOfBounds when parsing view rows.

Motivation
----------
Off by one erros can raise exceptions in the view and query handler when
looking for the closing }.

Modifications
-------------
The processor is refactored out of the query handler and now also reused
in the view handler.

Since the processor keeps the bound checks in its internal implementation,
such off by one errors can be avoided. Also, using a processor is more
efficient.

Result
------
No off by one errors when parsing view rows anymore.
