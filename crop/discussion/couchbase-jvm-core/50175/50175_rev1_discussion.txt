DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-191: Log unknown status codes.

Motivation
----------
When the server returns an unknown status code, a log message with the
actual code needs to be written in order to properly debug the situation.

Modifications
-------------
Since the response status converter is the centralized class to handle
the decoding, it now WARN logs a message when it detects an unknown status
which will be converted into a generic FAILURE.

Result
------
Better debugging when an unknown status code is detected.
