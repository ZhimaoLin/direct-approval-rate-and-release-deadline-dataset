DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-41: Fix buffer leak in DefaultFullBinaryMemcacheRequest/Response

Motivation:

DefaultFullBinaryMemcacheRequest/Response overrides release(), retain()
methods without calling its super, resulting in a leak of the extras.

Modifications:

When overriding release() and retain(), ensure to call super. And retain
extras on before passing to costructor.

Result:

Fixes the buffer leak
