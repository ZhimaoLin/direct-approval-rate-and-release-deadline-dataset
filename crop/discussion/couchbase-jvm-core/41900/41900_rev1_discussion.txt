Patch Set 1:

Hmm I have a gut feeling that this is not the right fix, but of course I could be wrong.

AbstractBinaryMemcacheMessage.java: that is intended to be created only once anyways, so I think doing the null checks are not needed since its only done once anyway. 

The other thing could be right, but I'd like to understand the problem further before getting this out. Let's sync up soon.
