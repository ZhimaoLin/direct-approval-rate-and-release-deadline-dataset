DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-388: Rename misleading ConfigurationProvider outdated line.

Motivation
----------
The log line on "outdated configuration" is misleading since the
polling is actually done proactive every couple seconds. On
DEBUG level it is visible and might give the impression something
is wrong while it isn't.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset rewords the log line to more accurately reflect
on whats going on.

Result
------
Cleaned up misleading debug log line.
