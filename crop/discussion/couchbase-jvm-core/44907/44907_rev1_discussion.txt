DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-106: Do not retain content and extras on encoding.

Motivation
----------
In the current fork of the memcached protocol netty codebase, the extras
were retained, which is not as-is upstream. Also, retaining the content
was actually leaking out of the pool (for example through observe
operations).

This changeset makes sure nothing leaks during encoding operations.

Modifications
-------------
Two changes were made:

	- The superfluous release() in the codec was removed.
	- Both retain for extras and content in the handler is removed.

Since during writing, netty calls release on the memcache request, all
resources are properly freed.

Result
------
Nothing leaking on writing and also making sure there are not too much
release/retain calls which do not make sense.
