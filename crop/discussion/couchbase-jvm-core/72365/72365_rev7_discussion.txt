DESCRIPTION

WIP: pooled service

todo:
 - convert dcp and config service
 - remove old service implementations
 - implement idle time socket closing
 - completely implement the environment with builder for settings
   and deprecate the older APIs
 - fail and document if pipelined is enabled and not fixed is used
   since right now they would consume all the reqs anyways
 - migrate endpoint selection from array to list interfaces
 - add test which makes sure the selection strategy is never called with
   a empty endpoint list/array
