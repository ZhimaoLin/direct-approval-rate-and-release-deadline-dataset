Line:443, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> maybe add a note that only server 3.0 is supported

Line:457, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> add that if set to true, key store file and password also must be set

Line:496, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> add that this switch is only used during developer previews and will be deprecated once N1QL ships with the server.

also add that if not bundled, it needs to run on all nodes in the cluster

Line:509, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> same as above.

Line:535, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> CCCP is not what the user knows it as.. name it "carrier publication"

Line:605, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> maybe add a note that if more nodes in the cluster than pool size is defined, multiplexing will happen automatically.

Line:618, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> I'd rather define it as "pool for all non blocking operations in the core and clients"..

and add a caution saying it should not be sized very small since that can significantly impact performance

Line:632, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> add a note that this is advanced and does not often need to be changed

Line:646, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> add a note that this is advanced and does not often need to be changed

.. also ideally req and res buffer size should be equal

Line:659, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> add "per node in the cluster". here I'd write that only tune to more if IO has been identified as the potential bottleneck, if more are opened one can be loosing batching on the tcp/network level

Line:672, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> also add per node. Setting to a higher number is advised in heavy view workloads.

Line:685, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> also add per node. Setting to a higher number is advised in heavy query workloads.

Line:699, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> maybe add that this should not be tweaked normally

Line:716, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> maybe add that this should not be tweaked normally
