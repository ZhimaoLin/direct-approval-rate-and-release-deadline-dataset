DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-159: Make responses reference counted.

Motivation
----------
To make it easier to release byte buffers without actually needing to know
all the implementation details, the appropriate responses can be made
reference counted themselves.

Modifications
-------------
The only responses carrying raw buffers are in the view and kv namespace. They
are made reference counted and will free the underlying content buffer when
release is called on them. They act as reference count proxies.

Result
------
More generic way to free responses.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

maybe we should protect against null content? especially in AbstractKeyValueResponse (since at some point in the future we could extend it without using the content)?
