DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-230: Only use one pause detector

Motivation
----------
The latency utils that we use for latency collection creates a
pause detector per object if not set properly before. Also, it
checks every ms and therefore creating lots of context switching.

Modifications
-------------
To reduce context switches the code creates one pause detector
and only wakes it up 10ms, dramatically reducing the
context switches it creates.

Result
------
No more context switches than needed.
