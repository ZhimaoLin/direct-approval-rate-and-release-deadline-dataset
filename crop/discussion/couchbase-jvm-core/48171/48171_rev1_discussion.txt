DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-170: Apply a hard lower limit for pool sizes.

Motivation
----------
For various reasons (only one core, wrong user config) it can happen
that the io and/or computation pool sizes get set to a very low
value which can cause deadlocks or resource starvation.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset applies a lower limit of 3 which is a resonable
default lower limit. It also prints INFO level messages to help
the user identify any issues.

Result
------
More resiliency out of the box for different user setups and
environments.
