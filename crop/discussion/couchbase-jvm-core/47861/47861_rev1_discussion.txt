DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-163: Avoid eager evaluation of config fallback.

Motivation
----------
Even when onErrorResumeNext is done once a failure happens, passing
it in right away will make the JVM eagerly evaluate the call
and trigger the network request.

Modifications
-------------
Use Observable.defer to correctly defer the hot observable call and
avoid a request which is never consumed and potentially leaks the
content.

Result
------
No eager evaluation and no leak.
