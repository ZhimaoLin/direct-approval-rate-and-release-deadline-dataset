DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-418 Add mock support for integration test

Motivation
----------
Use CouchbaseMock to test kv error map and allow configuration mock settings
as properties

Changes
-------
- Add dependency to CouchbaseMock which is hosted in
snapshots.couchbase.com.
- Add basic structure for testing kv error map as it is still not used
by the client
- Expose error map from ResponseStatusConverter
- Read properties file test.properties to check if mock is enabled and
also mock related settings.

Results
-------
Now mock can be used for testing kv error map.
