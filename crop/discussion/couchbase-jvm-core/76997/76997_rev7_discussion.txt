DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-418 Add mock support for kv error map integration test

Motivation
----------
Use CouchbaseMock to test kv error map and allow configurable mock settings as properties

Changes
-------
- Add dependency to CouchbaseMock which is hosted in snapshots.couchbase.com.
- Add basic structure for testing kv error map as it is still not used
by the client.
- Expose error map from ResponseStatusConverter.
- Read properties from com.couchbase.client.core.integration.properties
properties to check if mock is enabled and also mock related settings.
- Add username to properties for couchbase server 5.0 support.

Results
-------
Now mock can be used for testing kv error map or others based on a flag
passed to connect in ClusterDependentTest.
