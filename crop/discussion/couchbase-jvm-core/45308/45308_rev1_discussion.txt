DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-122: Release response content in view handler when removed.

Motivation
----------
When the view handler is removed for some reason (failover, rebalance
out, disconnect), the response content needs to be freed since it is
also allocated out of the pool.

Modifications
-------------
During handler cleanup, also release() the response content back to
the pool.

Result
------
No more held back bytebufs when a view endpoint is removed for some
reason.
