DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-432: Fix hostname fallback in MDS environment

Motivation
----------
Couchbase terse config might skip "hostname" property of entries in "nodesExt",
when the node configured on localhost. To mitigate that, SDK tries to fetch
hostname from "nodes" array. In MDS environment, where not every node has
Data service, falling back "nodes" array will have only entries where Data
service has been enabled, which leads to IndexOutOfBoundsException during
aforementioned fallback mechanism

Modifications
-------------
Only pull hostname from "nodes" array, when its size matches "nodesExt", because
only in this case we can be sure that we addressing the same node's information.
If the size does not match, the only option we have is to fallback to "localhost".

Result
------
SDK works with MDS clusters created by ns_server/cluster_run.

looks good to me, only a minor nit with logging

Line:75, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/AbstractBucketConfig.java -> makes sense to me, but I think we should at least log a DEBUG message here?
