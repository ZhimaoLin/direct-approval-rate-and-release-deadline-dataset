DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-476: Add support for IPv6 in config values.

Motivation
----------
During testing it has been discovered that some parts in the code
only work with hostnames or IPv4, but not with the IPv6 bracket
syntax.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset modifies the codepaths where this is happening and
adds test cases for each.

Result
------
IPv6 support for couchbase bucket configs.
