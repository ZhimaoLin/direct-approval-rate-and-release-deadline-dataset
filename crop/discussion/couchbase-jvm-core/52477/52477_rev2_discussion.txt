DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-215: Let Handlers expose their ServiceType

Motivation
----------
In preparation for the extended metric support, it is key
that each handler exposes the service type so it can be
stitched together later in a consistent manner.

Modifications
-------------
The AbstractGenericHandler defines an abstract method and all
handler implementations (including a mock test) implement them
accordingly.

Result
------
Each handler can now be properly identified by its service
type.
