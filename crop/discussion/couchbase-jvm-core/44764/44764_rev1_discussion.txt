DESCRIPTION

Narrowing misleading DEBUG message for node removal.

Motivation
----------
The DEBUG message showed a list of node removal _candidates_, but
logged them as they would be removed.

Modifications
-------------
Only log a DEBUG message if the node is actually going to be removed.

Result
------
No misleading DEBUG log message on node removal if its not actually
going to happen.
