DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-107: release buffer in ConfigHandler

Motivation
----------
ByteBuf leaks were encountered while testing, the contentResponseBuffer
is not properly release at any point despite it being only internally
used.

Modifications
-------------
FinishedDecoding now also releases the buffer and set it to null, so
that next decoding will start with a fresh buffer from the pool.

Same for handlerRemoved().

Result
------
No more leak should be encountered with the ConfigHandler.
