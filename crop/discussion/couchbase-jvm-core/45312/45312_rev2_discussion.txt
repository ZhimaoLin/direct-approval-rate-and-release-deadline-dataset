DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-123: Release observe content properly.

Motivation
----------
When observe is used, the content needs to be properly freed. Actually,
the content is not needed at all, so it can be freed right in the key/value
handler.

Modifications
-------------
Free the content in the key/value handler after use for observe, but keep
an additional check in Observe just to be double safe on not leaking the
content.

Result
------
No leaks during observe poll cycles.
