DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-403 Fix incorrect escape processing in streaming parser

Motivation
----------
Streaming parser with incorrectly consider escaped quote in a string
like "\\\"" as unescaped. Fix to consider the quote as correctly
escaped.

Changes
-------
String bytebuf processor keeps track of last two bytes to check if the
current byte is escaped. This is incorrect in the n-2th byte is already
escaped. So just keep track if the last byte is escaped to make
transitions to escaped or unescaped state.

Results
-------
Query parser now correctly parses continuous escape sequences. Added
unit test to verify.
