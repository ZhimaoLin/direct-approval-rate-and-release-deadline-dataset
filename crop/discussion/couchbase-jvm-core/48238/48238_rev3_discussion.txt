DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-171: Make sure nodesExt without hostname is backwards compatible.

Motivation
----------
Couchbase Server versions prior to 3.0.2 do not include the hostname
in the nodesExt config part. In 2.1.1 a regression was introduced
which expected it to be there and therefore broke backwards
compatibility.

Modifications
-------------
The code now grabs the hostname from the nodes section if it is
not available in nodesExt. A test has been added to make sure it
works properly.

Result
------
Backwards compatbible behaviour with server versions older than
3.0.2.
