DESCRIPTION

Share intellij idea settings in the team

Motivation
----------
In order to make it easier to bootstrap with project it will be good if
some projects settings will be shared in the team. It will also allow
perform tasks such full project tree cleanup.

Modification
------------
Import .gradle project once using IntelliJ Idea. The IDE can watch and
sync settings if needed (e.g. change of versions). To setup .gitignore
rules, official support ticket was used:
https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/23393067

Result
------
No need to import .gradle project to idea each time developer cleans the
tree or setups new machine.

what happens if you dont have the checkstyle plugin?

Line:6, .gitignore -> can we whitelist instead?

Line:9, .idea/misc.xml -> we need to do 1.6

Line:9, .idea/checkstyle-idea.xml -> lets get rid of sun and use ours only.

Line:6, .gitignore -> No we cannot, because it will make it harder to find pieces we really need, for example I've just configured checkstyle and it was easy for me to figure out in what file idea writes these settings (just use 'git status'). With whitelist it would be kind of guessing game.

Accidentally added files will be easily spotted during code review in Jasmin Rangel.

Line:9, .idea/misc.xml -> Done

Line:6, .idea/checkstyle-idea.xml -> The active configurations specified here, and sun's is not enabled

Line:9, .idea/checkstyle-idea.xml -> This line added by idea, it keeps readding it.
