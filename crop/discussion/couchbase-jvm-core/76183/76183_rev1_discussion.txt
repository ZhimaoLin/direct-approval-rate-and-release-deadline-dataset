DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-394: Fire channelActive in SelectBucketHandler when disabled.

Motivation
----------
As part of the bucket selection process a new handler was introduced,
but it doesn't fire the channel active event if the feature is
disabled. Since the upper handlers rely on this event to be bubbled
up the code doesn't work properly anymore.

Modifications
-------------
Bubble up the channelActive event if the feature is disabled.

Result
------
Functionality restored.
