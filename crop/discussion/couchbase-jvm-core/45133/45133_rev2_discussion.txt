DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-121: Do not expose the list of partitions outside of the config.

Motivation
----------
The previous code did expose the List<Partition> to the whole core, but this makes
it very hard to change the underlying implementation.

Modifications
-------------
More getter methods have been exposed which provide the needed functionality, instead
of exposing the list directly. This allows to change the implementation of storage
later.

Result
------
Better encapsulation of the underlying data structures.
