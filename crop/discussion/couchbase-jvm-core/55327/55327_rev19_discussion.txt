Line:461, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> the method should be static like the other "handleXXXRequest" ones

Line:569, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> why has the static modifier been removed here? these methods were made separate and static for hot code path optimization.
Could you capture the value of remoteHostname and pass it along as an argument for this method?

Line:569, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> because I need to call remoteHostname()
