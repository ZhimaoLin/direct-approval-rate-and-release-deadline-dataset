File Comment: src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/kv/AbstractKeyValueRequest.java -> looks like your IDE made automatic modifications to parts of the file not related to this change... please configure it so it only changes only the lines you edited:

added <p/> in javadoc, reordered imports, reordered static members

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/kv/StatRequest.java -> is the number of responses expected to be that large?
