DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-394 Add support for username/password auth in support of RBAC

Motivation
----------
Allow rbac user/password authentication support.

Changes
-------
1. Memcached connection negotiation also includes select_bucket command
for rbac users. Added additional handler for this in KeyValueEndpoint.
2. Internal protected apis (in Request and Enpoint classes) are broken to include
username.
3. Public interfaces are retained by adding an additional overload with
username.
4. Connection string allows username to be set.
5. Bucket configs store username.

Results
-------
Requests to core-io can now include username.
