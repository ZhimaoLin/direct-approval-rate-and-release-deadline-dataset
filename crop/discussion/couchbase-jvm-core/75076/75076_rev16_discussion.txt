DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-394 Add support for username/password auth in support of RBAC

Motivation
----------
Allow rbac user/password authentication support.

Changes
-------
1. Memcached connection negotiation also includes select_bucket command
for rbac users. Added additional handler for this in KeyValueEndpoint.
2. Internal protected apis (in Service and EnpointFactory classes) are broken
to includeusername.
3. Public interfaces (in Requests and Endpoint classes) are retained by
adding an additional overload with username.
4. Connection string allows username to be set.
5. Bucket configs additionally store username.

Results
-------
Requests to core-io can now include username. Specific rbac tests are covered in
java-client as current tests inherently test the changes.
