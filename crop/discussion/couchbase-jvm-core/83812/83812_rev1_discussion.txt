DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-465: Harden AbstractEndpoint for concurrent reconnects.

Motivation
----------
Under certain circumstances (like failed auth connect), it is possible
that multiple codepaths end up forcing the endpoint to reconnect.
It is important that race conditions are avoided which might lead
to too many reconnects or the endpoint ends up in a state which
it should not belong in.

Modifications
-------------
Three changes are made in this changeset to remedy some of the
effects:

  1) Since DISCONNECTED can be a transient state, the future check
     on success now checks for the actual disconnected variable, which
     is only going to be set if a disconnect is definitive.
  2) on channelInactive, the reconnect logic is only called if the
     channel is in a connected state. This especially prevents the case
     where the channel is already reconnecting and so we don't want
     another attempt piled on top.
  3) In the connect callback handler, if the timeout and the future
     completion race each other, lets make sure we clean up any successful
     channels so they are not lingering around. This hasn't been observed
     in practice yet but it should help harden it.

Result
------
Concurrent reconnects, especially around auth failure retries, should now
be more resilient and lead to more deterministic behavior.
