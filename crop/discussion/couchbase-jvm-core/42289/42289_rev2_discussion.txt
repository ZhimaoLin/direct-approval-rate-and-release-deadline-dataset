DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-45: Give config loading a chance to be retried.

Motivation
----------
Lots of exceptions have been reported where the GetBucketConfigRequest
failed and messed up the RequestHandler.

Modifications
-------------
In the previous code, the message was failed, but instead the config
loading request should be given a chance to be retried (which the
upper logic does if an empty node array is returned) instead of
failing it prematurely.

Such a situation can occur when the node takes longer to go through
the full connect and auth cycle and may be available a few ms later.

Result
------
Graceful retry of configuration loading if the node is not (yet)
available.
