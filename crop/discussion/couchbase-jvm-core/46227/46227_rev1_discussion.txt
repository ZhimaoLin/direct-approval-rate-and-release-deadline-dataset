DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-66: also rewrite dep imports in original src

In sourceJar, since now we include shadowed dependencies sources, we
need to include rewritten original sources so that they import the
relocated classes and can be debugged.

The shadowSource task now also copies core sources and rewrite them to
reflect change in shadowed package names.

Only the result of shadowSource is included in the sourcesJar task.
