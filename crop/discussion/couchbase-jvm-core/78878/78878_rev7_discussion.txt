DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-414 Add Extended Support phase 2 for KV Error Map

Motivation
----------
Couchbase server 5.0 provides key value error map with hints on handling
errors on response. Add support to parse and consume the error map
hints.

Changes
-------
The following changes have been added to the key value response handler

- Parses the retry specifications available for auto-retry attribute
- Consumes and records the retry specifications on the request itself
- Reconnect, retry if connection state invalidated attribute is present
- Send config invalidated message if config update attribute is present
- Changed error code type from short to long in error map keys to
  accomodate unsigned shorts.

Updated mock to latest version including the namespace changes. Mock integration
tests have been added to verify constant, linear and exponential retries.

Results
-------
Error map is parsed and consumed. Verification tests pass.
