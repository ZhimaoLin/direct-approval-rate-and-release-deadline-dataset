DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-2: Implement Carrier-based configuration management.

This changeset implements the carrier (cccp) based config management, solely
based on the binary get config commands and NMVB responses.

One known issue is that some operations seem to never get completed, so they time
out, but after that the code carriers on. This needs to be investigated separatedly.
