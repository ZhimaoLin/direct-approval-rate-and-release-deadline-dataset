Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I believe since this is only useable with RBAC and under RBAC auth we require a select bucket command, this isn't sufficient.  Does it test properly?  Adding Michael and Subhashni to offer comments too.

Hi Manik,

two questions:

- what is the reasoning behind this change in the first place?
- Why would we, if the server responds with an error, ignore it and move forward as it would've succeeded in this case?

@Michael: Manik later told me that this wasn't really ready for review, which is why he didn't put reviewers on it yet.  Sorry for the confusion!
