DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-194: Avoid concurrent modifications on node removal.

Motivation
----------
During node removal, the code (since it reuses the same set) is
subject to potential concurrent modification exceptions.

Modifications
-------------
By copying the set before iterating it, the concurrent modification
can be avoided.

Result
------
Safer code during reconfiguration.
