DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-379: Close query error observable as results start streaming

Motivation
---------
Query response observables are released early if the prepared query being
executed is long running (greater than 2s).

Modifications
-------------
Prepared query error values are peeked for retry. The error observable
complete only when query status is received, which causes
other query response observables to time out and be released before they
are consumed.
Closing query response error observable as soon as we start streaming
results instead of waiting for query status.

Results
-------
There should be no delay to transitioning the response observables to terminal
state. Verification using integration test in JCBC-1029.
