DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-232: Rename SystemMetricsEvent to RuntimeMetricsEvent

Motivation
----------
While writing the docs for this feature, it became visible that the
name was poorly chosen because we have a system event type and the
SystemMetricsEvent is a metric event type. All very confusing.

Modifications
-------------
The SystemMetricsEvent has been renamed to RuntimeMetricsEvent to
avoid the "system" name confusion and also to more accurately highlight
from which component the metrics are gathered.

Result
------
No more confusions, hopefully.
