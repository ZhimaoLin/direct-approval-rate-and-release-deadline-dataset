DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-293: Fix ExponentialDelay overflow guard, 64 bits not 32

Motivation:
-----------
ExponentialDelay overflow protection for the bitshift operation is too
eager, the 32 attempt overflow could occur every 64 attempt instead if
the operand was 1L (long) instead of 1 (int).

Modifications:
--------------
The bitshift operation now applies on a long and capping occurs starting
from attempt 64, not 32.

Result:
-------
ExponentialDelay more accurately deals with attempts 32 to 64 by having
the bitshift operator apply on a long. Other attempts correctly capped
at Long.MAX_VALUE.
