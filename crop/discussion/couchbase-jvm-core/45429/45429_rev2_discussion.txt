DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-124: Fix QueryHandler IndexOutOfBounds

Motivation
----------
There could be an IndexOutOfBoundsException in QueryHandler's internal
findSectionClosingPosition method.

Modifications
-------------
Replaced the manual loop by a ByteBufProcessor, resulting in safer range
processing of the bytes and fixing the off-by-one error.

Result
------
Finding a closing section character now works as expected, tests pass.
