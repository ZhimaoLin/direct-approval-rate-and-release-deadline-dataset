Looks good overall, just small nitpicks.

Line:33, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/binary/BinaryCodec.java -> can you disable star imports for these projects? We always kept the full ones.

Line:146, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/binary/BinaryCodec.java -> you can read the flags right off the msg.getExtras .getInt basically, no need to copy it first.

Also, for future you never want to use unpooled but rather ctx.buffer().alloc() since that uses the buffer pool.
