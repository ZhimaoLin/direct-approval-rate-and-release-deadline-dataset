DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-208: avoid repeated isTraceEnabled calls.

Motivation
----------
Hot spot profiling has revealed that repeated isTraceEnabled
calls on the hot code path spend more time in CPU than needed.

The value should be cached, with the drawback of not being
able to change the log level at runtime. While this is
suboptimal, other parts of the system also don't support
that and the whole runtime idea needs to be revisited
at some point. For now, performance matters more.

Modifications
-------------
Cache the isTraceEnabled call in the handler at
construction time.

Result
------
Less CPU cycles spent in the repeated calls.
