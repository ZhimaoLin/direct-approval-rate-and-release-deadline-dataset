DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-298: Use 0x97 to get last closed checkpoint for partition

Motivation
----------
Command 0x48 returns is not very reliable, because it returns only
sequence numbers for the node.

Modification
------------
Rewrite state gathering using 0x97 (get last closed checkpoint), in
combination with 0x54 (get failover logs).

Result
------
More reliable gathering current state of the cluster
