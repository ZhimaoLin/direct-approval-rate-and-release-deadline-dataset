DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-323: Gracefully handle config completion errors during shutdown.

Motivation
----------
When the handler is removed during shutdown, it might be the case that
the scheduler where this is run on is already shutting down and as a
result not taking any more tasks.

Modifications
-------------
Catch the specific exception and print a log message, but don't let it
bubble through the event loop. It's not harmful, but looks a little
nasty in the logs.

Result
------
Less clutter in the logs when this happens during (very often violent)
shutdown.
