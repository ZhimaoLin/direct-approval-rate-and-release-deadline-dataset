DESCRIPTION

Add pom.xml to core-io

Motivation
----------
Because our gradle code is messy and we don't use lots of
custom functionality, we can easily just use a simple maven
pom file.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds a maven pom.xml which contains all the
functionality of the previous gradle build.

Result
------
Maven-Based project setup.
