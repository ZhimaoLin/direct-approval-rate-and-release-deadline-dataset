DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-416: Set config poll interval to 2.5s by default.

Motivation
----------
As part of the fast failover RFC it was decided that the default
poll interval is reduced to 2.5s to detect config changes more
quickly.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset tunes the poll interval down from 10s to 2.5s.

Result
------
Quicker detection of possible config changes.
