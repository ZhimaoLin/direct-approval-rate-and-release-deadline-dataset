DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-391: Reset the reader index of content buffer on NMVB.

Motivation
----------
If underlying handlers (like SSL) are reading and modifying
the original content buffers, the retry logic doesn't work
well since it is expecting that the buffers are still
fully readable.

Modifications
-------------
We found that while the SSL handler doesn't touch the refcount
it modifies the reader index since it needs to read the content
for encryption purposes.

When a NMVB is returned we reset the reader index to allow the
content payload be reused again.

Result
------
When SSL is enabled and a NMVB shows up, the content is now
properly reusable and doesn't end up writing "empty" payloads
against the server
