DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-150: Map ERR_BUSY to a dedicated status

Motivation
----------
Some operations, like GetAndLock or Unlock, already are a bit ambiguous
in their error code, returning ERR_TEMPFAIL even for the case where the
key is already locked or the unlock used a wrong CAS.
Not distinguishing between ERR_TEMPFAIL and ERR_BUSY adds ambiguity...

Modifications
-------------
Add a ResponseStatus SERVER_BUSY to map ERR_BUSY.

Results
-------
Clients can now distinguish between ERR_TEMPFAIL and ERR_BUSY (by eg.
throwing a CASMismatchException for TEMPFAIL and a
TemporaryFailureException for BUSY).
