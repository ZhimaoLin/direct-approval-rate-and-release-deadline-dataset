DESCRIPTION

[cleanup] Reformatting and Refactoring of RequestHandler

Motivation
----------
This changeset slightly reformats the RequestHandler and also splits out
the big "onEvent" method into smaller method chunks. This allows for
better inlining and easier maintenance.

The only functional change is that when a new config arrives it is
always published onto the event bus, since the bus itself checks if
it has subscribers (avoid double checking).

The branching on found Nodes has been improved to have the common case
(nodes found) in the if block.
