DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-257: Do not refresh buckets on disconnect/bucket closed.

Motivation
----------
If an endpoint goes out of the cluster or all buckets are closed,
it is unnecesary to trigger config refresh. This can also lead
to pathological cases were refresh is happening after a full
shutdown.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset performs the following changes:

  - Only trigger a refresh from the config provider to the refreshers if
    at least one bucket is open.
  - If an endpoint is removed (disconnected), there is no config reload
    signalled to the config provider. This only needs to happen if an
    unintended socket close happens.

Result
------
No unnecessary config refreshes during shutdown and intended endpoint
disconnects.
