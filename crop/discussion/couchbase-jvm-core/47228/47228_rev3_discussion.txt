DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-153: Expose signature from N1QL response

Motivation
----------
The signature was just skipped until now, but some clients are currently
evaluating N1QL and need this information.

Modifications
-------------
Signature is exposed in GenericQueryResponse, as an Observable<ByteBuf>.
The observable is fed by the QueryHandler and correctly closed upon
parsing status.

Added signature parsing in QueryHandlerTest (and signature sections in
relevant test json).

Made QueryHandlerTest's mock environment have queryEnabled to true.

Fixed/added bits of documentation.

Results
-------
Java SDK will now be able to retrieve and expose signature, cf JCBC-717.
Unit tests pass.
