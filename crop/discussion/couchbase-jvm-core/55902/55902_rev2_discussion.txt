DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-222: Support MDS for Memcached Buckets

Motivation
----------
To make different service types (MDS - Multi-Dimensinal-Scalability) work with
memcached buckets, the code needs to make sure that only data nodes are included
in the ketama hash computation.

Modifications
-------------
The code which populates the ketama node list now takes the exposed service type
into account and only uses those who include the BINARY service type.

A unit test has been added to verify that.

Result
------
MDS is now also supported for memcached buckets.
