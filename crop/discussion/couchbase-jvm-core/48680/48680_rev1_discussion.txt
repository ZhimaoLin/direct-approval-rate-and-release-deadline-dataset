DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-173: Fix DCP compatibility with transient endpoints.

Motivation
----------
Somewhere between 1.1.0 DP and GA some code was reworked and parts
of the experimental DCP support was broken.

This changeset fixes the compatibility.

Modifications
-------------
To make it work again, a few things had to be put into place:

	- Add a LazyService to connect lazily but limit to 1 connection
	  and then reuse it.
	- Remove the transient nature from the dcp endpoint
	- Add some more intelligent cluster version detection to also
	  now run the DCP int tests when possible.

Result
------
Basic DCP integration is now working again, but more changes are
anticipated to make the behaviour more correct and usable.
