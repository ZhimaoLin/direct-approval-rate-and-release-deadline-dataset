DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-443: Remove DCP from Core-IO

Motivation
----------
DCP has been factored out into its own project (which has core-io
as a dependency) and we've deprecated it couple months ago.

Modifications
-------------
Now that 1.5.0 is around the corner DCP is removed from core-io
and only lives in a standalone project where it is maintained.

Result
------
Getting rid of unmaintianed and unused code in core-io making it
leaner.
