DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-245: Add time unit to the latency metric.

Motivation
----------
The metric should also include the target unit, so later inspection
of the resulting data is not dependent on identifying the time unit
set at configuration time.

Modifications
-------------
Adding the time unit to all possible output formats.

Result
------
Easier identification of the time unit reported in the latency metrics.
