DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-125: fix null signature parsing & nextToken

Motivation
----------
Sometimes the N1QL server can send a response with the signature field
empty (null). This confuses the parser.

Modifications
-------------
Parser now checks if there's a JSON object in signature field.

Also improved the keyword peeking to determine next state.

Result
------
Parser can parse response with null signature, for example with a CREATE
PRIMARY INDEX ON default request.
