DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-304: Extract common interface for DCP data messages

Motivation
----------
Connectors, which built upon the core, often need to differentiate
between interesting data events (mutation, deletion, etc.) and service
events (create new stream, query failover logs, etc.).

Modification
------------
Extract DCPMessage interface, and move common data to the abstract base
class.

Result
------
Better API
