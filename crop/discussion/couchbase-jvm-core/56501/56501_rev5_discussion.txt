DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-260: K/V command to get mutation tokens

Motivation
----------
There is a simpler way to get initial vbucket high sequence numbers than
through STAT: GET_ALL_VB_SEQNOS[1]. The command returns what called
MutationToken in terms of SDK, except it does not fill vbucket UUID field.

Modification
------------
Define request/response payloads, and update KeyValueHandler to support
them.

Result
------
There is much easier way to initialize state of DCP streams.
