DESCRIPTION

RFC: K/V command to get mutation tokens

Motivation
----------
During analyzing Couchbase traffic, I found interesting command: 0x48,
which actually renders things we call MutationToken (except it does not
include vbucket UUID there). I found it pretty useful, so implemented as
experimental API.

Modification
------------
Define request/response payloads, and update KeyValueHandler to support
them.

Result
------
There is much easier way to initialize state of DCP streams.

Nice find :)
Did you make sure with the query team if that opcode was going to be supported long term and tied to the enhanced durability HELLO feature?

What is the impact of it not having the vbucket UUID? Don't we rely on that in our usage of MutationToken?

Side note, the enum should have javadoc /** */ comments not plain /* */ comments (will be useful for users)...

Simon, who in query team I should ask about it?

For DCP initialization absence of vbucket UUID is not a failure, it will just use current one, so it is okay.

Another option to get the same information is more expensive (STAT command you might remember).
