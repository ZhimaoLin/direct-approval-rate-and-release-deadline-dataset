DESCRIPTION

RFC: K/V command to get mutation tokens

Motivation
----------
During analyzing Couchbase traffic, I found interesting command: 0x48,
which actually renders things we call MutationToken (except it does not
include vbucket UUID there). I found it pretty useful, so implemented as
experimental API.

Modification
------------
Define request/response payloads, and update KeyValueHandler to support
them.

Result
------
There is much easier way to initialize state of DCP streams.
