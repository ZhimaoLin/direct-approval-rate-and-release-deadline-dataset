just a minor nit, but note we also should now remove the usage from java-client (if it was marked internal/experimental remove the class too, if not keep it).. but for sure mark it as deprecated if that is the case and the java-client code should call the core one if that makes sense

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx now
