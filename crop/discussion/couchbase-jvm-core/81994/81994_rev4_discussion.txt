DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-438: LOCKED & Finishing touches for Xerror

Motivation
----------
With recent development of the xerror & kv error map in the spock
server release, a couple of adjustments need to happen in core-io
to be in-line with it.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset contains the following changes:

 - enable xerror by default now that all regressions are fixed
 - LOCKED is added as a new response status code that needs to
   be handled.
 - The error map is _only_ consumed and checked if the error
   is not known by just looking up the status code.
 - if a "item-locked" is found all retry behavior is removed
   from the attribute list to keep backwards-compatible behavior.

Result
------
Extend xerror support while still keeping backwards compatibility
on document locking.
