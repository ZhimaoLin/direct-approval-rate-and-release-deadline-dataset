DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-456: current request needs to be set on response.

Motivation
----------
The old query handler did set the currentRequest on the
GenericQueryResponse, but the new parser didn't even if the
response expects it to.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds a test to assert for non-nullness of the
request and makes sure it gets set properly by the new parser.

Result
------
The query response has the original request properly set by
the new parser.
