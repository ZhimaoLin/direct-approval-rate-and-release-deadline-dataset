DESCRIPTION

Implement selection of all endpoints using selectors

Motivation
----------
There are requests which have to be broadcasted to all endpoints, but
SelectionStrategy allows to pick only one endpoint for request.

Modification
------------
Add selectAll() method to interface and implement it for all current
strategies to return all connected endpoints. Also rename old method
select() to selectOne()

Result
------
It will be easier to implement broadcasting OpenConnectionRequest for
DCP, also STAT commands have similar semantics.
