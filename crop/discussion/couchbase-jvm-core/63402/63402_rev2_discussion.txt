DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-330: Enable trace logging of CouchbaseRequests on retry

Motivation
----------
Since a retry of an operation (especially in a steady state) is
something which should be unusual, it makes sense to log the
amount and retry delay of those requests at TRACE level (to not
spam the logs in an overload condition).

This also allows, if there is a suspicion of retry events going
on but they shouldn't, to specifically enable TRACE logging for
the ResponseHandler only.

Modifications
-------------
The ResponseHandler now logs the retry event with the actual request
as well as the retry delay and unit used.

Result
------
More insight into how and when requests are retried.
