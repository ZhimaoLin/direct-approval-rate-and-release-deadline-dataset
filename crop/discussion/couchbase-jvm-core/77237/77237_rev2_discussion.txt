DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-421: Close LatencyStats on removal.

Motivation
----------
LatencyStats is holding a weak reference to the pause detector
and it makes sense to clean them up to save the GC some work
and also avoid bloating if the GC is not cleaning them up
right away.

Modifications
-------------
Once the stat is removed, call close on it to make sure the
weak reference internally is cleaned up properly.

Result
------
LatencyStats are properly cleaned up. Hat tip xxx@xxx.xxx for
letting me know of this.
