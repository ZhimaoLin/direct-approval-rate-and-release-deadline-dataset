DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-261: display stacktraces for exceptions caught by disruptor

Motivation
----------
When interpolated into a format string, exception object just shows the
message only. It will be more useful to output more context about it.

Modification
------------
Exclude Throwable from format string, and allow logger to handle it
properly.

Result
------
Stacktraces visible now

Oh wait, two more things:

- you need to convert the two arg thing into one with string concatenation, check the signatures. if you pass an exception, only one arg is allowed

- Also, can you do the same for the response ringbuffer? there are two and they should behave the same (a few lines around)

Patch Set 2:

I didn't get your first comment. I'm using the following signatures

    void info(String msg, Throwable t);
    void warn(String format, Object argA, Object argB);

where both argB and t are throwables

I will update the other case
