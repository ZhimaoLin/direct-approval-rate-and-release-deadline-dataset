DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-261: display stacktraces for exceptions caught by disruptor

Motivation
----------
When interpolated into a format string, exception object just shows the
message only. It will be more useful to output more context about it.

Modification
------------
Exclude Throwable from format string, and allow logger to handle it
properly.

Result
------
Stacktraces visible now
