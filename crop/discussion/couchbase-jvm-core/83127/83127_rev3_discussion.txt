DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-462: Promote Experimental APIs where appropriate.

Motivation
----------
This changeset works through all the experimental APIs and promotes
them to uncommited & committed where appropriate.

Especially most of the subdoc API has been mature enough so its
worth promoting it in 1.5.0.
