DESCRIPTION

Backport fix for test using hostname instead of IP

This is a partial backport of commit 896f24a, as reviewed on
http://review.couchbase.org/53459:

DefaultMemcachedBucketConfigTest: the test would assert on resolved
hostnames while the config contains an IP, which fails if the hostfile
of the machine is not tuned.
