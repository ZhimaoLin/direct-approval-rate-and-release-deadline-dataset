DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-51: Move Observe utility class from java-client

Motivation
----------
Each wrapper of core-io library have to implement Observe polling
feature. This way is more error prone and harder to maintain good
quality of this implementation, which in fact will be shared.

Modification
------------
Pull Observe utility class PersistTo and ReplicateTo enums from
java-client to core-io.

Result
------
Duplication reduced (considering java-client and jruby-client
libraries). Potentially expanded coverage for the Observe
implementation.

Patch Set 7: Verified+1

I "moved" enums here in core-io and made them inner of Observe class to avoid accidental importing core functionality.

In java-client enums remain the same, just wrapped the core-io
