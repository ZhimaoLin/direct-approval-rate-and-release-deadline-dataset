DESCRIPTION

JVMCBC-466: Cancel KeepAlive future when channel is removed.

Motivation
----------
When "continuous keepalive" is enabled, which it is by default
now, then when a socket gets closed the keepalive still keeps
going (or at least tries to), since the scheduled task is not
cancelled.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset makes sure that when the handler is removed, the
future which coordinates the timed execution gets cancelled and
as a result stops the continuous execution attempts.

Result
------
When a node is properly removed the keepalive doesn't keep on
going and potentially leaking sockets.
