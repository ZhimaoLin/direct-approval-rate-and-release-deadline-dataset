DESCRIPTION

MB-16154: Create Breakpad Minidump file upon fatal error on indexer

Integrate Google Breakpad[1] into GSI's indexer program, to trigger the
creation of a minidump when a fatal error is encountered, including
fatal errors in forestdb.

Implemented by adding a simple Golang interface to Breakpad (C++)
which allows Golang to startup Breakpad to create a minidump upon
a fatal error.

Minidump files will be written to the path specified by the
'minidumpDir' argument, or the storageDir if minidumpDir is not
specified.
