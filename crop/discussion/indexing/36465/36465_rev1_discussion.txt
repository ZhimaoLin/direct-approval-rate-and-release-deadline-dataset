Looks good.  Just 2 minor comments.

Line:172, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> If in the future, bucket can have different number of vbuckets, then the worker will have unbalanced load.  Keep this in mind in the future.

Line:221, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Would be a good idea to print out the information about this key as well (e.g. seqno, key value, docId).   It would also be good to state the action that streamReader is doing (e.g. it will drop the key), so it is clear in the log.

Add one more comment -- how do you know if all the  workers have stopped before replacing with a new indexQueueMap?

Line:239, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> How do you know if all the workers have actually stopped before changing the index queue map?

Line:172, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Alright thanks. For now, I have kept the default as 8 workers in mutation manager.  Will adjust this logic in future as required.

Line:221, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Sure. Will do so.

Line:239, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Within stopWorkers, ch <- true(line 293) is a blocking call for each worker(as channel is unbuffered). It completes only when case <-stopch:(line 205) in startMutationStreamWorker is executed. This case only has a return statement. And once this case is entered, the worker no longer accesses the index queue map.
