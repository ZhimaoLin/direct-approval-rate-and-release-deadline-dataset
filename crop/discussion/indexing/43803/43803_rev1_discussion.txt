Patch Set 1:

(13 comments)

Line:160, secondary/manager/stream_mgr.go -> Is it possible that StreamManager.Close() is called after the above code executes but before starting s.run() routine ?
Maybe it okay to avoid this check ?

Line:270, secondary/manager/stream_mgr.go -> What if len(allInstances) == 0 ? Especially when topic-stream is yet to be started.

Line:878, secondary/manager/stream_mgr.go -> Not sure whether this loop needs to monitor whether feed has started SUCCESSFULLY.

Line:938, secondary/manager/stream_mgr.go -> This is folded into ConnectionError, if feed is configured to prevent slow indexer node behaviour cascade into upstream then the connection will be closed to slow indexer.

Line:43, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> Yes.

Line:49, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> This allowed.

remove instance - DelInstance()
deactive vbucket - ShutdownVbuckets()
restart vbucket - RestartVbuckets() 
repair connection - RepairEndpoints()

Line:52, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> is the above map is bucketname->timestamps ? If so should we need an array of timestamps ?

Line:60, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> For `streamId` can use the topic-name that was supplied to projector while starting the feed ?
topic-name is expected to be unique.

Line:150, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> This timeout may not be required because <-donech will block anyway.

Line:164, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> Should we kill the other workers ?

Line:174, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> Can we do a retry on the failed set of workers ? We can also do a retry on full set of workers and most likely it will end up as NOOP.

Btw, I remember discussing the following -
//   - Before attempting a retry, caller should cross-check with cluster
//     manager (eg. ns_server) for,
//     * bucket's sanity
//     * latest VBMap

I am assuming that AddIndexToStream could be called with empty set of instances but with a new sub-set of request timestamp.

Line:492, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> May be we should check for bucket sanity and vbmap here ?

Line:760, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> Is there a guarantee that a bucket will be hosted by the same set of nodes as any other bucket in KV ? If so we can just return the list of nodes as ([]string, error)
