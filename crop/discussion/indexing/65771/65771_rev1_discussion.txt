DESCRIPTION

MB-20156: GsiClient race condition during bootstrap.

Mutex lock added around places which read indexTopology{} (as currmeta)
and updates it.

There is a separate lock RWMutext around indexTopology.load field.

The 2 locks are expected to take mutually exclusive path, except in
updateTopology, where older stats are reloaded into new-topology structure.

This means, no code shall ever call updateTopology holding on to the RWMutex.
