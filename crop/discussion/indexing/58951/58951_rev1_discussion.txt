DESCRIPTION

MB-17226: Remove callbacks

We are not able to make C to Go callbacks work properly. We can
make it work on Linux now, but on Windows, it is causing weird problems
due to mingw being involved in compiling/linking external code. As a
temporary state, remove all callbacks so we don't face unexpected hangs
or break windows build.
