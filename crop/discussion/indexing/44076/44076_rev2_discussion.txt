DESCRIPTION

indexer: Implement refcounting for slice close/destroy

When an index needs to be destroyed, all the slice
resources (forestdb handles, physical files) need to
be deallocated. But, there could be a number of consumers
using slice resources while a drop index needs to be processed.

Added refcounting methods IncrRef(), DecrRef() that can be used
by consumers. Destructive functions Close() and Destory() will
become a lazy operation and will be performed only when refcount
becomes zero. ie, all the consumers have finished using the resource.

Line:551, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> One more thing we need to discuss is if we softClose the file on Drop Index and there is a Create Index with index of same name before all readers are done with the snapshot, we'll run into issues. Noting it here so we don't forget. May be the disk file needs to have the instanceId in its name to make it unique?

Line:551, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> That is correct. We need to do it as part of adding storage directory as part of systemconfig.
