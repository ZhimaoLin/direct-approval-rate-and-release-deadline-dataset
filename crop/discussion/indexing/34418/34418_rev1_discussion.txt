Patch Set 1:

(16 comments)

Line:4, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> I'm not sure what is the difference between indexer and local indexer. It is not obvious.

Line:7, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Except for stability timestamp generation, is index manager involved in any normal non-administrative operation data path?

Line:14, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Index Manager Master / Replica is more commonly understandable, and would prefer that terminology.

Line:19, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Again, node typically means a "machine". I'd prefer not to redefine things in a manner that is less than conventional.

Line:23, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> We must discuss this - I was under the assumption our agreed design explicitly kept the Index Manager out of query and update data path.

Line:33, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Not sure if index manager needs to know pub sub. I'd prefer router figure it out based on topology information published by index manager

Line:35, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Don't understand why they can't tNathalie Landry to each other directly

Line:46, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> I don't think we've agreed to participate in ns_server master election (except for liveness determination, even that is possibly a passive activity).

Line:64, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> The only time a client would tNathalie Landry to index manager would be during execution of a DDL. To that effect, we should not need to allow DDL operations to start or continue if a failure occurs.

Line:66, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> update is confusing as it could refer to index data update. Do you mean DDL statement processing?

Line:77, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> I'd prefer if all replicas are not available, we abort the update entirely. It is not a requirement for DDL statement capability to be available during failure, or complete to success always. As long as we return error to client and stay in a good (working) state, that's all is needed to handle failures during DDL statements.

Line:79, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> ns_server should discover it directly. it's easier for one component to be responsible for liveness tracking (ns_server)

Line:81, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> We don't need to retry. We respond with error to the client, and end the DDL processing there.

Line:91, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> I'd like to delegate this to ns_server. I'd expect them to push a config that indicates the chosen master, and based on seeing such a change, the indexer nodes configure themselves accordingly.

If the master does not respond, then it's back to failover / liveness mechanism described elsewhere.

Line:4, secondary/docs/design/markdown/indexer.md -> I think it may be confusing to separate index manager, index coordinator, index replica. I think they could be different classes, but I'm not sure if they have elements to qualify as a full component (such as deployment plan etc).

Line:5, secondary/docs/design/markdown/indexer.md -> The term local indexer is confusing because it would imply there could exist something else, a global indexer? I'd rather we just call it indexer process (and the manager as index manager)

Line:4, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Rename - understood

Line:14, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Pending decision if we'll do distributed commit of metadata

Line:23, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> From discussion, we agree on this.

Line:4, secondary/docs/design/markdown/indexer.md -> Pending decision if we'll do distributed commit of metadata

Line:5, secondary/docs/design/markdown/indexer.md -> Ignore. Understood that it's a rename
