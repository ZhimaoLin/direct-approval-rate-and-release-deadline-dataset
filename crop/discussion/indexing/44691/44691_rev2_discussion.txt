Line:703, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> shouldn't we pick the file with highest version as that one would be the latest?

Line:703, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> When compaction happens there will be file.1 and file.2. only if compaction succeeds, file.1 becomes invalid. But as part of successful compaction old file will be deleted. Incase if while compaction fails, new file cannot be used. Hence always first file will be the right file to use
