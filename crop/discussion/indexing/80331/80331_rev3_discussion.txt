DESCRIPTION

MB-25098 indexer: Obtain reader context appropriately for requests

If the reader context is obtained before acquiring an index snapshot,
delayed stale=false queries will block all the stale=ok queries.

Also added logic to return ErrIndexRollback for invalidated snapshots after
indexer rollback.

Line:1311, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Actually how about we acquire the token after getting the snapshot for AnyConsistency as well. e.g. if the lastSnapshot doesn't have the snapshot, then the code path will send it to StorageManager even for AnyConsistency. And if StorageManager is in rollback, it will not reply. Or the message may not reach StorageManager as the main loop is blocked due to rollback. Any downside of acquiring the token later for AnyConsistency?

Patch Set 3:

Yes, we can do that as we are anyway failing queries during rollback
