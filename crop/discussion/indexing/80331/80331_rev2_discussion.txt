DESCRIPTION

MB-25098 indexer: Obtain reader context appropriately for requests

If the reader context is obtained before acquiring an index snapshot,
delayed stale=false queries will block all the stale=ok queries.

Also added logic to return ErrIndexRollback for invalidated snapshots after
indexer rollback.

Line:1314, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> We need to skip doing Ctx.Init in defer in case of error acquiring the snapshot. Otherwise it will not be freed up.
