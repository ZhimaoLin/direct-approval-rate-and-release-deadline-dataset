Looks good.
Later if you feel these functions are better attached to Pool{} / Bucket{} object under dcp/ feel free to do so.

There is gap in current ns_server abstractions between nodes belonging to a bucket and set of nodes in a pool. So, I was unsure what needs to be done. ns_server for some reason has no abstraction of 'Node'. It tNathalie Landrys about only bucket, pool, node services.

We can see if this wrapper abstraction works for us and later move into dcp.Pool

Looks good. Return statements need to be corrected. One possible improvement is to use the cached list of nodes to connect in Refresh() if the node with url provided in NewClusterInfoCache  goes down.

Line:67, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> return the nids?

Line:85, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> I think return needs to be corrected.

Line:114, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> return the addr?

Line:139, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> return needs to be fixed.

Usecase of ClusterInfoCache is to connect with local cluster manager (usually provided by ns_server). If local cluster manager is down, that usually means current node is down.

So do we really need to try connecting with other cluster management nodes ?

Line:67, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> Using named return objects. Hence, return variables not required.
