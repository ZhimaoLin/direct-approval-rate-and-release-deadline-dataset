DESCRIPTION

Indexer Integration With Manager

- Indexer is integrated to register for MetadataNotifier to
get updates for Create/Drop/Topology updates.
- Indexer will provide a synchronous error response if the DDL
cannot be processed.
- Once an index build is accepted, success is returned to Index
Manager.
- Further state changes for index (initial->catchup->active) are
updated in manager topology.
