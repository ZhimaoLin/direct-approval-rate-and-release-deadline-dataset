DESCRIPTION

projector: angio for projector.

A tracking token is generated for every request that enters projector,
subsequently, if request leads to a new data-path, the token will
rub off onto the data-path, which then leaves a trail of control
path and data path via log-messages. This trail shall help developers
to tool around log-messages.
