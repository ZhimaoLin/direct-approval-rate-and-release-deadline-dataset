DESCRIPTION

MB-22422: Fix corner cases for secondary key length checks in GSI

The fixes include:
- Remove crashonerror / checkdbfatal errors
  for non-storage operations in slice writers.
- MOI array-index insert should create individual item with
  NewSecondaryIndexEntry having isArray as false
- Encoded Array secondary entry size check should be
  against maxArrayKeyBufferLength in index_entry
- Scan co-ordinator secnBufPool should be
  increased by ENCODE_BUF_SAFE_PAD
- Fix logging in array.go. Length should be logged not the key.
- Some minor logging improvements

Line:517, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> The error returned from ArrayIndexItems is not from db. Do you want to skip calling checkFatalDbError?

Line:517, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> This is for old back index entry Deep. If splitting old entries fails, we can skip the docid as that leads to inconsistency. Hence I am crashing. But error is not expected for old entries as buffer sizes are adjusted to be sufficient enough even in cases where users change buffer size settings
