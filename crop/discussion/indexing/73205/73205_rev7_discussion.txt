DESCRIPTION

MB-22422: Fix corner cases for secondary key length checks in GSI

The fixes include:
- Remove crashonerror / checkdbfatal errors
  for non-storage operations in slice writers.
- MOI array-index insert should create individual item with
  NewSecondaryIndexEntry having isArray as false
- Encoded Array secondary entry size check should be
  against maxArrayKeyBufferLength in index_entry
- Scan co-ordinator secnBufPool should be
  increased by ENCODE_BUF_SAFE_PAD
- Fix logging in array.go. Length should be logged not the key.
- Some minor logging improvements
