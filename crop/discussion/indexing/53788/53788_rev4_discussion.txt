DESCRIPTION

MB-15870 indexer: Disable compaction extraSnapshots data size approximation

It is very difficult to approximately determine extra snapshots data size
without forestdb API support. With default setting of 5s commit interval
and 5 rollback points, extra snapshots data size will account for data
inserted in 25s. That may not contribute to major fragmentation for large
indexes. User can adjust compaction min_size and fragmentation threshold
accordingly to deal with extra snapshots overhead.

Also changed compaction min_size to 500MB
