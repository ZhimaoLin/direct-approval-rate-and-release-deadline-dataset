DESCRIPTION

MB-16203 : Need a directory to write diagnostic information

Added a new argument "diagDir" to receive a config from ns_server
for dumping diagnostics information. Value defauts to "./" .
Made this addition for indexer and projector.

Also modified flag parsing to ignore extra/unspecified arguments
in which case a warning is logged. Any other error in flag parsing
results in indexer/projector crash.

Panic:
./indexer -vbuckets=abc -cluster=127.0.0.1:9001 ...
==> panic: invalid value "abc" for flag -vbuckets:
strconv.ParseInt: parsing "abc": invalid syntax

Warning:
./indexer -vbuckets=1024 -cluster=127.0.0.1:9001 .. -blaharg=abcd
==> [Warn] Ignoring the unspecified argument error:
flag provided but not defined: -blaharg

Only one error is handled as Parse() returns on first error.
