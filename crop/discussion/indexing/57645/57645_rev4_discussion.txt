DESCRIPTION

MB-17009: Do not callback from forestdb into go

As forestdb has threads originating from go and also threads it
starts up by itself, the execution environment is a mix of cgo
thread and pthreads. It is not possible to predict which thread
will execute callbacks. So it is best to keep all callbacks in C.
