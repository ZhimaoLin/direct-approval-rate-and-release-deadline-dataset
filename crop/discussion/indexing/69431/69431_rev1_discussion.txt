DESCRIPTION

MB-21552 memdb: Fix duplicate snapshot loading during rollback

Index rollback involves two steps:
1. Rollback the store to a previous snapshot
2. OpenSnapshot with latest snapshot

The memdb slice resets the store to rollback snapshot.
But it does not remove the invalid disk snapshot files
Also, the rollback API was reloading the snapshot unnecessarily.
The OpenSnapshot() call takes the responsibility to load the snapshot
