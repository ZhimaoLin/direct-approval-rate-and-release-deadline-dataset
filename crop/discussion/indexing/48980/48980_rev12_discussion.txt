DESCRIPTION

MB-13590 Indexer to have its own timer/sync msg mechanism

With limiting of mutation queue length, it is not always going to
be possible for indexer to keep listening to sync messages from
projector. Both functionalities being served by sync(updation of HWT
and providing a timer facility to generate stability timestamps periodically)
are now managed by Indexer on its own.

Line:597, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Don't we need a new line ? I mean after
   "MutationCount %v"

Line:40, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> Why have we reduced it to 1 worker ?

Line:44, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> Is this channel buffer ?

Line:531, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> So this sync due flag helps to detect if at-least 1 mutation has occured for this bucket, right ?

Patch Set 12:

(4 comments)

Line:531, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> yes thats right.

Line:597, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> the next log message automatically gets printed on the new line.. not sure if there is something in the log pkg or our logger.

Line:40, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> as we are bottlenecked on disk..even 1 worker is sufficient to fill up indexer queues much faster than these can be drained. Will do more experiments and fine tune.

Line:44, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> yes this is channel buffer. Now stream reader is directly inserting mutations in queue rather than buffering.
