DESCRIPTION

MB-19531 memdb: Reset GCLink before performing node delete

The MOI application uses GCLink field for maintaining list of index
items for a docid. When DeleteNode is performed, the GClink is not cleared.
SMR freeworker thinks that this is a valid node to be freed and tries to
free the invalid address.
