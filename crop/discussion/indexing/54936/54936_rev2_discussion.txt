DESCRIPTION

MB-16194 Fix slice API to add mutation meta field for supporting multiwriters

Mutation vbid is required for index multi writers. Work distribution
to the multi writers should be based on vbucket shards.

Currently multiwriters won't work since it causes out of order
execution of index updates for mutations for a document.
