Line:318, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> Can we please check and error out CREATE INDEX statement if isDistinct is false? As we've currently not implemented duplicates feature? We can put an ETA in the error message so people don't complain. But we should not allow non-distinct array indexes to succeed at feature complete.

Line:62, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> Please make this configurable before merging to master. It is OK if it is not in UI, but it should be derived from config.go

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> All commits must have a bug number. CBIDXT number is fine. QE needs this to be able to correlate code changes with expected behavior changes.

Line:314, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> we also don't support multiple array field in a composite index, correct?  If so, we should validate.

Line:455, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> run go fmt?
