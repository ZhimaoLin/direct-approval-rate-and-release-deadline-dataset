DESCRIPTION

MB-15068 Fix indexer crash due to invalid stats map

During index drop, stats map held by createSnapshotWorker() goroutine
go out of sync since it is executed concurrently while drop is performed.
We need to make sure that stats map passed to the worker is in sync with
index instance list passed to the createSnapshotWorker().
