DESCRIPTION

ClusterInfoCache: Hide existence of inactive nodes

Some of the ns_server pool level node listing APIs expose nodes
which are inactive. But, node service discovery APIs do not expose
nodes until they are active. Made ClusterInfoCache APIs to
consistently return only active nodes through all the exposed
methods.
