DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-48 Initial Implementation for Flusher

This is the basic structure of Flusher. SliceMap is still a loose
concept and will change as implementation of topology structure happens.
Interaction with storage layer(available via Slice) still needs to be defined.

Patchset 2(Minor Changes):
- Formatting changes in flusher.go
- Fix typo error in message.go
- Remove GetMsgData from Message interface
