Patch Set 1:

(3 comments)

Line:2642, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> It is not correct to call stop ticker here. Ticker is being used in a different goroutine below. So this will stop it prematurely. We can stop it in the same place as in the original patchset http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/60842/4/secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go

Line:176, secondary/indexer/mutation_queue_atomic.go -> The ticker is already being stopped before returning from this function(line 199).

Line:219, secondary/indexer/mutation_queue_atomic.go -> The ticker is already being stopped in line 227. Also the ticker is being used in a separate goroutine, so this call will close the ticker prematurely.
