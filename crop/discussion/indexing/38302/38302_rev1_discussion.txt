DESCRIPTION

Integrate MutationMgr/StreamReader with latest stream library

- Use protobuf message format being sent by stream library in
stream reader(stream_reader.go)
- Copy the actual mutation data in MutationKeys/MutationMeta structs
to allow underlying protobuf library to reuse its structs
- Change mutation queue to handle new structs(mutation_queue_atomic.go)
- Change mutation manager to use latest index and partition definition
structs
