DESCRIPTION

MB-13590 Initial Build TS Generation Changes

As initial build can have big snapshots to process which
may not fit into mutation queue, timekeeper will need to split
stability TS based on HWT. Also as snapshot markers can come in
at different points in time, the existing stability TS will need
to be merged with incoming snapshots so mutations from all vbuckets
can be processed together.
