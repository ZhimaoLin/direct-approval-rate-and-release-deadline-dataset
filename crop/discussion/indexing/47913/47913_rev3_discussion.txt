DESCRIPTION

MB-13590 Initial Build TS Generation Changes

As initial build can have big snapshots to process,
the TS should wait for all snapshot markers before it begins
processing. This ensures all vbucket mutations are processed
together. Earlier large snapshots would make the mutations
queue up for vbuckets which don't have any snapshot marker in TS.
