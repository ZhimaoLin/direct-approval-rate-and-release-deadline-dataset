DESCRIPTION

MB-13887 Rollback meta store first

If rollback is successful partially e.g. if main index gets rolled back
and back index gives a failure leading to panic, the recovery would still
pick the latest snapshot from meta (as meta didn't rollback) leading to
"no db instance" from forestdb for main index.

Its better to rollback meta first. So in case of failure, the meta would
already be pointing to the previous valid snapshot which can then be opened.
