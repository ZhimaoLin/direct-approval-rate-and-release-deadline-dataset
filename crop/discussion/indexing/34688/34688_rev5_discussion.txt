(4 comments)

Line:38, secondary/docs/design/markdown/projector.md -> Is this HWT synchronization for stability timestamp generation?

Line:24, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Also, it would be good to add that coordinator is responsible for requesting projector for Topic Creation/Restart for Maintenance Stream.

Line:35, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Maintain stability timestamp history, to be provided for local indexer recovery(in case indexer restarts and is doing catchup).

Line:110, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager_design.md -> If it becomes unreachable to ns_server, ns_server may take some decisions e.g. to mark the node dead or choose a new replica. It may be better for this IndexManager to just wait for further instructions from ns_server rather than restarting and doing bootstrap.

Line:38, secondary/docs/design/markdown/projector.md -> yes

Line:24, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Done

Line:35, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Following is my understanding,

during local indexer recovery, it shall not pariticipate in query until it catchesup with maintanence stream. during this time, local indexer shall queue up stability timestamp from Coordinator.

Line:110, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager_design.md -> Done

Line:35, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager.md -> Mutations from catchup queue are applied as per the stability timestamp history(as per Step 10 under 'Local Indexer Recovery' in John's doc). Lets finalize one approach.
