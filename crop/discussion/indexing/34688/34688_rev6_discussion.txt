Line:45, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager_design.md -> VbVector has seqNo as well. For uprSource will this be updated or only vbuuid be stored?

Line:64, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager_design.md -> this line can be removed now as sliceMap, partitionMap are no longer being used.

Line:119, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager_design.md -> I understand this will not be done, right?

Line:274, secondary/docs/design/markdown/index_manager_design.md -> move from one shard to another.
