DESCRIPTION

MB-15125 Indexer: Log Level Changes

Indexer is going to be run at Info log_level in production
and we may ask users to run in Verbose for troubleshooting.
Log levels are now tuned for this purpose:

Info - Capture All State Changes/Stream Management
Verbose - More debugging information with minimal perf impact
Debug - Heavy logging e.g timestamps
