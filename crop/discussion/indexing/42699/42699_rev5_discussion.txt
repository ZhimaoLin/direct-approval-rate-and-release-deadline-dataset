DESCRIPTION

Projector APIs are idempotent.

- Added error codes, ErrorNotMyVbucket, ErrorStreamRequest, ErrorStreamEnd.

Before retrying the API call, coordinator/indexer should check for,
  * bucket sanity.
  * bucketâ€™s vbmap
  * StreamEnd / StreamRequest message from data port server.

Patchset-2:
- Instead of shutting down the bucket, partial streams are kept open
  and caller is encouraged to check with requestTimestamps and
  rollbackTimestamps before making a retry.
- Still, bucket will be shutdown for ErrorResponseTimeout.
