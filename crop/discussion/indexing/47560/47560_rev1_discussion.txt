DESCRIPTION

Adding functional tests: Mutliple buckets, flush bucket, sasl bucket, projector restart.

Also added test code cleanup:

1. Most panics from test are removed and being returned back to test so that "go test" can fail that particular test and further tests can proceed. This will also not generate core dump file from test process on CI builder.
2. The out.txt that is currently getting created after test runs has been removed. That file will no more be created. Please delete any out.txt in your local repo if you ran functional tests.
3. Removed logging response of Couchbase REST API calls (create/delete buckets) making test run logs cleaner. Am logging REST API response only when there is an error.
4. Made LogLevel as Silent so that we donâ€™t get gometa info logs  like:
00:19:40.180180 [Info] PeerPipe.doSend() : Send channel closed.  Terminate.
