DESCRIPTION

indexer: Add support for sync and async stats

ns_server is the only consumer of indexer stats that periodically
calls /stats for populating graphs. For ns_server, it doesn't need
to be exact and hence it can use newly added /stats?async=true.
/stats endpoint will provide synchronously collected indexer stats.
