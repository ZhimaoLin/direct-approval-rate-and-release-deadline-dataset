DESCRIPTION

MB-14280 indexer: Add support for sync and async stats

ns_server is the only consumer of indexer stats that periodically
calls /stats for populating graphs. For ns_server, it doesn't need
to be exact and hence it can use newly added /stats?async=true.
If synchronous stats is required, endpoint can be called with
/stats?async=false.
