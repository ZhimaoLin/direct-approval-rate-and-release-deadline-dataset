DESCRIPTION

MB-23130: Missing trailing key should be encoded with MISSING type

Since watson, encoding happens in projector using
EncodeN1QLValue method which looks for n1ql type
MISSING to encode missing value.

However, the n1ql_evaluate in projector sends missing string
instead of missing value causing MISSING type to never
get encoded. This causes scan for missing trailing key
via GSI client to work incorrectly.

The fix changes missing string to missing value in
n1ql_evaluate.
