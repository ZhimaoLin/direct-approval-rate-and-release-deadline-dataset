DESCRIPTION

indexer: Serialize access to snapshot handle readers

Scan coordinator receives a snapshot handle and it spawns
a scanner goroutine that internally clones the snapshot
handle for scanning. But, clone operation involves access
to the main snapshot handle concurrently if multiple
requests are served using same index snapshot. ForestDB
requires exclusive access to the db handle by consumer
threads.
