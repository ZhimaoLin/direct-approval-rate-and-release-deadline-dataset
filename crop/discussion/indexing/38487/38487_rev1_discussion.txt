Line:136, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> mutation queue for other buckets may still be getting drained but not for this bucket until storage manager is done. New Stability TS is not processed, until the previous one is completed by Storage Manager. I was thinking of putting this bookkeeping with Indexer, but I think Timekeeper would be a better place.
