DESCRIPTION

MB-25404: Implement datastore AlterIndex API

Changes include:
- Implement datastore AlterIndex API (Alter method)
  - Interpret WITH clause, error checking in WITH
  - If action is move, invoke GSI Client MoveIndex
- Change MoveIndex API to async, remove timeout from meta_client
  for MoveIndex

AlterIndex is implemented by secondaryIndex2. It works in mixed mode
as MoveIndex is existing API from spock. Once indexer version
upgrade is added, the implementation can be moved to secondaryIndex3
