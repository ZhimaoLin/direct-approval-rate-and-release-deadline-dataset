DESCRIPTION

indexer: Use system config to obtain necessary constants

Cleaned up indexer by removing all hardcoded configurable
values such as ports, num vbuckets, etc. Indexer will now
use only config values passed through system config with
keys having prefix `indexer.`.

Line:307, secondary/common/config.go -> Coordinator is currently using 9102 to listen to DDL requests. We  will ultimately move adminport from indexer to coordinator, but till that integration is done, this conflict needs to be resolved.

Line:307, secondary/common/config.go -> sounds good. or if you don't want to disturb you ns_server change, you can change INDEX_DDL_HTTP_ADDR under manager/constant.go. There is no traffic going there right now.
