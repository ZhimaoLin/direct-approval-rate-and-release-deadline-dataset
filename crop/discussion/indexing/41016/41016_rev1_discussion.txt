DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-214 Copy Maps Between Components

Maps need to be copied when exchanged between components/functions.

As per golang documentation:
Like slices, maps hold references to an underlying data structure.
If you pass a map to a function that changes the contents of the map,
the changes will be visible in the caller.
