DESCRIPTION

Fix race between slice writer commit and insert

Before doing insert its not sufficient to check if the command
channel is empty. The last command might still be getting processed.
Wait till the workers have finished processing all commands, before commit.

Patchset:
More robust channel based mechanism. Previous logic had
race conditions.
