DESCRIPTION

MB-17767 Abort In Progress Flush In Recovery For Initial Build

For initial build, there is an optimization due to which storage
manager doesn't wait for persistence to complete before returning
to timekeeper. This can be a problem during rollback as timekeeper
doesn't know if the persistence is in progress. During recovery,
it is better to abort any in progress flush explicitly, to avoid this
situation.
