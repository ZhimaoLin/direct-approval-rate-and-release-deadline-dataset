Line:678, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> let say b.indexers have changed by another thread after line 670.   Then even if newmeta has the highest version, wouldn't CompareAndSwapPointer would fail?

Line:678, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> In that case, done will be false and the loop will repeat.
- reload the latest indexers
- create a newmeta
- check if newmeta.version > currmeta.version (will be true in this case)
- CompareAndSwap
- done will be true
- loop exits.
