If you cherry-pick this change on unstable, build is failing. I think, you missed to add some files ?

Line:351, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> It is better to use a function name GetArrayIndexEntries()

Line:357, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> I think it would be good to do one iteration to avoid passing json raw key to the slice writer. Instead, have a function that returns all encoded keys from the array directly from "entry" (which is encoded version of all items)

I tried building with latest unstable. Works fine for me.

Line:36, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> This is unused function. Will be removed.
