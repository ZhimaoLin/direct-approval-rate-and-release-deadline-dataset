DESCRIPTION

Automatic shutdown of stale feeds.

configuration param added that periodically checks for stale feeds.
If watchInterval is set to say 5 minutes, the feed will be
marked as stale and on the second iteration if the feed is still
stale, then feed is shutdown. This means a feed can remain stale
for 5-10 minutes.

- renamed ErrorClosed message value to "genServer.Closed".
- panics in vbucket-routines will propagate to kvadata, leading
  to STREAM_END on all vbuckets on that project/feed.
  hopefully this makes recover more resilient.
