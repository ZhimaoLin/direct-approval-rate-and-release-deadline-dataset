DESCRIPTION

Storage Manager needs to account for StreamId

Storage Manager should account for streamId and bucket while creating
snapshot and rollback. If a bucket in one stream is flushed and needs
a snapshot, there may be indexes in the same bucket on a different stream
while might still be writing to database.
