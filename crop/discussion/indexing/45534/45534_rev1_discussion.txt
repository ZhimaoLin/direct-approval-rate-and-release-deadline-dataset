DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-225: Load balancing.

CBIDXT-335: Identify equivalent index.
A draft implementation, to identify replica indexes based on a comparator
function (ref equivalentIndex()) that is under least load.
Load is calculated by accumulating a running average of time taken to
execute a scan-call (like Lookup(), Range(), Count() etc...)
