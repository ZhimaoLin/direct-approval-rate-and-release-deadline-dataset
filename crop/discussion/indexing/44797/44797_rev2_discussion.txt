  are integrated.

  * under metadata-provider Topology information is obtained via
    IndexMetaData structure, but specific fields are yet to be clarifiied.

    Refresh() call.

updated querycmd to include sanity checks.

Open-items:
  * push-notification for index meta-data changes to N1QL to
    be exposed to query-engine.
  * during bootstrap, how should N1QL client read topology
    information when reading it from me metadata-provider.
