DESCRIPTION

MB-20753 Set num_keeping_headers to one more than num_rollbacks

Right now num_keeping_headers is set to be same as num_rollbacks.
What this could mean is that forestdb may not return any valid commit header
for compaction(beyond the 5 rollback points) as it has started reusing the stale blocks.
Once this happens, Indexer cannot initiate compaction.

With this change, we'll keep one extra header than num_rollbacks so
compaction can always be initiated.
