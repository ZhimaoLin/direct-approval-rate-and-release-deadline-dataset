DESCRIPTION

MB-15424 cluster_info: Retry if bucket list goes out of sync

During cluster_info initialization of bucket metadata, first bucket
list is fetched and separate http requests are made to collect bucket
specific metadata. But, during the window between bucket list is collected
and bucket specific request is made, bucket can get deleted. In such
cases, bucket metadata collection should abort and restart.

Also added default retries for cluster_info initialization to prevent
crashes due to transient errors.
