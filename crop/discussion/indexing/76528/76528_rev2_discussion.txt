DESCRIPTION

MB-23265 indexer: make stream request to projectors owning vbuckets

instead to making stream request to all projectors, send the request
to only those projectors which have active vbuckets. Otherwise once all
vbuckets have moved out of a node in rebalance-out, projector will keep
sending errors, leading to infinite retry of stream request.

This used to work fine when indexer had nothing to do during rebalance.
