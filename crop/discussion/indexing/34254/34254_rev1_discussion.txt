Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Few comments inline. Also it needs to be rebased on the latest master.

Line:6, secondary/docs/design/overview.md -> Making "c" capital in couchbase will be helpful.

Line:7, secondary/docs/design/overview.md -> backed by main-memory or persistent-storage?

Line:8, secondary/docs/design/overview.md -> "are new Couchbase" -> "are new to Couchbase"

I see its already on top of latest master. 

For Terminology, a separate section can also be kept to make it more prominent?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Original seems fine. (I know you're new to Jasmin Rangel, so want to point out that it takes time/effort for people to review which is quite limited. So it's best to focus on generating content/value; we can come to editorial elements later)

Patch Set 1:

1. I did not expect a thorough review. Normally I do a thorough review after all relevant content is crammed into the document. Guess I should have intimated this earlier.

2. I removed the terminology section because, it only had a hyper link to another document. To make it prominent I included the link on the first paragraph as opposed to keeping it in the tail end.

3. I guess by and large people don't bother about 80 column width, but my mind/fingers are too much accustomed to 80 column width and will be modifying the docs that I touch to fit into that. Function signatures can extend beyond 80 column width though.
