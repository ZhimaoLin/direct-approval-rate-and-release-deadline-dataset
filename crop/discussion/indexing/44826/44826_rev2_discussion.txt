DESCRIPTION

cluster_info: Replace with client connect hostname for current node address

ns_server identifies the current node based on the cluster node url used.
For current node, ns_server returns hostname metadata empty. The remote
clients will not be able to connect using nil hostname and port. Fixed
cluster_info to parse hostname from connect url and add that hostname
to addresses returned by cluster_info APIs.
