DESCRIPTION

MB-19350 Handle lastSnapshotMarker usage better for memcached restart

Use lastSnapMarker for snapshot alignment only if it is from the same branch(vbuuid matches)
and HWT is already past the snapEnd of lastSnap. If memcached gets restarted, the snapshots
may not be sequential anymore.
