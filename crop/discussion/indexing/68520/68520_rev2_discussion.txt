DESCRIPTION

MB-21038 client/server: Implement HELO protocol for identifying server version

In CB 4.0, GSI client used to send session consistency timestamp. CB 4.5 moved
session consistency timestamp computation to indexer server. If the new client
sends session consistency scan request to the 4.0 server, the server expects
a timestamp and the indexer crashes.

The change adds server version detection in 4.6 GSI client. This enables the
client to send session consistency timestamp to the old server.

Line:64, secondary/queryport/client/scan_client.go -> If it cannot obtain the server version, probably it cannot initialize the client. So. we could do a limited retry before the crash.
