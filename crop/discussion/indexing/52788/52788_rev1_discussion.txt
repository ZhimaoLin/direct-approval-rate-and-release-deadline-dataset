DESCRIPTION

MB-15484 Set stream reader filter from restartTs

During restart of indexer or recovery(restartVbuckets),
dcp can resend some mutations without asking to rollback.
These mutations need to be ignored as these have already
been processed. Use the same filter being used by timekeeper
in the stream reader as well.
