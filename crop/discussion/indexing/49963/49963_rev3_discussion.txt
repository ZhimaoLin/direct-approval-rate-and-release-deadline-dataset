DESCRIPTION

MB-100 indexer: Add zero items snapshot for newly created index

For a newly added index, a snapshot may not be created yet,
in that case provide a valid snapshot object having 0 items.
This is just a code cleanup to ensure that no special handling
is required to treat indexes with no snapshot.
