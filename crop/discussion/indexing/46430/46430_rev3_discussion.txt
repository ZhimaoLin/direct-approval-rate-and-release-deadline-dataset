DESCRIPTION

control projector log-level via "/settings" endpoint.

Additionally use sync/atomic instead of sync.RWMutex to update log-level.
This forces us to used logLevel type as int32 (instead of int).
Hence had to update few more files,
      indexer/main/main.go
      manager/client/metadata_provider.go
      manager/manager.go
