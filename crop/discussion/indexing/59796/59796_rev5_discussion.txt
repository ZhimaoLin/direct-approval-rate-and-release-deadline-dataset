Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

Minor comments inline

Line:55, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Better to use hex for 128 (more readable)

Line:210, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Minor code duplication tip: You could move this outside of ifCountEncoded()

 if buf, err = jsonEncoder.Decode(encoded, buf); err != nil {

Also == true not required for here (idiomatic)

Line:393, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> This function seems to be unused. Please remove this function if it is dead code.
