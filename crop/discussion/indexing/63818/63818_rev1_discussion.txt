DESCRIPTION

MB-19551 memdb/skiplist: Fix a bug in insert algorithm

Insert of a node is performed in two steps:
1. Update level-0 link (node is now part of the skiplist)
2. Update all higher level links

When high level link update is perfomed using dcas, dcas operation
may fail. Then, operation needs to be repeated by refreshing path buffer.
During retry we only retry dcas operation. But, the node.next[i] will still
point to the old next for which dcas has failed. We should repeat the update
of node.next also as part of the retry operation.

This bug violates safety rules for SMR and ends up crash.
