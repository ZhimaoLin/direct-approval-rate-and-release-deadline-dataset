Line:35, secondary/manager/manager.go -> How do we specify the leader here? Isn't that going to be elected from all the coordinators.

Line:515, secondary/manager/coordinator.go -> From our earlier discussion, this else clause was required for observe to happen on follower. Is that not true?

Line:35, secondary/manager/manager.go -> That will be part of ns-server integration.  We need ns-server to provide the list of gometa nodes.  From there, we can do an election to find out the leader.  The watcher supports finding the leader through election.   But the time being, assume we know the leader (through configuration) and we have a single gometa node.

Line:515, secondary/manager/coordinator.go -> Correct.  In V1, one index goes to one indexer node.  So only that indexer node would need to observe if the index defn has arrived to the indexer node.   This will be added later.
