DESCRIPTION

MB-14965 Fix deadlock between indexer bootstrap and mutation manager

During the bootstrap, indexer mainloop tries to post a message on
mutation manager's command channel. At the same time mutation mananger
is trying to post message to the indexer message channel. It ends up
in a deadlock. Then indexer message channel dequeue go routine is
started by idx.run(). But, idx.run() is executed only after bootstrap.
