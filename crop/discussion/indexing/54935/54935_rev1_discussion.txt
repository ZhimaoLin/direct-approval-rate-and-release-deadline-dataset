DESCRIPTION

MB-16194 memdb Reuse the main index_entry for backindex item

Instead of duplicating docid and secondary key bytes in
items structures of back index and main index, use a
common item structure and manipulate them differently
in back index and main index using special comparators.

This will significantly reduce memory required for maintaining
back index.
