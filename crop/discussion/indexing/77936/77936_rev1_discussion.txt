Line:136, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> buf is a *[]byte. Can can move this repeated allocation blocks into projectKeys and

Line:1475, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> *buf is a pointer to []byte. This redundant code block for resize can be completely avoided. You can do the resize logic inside projectLeadingKey()
