DESCRIPTION

MB-14830 TS Generation Changes

Instead of trying to generate snap aligned TS, its ok to
generate non-snap aligned ones as we now commit at non-snap
aligned ones as well. And opportunistically update TS to snap-aligned
if mutations till snapEnd have been received for incremental stream.
