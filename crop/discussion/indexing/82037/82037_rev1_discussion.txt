DESCRIPTION

MB-25580 plasma: Fix backIndex update operation for array index

Plasma does not support Upsert semantics. To implement upsert,
a delete+insert should be used.

Since we used insert API to perform upserts, when a delete is performed
it removes only the most recent mutation. Hence the backIndex will have
an older entry causing incorrectness.
