DESCRIPTION

MB-19794 Handle flush abort for prepareRecovery state

The newly added circuit-breaker to abort a flush can trigger
when the stream recovery has already started(PREPARE_RECOVERY).
In such a case, Timekeeper needs to generate PREPARE_RECOVERY message
rather than a INIT_PREPARE_RECOVERY message.
