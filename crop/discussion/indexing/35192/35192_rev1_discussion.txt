Line:16, secondary/common/mutation.go -> Done

Line:56, secondary/common/mutation.go -> Protobuf generated file mutation.pb.go, has the following signature.

type Mutation struct {
    ...
    Keys             [][]byte `protobuf:"bytes,8,rep,name=keys" json:"keys,omitempty"`
    ...
}

mp.Keys and m.Keys are linear array of secondary-keys one for each index defined on the bucket.
