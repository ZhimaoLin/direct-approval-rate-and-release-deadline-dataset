DESCRIPTION

storage_manager: Notify waiters only if they belong to update bucket

The storage manager was updating timestamps for all indexes belonging
to the current indexer when any of the buckets have a new timestamp for
snapshot creation. This results in updating index-timestamp
with with wrong ts for which no snapshot exist.

Fixed storage manager to only update indexes belonging to the currently
processed bucket.
