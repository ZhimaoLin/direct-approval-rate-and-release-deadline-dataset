giving +1, just think about IndexInfo encapsulation. If we can get rid of it and directly add the fields into parent message, that might be better.

Line:81, secondary/protobuf/query.proto -> Do we need another level of encapsulation ? can `name` be changed to `indexName` and have both the fields directly as part of the parent message ?

Line:81, secondary/protobuf/query.proto -> I thought that we may need to add some additional fields in the future like index defnId or something. Having a separate info structure makes it easy to update it.

I will index name and bucket as part of parent structures itself for now.
