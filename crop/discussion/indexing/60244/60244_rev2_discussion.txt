DESCRIPTION

MB-18114: n1ql-client statistics.

Every scan request goes through following steps, note that each request to
server can receive one or more responses where each response is batch of
entries.

A - request is processed by client.
B - first response received by client.
B' - first batch of entries in the response is posted to n1ql application.
C - second batch of entries received by client.
C' - second batch of entries in the response is posted to n1ql application.
D - last batch of entries received by client.
D' - last batch of entries in the response is posted to n1ql application.
E - client API call returns back to n1ql application.

scan_time : E-A time taken for the scan API to complete.
prime_time : B-A time taken for the first response from server.
throttle_time : C-B' + D-C' + E-D', if n1ql i/p channel is not drained.
blocked_time : cumulative time that client was blocked on n1ql i/p channel

scan_time is accumulated as gsi_scan_duration
prime_time is accumlated as gsi_prime_duration
throttle_time is accumlated as gsi_throttle_duration
blocked_time is accumlated as gsi_blocked_duration

* client here is n1ql-client and server being indexer node.
* these durations are cumulative across all connections for a single
  n1ql-client.
