DESCRIPTION

Moved error definitions to projector/client package.

error strings where defined by projector/{feed.go,projector.go} and
to make use of those strings other packages had to import projector/
to avoid circular dependancy these definitions are moved to
projector/client package.

fixed go-formating.

Line:648, secondary/manager/stream_admin.go -> FYI: Direct Error comparison might have problem if you send an error message via protobuf, reconvert to Error and try to compare it. Is that the reason why we have used string comparison?
