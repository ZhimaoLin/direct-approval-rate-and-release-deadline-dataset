Patch Set 3:

(3 comments)

Line:1042, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> We should make maxVbLen config default to 0 or something like that. So we can detect when user has explicitly set this setting, and turn off our logic.

Line:1047, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> We should have a default value for this range as well.

Line:1049, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> If maxVbLen is set, it should unconditionally take effect.
