DESCRIPTION

indexer: Dynamic settings for snapshot intervals

indexer uses sync count internally to decide when
inmemory snapshots or persisted snapshots should be
generated. External settings available to users
exposes snapshot intervals rather than sync counts.

Snapshot interval parameters are converted in terms
of sync count for internal consumption.

Line:361, secondary/common/config.go -> I think its better to include the number of vbuckets i.e. 1024 in the calculations in stream_state.go like before. It makes it easier to users to specify 200ms which is the exact TS generation interval they want. And also makes it easier for dev/qe to vary the number of vbuckets in the system without making any other changes. 
And if we decide to change indexer logic to be based on timer rather than sync message(which won't then depend on vbuckets), there is no external change.
