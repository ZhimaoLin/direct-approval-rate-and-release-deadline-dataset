DESCRIPTION

indexer: Dynamic settings for snapshot intervals

indexer uses sync count internally to decide when
inmemory snapshots or persisted snapshots should be
generated. External settings available to users
exposes snapshot intervals rather than sync counts.

Snapshot interval parameters are converted in terms
of sync count for internal consumption.
