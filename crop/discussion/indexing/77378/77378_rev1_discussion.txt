Line:134, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> If for a composite index idx(a,b,c), entryKeys is [0,1,2], then how the projection will work? Will the additional check here not cause the projection to be skipped?

Line:134, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> Yes Deep. That is the intent of adding the new check. If composite index(a,b,c) gets entryKeys[0,1,2], it means, there is no need to do explicit projection. So all keys will anyway be returned to client. So entryKeys [0,1,2] is equivalent to projection being nil (ie project all).

Line:1209, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> It would be better to validate before setting all the parameters.

Thanks. I have moved it before fillRanges.
