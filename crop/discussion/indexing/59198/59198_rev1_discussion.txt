DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-362 Clear the stream repair lock when aborting repair

Timekeeper will abort ongoing repairs in paused state. Need to
make sure the repair lock is also cleared.

This case can happen if a repair is in progress in Paused state,
and the condition to unpause is met. Right now such a case won't work.

Also, abort only in case repair is going to retry. Other control
messages can propagate to main indexer loop.
