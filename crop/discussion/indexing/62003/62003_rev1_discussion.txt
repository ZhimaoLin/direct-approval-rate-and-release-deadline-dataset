DESCRIPTION

MB-18837: Disable BreakPAD completely for forestdb

This is a pre-req for the forestdb BreakPad invocation.
Without disabling from indexing, there will be symbol
conflicts since forestdb now has its own breakpad libraries
when compiled as part of couchbase server.
Hence removing unused libraries.
