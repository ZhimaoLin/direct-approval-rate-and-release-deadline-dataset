DESCRIPTION

MB100: add multiple DCP connections for projector.

* Number of connections configurable as "projector.dcp.numConnections".

* vbuckets will be distributed evently for each connection.
* If one of the connection is closed by ep-engine, STREAM_END will be
  sent only for vbuckets mapped to that connection.
* subsequent vbucket requests from downstream will be distributed to
  remaining connections.
* If rebalanced-vbuckets fall onto the same connection, then automatic
  re-distribution does not happen.
