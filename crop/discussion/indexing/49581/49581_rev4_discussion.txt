DESCRIPTION

MB-14377: hybrid algorithm to pick optimal index for scan.

- client will detect equivalent index and load-balance based on the
  elapsed time on indexer node.
- in case, of failures, the load-balancing logic will fall back to
  round-robin mode so that the failed node doesn't get picked all the
  time.

in case of indexer node failures, the indexer list on the client side
will eventually be updated when it receives the notification from
ns_server.
