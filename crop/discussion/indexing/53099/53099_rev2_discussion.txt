DESCRIPTION

MB-15589 Reduce generating non-snap aligned Ts

Lot of TS get non-snap aligned during incremental build due to the
next snap marker arriving while the mutations are yet to come. If
KV ops/sec is not high enough, these TS never get queued up and don't
have a chance for snap alignment adjustment.

Timekeeper will now store the last snapshot marker seen along with
the current one and adjust the TS snap-aligned when TS is generated
if seqno is from last snap marker.
