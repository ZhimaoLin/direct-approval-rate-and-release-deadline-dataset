DESCRIPTION

MB-13546 Add separate node services config notifier

Moved streaming node services based notification mechanism from
cluster info to a service_notifer implementation.

This implementation uses singleton design so that single connection
per clusterUrl is used for node services notifications. Node services
change notifier singleton container keeps track of many clients requesting
same cluster url and notifies all of them whenever cluster services config
is changed.
