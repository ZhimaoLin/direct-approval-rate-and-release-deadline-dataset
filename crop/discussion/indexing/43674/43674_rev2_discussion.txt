Patch Set 2:

Its your choice. I guess for grep you could use "github.com" where you would use "import", unless you also want to grep for  golang pkgs. Just that the code styles would get different and there are common files which multiple people work on. So upto you.

Patch Set 2:

Post Jan when we decide to follow a single convention, I will fall in line. I have not updated common files and won't do so in future.

I am still cat on the wall on this convention.
