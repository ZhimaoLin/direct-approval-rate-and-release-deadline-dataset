Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Looks good. I have defined cluster_client.go for cbq_bridge under queryport/, it has some overlap of definitions with cbq_bridge_defs.go.  After merging these changes we will have to do a second iteration of integrating queryport/cluster_client.go with cbq_bridge server.
