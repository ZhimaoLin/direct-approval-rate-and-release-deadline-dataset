Few comments in slice implementations

Line:41, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Please remove this

Line:389, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> I would prefer getting rid of this method to optimize for avoiding delete + insert incase an item is already skipped. We want our usual insert path work better.

Line:418, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> This is going to cause additional back index lookup, which is expensive and may cause perf regression.
We shouldn't optimize for improving skip performance!

Line:480, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> It is preferred to treat old entries as yet another old item.

if !isOldSkipped {
oldEntriesBytes = list.Keys()
}

By default value of oldEntriesBytes is nil

Line:511, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> tip: accepting isOldSkipped as arg would be more preferred over if

Line:547, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> This should happen as yet another old key. We should fix it as part of bug fix on collation as we discussed.

Line:529, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> You can move these TX wrappers to the top instead of calling within getOldEntry(). Calling multiple TX wrappers is expensive.
