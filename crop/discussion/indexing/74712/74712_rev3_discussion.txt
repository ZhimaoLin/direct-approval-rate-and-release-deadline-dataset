DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-412: Track unindexable skipped index entries

- Index a skipped entry when an item is unindexable
  (in case of error ex: size limit exceeded)
- Track number of skipped entries with skippedCount available
  on snapshot as well as index stat
- Provide GSI client API for count of skipped items as well
  as scan for skipped entries

Patch Set 3:

(21 comments)

Line:82, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> Why are we using 90? ?

Line:174, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> return code[0] == TypeArray && code[1] == TypeSkipped

Line:376, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Is this used?

Line:420, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Unused code. Please remove it

Line:449, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> It seems that this method is required. If you carefully tweak existing code, you may get it done with few lines of code.

Line:492, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Comment seems unnecessary

Line:523, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Generally, these changes seems to optimize for making skip path faster and over readability. It is okay to make skip path slower, but I would prefer readability over optimizing skip path.

Line:529, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Why deleteSecArrayIndex is not handling skip similar to insertSecIndex ?

Line:548, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> This isOldSkipped everywhere is making code unreadable.
Instead, we should have deleteSecArrayIndex handle it.
Try to remove unnecessary if cases

Line:558, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Instead of above isOldSkipped check, let oldkey set to nil by getOldKey() method. Then you don't need above check

Line:563, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Let delete handle it

Line:564, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Instead of these two functions everywhere, just call mdb.skip, it should delete and skip.

Line:632, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Same comment as above

Line:685, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Why is this special case required?
As part of deleteSecArrayIndex, it can check and increment the count appropriately.

Line:746, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> if ok = isEntrySkipped(backEntry); ok {
mdb.unskip(docid, workerId)
}

The stats counts the number of ops processed.

Line:1652, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> All we need to scan skipped items is low key as skipminValue and call Iterate right ?

Line:1654, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> This is too much of duplicate code. Please reuse the existing functions by adding additional parameters.

Line:1770, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Please avoid duplicating code

Line:34, secondary/protobuf/query/query.proto -> Fix indentation

Line:86, secondary/protobuf/query/query.proto -> Fix indentation

Line:172, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> Do we need a AllSkipped() new method ?
Would it simplify the implementation if Range() API can be used with appropriate low,high keys ?

Patch Set 3:

Just reviewed plasma_slice.go - It appears to me that there is too much code duplication. I have added my observations as comments. Probably you could go through it and see we could cleanup memdb and forestdb slice.

Changes in the other components seems okay for me

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:82, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> This should be the last in collation sequence and to allow more types to be added later in betwen.

Line:376, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> I had this when my earlier patch had SkipItem on Slice. Its not needed now. Will remove

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:529, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> delete does unskipping. not skipping. 
In unskip, the counter is decremented.
In skip, a skipped entry is added and counter is incremented.

Line:1654, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> I thought of that but I thought code could be confusing. Will try adding params

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:172, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> Range will not work as Range discards skipped items where as here want to scan only for skipped items
