DESCRIPTION

MB-100: Make all binaries similar in link options

We assume during coding that all GSI binaries can call all common GSI
modules, so reflect this in linkmode. Also, I know no good reason to
use one linkmode for indexer but not others on Windows (and cbindexplan
may even be broken because of this), so remove that difference.
