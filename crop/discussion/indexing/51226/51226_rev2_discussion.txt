DESCRIPTION

MB-15051 Treat nil timestamp as snapshot aligned

nil timestamp can happen only when there is no previously flushed
timestamp available. ie, bucket is empty. Since nil timestamp was
considered as non-aligned, index build was unable to merge with
maintenance stream and build was stuck forever.
