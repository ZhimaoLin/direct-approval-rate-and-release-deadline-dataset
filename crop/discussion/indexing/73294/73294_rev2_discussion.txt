DESCRIPTION

plasma: Fix a bug in primary index delete operation

Plasma delete operations are not ideompotent. If a delete is issued
for a item which does not exist, it will lead to data corruption.
The DCP may send DELETE mutation for an item which was never indexed
as a result of DCP snapshot deduplication.
