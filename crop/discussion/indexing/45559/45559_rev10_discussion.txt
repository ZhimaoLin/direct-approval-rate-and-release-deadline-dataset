DESCRIPTION

indexer: Use metaKV based settings storage and propagation

MetaKV will take care of storing and replicating indexer settings
json document with /indexer/settings resource uri. The 2i indexer
can listen to the json document change notification and perform
dynamic settings updates.

Settings update can be posted to any index node in the cluster
and settings update will be broadcasted to all indexers internally.
