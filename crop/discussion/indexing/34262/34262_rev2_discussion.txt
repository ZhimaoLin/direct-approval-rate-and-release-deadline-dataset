Line:48, secondary/docs/design/markdown/terminology.md -> and it also serves query? Is there any difference in "local-indexer" and "Participant Nodes" or are these synonymous?

Line:105, secondary/docs/design/markdown/terminology.md -> Are Mutation Queue/Catchup Queue per vbucket? My understanding was these are per node. Lets finalize this. I'll need to update the system diagram accordingly.

Line:48, secondary/docs/design/markdown/terminology.md -> My understanding is that,
- any node that participates in building an index is local-indexer.
- participant nodes is a subset of all local-indexer nodes that participates for a given activity. For instance, timestamps are target to a subset of nodes that manages a particular index DDL, query can target a subset of nodes that contains relevant index-data etc ...

Line:105, secondary/docs/design/markdown/terminology.md -> It is per node, per bucket. But internally it can be organized as per node, per bucket, per vbucket or using other data structure.
