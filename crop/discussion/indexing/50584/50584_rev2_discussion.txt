DESCRIPTION

MB-14786: delete index from local cache.

also, the code is cleaned up to make it consistent.

- b.adminports is the source of truth for all indexer nodes.
- b.topology, b.replicas shall be consistent with b.adminports and are
  recomputed during a Refresh() call, and b.loads will be cleared for
  an index that is deleted or down.
- updateIndexerList() should alway be followed with a call to Refresh().
- there is an assumption that metadata-provider won't include index metadata,
  returned from ListIndex() call, for deleted index / indexes part of offline
  indexer node.
