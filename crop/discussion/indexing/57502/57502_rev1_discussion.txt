DESCRIPTION

MB-16194 memdb: Partition backindex to one per writer

Backindex is only used for lookups during the mainindex update. Also, it uses
docid as the key. Hence, naturally they are hash paritioned using multiple
writers in the memdb slice.

This change would reduce contentions on the backindex during high mutation
rate.
