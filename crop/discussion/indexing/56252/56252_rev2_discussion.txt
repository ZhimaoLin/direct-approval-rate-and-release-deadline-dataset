DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-368 queryport: Refactor server for connection scalability

select{} on channels becomes a major source of cpu eatup with large
number of connections and causes scan throughput to drop with connections
more than 200. Refactored server connection handling methods to avoid
using selects. Observed that throughput does not degrade anymore after
this change.
