DESCRIPTION

MB-14637 Implement error handling for pipeline library

Any unit within a pipeline can incur runtime error
and entire pipeline needs to be terminated gracefully.
If Source or Filter object has occurred an error,
they need to invoke CloseWithError(error) method and
return Routine() with error. Sink unit should invoke
CloseRead() and return Routine() with error.

A pipeline can be shutdown gracefully by an external
party by invoking source.Shutdown(error). This error
will be propagated till from Source till the end Sink
unit.
