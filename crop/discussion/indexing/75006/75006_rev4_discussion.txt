Patch Set 4:

(2 comments)

Line:767, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> In case of a composite index on 3 fields e.g. index1(a int, b int, c int), lets say there's a scan on a=1 and c=2. protoScan will have the middle filter empty. How will this code behave in that case?

Line:864, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> inclusion needs to be flipped if desc?

Patch Set 4:

Line:767, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> as far as I know, there is no way to specify equals values with middle as not specified. List if equal values is an array if interface. So if specified, it will be nil which means JSON NULL.

Line:864, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Yes. This would be flipping logic:
incl 0 => incl 0
incl 1 => incl 2
incl2 => incl 1
incl 3 => incl 3
Will make that change. Missed out the if condition to optimize only if desc is false. But its better to make optimization by flipping incl
