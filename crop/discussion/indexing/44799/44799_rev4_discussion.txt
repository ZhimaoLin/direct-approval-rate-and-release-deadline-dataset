DESCRIPTION

cluster_info: Implement nodeServices membership notification

Added a new blocking API ci.WaitAndUpdateServices() to provide
notification upon nodeservices membership change.

Consumer needs to initialize cluster_info and call Fetch() method
as part of initialization. Afterwards, consumer can implement a
watcher loop as follows:
    for {
        err := ci.WaitAndUpdateServices()
        if err != nil {
            // do something
            break
        }
        nodes := ci.GetNodesByServiceType("indexAdmin")
        for _, n := range nodes {
        addr := ci.GetServiceAddress(n, "indexAdmin")
        // Consumer's internal update helper
        Update_Consumer_Address(addr)
    }

Calling WaitAndUpdateServices() will only update nodeServices related
data structures. For updating full cluster info cache, ci.Fetch() needs to
be called.
