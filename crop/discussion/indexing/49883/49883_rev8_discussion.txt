DESCRIPTION

MB-14357 : rebalance 2 kv nodes hangs due to race condition of StreamBegin

Each <bucket,vb> has a owner (projector).  The ownership is managed by
2 transport level operations: (1) StreamBegin to claim ownership
(2) StreamEnd to relinguish ownership.   During rebalancing, vb
ownership changes from projector to projector.  In addition,
there is no guarantee that StreamBegin and StreamEnd will arrive
in particular order.    In other words, it is possible that
two projectors may claim ownership on a vb.   To support that,
indexer will maintain reference count on vb ownership.  From
indexer point of view, a vb has owner (vb status == VBS_STREAM_BEGIN)
if reference count > 0.   A vb has no owner (vb stauts == VBS_STREAM_END)
if reference count == 0.  If vb has no owner, then it is necessary
to repair the stream.
