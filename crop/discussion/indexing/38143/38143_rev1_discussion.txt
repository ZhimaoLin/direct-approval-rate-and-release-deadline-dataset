Line:14, secondary/indexer/forestdb_iterator.go -> Is there a reason why these should not put in couchbaselabs/goforestdb?

Line:23, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Possibility of both back and main index stored on the same forestdb instance?

Line:14, secondary/indexer/forestdb_iterator.go -> goforestdb is currently a one-to-one binding for what the c interface for forestdb provides.This iterator is a wrapper to provide the same iterator features as leveldb does. This helps to keep the code above it to remain the same. Though I think this is quite generic and can be part of goforestdb. Will check with Marty once.

Line:23, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> right now forestdb doesn't allow it but whenever that feature is supported, we should be able to add that as this detail is abstracted by the Slice interface.
