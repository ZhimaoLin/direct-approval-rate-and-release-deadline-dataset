Line:65, secondary/protobuf/query.proto -> When I defined this message I was not sure about N1QL requirement. Now it seems that range and equal are mutually exclusive fields in this message. If that is case can we change the line to

optional Range range = 1;

Line:66, secondary/protobuf/query.proto -> I remember you mentioning that muti-get might not be feasible with query. Is so, would you want to change the line to

optional bytes equal = 2;

Line:93, secondary/queryport/client_test.go -> Can you add a TODO at the top of this file, mentioning that we are yet to add test cases for lookup-queries (using `equal` parameters)

Line:72, secondary/queryport/client.go -> I am not sure whether `equal` parameter make sense for Statistics API. May be you can add a TODO calling for a future validation on this requirement.

Line:66, secondary/protobuf/query.proto -> I thought about multiple equal keys again, and I found it should be okay to support it. Its upto the query whether they want to use it or not.
