Line:105, secondary/adminport/admin_httpd.go -> Should s.shutdown be defer so the listener will be closed no matter what?

Line:134, secondary/adminport/admin_httpd.go -> Do you mean "go func()" or "defer func()" here?  I thought recover() should be called in a defer method in order to stop panic-ing.
