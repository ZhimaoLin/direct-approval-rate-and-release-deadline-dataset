Patch Set 1:

Mart -- we saw some strange hangs where one of the threads was in the logging callback. So removing it in a toy build to see if this was a problem or a red-herring. Will keep you updated, Bastian is trying out this toy build.

Patch Set 1:

Steve just brought this up as well.  My own opinion is that there is more to it than this.  We do this quite a lot with RocksDB where our merge operator is written in Go, and to my knowledge, exclusively called by threads created in C that Go has no knowledge of.

Prior to 1.5.1 this would occasionally panic (but not hang), this panic was fixed in 1.5.1
