DESCRIPTION

protobuf: messages handled by admin port.

* common.proto, ddl.proto, index.proto files are not specific to any component
  and do not define request or response messages.
* coordinator.proto, rollback.proto defines requests handled by Coordinator's
  admin port.
* indexer.proto defines requests handled by Indexer's admin port.
* projector.proto defines request handled by Projector's admin port.

  * IndexBackfill is changed to IndexLoading, the stream is referred as
    "index initial load" stream
