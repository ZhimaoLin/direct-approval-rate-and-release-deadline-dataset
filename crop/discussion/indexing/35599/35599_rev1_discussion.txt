Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

A few minor comments.

Line:20, secondary/protobuf/index.proto -> Perhaps call it IndexLoading.

Line:24, secondary/protobuf/index.proto -> How about IndexActive?   Incremental Update is just one of the function when the index is active.   Being able to query is another function for active index.  So calling maintenance a state does not reflect the full function when an index is active.
