Line:1377, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Please use fdb.statFd for this purpose. And lock it before using. You can see the call to fdb.statFd.EstimateSpaceUsed() as example.

Line:613, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> I think we can just say IsEnabled(logging.timing) then dump the stats. Debug will automatically get covered. What do you think?
