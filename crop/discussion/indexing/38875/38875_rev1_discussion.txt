DESCRIPTION

Semantics defined for adding/updating/deleting engines.

When a new feed (aka topic) is requested to projector, full set of engines,
that are subscribed to the topic, must be provided.

Subsequently,
- use `AddEngines` to add new set of engines, providing only a subset of
  engines that are newly subscribed to the topic.
- use `UpdateEngines` to do a full update on the current set of engines, by
  providing full set of engines that need to be subscribed to the topic.
- use `DeleteEngines` to delete a subset of engines from current set, by
  providing only those engines as part of the request.
