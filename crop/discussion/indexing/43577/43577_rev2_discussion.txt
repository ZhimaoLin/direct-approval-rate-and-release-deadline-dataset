DESCRIPTION

Process Stream Messages for Known Buckets Only

Add bookkeeping to Timekeeper to process stream messages for
known buckets. If the index count of a bucket goes to zero, any
subsequent stream message for that bucket will not be processed.

Line:1143, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Currently we don't want to update the maps when a maintenance stream is initiated, but only when mutations arrive and only if any indexes are present for the bucket, we will update the map inside the timekeeper. is that correct ?

Line:1143, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> We still need to have the maps updated before starting maint stream so it can process the incoming messages. But yes the bucket level inits will happen only when messages related to that bucket come. When the last index of a bucket gets dropped, that bucket is cleaned from the maps and no further processing of messages happen. This particular piece of code was handling bookkeeping after initial build of index got done. This has now been moved to timekeeper itself.
