DESCRIPTION

MB-19164: Generate Build Completion TS only once for stream/bucket

if a HWT > buildTS for inital build, timekeeper will mark snapshot
as persistent snapshot.   But if ts_queue piled up, it could take
time for the index to convert from initial build to active.  Therefore,
timekeeper could generate a lot of persistent snapshot.   This fix is
to generate a build completion timestamp only once, independent on
how long index converges from initial state to active state.
