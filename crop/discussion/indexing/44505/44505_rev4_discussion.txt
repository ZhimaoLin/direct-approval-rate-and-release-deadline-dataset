DESCRIPTION

indexer: Implementation of commit snapshot metadata management

When indexer performs forestdb commit, it generates an on-disk
snapshot. Indexer wants to keep limited number of forestdb
snapshots on disk so that it can be used for recovery during
index rollback. During recovery, indexer needs the list of
commited snapshots present in the disk file. Implemented
metadata storage of commit snapshots during forestdb commits.
During each slice.Commit(), it will also discard old snapshots
from the snapshots info list.

Now valid snapshots information for a slice can be obtained
using slice.GetSnapshots() API and a snapshot handle can be
obtained by using slice.OpenSnapshot(snap_info).

Compactor can also make use of this metadata to prune away
invalid snapshots from forestdb.
