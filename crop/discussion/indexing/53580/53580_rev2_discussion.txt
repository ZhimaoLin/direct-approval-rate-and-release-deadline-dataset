DESCRIPTION

MB-15741: check for windows op for closed listener.

1. Check for AcceptEx error from listern() call (windows).
2. fold "unknown connection error" into "closeremote" logic, which
   will clean up the failed connection and surface that as
   ConnectionError{} and leave rest of the dataport server's state
   as intact, again happens in windows -

   > unknown error: WSARecv tcp 172.23.107.119:9105: An existing
   > connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.

   on unix above error comes as io.EOF.
