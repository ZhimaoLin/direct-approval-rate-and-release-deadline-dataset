Line:16, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> Should have Leonel Abbott to move collatejson to couchbase.

Line:43, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> I assume it is 2 dimensional because of composite key.

Line:16, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> I don't have permission for that.
shall we move that to,

github.com/couchbase/collatejson
github.com/couchbase/go-collatejson

You want me to fork Leonel Abbott to couchbase, or should I push the commits into couchbase as the original master ?

Line:22, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> How are we encoding `docid` ?

Line:38, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> Since keybytes have `docid` should we include `Docid` in value as well ?

I think it is possible to decode back the JSON structure from []byte. Did we discuss any limitations on this ? If otherwise, we can also skip Keybytes ?

variable name and type name for Keybytes are same. might be a little confusing.

Line:43, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> Right now projector encodes composite keys as json array.
[ sec-key1 for first expr, sec-key2 for second expr, ...]

Line:45, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> Will byte stuffing work ?

Line:22, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> there is no special encoding used for docid. its stored as []byte in its original form.

Line:38, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> keybytes doesn't have docid. Its only the composite secondary key. 

The decoding wasn't ready in collatejson some time back, so I decided to include keybytes in Value. If its working now, this can be removed. It serves no other purpose.

Line:43, secondary/indexer/kv.go -> yes that's correct.
