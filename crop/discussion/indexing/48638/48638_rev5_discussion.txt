DESCRIPTION

MB-13900 Detect client stale metadata from scan errors

Whenever scan request returns error index-not-ready or
index-not-found, it could be due to mismatch between client's
cached metadata of indexes. Secondary index client will return
an error cause = ErrorCauseStaleMetadata on such errors.
Query engine can call client metdata refresh if such an error
is observed to obtain latest metadata.
