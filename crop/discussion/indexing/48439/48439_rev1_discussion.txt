DESCRIPTION

MB-100: Make debug messages single line

Currently, it is hard to follow sequence with debug logs turned
on due to multiline periodic logged messages. Compress them to
single line using ® character.

The ® character is ASCII and can be generated by pressing
Option+R in Mac keyboard. This can easily be expanded in most
editors. For example, in vi: s/®/\r/g
