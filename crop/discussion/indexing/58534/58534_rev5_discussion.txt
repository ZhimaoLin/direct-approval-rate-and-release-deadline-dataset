DESCRIPTION

MB-17371 indexer: Update num_docs_indexed in realtime

The graphs populated from num_docs_indexed in the UI are currently
useless since the sampling interval of ns_server is 2s and indexer is 5s.
Realtime num_docs_indexed will fix this issue and will make graphs usable.

The old num_docs_indexed counter is remapped to num_seqs_processed stat.
