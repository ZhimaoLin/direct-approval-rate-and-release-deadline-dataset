DESCRIPTION

MB-18442 Adjust pause threshold in Indexer

The new configuration will allow multiple GC runs before pause.
golang can return from a GC call without freeing any garbage.
Adjust the pause threshold to 95% so that there GC will be running
from 90-95% memory usage window. This gives golang a better chance
to free up garbage.

With the old configuration, if GC couldn't free garbage, Indexer would pause
