DESCRIPTION

MB-14796 Fix race condition in stream reader

There can be a situation when mutation queue alloc
is pending for bucket B1, and bucket B2 is being
added to stream_reader. In such a case, stream reader
worker is waiting for alloc and won't get stopped and
there is a race condition while updating the bucketQueueMap.
