DESCRIPTION

MB-22963: Fix empty string handling for primary index scan

- isNil for scan keys should check for nil instead of empty
byte slice
- Scan with null as scan low/high key is filtered out in
curation of primary key in client
- Fix NewPrimaryKey as doc length of 0 is a valid IndexKey
and not a NilIndexKey
