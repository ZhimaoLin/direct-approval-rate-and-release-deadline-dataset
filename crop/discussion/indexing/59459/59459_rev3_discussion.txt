DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-362 Adjust aggressive GC behaviour

Now Indexer will run aggressive GC only when it reaches
within 10% of the memory quota. If after GC, the memory
usage goes below high_mem_mark, Indexer continues in Active
state. Otherwise it moves to Paused state.

Once a GC is run and Indexer is still Active, it implies
that memory usage is below the high_mem_mark and next GC
will not get triggered until memory usage again crosses
high_mem_mark.

In Paused state, GC will continue to be triggered every
mem_usage_check_interval seconds. If memory gets freed up
below low_mem_mark, Indexer switches to Active state again.
