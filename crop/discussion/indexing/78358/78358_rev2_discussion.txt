DESCRIPTION

MB-20385: Handle int64 values in collatejson

- Changed Actual() API to ActualForIndex()
for N1QL value.
- Added two transformers in Encode and Decode path -
 1. Tranform int64 to scientific e notation during
    encoding
 2. Transform number if integer to standard notation
    during decoding
- Using go_json instead of encoding/json to avoid treating
  integers as float64
