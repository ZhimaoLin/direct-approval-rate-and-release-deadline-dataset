DESCRIPTION

MB-14679: remap 2i stats to N1QL stats.

Following will be the state mapping.

Non deferred indexes:
- index will start from PENDING state, on 2i side this will be
  INDEX_STATE_CREATED or INDEX_STATE_READY.
- immediately move to BUILDING state, on 2i side this will be
  INDEX_STATE_INITIAL or INDEX_STATE_CATCHUP.
- once index is built index state will move to ONLINE, on 2i side
  this will be INDEX_STATE_ACTIVE.
- deleted index and index that has errored out, will be marked
  as OFFLINE.

Deferred index:
- will start from DEFERRED state, on 2i side this will be
  INDEX_STATE_CREATED or INDEX_STATE_READY
- after build is issued index state will be BUILDING, on 2i
  side this will be INDEX_STATE_CATCHUP or INDEX_STATE_INITIAL.
- rest everything is similar to non-deferred indexes.
