Patch Set 1:

Line:1148, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> handleBucketNotFound depends on the result of ValidateBucket which doesn't account of bucket uuid. So if a bucket gets recreated quickly with the same name, ValidateBucket may not trigger BucketNotFound. So I think uuid validation needs to be added to ValidateBucket as well.
