DESCRIPTION

MB-16880 Cleanup waiter map after rollback

Once a waiter has been notified of the rollback, it needs
to be cleaned up from the waitermap. Otherwise, next rollback
will again try to notify on same channel. But as nobody is listening
on that channel, it will lead to a hang.

Also, fixed the stat for numSnapshotWaiter
