DESCRIPTION

indexer: Use cluster address to discover about kv nodes

Currently indexer uses local projector address to discover about
kv nodes. This makes it impossible to run index server only node
in a cluster setup. This changes makes it possible for ns_server
to provide local cluster address to the indexer and indexer can
discover kv addresses by contacting cluster endpoint.
