DESCRIPTION

Slice Writer Changes for Concurrency

ForestDB requires each thread to have its own handle or
all requests be serialized using a single thread.

Slice Writer now has a buffered channel to queue requests
to ForestDB and these are then serialized.

External Interface remains the same and there are no
changes to Flusher.

Line:93, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> In case of fatal db error, the only option right now would be to close the slice and reopen it. I haven't changed the flusher to do that as I am not 100% sure of this strategy. Does it sound reasonable?
