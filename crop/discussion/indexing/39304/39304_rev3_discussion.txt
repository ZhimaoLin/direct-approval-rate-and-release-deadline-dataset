DESCRIPTION

Slice Writer Changes for Concurrency

ForestDB requires each thread to have its own handle or
all requests be serialized using a single thread.

Slice Writer now has a buffered channel to queue requests
to ForestDB and these are then serialized.

External Interface remains the same and there are no
changes to Flusher.
