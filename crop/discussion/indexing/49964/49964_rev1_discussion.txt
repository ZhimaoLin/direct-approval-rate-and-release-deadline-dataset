DESCRIPTION

MB-14637 scanner: Rewrite to use pipeline library

Reworked the scan coordinator channel centric and gc unfriendly
design to a highly memory optimized design.

Index reader interfaces are converted into callback based APIs.
Scanning is performed using the following pipeline:

+------+    +-------+    +------+
|READER| => |DECODER| => |WRITER|
+------+    +-------+    +------+

Reader performs db reads and packs a 16kb buffer with index entries.
Once 16kb buffer is full, it is sent to decoder. Decoder receives
16kb chunks of index entries and decodes them into secondary key
and docid. Packs them to another 16kb buffer and is sent to writer.
Writer builds a 16kb socket write buffer out of received key pairs.
It also performs protobuf encoding of key pairs.
