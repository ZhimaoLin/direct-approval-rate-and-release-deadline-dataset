DESCRIPTION

MB-19064 : Fix rollback to 0 when some VBs are not rolled back

When Rollback is received by indexer, some of the vbuckets
are not present in rollbackTS which led to those VB seq num
becoming 0 leading to rollback to 0. Fix is to do union of activeTs
with rollbackTs in kv_sender. Also fixed the condition which
led to only latest persisted snapshot being compared in GetOlderThanTS
method

Patch Set 2:

Deep, with the latest patch, final TS is computed from rollbackTs and restartTs. The final TS after Union will be like - 

    {  345     baec46cc654b       1077          0          0}
    {  346     be98b6d2541f       1093          0          0}
    {  347     2cc3846dc73d       1065          0          0}
    {  348     79a38075d2d2       1104       1103       1104}
    {  349     bba428d65b65       1091          0          0}
    {  350     7e6acbb92b72       1018          0          0}
    {  351     96c480d9610a       1031          0          0}
    {  352     ca939dd42015       1046          0          0}
    {  353     d64a69b8fdba       1032          0          0}
    {  354      a63755e04df       1039       1039       1039}
    {  355      13894be806b       1129          0          0}
    {  356     ab5c99671c1c       1064       1064       1064}
    {  357     46a18324e285       1134          0          0}
    {  358     13dd75637093       1063          0          0}
    {  359     dfb6253ca78e        981          0          0}

One VBs with snap-start and end are the ones which were missing in original rollbackTS

Did you fix the premature break in for{} loop while comparing for snapshot older than rollback ?

Thanks,

Line:152, secondary/indexer/snapshot_container.go -> Do we need this log message ? Just asking..

Yes Pratap, that is done. Thanks for the review

Line:152, secondary/indexer/snapshot_container.go -> This is to log all the 5 snapshot sequence numbers. I found this useful while debugging. This code path (GetOlderThanTS) is exercised only during rollback, so it should be safe to log.
