DESCRIPTION

New proposal on topic creation and subscription.

- updated the document making topic string as opaque object for projector and
  router.
- made router into a re-entrant component. That is, all the required
  information for a router to function on stream will be supplied during
  stream restart.
- simplified index rebalance.
- added few more words of explanation for missing STREAM_END due to projector
  crash while kv-rebalance.
- cleaned up document and made it relatively more consistent.
