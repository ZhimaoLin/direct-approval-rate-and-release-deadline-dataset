DESCRIPTION

first integration with go-couchbase for UPR.

- implemented KVFeeder interface for go-couchbase.
- re-use the same go-couchbase bucket instance for all feeds.
- changed from GetFailoverLog() API to GetFailoverLogs() API for go-couchbase.
- start using memcached.UprEvent structure instead of locally defined
  MutationEvent structure.

Pending issues,

- bucket instance need to be refreshed before computing VBServerMap().
- UprStreamRequest should be morphed as UprStreamBegin.
  Vbuuid field from STREAM_REQ should be sent downstream.
- UprStreamEnd need to be sent downstream.

long term issues - to handle the following opcodes,
  UprAddStream, UprCloseStream, UprStreamRequest, UprStreamEnd
  UprSnapshot, UprExpiration, UprFlush, UprControl, UprBufferAck
  UprNoop.

Line:121, secondary/projector/adminport.go -> why is this a 32-bit field when everywhere else vbucket is used as 16-bit field ?

Line:144, secondary/projector/adminport.go -> why bucketns ?

Line:384, secondary/projector/kvfeed.go -> This should be UprStreamRequest.

Line:410, secondary/projector/kvfeed.go -> handle UprExpiration

Line:59, secondary/projector/engine.go -> You should handle UprExpiration as well here.

Line:121, secondary/projector/adminport.go -> protobuf effects. There is only uint32 for protobuf.

Line:144, secondary/projector/adminport.go -> plural for bucketn :), where bucketn is bucketName

Line:384, secondary/projector/kvfeed.go -> Done

Line:410, secondary/projector/kvfeed.go -> Yes. This is open issue.

Line:59, secondary/projector/engine.go -> This is covered in the mail thread on UPR. Thanks for pointing out.
