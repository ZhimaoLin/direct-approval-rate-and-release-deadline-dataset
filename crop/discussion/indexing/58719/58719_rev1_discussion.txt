DESCRIPTION

MB-17186 indexer: Fix getIndexStatus hosts list for single node cluster

If a single node cluster is initialized with 127.0.0.1, ns_server
node services API returns "" as the hostname. We need to populate
hostname according to the hostname specified in the http request.

Patch Set 1:

Sarath, I thought Prasanna said she had set an explicit host name and Dave said in that case, nsserver should send that to us? Is this a race between indexer init and node rename?

Patch Set 1:

I think Prasanna did not initialize the node with public IP(node is initialized with default 127.0.0.1). But, she used public IP address to request getIndexStatus. This change fixes that problem.
