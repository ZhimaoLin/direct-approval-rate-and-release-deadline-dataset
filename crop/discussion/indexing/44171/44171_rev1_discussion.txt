DESCRIPTION

cluster_info: Use terse buckets info

Only terse buckets info URI can provide correct ordering
in the nodelist wrt the vbmap serverList.

Also made GetBucket() to prevent doing any fetch operation.
We expect only cluster_info.Fetch() to do any network operations
and other APIs to consume whatver Fetch() and build.
