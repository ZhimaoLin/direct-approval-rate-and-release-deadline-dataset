Line:159, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> I assume this is also used in the indexer process as well as coordinator.  The HTW table is reset.   There is a possibility that when a stream is started, its seqno is older than the seqno that we have seen.   That's means that the snapshot in forestDB will have a higher seqNo than the stream start.   We will have to reset when there is failover on the KV side.   But if we reset the HWT at stream start, will we loose track of the actual HWT at storage?
