Line:608, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> I don't think StorageMode should override log level. Please treat FDB storage statistics no differently than all other statistics.

Line:1329, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Let's make this entire new block conditional to log level being enabled that will print such data

Thanks Theodore Roberson, the forestdb section looks good.

Patch Set 1:

Please note that the call to Statistics() method of forestdb_slice_writer from StorageManager is a blocking call, which means the StorageManager is going to be blocked for the duration of this call. And if there are 10 indexes, this is going to be called for each of the index, which can further increase the blocking time of StorageManager. We need to measure and make sure the stats call in forestdb returns in reasonable amount of time during compaction, commit, heavy writes, large index etc otherwise this can impact throughput. 

Other option is to make the call to Statistics from storage manager async.

I can confirm that the forestdb stats is an in-memory read of a few atomic variables and should be extremely cheap (nanoseconds).

Hi all, Just curious to see if this change can be merged. It would be very useful to get a better insights into perf issues if we can have these timings reported. Thanks!
