DESCRIPTION

Bugfix: race between StreamBegin and StreamSync.

kvfeed will spawn a vbucket-routine when it sees StreamBegin for that vbucket.
Immediately after that it was posting the StreamBegin Event to newly spawned
routine.

Race happens when kvfeed is switched out after it spawned the routine but
before posting the event. The new vbucket-routine gets a chance to run and
starts emitting the heartbeat for every 5ms. Leading to StreamSync before
StreamBegin.

- feed does not send vbmap now. StreamBegin is the sole event that opens the
  path for a vbucket.
