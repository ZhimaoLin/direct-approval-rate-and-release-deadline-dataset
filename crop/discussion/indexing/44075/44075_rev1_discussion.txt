DESCRIPTION

indexer: Use index snapshot abstractions for scanner

Storage manager is refactored to generate IndexSnapshot
objects whenever a new stability timestamp is processed.
The scan coordinator will no receive IndexSnapshot
corresponding to the requested atleast-timestamp and
scan operates on IndexSnapshot instead of mutable
index partition map and index instance map data structures.
