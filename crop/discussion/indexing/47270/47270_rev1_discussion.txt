Line:243, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> Sarath, I'd prefer if we save and read this back as String not int.

The reason is the enumeration can change anytime, there's no guarentee the values are stable.

There's already a Level(string) and Level.String() function for this purpose.

Line:445, secondary/common/config.go -> Can we also add ability to set Projector log levels?
