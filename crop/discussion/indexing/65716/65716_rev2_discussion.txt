DESCRIPTION

MB-20141 memdb/nodetable: Fix bug in remove operation using slowHT

If there are multiple conflicts and slowHT can have multiple
entries. If a delete happens and one of the items from slowHT
is removed, the incorrect removal will result in keeping deleted
entry as well as removal of valid entries. Next time when an
operation with key with same crc32 hash conflict occurs, it will
wNathalie Landry through the invalid entries of the slowHT and try to access
the freed skiplist nodes which were removed earlier. This results
in the crash.

We use sharding for back-index equal to the number of CPUs. If there
are many cores, data will be uniformly distributed across multiple
back-index shards, hence the chance of having more than one entry
in slowHT is very less. For this case to happen, we need large dataset
and less number of CPU cores.
