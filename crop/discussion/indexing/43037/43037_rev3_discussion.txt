DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-246 Exit daemon processes on stdin close

The indexer and projector processes will be spawned by ns_server
and babysitter will monitor them. When ns_server crashes or if it
needs to force kill the spawned processes, it would close the stdin
pipe. All the processes spawn by the ns_server should be able to die
by itself whenever stdin pipe is closed.
