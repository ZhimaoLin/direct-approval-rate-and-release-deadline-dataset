DESCRIPTION

MB-13800: Session consistency.

When replica vbuckets are available from other nodes, STATS command
returns statistics for both active&replica. Not able to figure out
which one is from active vbucket, for now computing the greater
among the two as the vbucket's high-sequence-no.

There is another parameter called `abs-seqno` not sure whether we
can rely on this value.

Please call the stat - GetStats("vbucket-details")
it tells you which is active/replica
see indexer/util.go - GetCurrentKVTs()
