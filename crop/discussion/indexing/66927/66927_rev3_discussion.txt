Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

Line:609, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> You mentioned about a deadlock scenario if callback is fired under a lock. I know this lock is different from that one. Just want to make sure that this lock won't lead to a deadlock situation.

Line:617, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> This change of adminports is something that I never understood.

Line:622, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> The above lock coupled with the force update should work.
