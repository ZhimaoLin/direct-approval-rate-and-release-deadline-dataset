DESCRIPTION

MB-14796 Add Destroy to Mutation Queue

Mutation Queue now has a Destroy method to free all the
resources. There can be pending mutations in the queue
when indexes for the bucket are deleted and these need to be freed.
Also if there are any pending allocations waiting on the queue(due
to size limit on the queue), these needs to be stopped.
