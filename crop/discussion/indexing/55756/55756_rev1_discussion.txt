Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Successfully built and run locally on OS X Yosemite - indexer can now run with a cleared DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. This should be sufficient to run on El Capitan

Patch Set 1:

ping for review? This is needed for 4.1 so the indexer works on OS X El Capitan - note the MB is a blocker.
