Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

(1 comment)

Line:249, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Its better to add this code under KV_STREAM_REPAIR in sendRestartMsg. There can be time window when restartVb sends KVStreamRepair to Indexer(and deletes the stopCh from repair Map) and when Indexer sends MTR to TK. A StreamEnd in this window can again trigger restartVb.
