DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-62 Define structs to represent Topology

Index definition is captured in IndexDefn(index.go)
and IndexInst(index.go) represents the active instance
of an index. Partition Definition is captured in
PartitionContainer(partition_container.go and
key_partition_container.go). This is the information
seen by Router to router keys to Endpoints.

Slice information is captured in Partition Instance(
partition_instance.go) and slice_container.go. This is the
second level of topology details seen only by the Indexer.

Patchset2:
Added Add/Update/Remove methods to both PartitionContainer
and SliceContainer interfaces and its implementation

Patchset3:
- Fix typos
- Fix minor issues(type assertions)

Patchset4:
Removed mutation.go which made its way into the commit
by mistake

Line:82, secondary/common/key_partition_container.go -> Being a utility function, wouldn't it be better to return this as error rather than logging it here. Let the application panic or deal with it.

Line:102, secondary/common/key_partition_container.go -> Same comment as above. I would prefer return an error rather than logging.

Line:82, secondary/common/key_partition_container.go -> I'll write the contract more explicitly. For the application, a nil return value indicates that and it should proceed accordingly.

Line:102, secondary/common/key_partition_container.go -> same as above.

Line:14, secondary/common/index.go -> yes, will change that.
