DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-62 Define structs to represent Topology

Index definition is captured in IndexDefn(index.go)
and IndexInst(index.go) represents the active instance
of an index. Partition Definition is captured in
PartitionContainer(partition_container.go and
key_partition_container.go). This is the information
seen by Router to router keys to Endpoints.

Slice information is captured in Partition Instance(
partition_instance.go) and slice_container.go. This is the
second level of topology details seen only by the Indexer.

Patchset2:
Added Add/Update/Remove methods to both PartitionContainer
and SliceContainer interfaces and its implementation
