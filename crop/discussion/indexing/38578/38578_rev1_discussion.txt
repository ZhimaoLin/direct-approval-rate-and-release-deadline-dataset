Something still needs to be fixed.  But go enough for initial end-to-end testing.

Line:33, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> The indexer id not initialized.

Line:92, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> TODO: port number should come from config.

Line:324, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Any panic will shutdown the main loop.  It is OK for initial testing, but you may want to add a note for handling exception.
