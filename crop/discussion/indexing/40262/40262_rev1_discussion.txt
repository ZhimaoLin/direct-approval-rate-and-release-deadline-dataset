Line:106, secondary/indexer/forestdb_snapshot_reader.go -> stop is a local variable and it is referenced by 2 gorountines: (1) GeyKeySetForKeyPanel which defines this local variable + reading the value from it, (2) anonymous goroutine that sets the value.  Since there is no synchronization primtive, will the golang does the following (1) the compiler put the variable in the CPU register (2) the scheduler places GetKeySetForKeyPanel and the anonymous goroutine in different cores.  In this case, the effect of changing "stop" will not be observed by GetKeySetForKeyPanel?
