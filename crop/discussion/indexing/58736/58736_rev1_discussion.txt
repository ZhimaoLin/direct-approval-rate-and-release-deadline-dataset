DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-362 Handle change in memory_quota when storage mode is not set

Until storage_mode is not set, restart indexer on every memory_quota change.
This will make sure all changes to memory_quota get reflected before first
forestdb index gets created.

This is not a production use-case, as ns_server will set storage_mode(based on
UI option) before indexer gets spawned.
