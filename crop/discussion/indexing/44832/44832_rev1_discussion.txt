DESCRIPTION

KVSender Improvements for Repair Stream

- KVSender uses the projector idempotent behaviour for failed
requests
- KVSender now does async processing of requests and result is
supplied on a response channel. This allows for simultaneous requests
for {stream, bucket, vbucket}.
- All requests now have a stop channel to abort the request
- RepairEndpoint is archived as it cannot be used without a
catchup mechanism
- Added lock for cluster_info usage
