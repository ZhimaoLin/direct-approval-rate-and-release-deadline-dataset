Line:721, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> What is the performance impact with couple of thousands concurrent scans?

Line:127, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Need to protect by atomic for avail.Timeout?

Line:173, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Need to protect with atomic on cp.timeout?

Line:152, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> This will kill cbq?   Probably not a good idea for a "library" to kill the process.   If metakv is not responsive, the worst case is that gsiClient not getting the latest config, but killing cbq may have bigger impact.

Line:785, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> You should use indexing/secondary/platform for windows.

Line:225, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Why poolSize is called evictRetry?

Line:242, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use the platform package in 2i for windows

Line:756, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> So we are going to retry 1000 times (connection pool size)?
