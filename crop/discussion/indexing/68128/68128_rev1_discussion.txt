Line:362, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> I think defnID should be part of the `replica` list above and if !excludes[uint64(defnID)] `n` would have been incremented.

we don't have to remove this logic.  Just FYI.

Line:733, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Would it be appropriate to call c.updateScanClients() before continuing with the next attempt ?

Also should we count this as a retry ?

Line:362, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> I believe so.  But since the original logic return "defnID", I don't want to change  it.    So I just put the check to ensure that defnID is not in the exclude list.

Line:733, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> According to setting config, the purpose for retryScanPort is "number of times to retry when scanport is not detectable".  But in this case, the scan-port is detectable (ok1 && ok2).   So this is a new logic when there are 3 equivalent indexes, we should retry on each one of them.
