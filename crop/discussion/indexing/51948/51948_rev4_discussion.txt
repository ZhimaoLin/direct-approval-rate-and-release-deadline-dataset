DESCRIPTION

MB-15176: Round robin load balancing for GsiClient.

tools/querycmd/gsi_rr.go verifies the implementation.

- start a cluster with 2 indexer nodes.
- execute, `querycmd -auth Administrator:asdasd -server 127.0.0.1:9000 gsi_rr`
- kill one of the indexer.
- number of scan requests in the failed indexer node should be 20 less than
  the other indexer node.
- we also find that failure indexer node after restarted by babysitter is
  eventually picked up by GsiClient.
