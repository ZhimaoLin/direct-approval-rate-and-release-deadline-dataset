Line:360, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Also, stats incr lines should be present here, otherwise it will increment the counter even though they haven't enqueued anything.

Line:361, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Looks like, one assumption i have made is wrong. I thought that new stream reader will be initialized when new buckets are added. but looks like same stream reader is used. 

We have stats object as copy on write. So, when stream reader is created, it is passed with a stats object with fixed list of buckets. When new buckets are added, it wont be reflected. We need a way to update stats object everytime. I think, we need to pass muation_manager pointer to stream reader object. Everytime it can call mutation_manager.stats.Get() to obtain current stats object.

If you find it complicated, please free to assign this bug to me. I introduced it :)
