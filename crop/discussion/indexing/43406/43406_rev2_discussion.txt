DESCRIPTION

scanner: Detect index state and respond accordingly

If an index is not in active state, any scan request towards
that index will receive `Index not ready` error response. If
an index is active and no snapshot is available (Eg. empty bucket),
scanner will respond with 0 rows.

Line:359, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> This check can be part of the scan coordinator itself. The latest indexInstMap is available there as well. If index is not yet ready, we can avoid sending the message from scan coordinator to storage manager.
