DESCRIPTION

MB-19313 memdb/smr: Fix a bug in SMR algorithm

The SMR algorithm is based on the assumption that the items from a freelist
can be reclaimed once all the accessors in its session terminates. But, that
condition is not sufficient for reclaiming items. There could be multiple
closed session at any point of time. Let us consider two closed sessions,
session-1 and session-2. When the last accessor of session-2 goes away,
it will try to reclaim items from its freelist. But the accessors from
session-1 are still active and may be able reach items in session-2
freelist. Hence, a session can only be terminated after termination of
previous sessions. ie, session n can only be terminated after terminating
session (n-1).
