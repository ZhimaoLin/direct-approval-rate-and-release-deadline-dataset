DESCRIPTION

MB-15644 indexer: Fix approximate fragmentation calculation

OverheadFromSnapshots = DiskSize-DataSize (after last compaction)
DataSize2 = DataSize + OverheadFromSnapshots
Fragmentation = (DiskSize-DataSize2)*100/DiskSize

The dataSize logged as part of compaction also includes overhead dataSize.
