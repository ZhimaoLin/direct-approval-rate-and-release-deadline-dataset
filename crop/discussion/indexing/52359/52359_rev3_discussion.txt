DESCRIPTION

MB-15327 indexer: Fix index fragmentation calculation

Multiple index snapshots are retained after the compaction.
Hence fragmentation needs to be computed by considering
all snapshots data blocks present in the index file.
But, it is expensive to estimate data blocks other than
then one present in the latest tree. Hence we came up
with an approximate fragmentation calculation formula as follows:

fragmentation = current_fragmentation - fragmentation_after_last_compaction
