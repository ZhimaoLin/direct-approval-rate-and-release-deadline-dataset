Line:338, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> 1. You don't have to append strings into list if you just want to count them. 2. We do not guarantee that nodes are returned in the same order by different api's 3. We start projector service only on nodes that have data, so I'm not sure if you even need to use 2 api's for this.

Patch Set 3:

also for a particular bucket you can poll the consistent info using : GET /pools/default/b/<bucket_name>

or better use streaming api: GET /pools/default/b/<bucket_name>

this api will deliver all necessary info when it actually changes, so you won't need to poll ns_server every second and pollute access log

Line:338, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> 1. The actual content of the list is also being compared(see line 356). 2. The previous implementation depended on the order being same. If the order is not same, the current implementation will retry. 3. We need to figure the actual "address" of projector service which is only available via the /pools/default/nodeServices api.
