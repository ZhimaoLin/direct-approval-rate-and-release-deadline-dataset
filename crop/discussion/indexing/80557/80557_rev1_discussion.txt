Line:1811, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Shouldn't this be done via atomics as there will be goroutines accessing this concurrently?

Line:1813, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Wouldn't it be equivalent if we assign the new value here to the bool instead of pointer change and let go of the above 4 lines(1809-1811)?

Line:110, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> we should do atomic read here?

Line:1811, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> The update will be visible to the thread. Just that it won't expensive lock the cache line to provide more strict guarantee during concurrent access.

Line:1813, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> I am trying to update the old value itself. The scan thread has only reference to the old bool value. Otherwise, i will do to a atomic load of the map and read the value everytime ?

Line:110, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> The update will be visible here even without atomic read. atomic store/load ensures strict serialization on load/store. Since we are not worried about that, we can let go of it.

There could be still compiler auto optimizer in the future. May be i will use atomics.
