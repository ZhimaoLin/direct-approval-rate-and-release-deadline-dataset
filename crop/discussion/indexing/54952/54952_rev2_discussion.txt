DESCRIPTION

MB-100: updated tools (datapath, upr) to latest version.

datapath - measures projector performance.
upr - measures upr performance.

With the latest set of code, the following is observered,

Experiment1:
* 1KV, 1024 vbuckets, 1 index, each kv-document ~100 bytes.
* 80-85K / sec mutations at `datapath` client on an another node.
* projector CPU is ~600%
* memcached CPU is ~120%

Experiment2:
* 1KV, 1024 vbuckets, 1 index, each kv-document ~1K bytes.
* ~75K / sec mutations at `datapath` client on an another node.
* projector CPU is ~600%

Experiment2:
* same as Experiment1 but with 2 index.
* ~68K / sec mutations at `datapath` client on an another node. Since
  there are 2 indexes it amounts to 136K index key-versions for
  both indexes.
* projector CPU is ~600%

Each index is on a single document field, and both of them don't
use partition-clause or where-clause.
