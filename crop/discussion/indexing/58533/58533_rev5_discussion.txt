Line:385, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> I think it is okay to return nmut as 0 since we do not make any updates to storage.

Line:556, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> This stats will indicate how many index storage mutations done. I think for array indexes, its a good measure to add both added and removed.
