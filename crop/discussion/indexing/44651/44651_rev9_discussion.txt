DESCRIPTION

Add filter to stream reader

Stream Reader now has a per bucket filter, which
filters out any duplicate mutations coming from projector.
This can happen when restarting a vbucket. There may be
unprocessed mutations in the queue as TS is generated on
snapshot boundary. On restart, duplicate mutations will
be received and skipped.
