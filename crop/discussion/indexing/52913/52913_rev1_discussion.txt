DESCRIPTION

MB-15560 Indexer to ignore messages for inactive buckets

Indexer needs to ignore the BuildDone/Merge messages for buckets
which are inactive in a stream. This can happen if all indexes of a
bucket get dropped while BuildDone/Merge is happening.

Also fixed the timekeeper flush state change method to check for
stream status before processing the message.

Line:760, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Same as before, whether it is possible that bucket key is not in streamBucketStatus ?

Line:1246, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> if idx.streamBucketStatus[streamId] does not have bucket key ? Is that possible ?
