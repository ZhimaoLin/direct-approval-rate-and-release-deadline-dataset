DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-188 Implement infrastructure for consistent scanning

Implemented a mechanism in the scan coordinator to perform
query on consistent snapshots. Every query request can provide an
atleast-timestamp or nil. The scanner will ask storage manager
to provide a consistent snapshot timestamp that can fullfil
the query's atleast timestamp. The scanner will block wait until
a snapshot is available that can meet the query's atleast criteria.
Once snapshot timestamp is available, the scanner will use that
timestamp to scan slices.

Patch Set 6:

(2 comments)

A couple of comments inline. Another TODO for scan coordinator is to implement a mechanism to make sure the snapshots being scanned are not deleted due to snapshot container reaching its threshold. This can be done later.

Line:761, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Snapshots will keep getting discarded once their number reaches a threshold. So storage manager may return a TS but its corresponding snapshot may get deleted by the time we try to find it here. We can use the next higher snapshot in that case.

Line:345, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> This line needs to move to the end of the function. Right now tsMap might be getting modified due to a new Commit while it is being accessed in this function.
