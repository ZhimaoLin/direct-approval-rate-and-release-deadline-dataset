DESCRIPTION

MB-14538: expose indexer status (for usability)

- a new data-structure exposed to application,
    // IndexerService returns the status of the indexer node
    // as observed by the GsiClient.
    type IndexerService struct {
        Adminport string
        Queryport string
        Status    string // one of "initial", "online", "recovery"
    }

- GetNodeStatus() added to get the node status from ns_server.
  this function will return the cached result, and can be one
  of the following,
       "healthy" "unhealthy" "warmup" "active"
       "inactiveFailed" "inactiveAdded"

  of the above,  "healthy", "warmup", "active" will map to
  IndexerService.Status == "initial"

- if metadata-provider is successfully connected to indexer node
  then IndexerService.Status moves to "online"

- Nodes() API exposed via GsiClient can be used to fetch
  indexer node's status and services.
    func (c *GsiClient) Nodes() ([]*IndexerService, error) {

- this changeset does not yet deal with "recovery" state. Should
  "recovery" be handle per index ?
