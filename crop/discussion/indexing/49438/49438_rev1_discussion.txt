DESCRIPTION

MB-14324 Use separate file handle for db stats

Added a separate read-only file handle for db calls. Currently
the "Commit" and "Stats" call would have lock contention which
can lead to storage manager stats call taking a long time, holding
up the indexer gen-server. This was confirmed by presence of lot
of advisory lock stacks for stats in the logs.
