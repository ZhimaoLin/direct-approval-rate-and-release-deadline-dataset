DESCRIPTION

MB-15134 indexer: Provide correct stats object for stream reader

Mutation stream reader is created only once and bucket memberships
may change later due to bucket add or removal. But, stats object
will not be updated according to the bucket membership changes.

Fixed stream reader to obtain correct stats object everytime during
stats update.
