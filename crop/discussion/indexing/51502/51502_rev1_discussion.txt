DESCRIPTION

MB-15134 indexer: Provide correct stats object for stream reader

Mutation stream reader is created only once and bucket memberships
may change later due to bucket add or removal. But, stats object
will not be updated according to the bucket membership changes.

Fixed stream reader to obtain current stats object everytime during
stats update.

Line:107, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> I think its better to keep the stats object like before and update it on STREAM_READER_UPDATE_QUEUE_MAP message rather than store the reference of mutation manager being passed here.
