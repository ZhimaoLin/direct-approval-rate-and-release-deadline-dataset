DESCRIPTION

MB-100: Allow proper core dumps on linux

On Linux (Debian at least), the Go signal handlers mess up
the core dumps and the core files are largely useless. So
turn off the Go signal handlers for certain fatal signals,
and let OS do it's thing of dumping the process image right
at the point of fault.
