DESCRIPTION

MB-18759 BucketSeqnos(): Fix race condition in conn initialization

Consumers of BucketSeqnos uses a read lock to avoid contention. But,
if a connection is not already present, all consumers may allocate a
connection. Fixed this race condition by rechecking if somebody has
already allocated a connectiona after acquiring write lock.
