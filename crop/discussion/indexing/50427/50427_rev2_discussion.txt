DESCRIPTION

MB-14374: race between StreamBegin and ConnectionError.

Following is the scenario, with 3 projector X,Y,Z and Indexer N.

1. Z is already rebalanced out (ungraceful failure).
2. N would have received 512 vbuckets (let us call this set as X')
   StreamBegins from X.
3. Y is rebalanced out (ungraceful failure).
4. connection from Y to N would have broken and ConnectionError{X'}
   would be sent to Indexer.
5. Indexer starts a ShutdownVb/RestartVb with X for vbucket set X'.
6. Meanwhile, MutationTopic is going on between N and X with full
   set of 1024 vbuckets and due to Y rebalancing out (step 3) some
   of the vbuckets from the other 512 (let us call this set as Y')
   would have started.

On the dataport-server.

There are three doReceive() routines for 3 connections with X, Y, Z.
Let us call this as connection M, N, O respectively.

a. Z is rebalanced out before any of the vbuckets getting started from Z.
b. No vbuckets will be marked for connection-error.
c. M received StreamBegin for 512 vbuckets from X'.
d. due to step 3, connection N gets broken and triggers a connection error
   for all vbuckets in X', step 4 above.
e. while connection N detects an EOF error and sends it to dataport-genserver
   (that maintains the book-keeping), connection M has received StreamBegin
   from some of the vbuckets in Y'.

The race !
- dataport-genserver has received EOF from N while StreamBegins for Y' are
  still in i/p channel buffer.
- the parallel-connection detection logic will detect all the connections
  with the same remote belonging to N (which will be both connections M and N),
  and close them all and send the ConnectionError{X'} to dataport-genserver
  step d. above.
- feed on the good Projector X will simply drain the mutation on closed
  endpoint (refer above step).
- Meanwhile, step 5. will repair the endpoint and Projector X's feed will
  continue sending the mutations (albiet some of them are lost).
- Meanwhile, dataport-genserver will receive the StreamBegins for Y'
  and some of the mutation for these streams would have been lost.

Fix !!
- don't close good connection that has not received EOF, implies the
  parallel-connection logic will be removed.
- gaurantee that a StreamBegin would lead to unbroken stream of mutations.
- gaurantee that if a mutation stream does get broken, send
  ConnectionError{} for those streams and for those streams only.
