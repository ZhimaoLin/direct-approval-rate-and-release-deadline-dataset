DESCRIPTION

MB-15803 indexer: Use different storage parameters for incr build

The storage operations workload during initial build and incremental
builds are different. Hence tuning storage parameters differently
will help in optimizing the storage engine performance.

Added configs:
indexer.settings.initial_build.wal_size
indexer.settings.incr_build.wal_size
indexer.settings.initial_build.max_writer_lock_prob
indexer.settings.incr_build.max_writer_lock_prob
