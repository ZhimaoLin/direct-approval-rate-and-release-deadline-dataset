DESCRIPTION

cluster_info: Add Lock() and Unlock() helper methods

If there are multiple concurrent users for the same cluster_info
instance, access should be serialized using a lock.
Added helper methods to lock and unlock cluster_info for concurrent
access.

Eg.
    ci.Lock()
    ci.Fetch()
    nodes := ci.GetNodesByServiceType("srv")
    addr := ci.GetServiceAddress(nodes[0])
    ci.Unlock()

nodeId returned by cluster_info APIs will become invalid with subsequent
Fetch() call. Hence, API calls followed by a Fetch() should be protected
using a lock.
