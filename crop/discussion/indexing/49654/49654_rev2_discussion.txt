DESCRIPTION

MB-14280 indexer: Immediately return cached stats

During index builds, timekeeper might be busy and may take time for
synchronous stats updates. Made stats cache update to be fully asynchronous.
/stats endpoint will return with current cached results immediately rather than
waiting for cache updates.
