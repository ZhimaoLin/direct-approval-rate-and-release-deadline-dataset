Patch Set 1:

This probably will break a lot of the tests and existing customer since fdb settings are also changed (from sherlock).

Patch Set 1:

For the user exposed settings e.g. persisted_snapshot, I have retained the old setting name so it doesn't break existing stuff. For the internal settings, e.g. mutationBuffer I have renamed the fdb setting with a ".fdb" in it. So hopefully it shouldn't break stuff as we haven't asked people to change any internal settings yet.
