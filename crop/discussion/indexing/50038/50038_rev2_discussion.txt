DESCRIPTION

MB-14590: idle projector optimization.

The optimization spans the situations where one or more indexes
are created on one or more buckets but there are no mutation
traffic.

endpoint's bufferTimeout:
  This timeout is used as one of the trigger (upper bound) to flush
  mutation keys to downstream. It was configured @ 1ms, so that
  Consistency queries can be served quickly.
  With this patch, bufferTimeout is increased to 25ms.

vbucket's syncTimeout:
  This timeout is used by each vbucket-routine to generate the
  sync pulse. having a timer-channel within select{} seem to
  be a bad idea for go-runtime.

  This patch is moving the sync pulse generation from vbucket-routine
  to kvdata-routine (one step above in data-path).
  On the upside, there will be one timer tick per bucket and
  vbucket-routine don't have to use select{} statement.
  On the downside, kvdata-routine will have to loop over all
  vbucket-routines posting the sync-pulse. This implies that
  the chance of vbucket-routines blocking on downstrem endpoint
  should be minimized, hence bumping the i/p buffer size from
  10K to 50K for endpoint routine.

On mac, projector should consume < 10% when 20 index is defined
on 10 buckets with 1024 vbuckets per bucket. In normal cases
it should be < 5%.
