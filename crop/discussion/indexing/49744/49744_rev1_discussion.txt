DESCRIPTION

MB-14486 client: Ignore user provided timestamp for SessionConsistency

If the caller provides a timestamp vector, client was not setting
timestamp vector = current vbucket timestamp when SessionConsistency
was chosen. This resulted in passing all vbseqno=0 for scan requests
from n1ql and broke RYOW semantics.
