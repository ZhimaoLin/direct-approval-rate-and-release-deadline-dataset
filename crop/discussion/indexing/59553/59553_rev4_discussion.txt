DESCRIPTION

MB-16999 Improve error message for invalid bucket uuid

If a deferred index is present for a bucket which has got
deleted/recreated, Indexer will explicitly provide this information
in the error message.

If such an index exists for a bucket:
- No new create indexes are accepted for the bucket until such an index is dropped
- Such an index cannot be built. It needs to be dropped.
