DESCRIPTION

protobuf updates.

- error fields should be defined as optional.
- Index is now IndexInst. There is a bit of duplication but simplifies the
  logic on the indexer side.
- IndexPartition message is removed, instead different partition messages
  are to be contained directly within IndexInst.
- added TestPartition scheme for testing purpose.
- variable re-naming and message re-naming.
