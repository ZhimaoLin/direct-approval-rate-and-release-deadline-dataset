Patch Set 5:

(3 comments)

Line:99, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Should this be poolBuf ?

Line:136, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> We are not using sync.Pool for decode path ? Since the number of time we decode could be more than encode, sync.Pool-ing this could give better memory efficiency.

Line:266, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Same as above
