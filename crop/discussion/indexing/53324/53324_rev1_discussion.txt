DESCRIPTION

MB-15714 indexer: Add support for archiving stale db files

For any forestdb debugging related to file corruption, dbfile
needs to be analyzed. Added `indexer.settings.stale_dbfile_archive_dir`
to configure the archive directory. This setting will be used by the
indexer only after a restart.
