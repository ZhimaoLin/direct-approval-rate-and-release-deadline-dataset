DESCRIPTION

MB-100: optimization to improve project data-path.

Scenario:
- kvdata folds control path and datapath together.
- to avoid select{} blocks on timer-tick for 1024 vbuckets,
  sync-pulse is now generated by kvdata.
- it may so happen that due to downstream throttling,
  kvdata will not be able to post the sync-pulse to all 1024
  vbuckets immediately
- until it is posted downstream, the upstream might be blocked.
- to avoid this sync-pulse is posted in a separate go-routine.
