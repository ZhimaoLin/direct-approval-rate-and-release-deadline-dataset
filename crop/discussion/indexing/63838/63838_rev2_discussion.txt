DESCRIPTION

MB-19524 Reduce dataport dataChanSize to sherlock value

Reduce from 100K to 10K. 100K can queue up lot of mutations and
can lead to OOM as this is unaccounted memory sitting in dataport channel.

Once mutation queue has become full, it is better to throttle than to
queue up mutations inside dataport.

With multiple stream workers, this shouldn't be a perf bottleneck as
the pipeline gets drained very fast. The dataport/stream reader channels
only start to become full when mutation queue begins to throttle.
