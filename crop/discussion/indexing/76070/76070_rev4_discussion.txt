DESCRIPTION

MB-23354: Remove index entry size limits

Changes include:
- Expose a flag to enable/disable size. Default is
disable size checks
- Individual item size is no more a constant
- If large keys are allowed, dynamically increase encode
buffers in slice writers
- Handle large keys in scan pipeline and protocol sender
- Projector needs to be able to encode large keys and
reuse the encode buffer

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(4 comments)

Line:1309, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> is this 1024 padding? If there is already a const defined, it would be better use it.

Line:136, secondary/indexer/scan_protocol.go -> Is this code required here?

Line:72, secondary/pipeline/data_pipeline.go -> Instead of doing these checks in WriteItem, could you do this inside Put(), that way duplication of code can be avoided ?

Line:1435, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> it would be good if this is padding const
