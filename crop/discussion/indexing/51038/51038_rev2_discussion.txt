DESCRIPTION

MB-14965 Start Indexer main loop before index recovery

On indexer bootstrap, the main indexer loop needs to be running
before starting recovery for existing indexes. So now the index
recovery is taken out of boostrap and done in main indexer init code
after the main loop has started. Once all existing indexes are recovered,
the cluster manager listener is started to accept any new DDL requests.
