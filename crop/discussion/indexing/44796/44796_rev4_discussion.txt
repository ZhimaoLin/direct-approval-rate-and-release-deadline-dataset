DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-228: integrate with MetadataProvider.

* for a while we plan to maintain both cbq-bridge and metadata-provider,
  until later become stable enough to let go of former.
* added gsiBridge interface{} to switch between the two.
* cbq-bridge will only work with single-indexer, single-query config.

CBIDXT-273: index state
  * for cbq-bridge, state is set to ONLINE once create-index succeeds.
  * state will be updated via Refresh() call.

CBIDXT-300: integrate with cluster_info.
  * to get service-address for n1ql.
  * to get list of all indexer nodes.
  * to get adminports of all indexer nodes.
  * to get queryports of all indexer nodes.

CBIDXT-301: topology selection.
  * temporarily topology of index is selected based on round-robin
    method.
