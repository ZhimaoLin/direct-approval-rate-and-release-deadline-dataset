DESCRIPTION

Call newly added forestdb destroy api on Drop Index

When an index is dropped, the physical files need to be
cleaned up as well. ForestDB now has a destroy api to do that.
That api needs to be called for all slices of an index.

There is a corresponding goforestdb commit, which needs to be
merged along with this.
