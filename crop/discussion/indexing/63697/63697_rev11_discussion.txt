Line:101, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> 1) Pratap, for the old files, are we going to remove old directories?  If not, it will hold up disk space.
2) If the disk is almost full, there is a chance that we won't have enough disk space to copy the files (e.g. each fdb file takes up 100G).   Now, we are going to crash the indexer repeatedly
