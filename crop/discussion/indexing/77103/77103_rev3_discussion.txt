DESCRIPTION

MB-23969: Temporary workaround to allow 1.7.3 to work on OSX 10.12.4

OSX 10.12.4 debug symbols breaks go 1.7.3 binaries. Temporarily add
-s flag to strip debug info.

Revert this commit when we move to 1.8.1

Patch Set 3:

Will other projects (those not using go 1.8.1 yet) need to make similar workarounds?
