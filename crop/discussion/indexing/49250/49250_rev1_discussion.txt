DESCRIPTION

MB-14241 Handle case of build done/merge on indexer panic

If indexer panics just before making a state change from Initial->Active
or Catchup->Active and there are no mutations, on recovery there will
be no flush happening to allow for these state transitions. Add these
checks to StreamRequestDone in Timekeeper.
