DESCRIPTION

MB-20153 scanner: Fix race condition in pipeline shutdown

When an error occurs in IndexScanWriter (sink), the pipeline
the sink routine will terminate and pipeline supervisor will
call kill() for source and filters. If source or sink is already
processing another error it will call CloseWithError(). During
the processig of CloseWithError(), it will see that supervisor
has requested termination. CloseWithError() frees the current
buffer block back to the sync.Pool without marking it as freed.
The default destructor for the sink or source calls CloseWrite().
As current buffer block is not marked as freed, it would free the
buffer block again to sync.Pool causing invalid blocks to be passed
across sync.Pool leading to crash.

Steps for repro:
1. Run many cbindexperf or gsiclients with requests cancel
(leads to source and sink shutdown with error)
2. Kill some of the cbindexperf instances\
(leads to error in sink due to network write and sink termination)
