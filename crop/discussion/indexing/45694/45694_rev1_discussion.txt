Patch Set 1:

Since we need to merge ns_server change and this change together, I think we will need to wait till our merge to master window.

Patch Set 1:

no. master of indexing doesn't depend on NewDefaultAuthenticator.

So when cbauth changes are merged your stuff will stop working massively. This change at least adapts your most important programs: indexer and projector.

Sorry. It should be fine to merge this change. I was thinking that corresponding ns_server change has some cbauth API changes :)
