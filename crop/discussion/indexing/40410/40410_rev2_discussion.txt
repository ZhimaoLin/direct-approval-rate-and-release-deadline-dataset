DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-130: rebalance.

- fixes to handle StreamEnd and upstream connection closing on dataport.
- udpated local structure that maintains active-vbuckets.
- added RepairVbuckets{} message to differentiate StreamEnd and
  closed-connection.
- when a remote connection gets closed, dataport-server will not close all
  other connections to same client. `closeremote` handling is replaced with
  `closeconn`
