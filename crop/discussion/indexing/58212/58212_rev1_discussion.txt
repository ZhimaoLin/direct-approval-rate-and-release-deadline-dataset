DESCRIPTION

MB-16194 memdb: Fix backindex multimapping during bottom-up build

For array indexes, each document-id in backindex may map to multiple
secondary index keys. During the index bottom-up rebuild, we need
to ensure that the linking between group of main index keys of
a document is rebuild.
