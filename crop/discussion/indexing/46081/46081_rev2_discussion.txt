DESCRIPTION

hack: check for duplicate endpoints in project feed.

ns_server could switch IP address from localhost to eth0.
Feed's startEndpoints() logic should detect for duplicate
endpoints,
- by comparing whether it is local-ip and already present.
- by comparing whether it is remote and already present.

to avoid duplicate endpoint routines.
