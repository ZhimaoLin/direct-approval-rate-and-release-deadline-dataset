DESCRIPTION

indexerid: updated query-client to use indexer-id

1. assuming that FindServiceForIndex(), FindServiceForIndexer() and
   FindIndex() from manager/client/ are cheap calls.
2. use indexer-node's cluster-address in CREATE-INDEX deployment spec.
3. If CREATE INDEX do not supply a with clause, client will simply pass on
   the empty clause to metadata-provider (I guess that is what you have
        mentioned in your mail as well).
4. In func (o *MetadataProvider) BuildIndexes(defnIDs []c.IndexDefnId)
   `defnIDs` can span across multiple indexer-nodes.

For scan calls (Lookup, Range, Count, Stats) client will use,
a. c.config["retryIntervalScanport"].Int()
b. c.config["retryScanPort"].Int()
to retry the call in case of error. While retrying the metadata provider
will be checked to refresh the local list of scan-clients.

Also gsi-client has started using Sarathâ€™s cinfo.WaitAndUpdateServices(),
to wait for changes in cluster-info and update the local cache
asynchronously.

- The metadata-client is preserved until an explicit Close() from
  Application.
- queryport clients (scan clients) are preserved until the indexer-node is
  removed or an explicit Close() from Application.
