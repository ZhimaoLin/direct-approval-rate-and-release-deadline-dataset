DESCRIPTION

MB-15880: cbindex sleep wait before listing the index.

This issue is specific only to `cbindex`, especially when the tool
is executed in a local machine that connects with remote cluster,
which will introduce a delay in propogation of metadata. Since
GsiClient's Refresh() API is async, I have added a time.Sleep
in the tool for listing indexes.
