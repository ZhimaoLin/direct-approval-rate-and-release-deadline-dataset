Line:1886, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Thinking a little more on this. We update the status to "Online" when initial+catchup phase is done. Which can mean there will be "Pending" index in UI with build progress as 100%. Not sure if this works for PM.

Line:1895, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> does this logging statement need to be removed?
