DESCRIPTION

CBIDXT-100: CloseStream implemented.

- fix example app for dataport.
- changed application `opaque` type to uint16.
- feed's opaque value will increment dozen times a second, thus keeping it
  unique for a feed call and will not overflow for a long time.
- tools/multibuckets/multibuckets.go is passing.
