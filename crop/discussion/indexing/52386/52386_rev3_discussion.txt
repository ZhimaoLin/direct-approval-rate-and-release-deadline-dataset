I think my comments are more related to GC point of view.
We can push this change and go for another round of optimizations.

Line:519, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Without the ErrVbuuidMismatch error message being returned to the client, it will have to recompute the hash on all scan failure e.g. a scan timeout or any of the errors listed in this file.

Line:519, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Yes, we will have to make this precise.
Right now ErrVbuuidMismatch, and ErrScanTimedOut is we did not get a matching snapshot within the timeout.

Line:213, secondary/cmd/cbindexperf/executor.go -> This is an ugly stuff man!! we will tNathalie Landry about it face-to-face. To tickle your curiosity check out the main.go and search for warmup.

Thanks,
