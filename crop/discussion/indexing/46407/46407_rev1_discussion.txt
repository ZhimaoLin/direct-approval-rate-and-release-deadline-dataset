DESCRIPTION

MB-13308 Index Scan Using primary index (gsi based) fails

For immediate index build, indexer update index state asynchronous in
during OnIndexBuild(). Therefore, the lifecycle manager can respond to
the client before the index state is set.  The fix is to make sure
that Lifecycle manager sees the index state is updated before
returning to the client.
