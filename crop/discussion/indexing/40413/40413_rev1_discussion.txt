Line:528, secondary/projector/feed.go -> feed.startEndpoints() will be called as long as raddr is IN raddrs.   In your older code, you also check endpoint.Ping() for existing endpoint.  That's no longer required?

Line:269, secondary/projector/kvfeed.go -> Why kvfeed.bucket.Refresh() is being called twice?

Line:528, secondary/projector/feed.go -> Some times, server might have detected a fault with client, thereby triggering a repair endpoint to projector from indexer app. But it can happen that endpoint has not yet detected the fault while the above code get executed and Ping() might succeed. So removed the Ping() from predicate.

Since the new endpoint is passed to all vbucket routines, the older ones will anyway commit harakiri.

Line:269, secondary/projector/kvfeed.go -> Thanks. That is mistake. I will make a separate commit for this.
