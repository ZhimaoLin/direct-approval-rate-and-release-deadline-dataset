DESCRIPTION

MB-13818: projector configuration.

- configuration is passed to endpoint factory call,
  as apposed to remembering it from factory instantiation.
- config.Int() will automatically convert float64 into int.
- config.LogConfig() added to log information about posted settings.
- added immutable parameter to config fields.
- config.Override() will skip immutable settings params. This
  means even if user tries to update an immutable config param
  (after the server is started) it will be ignored and logged.
- if user supplies invalid config param skip them.
- renamed settings params endpoint.dataport.* to projector.dataport.*
- removed projector.kvAddrs, projector.colocate
- general configuration cleanup for all projector
  components/go-routines.
