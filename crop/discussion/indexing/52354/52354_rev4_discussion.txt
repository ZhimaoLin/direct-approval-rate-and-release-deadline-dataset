Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(3 comments)

Line:168, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Minor - its better to make snapshotNotifych as part of indexer struct so we don't need to pass it around in indexer functions.

Line:881, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> you may want to add notifySnapshotCreation to addNilSnapshot if we want to cover the initial case as well.

Line:498, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> if r.Ts != nil, then also we can check if we have already got the snapshot > r.Ts and use it directly
