DESCRIPTION

Better handling of invalid WindowCache Configuration

Currently, if an invalid value for the WindowCache
configuration is stored (e.g. "2 k" for window size), then start-up of
EGit fails after the next IDE restart.
Furthermore, no suitable error message is shown when this value
is stored in the preference page.
The fix makes the startup failsafe by logging an error if the config
is wrong but starting the cache with the default config. Also, the
preference page shows an error message if a wrong value is
entered.
