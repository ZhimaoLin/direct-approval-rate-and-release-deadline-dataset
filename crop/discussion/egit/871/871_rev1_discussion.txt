DESCRIPTION

Better handling of invalid WindowCache Configuration

Currently, if an invalid value for the WindowCache
configuration is stored (e.g. "2 k" for window size), then start-up of
EGit fails after the next IDE restart.
Furthermore, no suitable error message is shown when this value
is stored in the preference page.
The fix makes the startup failsafe by logging an error if the config
is wrong but starting the cache with the default config. Also, the
preference page shows an error message if a wrong value is
entered.

Patch Set 1:

Please remove that blank line between Bug and Signed-off-by.  Its preventing Gerrit from seeing the Bug: 316761 line as a footer, which means it won't index this change as a fix for 316761... and we can't later search Gerrit for changes related to bug 316761 with the search string "bug:316761".  :-)
