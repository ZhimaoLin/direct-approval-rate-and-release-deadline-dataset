DESCRIPTION

Removed dependency to org.eclipse.compare

The org.eclipse.compare bundle introduces dependencies that ripples all
the way up to the org.eclipse.ui.ide. The only reason for this
dependency was to get some integer constants from the Difference class.
This commit replaces those constants with local copies.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

this breaks the corresponding tests as they use the same constants, will upload a fix in a minute
