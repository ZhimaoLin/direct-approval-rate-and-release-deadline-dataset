Patch Set 1:

how can you run synchronize on a bare repository it has no working tree ? or do I misinterpret the stack trace shown in the referenced bug ?

Patch Set 1:

It's not from an explicit synchronize action but from initializing of the repository provider. This is the interesting part:

	at org.eclipse.egit.core.synchronize.GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.init(GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java:102)
	at org.eclipse.egit.core.internal.GitRepositoryProviderType.<init>(GitRepositoryProviderType.java:53)

You can reproduce it by just adding a bare repository to the Git Repositories view and the exception should show up some time after startup.

Why we load any caches in the constructor for synchronize at all I don't know, but that's for another change.
