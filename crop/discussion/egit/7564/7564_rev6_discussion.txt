DESCRIPTION

Use IPath instead of IResource for non-workspace paths

The implementations of getMappingForNonWorkspaceResource() and
getRepoRelativePath() in RepositoryMapping were confusing workspace
paths with filesystem locations.

The problem is that IResource#getFullPath() returns e.g. /foo/bar (where
/ means workspace root), whereas IResource#getLocation() returns the
absolute file system path. This caused later code which treated the
paths as absolute file system paths to return incorrect results.

Instead of incorrectly using an IResource for non-workspace files, we
now work with IPath if necessary, e.g. for comparing with index from
Staging View.
