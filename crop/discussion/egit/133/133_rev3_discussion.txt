DESCRIPTION

Implement GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES for Eclipse.

If this environment variable is set it will be interpreted as a list
of directories above which the Git Team Provider does not search
for repositories.

The key here is "search". By explicitly pointing at a repository it can
still be used, regardless of where it is located.

This feature is mostly useful for testing, but can possibly be used to cut
of scans into network directories, which is the original rationale for the
implementation in C Git.

Patch Set 3: No score; IP review completed

I guess the OSGi class loader is smarter than I am. This
connects the EGit unit tests tgo the JGit ones to a lesser
extent.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

depends on pending jgit changes 
  http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,132
and 
  http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,147

Line:60, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitTestCase.java -> if this is no longer called (see above) why do we need to retain this method ?

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitTestCase.java -> this renders the next line dead code and will always skip this check
