DESCRIPTION

Implement GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES for eclipse.

If this environment variable is set it will be interpreted as a list
of directories above which the Git Team Provider does not search
for repositories.

The key here is "search". By explicitly pointing at a repository it can
still be used, regardless of where it is located.

This feature is mostly useful for testing, but can possibly be used to cut
of scans into network directories, which is the original rationale for the
implementation in C Git.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

JUnit 3 doesn't find the test cases anymore.

Line:23, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitTestCase.java -> JUnit 3 apparently doesn't like this change, it doesn't find the test cases anymore if they are not directly extending junit.framework.TestCase. This leads for all tests to the exception:

junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: No tests found in org.eclipse.egit.core.T0003_AdaptableFileTreeIteratorTest
	at junit.framework.Assert.fail(Assert.java:47)
	at junit.framework.TestSuite$1.runTest(TestSuite.java:90)
