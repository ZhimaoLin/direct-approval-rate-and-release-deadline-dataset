DESCRIPTION

Improve height calculation for multi pull result dialog layout

The multi pull result dialog only has 2 lines visible, independent of
how many repositories have been pulled. This change adapts the height
dynamically depending on the number of repositories (with a fixed
maximum of 15 lines).
