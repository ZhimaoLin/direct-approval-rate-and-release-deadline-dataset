DESCRIPTION

Mark branding plugin and gitflow plugin as singletons

Allowing installation of multiple versions of these plugins doesn't seem
to be useful.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

I cannot imagine a use case for having multiple versions of a branding plug-in installed. Maybe there is one for the gitflow core plug-in, but eventually it will have extension points, so it's probably a good idea to communicate this restriction rather too early than too late.
