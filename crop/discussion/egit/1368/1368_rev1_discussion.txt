DESCRIPTION

Replace deprecated Tag, Commit usage with RevTag, RevCommit

JGit is changing its API to no longer make Tag and Commit classes
accessible for reading purposes.  The only thing they will support
is the creation of new objects, and even then their APIs are moving
to a simpler and more consistent usage style.

Replace relevant uses of tags and commits with their RevWalk based
variants, fixing any build breakages caused by this JGit change.
