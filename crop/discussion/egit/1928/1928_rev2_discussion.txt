DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Added menu option to toggle 'reuse compare editor'

The option already existed in the team preferences, but this is
not known to everybody.  Therefore it is now also added to the menu
of the GitHistoryPage.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(7 inline comments)

Almost perfect. Just a few style-nits and formatting issues. Please also check the commit message.

Line:308, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CompareUtils.java -> There seems to be a minor formatting issue (missing tab). Please make sure to format with the formatter settings checked into the project.

Line:309, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CompareUtils.java -> For code readability, I'd prefer to import IWorkbenchAction and get rid of the "ActionFactory." prefix

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Please import IWorkbenchAction and get rid of the "ActionFactory." prefix. This will also shorten the line somewhat.

Line:800, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> See above (import IWorkbenchAction)

Line:1272, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Please import IWorkbenchAction (see above).

Line:1273, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> A tab seems to be missing. Please format with the code formatter settings checked into the project.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please add signed-off.
