DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Added preference for reusing compare editors

It is now configurable whether the same compare editor is used each
time, or a new one is opened each time the user wants to compare
two revisions of a file.

This behavior was changed recently from opening multiple editors to
opening a single one, but personally I like it much better to open
multiple editors.  This makes it easier for me to review all changes
in a commit.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi Ruth,
first of all, thanks for your contribution. However, I'm afraid that this is a duplicative effort. The CompareUtils class already checks the preferences found on the Team preference page (Menu path Windows->Preferences->Team, Checkbox "Reuse open compare editors when opening comparisons"), and I don't think we should have our own Preference here.

Patch Set 1:

Just for clarification: I think the toggle action would still be great to have, but it should work on the team preference.
