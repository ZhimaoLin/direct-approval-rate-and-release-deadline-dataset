DESCRIPTION

Removed checkedItems field from GitProjectsImportPage

The checkedItems field has been removed from GitProjectsImportPage, 
and a getCheckedProjects method has been added instead, which computes
 the set of checked projects based on information available from the UI widgets.

This fixes at least one bug that was affecting my work: unchecking projects by 
using the spacebar didn't work, because there was no KeyListener in place to 
update the checkedItems field. This lead to the project being unchecked in the 
UI, but still considered checked by the wizard page, and upon clicking Finish, 
the wizard would try to import all of those unchecked projects.

In this amendment, changes are made in response to reviewer comments.

I tried to just follow the instructions on the Wiki for pushing amended commits but evidently I blew it somehow. Is there any way to salvage this?

Patch Set 1:

The easiest way is to create a new branch on top of egit's master branch. Then cherry-pick your changes into
it and finally use rebase -i to squash them together and update the comment so it looks like there ever was one patch. I suggest you re-use the change-id of the first
patch and abandon this one. Something like
