DESCRIPTION

Safe preference reading of sash weights in GitHistoryPage

Preference values shall be treated as unverified external input and be
read in paranoid mode. Preferences can become corrupted; we can't trust
them. In no case shall garbled preferences cause the application to
fail.

Armor reading of sash weights and fall back to the default values if
the stored values cannot be read.
