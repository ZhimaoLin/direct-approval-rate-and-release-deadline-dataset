DESCRIPTION

Remove redundant initialization of GitProjectData

This change adds a static 'add()' method to GitProjectData in order to
put a project data object into the cache that has been created using
the constructor. This change affects the ConnectProviderOperation.
Previously for each newly imported project GitProjectData was
initialized twice.
