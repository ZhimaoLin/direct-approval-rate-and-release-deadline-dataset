DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Preserve commit selection on filter change

When switching between filter types (resource, project, repo), the
selected commit is now preserved. Before this, the selection was lost
each time, making it difficult to inspect a specific commit.

Problems (help appreciated):
- The history view may end up having no commits selected.
- Reveal doesn't seem to work. (Select an older commit from resource filtered commits, then change filter to repo -> commit is selected, but not revealed.)

good idea

Would be even more useful if the selected commit would stay in the visible area when switching the filter type, similar to what happens when you select a ref (branch, tag etc.) in the repositories view
