This doesn't really help since we generate the help from the corresponding wiki pages using wikitext, so these changes will be lost when I generate a new version [1]. To make these changes permanent do the corresponding changes in the wiki pages referenced from the xml file [2].

Maybe it would be better to remove the generated doc from the repo and replace it with a readme.txt?
