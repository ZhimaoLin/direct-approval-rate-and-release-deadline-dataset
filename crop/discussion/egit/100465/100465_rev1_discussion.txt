DESCRIPTION

Improve hard-wrapping in commit messages

Preserve the current behavior as much as possible, but relax the
rules about wrapping long words. This prevents moving long URLs
(or other long "words") to new lines when doing so doesn't improve
the formatting. In particular, it'll keep URLs used in references[1]
on the line with the reference index.

Patch Set 1:

Still that broken target platform because mylyn wikitext moved to another update site.

BTW, this commit was created with EGit with this change in. As one can see, it did not wrap before the URL :-)
