DESCRIPTION

Improve hard-wrapping in commit messages

Preserve the current behavior as much as possible, but relax the
rules about wrapping long words. This prevents moving long URLs
(or other long "words") to new lines when doing so doesn't improve
the formatting. In particular, it'll keep URLs used in references[1]
on the line with the reference index.

Patch Set 2:

it seems this isn't wrapping normal text accurately anymore, try e.g. to paste the first paragraph of [1] (II. The SQL Language until the table of contents)
into a commit message using the old and the new implementation.
The old implementation properly wraps the text at the limit shown as a vertical rule.
The new implementation doesn't any longer, it wraps many lines too late

I can't reproduce this. I get exactly the same wrapping.

Look again at your screenshots. The hard-wrapping is identical. But the font size in the first screenshot is much larger. It seems that there's an unrelated bug here (related: bug 484097?): the margin should be drawn based on the current font size.
