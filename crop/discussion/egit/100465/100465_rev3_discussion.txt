DESCRIPTION

Improve hard-wrapping in commit messages

Preserve the current behavior as much as possible, but relax the
rules about wrapping long words. This prevents moving long URLs
(or other long "words") to new lines when doing so doesn't improve
the formatting. In particular, it'll keep URLs used in references[1]
on the line with the reference index.

you are right, I missed that I used different font sizes in the two Eclipse instances I used for testing

Patch Set 3:

I still don't understand how you ended up with the text being larger but the print margin being wrong. Did you do this on a Mac with Retina display? Then perhaps it was bug 506166.

I saw that on my Cinema (27 inch 2560x1440) display and on the MacBook's Retina display (15,4-inch 2880 x 1800)

All right, now I see:

* On Oxygen, the MarginPainter reacts on its own to font changes. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/83475/
* On Neon, it doesn't; if we wanted to fix it, we would have to call MarginPainter.initialize() explicitly on font changes.
* Plus there's bug 506166 ( https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/83472/ ), which may result in a wrong margin position. (Seen that on Neon on a non-Retina display, too.)
