DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Fix undo in commit message field

It was not working because of a handler conflict. The problem was that
it was registered using the workbench handler service in the staging
view.

By using the site-specific handler service via getHandlerService, the
conflict no longer exists and the keybinding works.
