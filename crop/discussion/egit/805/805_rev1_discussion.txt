DESCRIPTION

Allow Git repository to be pre-filled from clip

If the user has copied a clipboard already, then we can access that
from the SWT clipboard. If it looks like a transport we know about
(as reported by Transport.canHandleProtocol) then we pre-fill the
connection dialog with that as the URI.

Since we need to fill in the user/port combinations, refactor out
the code which does this on keypress and instead call that function,
but only once, and only after all the fields have been created.

Patch Set 1: No score

Note that this depends on http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,803 but since they are two repositories, I didn't know how to set up the dependencies between them.

Please let me know if I should refactor the name of the 'updateFields' method.

This also fixes the case where a presetUri is passed in, in that it now sets the user/parameter fields where before it wouldn't have.
