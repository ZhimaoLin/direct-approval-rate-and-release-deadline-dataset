> Please do not use windows line endings.

Good catch! I completely agree. I did not do this explicitly: there seems to be a bug when writing the preference file: the original file had the correct endings and when I changed the setting via UI it destroyed the existing line endings by using the platform line delimiter.

Just for the records: https://bugs.eclipse.org/384151 tracks the problem that changing a project setting also changes the line delimiter to the OS line delimiter.
