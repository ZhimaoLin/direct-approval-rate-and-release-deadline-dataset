The UI bundle was the one where I got hit many times, so I changed it there. Given no EGit committer changed it in any other project I didn't want to add it everywhere.

If you like the change I can make it across all bundles.

Patch Set 2:

FWIW this looks good, change it for all non-test bundles so that we use consistent options across projects
