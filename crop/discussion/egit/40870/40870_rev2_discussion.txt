DESCRIPTION

Lookup active window before opening commit selection dialog

Just seen that "Compare with Previous" will fail on Eclipse 3.8 due to
some bugs in HandlerUtil, if executed on a file which last version is a
merge version.

In this case we open a selection dialog (for selecting the merge
commit's predecessors version to compare against), and this makes the
"active window" variable disappear. The simple fix is to read the
variable before we open a dialog.
