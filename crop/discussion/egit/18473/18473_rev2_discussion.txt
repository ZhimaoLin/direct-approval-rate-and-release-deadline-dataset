DESCRIPTION

Blame annotations: Show diff in hover and enable blaming parent commits

This change extends the information that is shown when hovering over a
annotation revision:

A diff to each parent (normally just one) is shown. Only the hunk
concerning the current line is used to keep the diff small. This helps
in understanding what the blamed commit changed in the current line.

The text above the diff shows the parent commit ID and includes a link
to show the annotations of this parent commit. When clicked, a new
editor is opened for showing annotations for that commit. It also jumps
to the correct line.

Together, this enables quickly going through the history of a file and
inspect the changes that happened over time.

That's really cool!

Please have a look at my inline comments.

Line:296, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/blame/BlameInformationControl.java -> Line is too long

Line:343, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/blame/BlameInformationControl.java -> Maybe add

  diffFormatter.setContext(1);

here (see comment below).

Line:360, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/blame/BlameInformationControl.java -> I had two diffs only separated by two lines. As the default number of context lines is 3 (DiffFormatter.context) I didn't see the neighboring diff and was a little bit confused.

If you widen the range here to include the neigboring diffs there would still be a problem if there is another diff as a near neighbor to the first neighbor.

As there is already context visible in the editor itself, why not limting the context line to 1?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/a/an/

Line:296, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/blame/BlameInformationControl.java -> Done

Line:343, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/blame/BlameInformationControl.java -> Done. We could also set it to 0, but a bit of context is still nice I think.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
