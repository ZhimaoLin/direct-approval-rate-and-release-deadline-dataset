DESCRIPTION

Allow committing non workspace changes

The commit process is now based on files instead of resources. It is
possible to commit changes on files that do not belong to the
workspace. The commit dialog commits the changes of one single
repository.

Displaying diffs in the commit dialog for non workspace files needs to
be implemented in a follow-up commit.
