DESCRIPTION

Allow committing non workspace changes

The commit process is now based on files instead of resources. It is
possible to commit changes on files that do not belong to the
workspace. The commit dialog commits the changes of one single
repository.
Displaying diffs in the commit dialog for non workspace files needs to
be implemented in a follow-up commit.

Line:1002, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> gerrit shows this diff in a strange way ...

Line:1119, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> what if length > 1 ?

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> wouldn't it look cleaner if the null checks would be moved into buildFileList() ?

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> style nit: this line looks too wide

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> I think HashSet would be faster as in addUntracked() you call contains() which is O(n) for ArrayList but O(1) for HashSet

Line:203, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> style nit: looks like a blank is missing here

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would add a blank line here to separate the 2 paragraphs

Line:1119, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> It might happen that more than one resource exists for a given file (e.g. nested projects). Anyway, we just need a resource and can thus take the first.

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> I'm not sure. I like to do null checks on parameters early.

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> Done

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> Done
