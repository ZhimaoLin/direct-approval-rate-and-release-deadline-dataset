DESCRIPTION

Use current selection if menu selection is not available

Rebase, Fetch and Push command now use the current selection if the menu
selection is not available. Other handlers in EGit behave in the same
way. Furthermore this is a prerequisite for using SWTBotMenu.click in
the UI tests instead of using the ContextMenuHelper workaround.
