Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

I proposed an alternative implementation [1] extending the existing command instead of adding another menu entry along the lines of Wayne's proposal [2]

[1] Change Iaaddb1b51aa66ecd0e160fe4aaba19272939d54c
[2] http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg02359.html

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/PasteCommand.java -> no need for this anymore as http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,4058 has already been merged. Sorry, I wasn't aware that you are working on this.
