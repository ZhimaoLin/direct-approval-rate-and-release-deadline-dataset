DESCRIPTION

Consider logical models when staging files

We need to take the model providers into account when staging files.
This means that, once a file is staged, all necessary files for model
consistency will be added too.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

tried with your sample model:

we should not show the dialog "Selection Adjustment Required" since add wouldn't touch the involved files if none of them is dirty.
