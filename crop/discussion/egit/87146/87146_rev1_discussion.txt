DESCRIPTION

Fix DiffEditorOutline for pre-Neon Eclipse

In February 2016, default implementations were added to the
IContentProvider interface. Eclipse's before Neon do not have those,
thus content providers need to implement dispose() and inputChanged()
if a platform earlier than Eclipse Neon is targeted.
