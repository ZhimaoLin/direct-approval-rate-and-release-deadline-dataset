DESCRIPTION

Add a helper method to find repository from given resource path

In most cases we can use RepositoryMapping to find the repository
responsible for versioning a given resource. But the team framework
doesn't allow to use RepositoryMappings to find the repository for
resources in a closed project. Hence add a helper method to find the
repository based on comparison of resource path and the working tree
path of all repositories known to the RepositoryCache.
