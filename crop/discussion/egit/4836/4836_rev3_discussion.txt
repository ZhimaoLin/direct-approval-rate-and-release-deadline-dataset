DESCRIPTION

Git API does not declare GitAPIException call()

Anyone that calls a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just
the currently known exceptions.

During the process of cleaning this up a number of cases, but not all
cases where only checked exceptions were called into catching all
Exceptions except Error.

Bug: 366914
