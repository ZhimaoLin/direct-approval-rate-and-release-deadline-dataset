DESCRIPTION

Reload a project's git config when a project was reopened

It's good, in most cases, touching a project git config's content on a
disk as rarely as possible. But it's not the case when a project
explicitly had been closed and is reopened. Reload a git config's content
on a project open event.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:86, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> Don't you mean:

  && (delta.getFlags() & IResourceDelta.OPEN) != 0

here?  If I understand the Javadoc of getFlags() correctly we would want to verify the OPEN bit was set.

Line:88, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> Given how deeply nested this is, I wonder if the better way to open the method is to just say:

  if (delta == null
   || delta.getKind != IResourceDelta.CHANGED
   || (delta.getFlags() & IResourceDelta.OPEN) == 0)
    return;

as it removes two levels of indentation.  Though the negated logic may seem strange to some readers.

Line:108, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> These should go through Activator.logError so they are recorded inside of the workbench's Error Log view.
