DESCRIPTION

Share project: Allow "Create Repository" when repo exists in parent

When one has a .git e.g. in /home/username and a project somewhere
below, the only choice offered by the wizard was to use that repository.
This change also enables creating a new repository at the project
location (but only if such a repository does not already exist).
