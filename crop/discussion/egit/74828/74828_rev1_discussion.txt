DESCRIPTION

Paste in repo view need not log error

The PasteCommand shows an alert to the user _and_ logs an error. That's
overkill here. Just showing an alert is good enough. Besides, it's not
really an error.

Even better would be to deactivate the handler when the clipboard
doesn't contain a git repo location. But I suspect a property tester for
this would be rather expensive, so I opted for this simpler solution.

Also add a missing clipboard.dispose() in the FetchGerritChangePage.
