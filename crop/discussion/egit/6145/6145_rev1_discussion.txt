DESCRIPTION

[reflogView] Add a "copy" command and some minor UI improvements

* Add a "copy" command that copies the currently selected commit id into
the clipboard
* Make the table "full selection", as the current implementation is
confusing (there is no point to select a specific column in the table)
* Add some missing String externalization and mnemonics
