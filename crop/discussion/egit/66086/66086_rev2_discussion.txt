Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Hudson seems to have a problem. https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/8104/ was triggered and was successful, but Hudson didn't report back here. Second time I'm seeing this...

Anyway, looks good. Performance of the isOnBranch() operation appears to be about linear in the distance between branch tip and the commit selected, about 1.6ms for the tip commit itself, about 5ms some 10-20 commits back in my tests. (Tried it on the EGit repo.) So it's not exactly a cheap operation, but if used sparingly and (for now) only in a dynamic menu, it should be OK.

Patch Set 2:

Hudson also did not respond to this one, though the build seems to be hanging anyway:

Thanks for the performance test. I think this is unlikely to cause problems because releases are usually created from fairly recent commits. If it does cause problems, we should probably change the UI. I would be surprised if the performance is better when using RevWalks or something along those lines.
