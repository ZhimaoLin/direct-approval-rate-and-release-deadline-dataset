DESCRIPTION

Allow deleting multiple branches at once

From time to time, one wants to cleanup old and obsolete branches.
To help the user with this task, it is now possible to select multiple local
branches and delete them all at once. To improve user expierence, the
affected branches will be shown again in the dialog before confirmation.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

- verified tests and tried it, good :-)
- some minor issues (style nits, comment)

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteBranchCommand.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteBranchCommand.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:141, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteBranchCommand.java -> Currently branch deletion doesn't check if any commits would become unreachable from remaining branches. Setting the force update flag is not a minor thing which should go unnoticed for the user as this may result in data loss (if some commits become unreachable).

As the corresponding dialog text specifies this fact I think the logic is ok, but this comment should be corrected.
