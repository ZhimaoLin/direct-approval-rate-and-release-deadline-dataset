DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Reveal selected commit on filter change

When looking at the commit history of a resource, a common use case is
to select a commit and then wanting to see how this commits fits into
the history of the whole repository. With this change, this is now
easier because the selected commit is automatically revealed when
changing the filter.
