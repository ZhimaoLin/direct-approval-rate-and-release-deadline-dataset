Line:236, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> I think we should also check for !repo.isBare() before calling getWorkTree() here. You could combine that with the check for deleteWorkDir, as above:

if (deleteWorkDir && !repo.isBare()) {
  // ...
}
