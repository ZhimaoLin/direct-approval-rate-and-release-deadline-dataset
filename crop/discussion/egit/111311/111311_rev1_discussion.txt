DESCRIPTION

Provide property name for repository tree nodes

Provide a label to be used for all different kinds of repository tree
nodes, not only for the root repository node. This makes the IDE
property dialog display the "No properties" dialog with the correct node
label.

This patch does not really add new functionality, it only makes the
already implemented adapter available for more classes in the same
hierarchy.

Patch Set 1:

The change itself looks OK and may be a good idea in any case. But that "No properties" dialog shouldn't appear at all in the first place; the action should just not be available at all for these nodes.

Patch Set 1:

The problem is: I have absolutely no clue why the other nodes react to the properties handler. In /org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml, lines 4782ff. it looks like it should only be there for repository top nodes.

Since I'm bad in debugging commands and handlers, I'm lost now.
