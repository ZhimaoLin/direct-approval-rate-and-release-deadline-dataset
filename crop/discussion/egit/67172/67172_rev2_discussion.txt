DESCRIPTION

Make RepositoryMapping use java.nio.file.Path

org.eclipse.resources.Path.fromOSString normalizes paths. However, the
FileRepositoryBuilder returns paths like
/some/path/container/../.git/modules/... . If that get's normalized, we
end up with /some/path/.git/modules/... , which defeats the subsequent
attempt to relativize the string to ../.git/modules/... .

Using java.nio.file.Path, we can avoid this premature normalization,
and moreover we can create relative paths in way more cases.
