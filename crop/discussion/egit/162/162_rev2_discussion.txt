DESCRIPTION

With large repositories it is difficult to get a subset of projects because the import projects tree could not be filtered. 
Now the import projects uses a filtered tree which is commonly used inside eclipse,

The tree can be filtered with *text like syntax
If a project is selected it always stays in the view even if it does not match the filter
If a projects are deselected with the deselect all button they can be removed from the view if it does not match the filter string.
 This is done by calling setinput again. This is not done for individual deselections because that did not look right and I am not sure about the setinput overhead on really large repositories

I have tested this with the following repositories:
git://github.com/smilebase/org.eclipse.mylyn.github.git
git://github.com/aptana/studio.git
git://ecf1.osuosl.org/home/gitcvs
and the egit and jgit repositories


It was noticed that some of the aptana and ecf projects (notably the feature projects) were not attached to teaming 
after import. This is probably not caused by this change.
