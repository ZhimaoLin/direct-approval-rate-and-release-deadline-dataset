DESCRIPTION

Repository nodes should propagate adapters to their elements

Currently RepositoryTreeNodes containing references to File objects do
not propagate them via getAdapter(). By allowing them to do so we allow
other tools to contribute File based context menus to the Git Repository
selections.
