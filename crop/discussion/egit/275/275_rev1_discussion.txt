Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Hi,

it seems that the tests work with a 3.6 eclipse.

I have SWTBot version 2.0.0.486-dev-e35

Line:317, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/wizards/clone/GitCloneWizardTest.java -> I'd recommend using perspectiveByLabel() instead to make tests more readable.

Still figuring out how this thing works.

I'd recommend using perspectiveByLabel() to make tests more readable.
