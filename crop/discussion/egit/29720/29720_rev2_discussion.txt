Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/MergeActionHandler.java -> why are you changing the method name ?

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/MergeActionHandler.java -> I like the new name, the other sounds like it's just a getter, when it does more than that.

Line:1038, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> What would you suggest? This text is a title, so it should be in title case. As a title, "Merge Unavailable" sounds better than "Cannot Merge Now" to me. See also the other titles below, "Merge Canceled", "Merge Result".

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/MergeActionHandler.java -> It should express that the method has a side effect.
