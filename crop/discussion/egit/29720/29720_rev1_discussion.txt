DESCRIPTION

Show an explanation when a merge is not possible

Explain the reason the merge has failed instead of just showing "Cannot
merge now". This aligns the behavior with the
RepositoryActionHandler.canMerge method.

Oh, that's the same code duplicated in 3 places? Could you clean that up with this change?

I'd move the RepositoryActionHandler#canMerge method into a static method on MergeActionHandler that takes a Repository and a Shell, and then call it from the other 2 places.

Line:144, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/MergeHandler.java -> I'd rather pass in the Shell, it's the only thing that's used.

Line:1038, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> This is used as a title now, should be "Cannot Merge". Or maybe something more titley like "Merge Unavailable"?
