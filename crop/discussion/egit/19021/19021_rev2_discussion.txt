DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Enable to run commands when input is in a closed project

The team framework doesn't allow to lookup the RepositoryMapping for
resources located in a closed project. Hence we need to handle this
using path comparisons of working tree path of all known repositories
with the input's resource path.
