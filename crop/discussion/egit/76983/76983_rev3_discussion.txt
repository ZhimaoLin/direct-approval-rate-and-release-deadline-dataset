Patch Set 3:

I don't think adding additional configuration to block the UI is valuable. Why not simply running in the background? Who will like that his UI is blocked?

Patch Set 3:

Having this option is definitely a huge improvement over the current situation but I think always running in the background should be preferred if possible.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Let's see what the outcome of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77461/ is. If we remove the "Run in background" option there, we should not introduce it here.

Would be great if you could by default use background operations. We should leave blocking the UI to IntelliJ... ;-)

Of course we can. I just want to see what Matthias thinks about it. In any case Fetch from Gerrit and Push to Gerrit should use the same.

Speaking of IntelliJ: what about https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77356/ ?

looks good, please rebase and resolve conflicts

I think we don't need an option to run this in background but run it always in background as Lars proposed for Fetch from Gerrit
