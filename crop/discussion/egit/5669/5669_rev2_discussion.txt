DESCRIPTION

Prevent from NPE in RevUtils.getCommonAncestor

NPE in RevUtils.getCommonAncestor occurs when one of given commits id's
is null. To prevent for it we ensure that gerCommonAncestor is never
called with null arguments.

Also updates documentation for RevUtils.getCommonAncestor and adds not
null checks.
