DESCRIPTION

Show blame revisions in history view when selected

BlameOperation now listens for revision selection events
and shows/selects the commit in the history view for the
selected revision.

This changes the behavior to initially load the history view
while the editor ruler is being shown so it is ready to show
selections once the editor and gutter area are explored.
