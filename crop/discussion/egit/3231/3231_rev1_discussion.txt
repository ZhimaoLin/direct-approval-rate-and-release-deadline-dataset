Line:1001, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> Currently the action does nothing when more than one file is selected. Either disable the action or do anything, e.g. paste all file names separated by comma.

Line:513, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> spelling: "Commit Message" as in the dialog

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> spelling: pastes

Abandoned

Abandoned due to lack of response. And the functionality is already available with content assist.
