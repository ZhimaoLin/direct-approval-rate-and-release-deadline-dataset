DESCRIPTION

Share project should close related editors

If the user has an editor open of the projects he shares with Git, the
editor currently stays open. The user can still use the editor but as
soon as he tries to save, he gets an error message. This fix closes all
editors of the project to be shared and saves their content. This way no
content is lost and the user is not mislead that he can still change via
the old editorr
