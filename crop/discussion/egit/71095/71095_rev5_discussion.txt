DESCRIPTION

Share project should close related editors

If the user has an editor open of the projects he shares with Git, the
editor currently stays open. The user can still use the editor but as
soon as he tries to save, he gets an error message. This fix closes all
editors of the project to be shared and saves their content. This way no
content is lost and the user is not mislead that he can still change via
the old editorr

Line:157, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/SharingWizard.java -> why adding redundant type information ?

Line:194, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/SharingWizard.java -> style nit: unnecessary empty lines and bad formatting below

Line:204, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/SharingWizard.java -> in order to reduce the deep indentation below we can remove one level of indentation by inverting this condition

 if (editorsToBeClosed.isEmpty()) {
     return:
 }

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> this is a problem if he doesn't choose to create the repository in the parent folder of the current project location

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> editor
