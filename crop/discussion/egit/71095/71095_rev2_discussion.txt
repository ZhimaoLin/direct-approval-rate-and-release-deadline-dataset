DESCRIPTION

Share project should close related editors

If the user has an editor open of the projects he shares with Git, the
editor currently stays open. The user can still use the editor but as
soon as he tries to save, he gets an error message. This fix closes all
editors of the project to be shared and saves their content. This way no
content is lost and the user is not mislead that he can still change via
the old editorr

Line:200, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/SharingWizard.java -> I have big concern regarding the algorithm.

We know for sure people have < 100 editors open (Eclipse is simply unusable with higher number of editors), however there are projects with > 100000 files. There can be HUGE projects. Why should we collect lists with so many files?

All what we need is to iterate over the opened editor files and ask if the file.getProject() equals given project.
