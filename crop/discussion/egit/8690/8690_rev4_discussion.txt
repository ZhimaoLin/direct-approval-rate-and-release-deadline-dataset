Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This is a simple move method refactoring. If it can be reused elsewhere (and we can see Gunnar has other patches depending on this) then it's worth it. +1 from me.

Let's wait for bug 396884 and double check with Hudson. To be clear, it's a formality.

Patch Set 4:

I rebased the whole patch series. I squashed this change into Id113b941 (the previous one), as that one introduces the method which is moved in this change, which is awkward for reviewing. So this change can be abandoned.
