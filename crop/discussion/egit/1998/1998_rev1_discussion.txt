Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Passing null instead of a ResourceVariantByteStore instance could lead to NPEs in ResourceTreeVariant which doesn't check for null-ness when using the store field except if you can ensure that the affected methods of this class are never used from this test.

Patch Set 1:

Tested class GitResourceVariantTree never uses getByteStore() from ResourceVariantTree therefore the null value can be passed here.

If in feature GitResourceVariantTree will use byte store from parent class we will get here NPE, as you mentioned, but then this test should be fixed.
