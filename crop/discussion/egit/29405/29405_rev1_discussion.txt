Line:226, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/RefUpdateElement.java -> Not sure if this should still be with QUALIFIER_STYLER (that greys out the text). Did you leave this in on purpose or just switch the order? Maybe just greying out the arrow is enough, or don't grey out anything (haven't tried how it looks).

Line:227, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/RefUpdateElement.java -> Can you replace this with " \u2192 " and add a comment? It's not strictly necessary, but keeping the source to be ASCII is a bit safer (e.g. against bad editors).

Line:226, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/RefUpdateElement.java -> I just switched the order and kept everything.
Note that I don't see a difference between QUALIFIER_STYLER and normal black on my Ubuntu.

Line:227, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/RefUpdateElement.java -> Sure, will do.

Line:226, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/RefUpdateElement.java -> Really? Not even in other views like the repo view (the repo path is in grey)?

Looks like this here: http://i.imgur.com/LN9BIkD.png
