Line:106, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/GitResourceDeltaVisitor.java -> Why is this necessary here? This is a resource delta visitor: it always starts at the workspace root, and if you end up at a folder, you have traversed through the project before. Thus under what circumstances can one possibly get null here?

Line:311, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> Same question: how can we arrive in a resource delta traversal at a folder for which resource.getProject() returns null?

Line:106, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/GitResourceDeltaVisitor.java -> Right, we can skip it here. I've just went over all occurencies and added NP checks.

Line:311, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> Same as before.
