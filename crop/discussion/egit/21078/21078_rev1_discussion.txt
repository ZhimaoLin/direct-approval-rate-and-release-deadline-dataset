DESCRIPTION

Avoid cleaning if selection is empty.

The current implementation runs the git clean command even if no file or
directory is selected in the clean wizard. That may take quite some time
and may lead to cleaning the repository (if I understood the underlying
jgit command right), although the user expected nothing to be cleaned.

If there is a useful workflow for running the clean command without any
selection of to be cleaned paths, then this should be implemented by an
additional top level radio button "Clean all resources" or the like.

Wouldn't disabling the "Finish" button in that case be even better? So that it's clear to the user that they either have to select some files or cancel the dialog.
