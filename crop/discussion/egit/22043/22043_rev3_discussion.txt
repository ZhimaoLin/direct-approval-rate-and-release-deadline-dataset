DESCRIPTION

Make the ContainerTreeIterator recognize symbolic links

We cannot rely on Eclipse's resource handling here since it
looks at the link target rather than the link itself.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

- rebased
- the NPE is fixed by the jgit patch :-)
- now we have a base to explore further problems to fix on the way to proper symlink support, I did a bit more testing and found a couple of issues in the staging view and filed a couple of bugs for these problems and linked them to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429304
