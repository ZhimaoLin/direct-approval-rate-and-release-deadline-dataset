DESCRIPTION

Remove superfluous "Do you want to continue" in repository delete

The two "do you want to continue?"-questions looks strange in a
confirmation dialog and they also cause layout problems when the whole
text is not displayed. Since it is a confirmation dialog, remove the
extra question.
