DESCRIPTION

Remove superfluous "Do you want to continue" in repository delete

The two "do you want to continue?"-questions looks strange in a
confirmation dialog and they also cause layout problems when the whole
text is not displayed. Since it is a confirmation dialog, remove the
extra question.

Line:981, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> This doesn't work as on certain platforms (OS X, GNOME 3), the title of the modal dialog is not displayed. This is what it looks for me:

Line:981, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> I see; the text is reused in two different dialogs. I always get the title though. Will break out the strings.
