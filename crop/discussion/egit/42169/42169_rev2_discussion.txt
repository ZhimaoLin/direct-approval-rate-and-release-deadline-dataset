Matthias, sorry for the inconvenience, per mistake I pushed this commit (and the next one) directly on 3.7. How we should proceed now?

Patch Set 2:

If they are identical to the 2 alternate incarnations still in review everything is fine,
I had already reviewed them and voted +2. If there is some difference you need to fix just push another change for what needs to be fixed. Abandon the 2 duplicates which are still in review.

I think we should file a bug for webmaster asking him to remove direct push permissions also for committers to avoid such mistakes.
