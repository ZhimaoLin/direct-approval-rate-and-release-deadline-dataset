Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:240, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTable.java -> Should we instead put this into a utility class?  The method is used twice, which is probably why we put it into the Activator in the first place... to avoid duplicating it.
