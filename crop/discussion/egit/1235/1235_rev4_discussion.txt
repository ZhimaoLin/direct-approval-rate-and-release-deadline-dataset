Patch Set 4:

Rebased to current master. What exactly are you doing to get the nullpointer?
With the checkbox, I agree, but would rather do this in a separate change, what do you think?

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Hm, can't seem to reproduce the NPE at will. Currently I'm unable to find a scenario to reproduce it. Maybe there was something wrong with my test project. I think we should leave it as is (tested it with several scenarios) and if it happens again, I'll open a bug.

Another change for the checkbox: +1
