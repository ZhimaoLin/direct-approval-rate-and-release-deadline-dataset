DESCRIPTION

Project deletion fails if project is closed and contains .git

There is pre-delete project listener that reconfigures the windows
cache. This listener takes effect only if the project is open -
RepositoryProvider.getProvider() returns null if the project is closed.

This patch makes the listener to fallback to using java.io API if the
project is closed.
