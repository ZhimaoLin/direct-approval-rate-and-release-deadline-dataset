DESCRIPTION

Respect whitespace visibility preferences in commit message editors

Since Eclipse 3.7, it's possible to configure which/where whitespace
characters should be visible (e.g. only show trailing spaces). Respect
these preferences in the commit dialog and staging view.

This filtering is a nice feature I didn't know :-)

Before this change line breaks in the staging view were always LF with this change they are flipped to CR, this looks wrong

Yes, me neither, nice addition :).

Very strange. It looks the same for me before and after this change, I get this symbol: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow

The only thing we do differently is using the other constructor of WhitespaceCharacterPainter, but looking at its code I don't see what could be causing this change.

Could you maybe debug drawCharRange in WhitespaceCharacterPainter?

Could be (I'm on Linux). Do you also see this in other text editors?

Maybe it has to do with the segment listener, could you try if disabling hard-wrap makes a difference?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Looks like the lines added by the signed-off-by button use CR and the change-id button seems to flip all line endings to CR :-(

Probably I used a test repository configured for Gerrit (gerrit.createchangeid = true) and hence always saw CR.

I tried without this change and found this problem is unrelated to this change so I am going to include this nice change in stable-3.2 and hence will move it to stable-3.2
