DESCRIPTION

Check target of linked resources in action handler isEnabled

The fix provides stronger checks on selected linked resources before
enabling menu items. In particular, linked resources that point to a
file that is part of a project shared with egit are allowed to be
operated on. Otherwise team actions are disabled if the selection
contains a linked resource pointing to a file outside any project and
repository. A default isEnabled() implementation is provided for this
behavior. After adding a test case a couple more handlers have been
amended and made compliant.

I think there are changes that really don't belong here, and that you did not mean to commit along this change set. See comments.

Line:86, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> I fail to see how this relates to stronger test for linked resources. Did you really mean to commit this into this change set?
