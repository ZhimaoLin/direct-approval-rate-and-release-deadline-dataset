DESCRIPTION

If a project has a single git repository, return it from
RepositoryMappings.getMappingAllowUnmappedProject().  This allows to
support the case when the whole project is not git code versioned, but
only linked source directories are versioned.

The code looks OK to me in that it does what it says; but I'm not sure whether the purpose of the code change makes sense, so I defer to others more knowledgable on the subject.

Alex, I have two other patches ready that depend on this patch:

* Make project git properties work for a project where the source directory is an Eclipse link, and only it is inside a git repository.

* Make git decorators work for the same project style.

I have talked to Yoselin Hanna, and he is aware of the big picture of what I am trying to achieve with this series of patches.

Please advise how to proceed.

I propose you upload the whole series so that we see what you want to achieve. What about some tests ?

Skirmantas,

Do you have other dependent changes you'd propose to add?
