DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] task activation integration support

This change enables the automatic creation or checkout of branches
according to the activated mylyn task. If there's no context in the
task, a dialog appears, where the repositories can be selected. If
there's a context, the resources of that context are browsed and the
contained Git repositories are selected for branch creation/checkout.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Missing features:

-What happens at task deactivation?
-Currently the branch name is calcutated from Bug ID / Key, maybe part of the title should be there
-Storing of the configuration of the repositories that are affected in the context (no need to browse the whole context, maybe better performance)
-Make this feature configurable

Looks good, I like where this is going!

- What happens at task deactivation?

by default and easiest solution would be to go back to master. We could add a preference and allow people to choose to go back to master always or the last branch you were on (we would have to remember this in EGit via a preference probably or even better, just check the git ref log)

Patch Set 1:

I would prefer to go back to origin/master as this is closest to what the upstream master has
