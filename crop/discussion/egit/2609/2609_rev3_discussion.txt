DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] task activation integration support

This change enables the automatic creation or checkout of branches
according to the activated mylyn task. If there's no context in the
task, a dialog appears, where the repositories can be selected. If
there's a context, the resources of that context are browsed and the
contained Git repositories are selected for branch creation/checkout.

Line:18, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/AutoStart.java -> Why do we need this?

Line:24, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/plugin.xml -> why do we need this at all? Autostarting bundles is bad...

Line:24, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/plugin.xml -> Currently i register the TaskActivationListener in the start method of this bundle, so without autostart, the listener wouldn't be registered:

manager = TasksUi.getTaskActivityManager();
listener = new TaskActivationListener();
manager.addActivationListener(listener);

I'll check if there's an extension point in Mylyn, which we can use.
