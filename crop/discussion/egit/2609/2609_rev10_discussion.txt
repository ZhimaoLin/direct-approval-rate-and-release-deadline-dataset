DESCRIPTION

Automated branching on task activation

This change enables the automatic checkout of branches on task
activation. On task deactivation, a project set file is stored in the
task context containing all referenced repositories and their respective
branches. On task activation the branch state is restored from the
context.

Rebased code to compile with master branch of egit

Patch Set 10:

With https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/5457/  the code is building successfully.
Therefore the commits are in the wrong order, but I have no idea how to "fix" this in gerrit.

Patch Set 10:

- which commits / changes do you need in which order ?
- you can reorder commits using interactive rebase, just stick to the existing change-ids contained in the commit messages of the commits you are reordering and gerrit should be fine with a reordered sequence of changes depending on each other
- if you need assistance let me know

Line:28, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn-feature/feature.xml -> does this feature include the bundle org.eclipse.mylyn.versions.core ?

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> can we find a better name here, this one sounds odd

Line:72, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> why should we ignore exceptions here ?

Line:102, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> fix this todo

Line:134, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> fix todo

Line:159, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> I would add braces here to improve readability

Line:163, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> should we really ignore this or better notify the user that he is trying to use a malformed psf file ? I would at least log the problem

Line:184, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> can't we use org.eclipse.jgit.transport.RemoteConfig here ?

Line:202, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> fix todo

Line:207, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskActivationListener.java -> this can be inlined

Line:25, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> specify the required version range, for 3rd party dependencies we use a range from the minimum required version up to the next major version to allow egit to run on a variety of underlying platform versions

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> s/3.3.0/[3.3.0,3.4.0)/

Line:33, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> s/3.3.0/[3.3.0,3.4.0)/

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> this sentence shouldn't be part of the commit message as it only describes how you created this patchset from a previous one, so this should rather be part of a review comment. It doesn't add value to the project history when this change is submitted

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think you should give credit to some more co-authors, have a look at the license headers to find them, the email address you are listing for Manuel doesn't match another email address listed in some of the license headers.

(6 comments)

Covered review feedback from Douglas Trujillo, excluding TaskActivationListener.java. I will try to improve this file as much as possible, but e.g. regarding the usage of org.eclipse.jgit.transport.RemoteConfig I think I can't help (no jgit experience at all).
How could this be solved?

Line:28, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn-feature/feature.xml -> No. This leacked in from the old patches.
It shall be org.eclipse.mylyn.versions.core.
Done.

Line:25, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:33, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I hope that I now did it right:
I readded the signed-off and also-by lines and included all the authors of new files (not from modified ones).
Because Manuel use in the last changes the googlemail email address I changed the license header.
