DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] task activation integration support

This change enables the automatic creation or checkout of branches
according to the activated mylyn task.
If a new task is activated, the branch to create can be chosen with
a dialog. On task deactivation, a Project Set file is stored besides
the Mylyn context zip file. This file is read on task activation
to determine the branches and repositories.
