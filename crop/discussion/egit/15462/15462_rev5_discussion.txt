DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] If "Expand All" was selected, keep expanding new nodes

If a user always wants to see all the files, they can now click "Expand
All" and new nodes will also be expanded (as opposed to being collapsed
initially). As soon as the user collapses anything, this auto-expand
mode is disabled again.
