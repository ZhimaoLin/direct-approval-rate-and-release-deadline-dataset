DESCRIPTION

Improve DiscardChangesAction

Currently DiscardChangesAction (Trigger: Replace With->File in Git 
Index) runs in the UI thread. This might block the UI. Furthermore 
the discard operation is located in the action.
Now DiscardChangesAction uses a Job to execute. The discard operation
was moved in a new class DiscardChangesOperation.
