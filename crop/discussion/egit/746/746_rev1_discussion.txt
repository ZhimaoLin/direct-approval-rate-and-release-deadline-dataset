I believe this time around we should modify the wikitext task to include http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Git_For_Eclipse_Users

What do you think?

Patch Set 1:

Ok, I agree. 

Do you have any hints what needs to be tweaked in the ant script to get the second wiki page in ?

The version of wikitext that we were using previously was old so we need to make sure we pickup the latest one from Helios... it has the flexibility to grab entries from different wiki pages. I documented this process here:

http://wiki.eclipse.org/DocumentationGuidelines/CrowdSourcingExample

We can greatly simplify the script with the new wikitext to. We have a bug to do this already :)

Patch Set 1:

With the change
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,745
we are fetching always the latest jars available on
http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/weekly/e3.4
currently we get there
org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core-1.3.0.I20100521-1600-e3x.jar
and
org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.mediawiki.core-1.3.0.I20100521-1600-e3x.jar

If we need newer jars I need the URL of the corresponding p2 repository.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I will integrate the other wiki pages Chris mentioned and propose a new patch
