DESCRIPTION

Make nested classes static

Static nested classes are preferrable since they have fewer dependencies than non-static classes where
hard-to-remove dependencies can easily enter.

I generally dislike nested classes, however making them static is right here. In the future, we should consider refactoring out label providers into a shared and global one. I have opened bug 316929 to track this enhancement.
