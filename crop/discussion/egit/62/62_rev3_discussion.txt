DESCRIPTION

Fix dialog to select Git repository location

Previously the dialog had several bugs, this change:

- Prevents infinite loop if multiple repository mappings were found

- Removed break statement which prevents from inspecting upper levels

- Fixed logic to find any existing git repositories. It never
  searched parent directories for a linked resource or project
  itself due to an extra 'else' statement.

- Enabled repository creation if there is no '.git/' directory in
  the project's root.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Fixed a few minor style nits, and an NPE when the while loop created new TreeItems but didn't populate their data member with the IProject.
