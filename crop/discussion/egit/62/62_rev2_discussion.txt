DESCRIPTION

Dialog to select Git repository location is fixed:

- Method extracted to create a tree item with a git directory
- Prevents infinite loop if multiple repository mappings were found
- Removed break statement which prevents from inspecting upper levels
- Fixed logic to find an existing git repositories. It never searched
  parent directories for a linked resource or project itself due to an
  extra 'else' statement.
- Enabled repository creation if there is no '.git/' directory in the
  project's root.
