I have another objection: we shouldn't have performance tests in our regular test suite at all.

Patch Set 2:

We need some type of smoke test to ensure we don't break the speed of the sync view. We could create a new plug-in that hosts the performance tests and use the existing org.eclipse.test.performance framework or something else.

Patch Set 2:

Chris, why you suggest to have a separate project for performance tests?
