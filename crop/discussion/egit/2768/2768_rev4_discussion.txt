DESCRIPTION

RFC [sync] Add performance test for synchronize view

I've see here two issues:
* LocalRepositoryTestCase (and all it dependencies) is copy-pasted from
  ui.test project, can we somehow link those two projects?
* running performance tests from maven currently doesn't work. Tycho
  complains that it can't find bundle for org.eclipse.test.performance.
  Additionally we should save test results in Derby DB so that we can
  compare new results against old ones and discover performance
  regression.

Patch Set 4: Abandoned

I think that after new synchronize implementation this change isn't needed any more.
