DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Add Delete action for untracked files

If the selection only includes workspace resources, the normal
DeleteResourceAction is used. Because of this, the delete can even be
undone. This change also makes the undo and redo menu items available
when the staging view is focused for this to be discoverable.

If the selection includes a non-workspace resource, the action is
carried out by a new DeleteResourcesOperation, which can handle
non-workspace resources. This has no undo support though.

The new operation can later also be used for offering Delete for Working
Directory files in the Repositories view.

Patch Set 2:

- rebased
- when non-workspace file is deleted the staging view gets updated automatically that's nice, but why is it not auto-updated when deleting a workspace resource ?

Patch Set 2:

Strange, it works here. When deleting workspace resources, it should trigger a normal resource change event, which should be picked up by IndexDiffCacheEntry, which in turn should update the Staging View.

Do you have the Staging View linked or not?
