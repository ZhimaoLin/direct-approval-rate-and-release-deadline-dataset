Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think you're using the wrong control, Kevin.

Line:577, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> CLabel doesn't render hyperlinks. Did you mean to use a Link control instead?

Line:577, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> The link is on line 583, I switched to a CLabel for the text and icon so we don't need an extra control and so it could degrade gracefully when not enough space exists for both the icon and text.
