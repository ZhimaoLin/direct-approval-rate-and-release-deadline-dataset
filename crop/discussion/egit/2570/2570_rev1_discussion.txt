Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

This might fix current broken build. Now failing job tries to resolve maven-reporting-impl:jar:2.1 in codehaus.snapshots which is wrong.

Chris, what do you think?

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

we don't need this anymore as we now use the release findbugs-maven-plugin 2.3.2
