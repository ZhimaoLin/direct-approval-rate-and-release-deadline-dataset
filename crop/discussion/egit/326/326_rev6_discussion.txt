DESCRIPTION

Add .gitignore capabilities to EGit

Adds .gitignore capabilities to EGit. The ignore cache is
initialized once fully on creation, then updated via an
IResourceChangeListener from then on. Updating is coupled to
GitLightweightDecorator, which already does a check for changes
to .gitignore files.

Patch Set 6:

The attached patch requires some small changes in JGit to add a cache to the Repository class. I will revisit this change when changes in 1156 are complete.

This implementation would walk the tree once upon creation and then uses change listeners to update ignore rules as .gitignore/exclude files are modified/added/deleted.
