DESCRIPTION

Revert "Small performance improvement in CommitFileRevision" and "Fix
NPE while opening CompareView for oldest commit"

It appears that commit "Fix NPE while opening CompareView for oldest
commit" with was fixing bug 322732 was only
workaround. In previous implementation of
GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() we were using LogCommand to
calculate complete list of commits between to given points.
LogCommand.addRange(AnyObjectId, AnyObjectId) internally calls
RevWalk.markUnimportant(RevCommit) on first given AnyObjectId to
addRange() method. RevWalk implementation disposes commits that was
marked as unimportant when traversal has finish. Because we were joining
results of two LogCommands (since common ancestor to destination and
since ancestor to source) the common ancestor commit was included in
commits list but it was disposed by RevWalk, therefore we got an NPE
while launching Compare view. Current implementation of
GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() uses single RevWalk instance and
don't mark any commit as unimportant therefore it is free from NPE in
CommitFileRevision.
