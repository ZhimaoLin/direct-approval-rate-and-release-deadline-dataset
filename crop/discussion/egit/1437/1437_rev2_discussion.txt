DESCRIPTION

Revert changes made by commits d28a02 and ff8863

It appears that commit ff8863 with was fixing bug 322732 was only
workaround. In previous implementation of
GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() we were using LogCommand to
calculate complete list of commits between to given points.
LogCommand.addRange(AnyObjectId, AnyObjectId) internally calls
RevWalk.markUnimportant(RevCommit) on first given AnyObjectId to
addRange() method. RevWalk implementation disposes commits that was
marked as unimportant when traversal has finish. Because we were joining
results of two LogCommands (since common ancestor to destination and
since ancestor to source) the common ancestor commit was included in
commits list but it was disposed by RevWalk, therefore we got an NPE
while launching Compare view. Current implementation of
GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() uses single RevWalk instance and
don't mark any commit as unimportant therefore it is free from NPE in
CommitFileRevision.

Patch Set 2: IP review completed

The 48b45f was miss pasted it should be ff8863.

This commit is a plain revert of d28a02 and ff8863. Both commits can be revert thanks of new implementation of RevModelRepository.getChildrenImpl()

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Refer to the revreted commit using words rather than hex digits. That may
be a challenge but the subject line does need the precision. Since we
sometimes rebase maybe we should refer to change id's instead.
