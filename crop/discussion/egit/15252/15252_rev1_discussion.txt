DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Ask whether to remove/delete repo when pressing Delete

Before, it would always show the "Delete Repository..." dialog. Now it's
more like other Eclipse behavior in that the Delete key also offers to
just remove the selection without deleting anything.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

- in the context menu of repository nodes in the repositories view the entry "Delete Repository..." lost its icon through this change
- placing the cancel button between "Delete Repository..." and "Remove" looks a bit odd maybe since the cancel button has the smallest width, any reason for this order ?
