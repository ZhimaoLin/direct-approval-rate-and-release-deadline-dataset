DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Ask whether to remove/delete repo when pressing Delete

Before, it would always show the "Delete Repository..." dialog. Now it's
more like other Eclipse behavior in that the Delete key also offers to
just remove the selection without deleting anything.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

* Icon fixed (didn't notice this because my theme does not show any icons at all in context menus)
* The cancel button placement is actually platform-specific and done by Eclipse (note that cancel is listed last in the code). You can compare it with "Delete Working Set", select a working set and press the Delete key -> cancel is also in the middle.
