DESCRIPTION

Offer to create branch when checking out remote-tracking branch

A common mistake for new users of EGit is that they want to work on a
branch existing on a remote and therefore check out the remote-tracking
branch. Instead the right thing to do would have been to create a new
local branch based on it.

This change shows a question whether to create a new local branch or
whether to check out the commit behind the remote-tracking branch.

To make it clear that there will be a question, the label is
"Checkout..." instead of "Checkout" when a remote-tracking branch is
selected.

For advanced users already knowing about this, the question dialog is
not shown when the warning about "detached HEAD" is disabled.

looks good 

I don't like these wide buttons, I think tweaking the layout like I3a5a89135b5c580d54aa3ae38064187ca46bb363 looks nicer

Patch Set 4:

What did you think about the suggestion to change "Checkout as New Local Branch" to "Checkout as Local Branch" to make it a bit shorter?

Ah, and seems this made the cut for 3.1, nice :).
