DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Don't accept arbitrary drops

Previously, the staging view would stage the selected files, even when
an unrelated drop happened (by mistake), e.g. from a file from the
Package Explorer. The same with unstaging.

By checking that the event data is actually a StagingEntry (i.e. the
drag was started from the staging view), we ensure that no accidental
drops can cause staging.
