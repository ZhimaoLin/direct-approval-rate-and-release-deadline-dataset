DESCRIPTION

Clear RepositoryCache after each test to fix core tests

With this fix the core test suite is running also on Mac. Reason for the
failures before was the usage of out-dated Repository instances
contained in RepositoryCache which caused spurious failures when
running the full test suite while running tests individually always
succeeded.

A follow-up fix should care for the life cycle of Repository objects
in RepositoryCache.
