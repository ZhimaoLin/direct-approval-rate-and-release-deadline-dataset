Patch Set 2:

Not convinced. "Close" implies that clicking the button will just close the dialog. But if there are rebase conflicts, the user has a number of options like starting the merge tool. Can we give that button a meaningful name other than "Close" in that case?

Patch Set 2:

Yes, we can show different button labels based on the rebase result. Do you have a suggestion? Maybe simply "Close and Continue" for the case you don't only close the dialog?

How about IDialogConstants.PROCEED_LABEL if we're in the conflict case and the user did not select "do nothing", and IDialogConstants.CLOSE_LABEL otherwise?

(BTW, that might also be a solution for the FetchFromGerritPage: use "Proceed" unless the user had chosen "update FETCH_HEAD only", in which case we'd show "Fetch").

Or, if a dynamic button text is too complicated or too confusing, just use "Proceed" always?

"Proceed" sounds good to me.
