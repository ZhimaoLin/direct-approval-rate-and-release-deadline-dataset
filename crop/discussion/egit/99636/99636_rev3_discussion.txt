Patch Set 3:

Thanks for your remarks. I pushed an update. Maybe you can have a look. As it is done for the title and the status text, I added a method to get the button label based on the rebase result. For now, if status is EDIT, CONFLICTS, STOPPED, INTERACTIVE_PREPARED or STASH_APPLY_CONFLICTS the button label will be "Proceed", otherwise "Close". What do you think? Any suggestions regarding the switch cases?

Line:221, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/RebaseResultDialog.java -> Default texts defined here are OK for me.

Line:517, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/RebaseResultDialog.java -> I think it would be nice if the default button label changed to "Close" when this button is selected. Just add 

  getButton(getDefaultButtonIndex()).setText(IDialogConstants.CLOSE_LABEL);

to this if-statement, and the same with PROCEED_LABEL in the other three radio button listeners. (And BTW, all these listeners could be changed to SelectionAdapter and all the no-op overrides of widgetDefaultSelected could then be removed.)
