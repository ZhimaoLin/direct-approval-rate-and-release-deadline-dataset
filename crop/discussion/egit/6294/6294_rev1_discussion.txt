DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Don't show other warnings when commit is not allowed

If a commit is not allowed (e.g. in conflicts state), the author and
committer text fields are set to empty. This lead to the status of the
commit message component to be not OK, and a warning was shown: "Invalid
committer specified".

Instead of the warning about the committer, we now show the message why
committing is not allowed at the moment. This message can be further
improved later to help the user, e.g. "Please resolve conflicts and then
commit".

can you provide steps how to test this ? I tried with a conflicting state but the staging view doesn't show any of the described messages, also author and committer are set

Try this:

* Have the Stating View in "Link with Editor and Selection" mode
* Clone the jgit repo, switch to stable-2.0, add a conflicting change (I used MetaFilter, added a comment after serveRegex method)
* Switch to master, merge stable-2.0 -> Merge will be conflicting
* Switch to Staging View

For me, this results in this state: http://imgur.com/GMjgr
