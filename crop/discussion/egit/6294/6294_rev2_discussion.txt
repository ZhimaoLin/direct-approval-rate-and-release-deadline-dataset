DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Don't show other warnings when commit is not allowed

If a commit is not allowed (e.g. in conflicts state), the author and
committer text fields are set to empty. This lead to the status of the
commit message component to be not OK, and a warning was shown: "Invalid
committer specified".

Instead of the warning about the committer, we now show the message why
committing is not allowed at the moment. This message can be further
improved later to help the user, e.g. "Please resolve conflicts and then
commit".
