DESCRIPTION

Regression fix: display of diff for stashes

Commit e5054ed2 fixed an NPE when trying to show a diff for a merge
commit by suppressing the diff and displaying an error message instead
for commits with more than one parent. Stashes also have more than one
parent (index and HEAD), but for those we can actually display a diff.

Adapt the check to account for stashes.
