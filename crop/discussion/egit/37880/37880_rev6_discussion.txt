DESCRIPTION

Don't let ignored resources cause index update jobs.

Changes to ignored resources cause deltas fired by eclipse. These deltas
will cause index update jobs even though there is nothing to do. In the
worst case, a lot of resources are changed, and even though nothing
happened to tracked files, a full re-index is done because the changed
resource count threshold was reached.

Patch Set 6:

I tried to update only sub-trees on .gitignore changes, but that does not seem to work so easily. There must be more on this somehow. I validated that the update jobs runs as expected, but the staging view does not get hold of the new state. The icon decorator for the package explorer does notice the changes in .gitignore after a second... Also one of the new unit tests is then failing when waiting for an update after deleting the .gitignore.

I'm pretty puzzled on what is going on - no idea... If you have some idea, or a little time to find out what is going on...?

Still I did the test adaptions.

I've tested it now on our repo - looks good. 
This path (almost always) eliminates a need in the repo update at all on "clean build".

Line:89, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/GitResourceDeltaVisitor.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

store path.lastIndexOf('/') and cache it in a local variable then we don't need to scan the same string twice if a slash is contained

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheTest.java -> this wait time is too long, it's increasing test run time for org.eclipse.core.test from 68sec to 91sec (on my Mac). I think 1sec wait time should be sufficient.
