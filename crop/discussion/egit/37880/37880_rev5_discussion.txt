DESCRIPTION

Don't let ignored resources cause index update jobs.

Changes to ignored resources cause deltas fired by eclipse. These deltas
will cause index update jobs even though there is nothing to do. In the
worst case, a lot of resources are changed, and even though nothing
happened to tracked files, a full re-index is done because the changed
resource count threshold was reached.

I tried all egit.core tests locally and they work... don't know what hudson is up to.

Andrey, are you OK with the unit tests I wrote now?

Markus, see also https://git.eclipse.org/r/38205 which probably will help you with your original startup issue.

Patch Set 5:

Hey. Thanks for testing. I will do the mentioned improvements.

The other change would not have solved only very little for me. The largest chunk of changes that happen are ignored files. I myself (manually) nearly never change 1000 files at once. So if the amount is never reached, it would be OK for me to batch them together. Maybe 400ms is a little bit long, yes, but OTOH, 10ms may be a little bit short, right? :)
