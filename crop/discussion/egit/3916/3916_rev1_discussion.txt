DESCRIPTION

Allow dragging of commits from History view

User are now able to drag & drop a commit into other applications (eg.
text editor or file explorer) and will get the patch for this specific
commit. Furthermore this allows better integration with existing plugins
like Mylyn - drag and drop a commit onto the task editor to attach the
commit as patch to the task.

This is a great feature.

Please see my inline comment.

Line:611, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTable.java -> You now use the default 0 for the number of context lines. I would prefer that we also use the same default here as in the patch wizard.

Maybe we could even make the default number of context lines configurable with a new preference?

Line:611, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTable.java -> Not sure if a new preference would be overkill for this. I introduced a new default number for context lines for now. If we decide to introduce a pref for this, I'd suggest to do this in an additional commit.
