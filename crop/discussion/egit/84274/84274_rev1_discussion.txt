DESCRIPTION

Add m2e to Egit Oomph setup

Not all Eclipse packages contain the m2e integration. Therefore the
editor for the egit POM files may be missing (as in my local
installation). By adding m2e to the Oomph setup we make sure that POM
files can be edited easily.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Editing support for pom files which are modified rarely is a pretty weak argument for installing m2e which to my experience tends to slow down Eclipse by contacting remote Maven repositories at random times. As we use target platforms to setup the classpath in Eclipse I'd prefer to not install m2e
