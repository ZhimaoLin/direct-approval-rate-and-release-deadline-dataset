Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

(1 inline comment)

- rebased to make it compile against 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
- could you provide a change or change series (I suspect you already have it) which can start this page ?

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/search/CommitResultLabelProvider.java -> style nit: we rather use @Override xxx@xxx.xxx tags
