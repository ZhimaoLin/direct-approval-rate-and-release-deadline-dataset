DESCRIPTION

[sync] Add 'Synchronize Workspace' action

In most cases users would like to compare theirs local changes with
latest commit in repository. Adding 'Synchronize Workspace' action
into project's context menu reduce common day-to-day workflow of
synchronization.

Currently this action fully reuse code from 'normal' synchronization
model, but in feature we can easily introduce separate synchronization
participant that will be specialized for this task.
