DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Introduce 'Synchronize Workspace' action

In most cases users would like to compare theirs local changes with
latest commit in repository. Adding 'Synchronize Workspace' action
into project's context menu reduce common day-to-day workflow of
synchronization.

Currently this action fully reuse code from 'normal' synchronization
model, but in feature we can easily introduce separate synchronization
participant that will be specialized for this task.

I like the idea of this feature! I wonder if this could replace "Synchronize..." on projects and we move the full-fledged Synchronize Action into the Repository view instead of the team menu.

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> Please omit the "..." as this action doesn't need a dialog. "..." is only used on actions that will open up a dialog

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SynchronizeWorkspaceActionHandler.java -> Not sure what you tried to achive with
 repos.length != repos.length
should rather be
 repos.length == 0

Actually I'm thinking about having three separate synchronize actions in team menu:

* synchronize with workspace (it will be equivalent to HEAD vs HEAD with included locally made changes)
* synchronize with remote tracking (if remote tracking branch is specified it will launch HEAD vs remote_tracking with included locally mange changes)
* custom synchronization (where user can configure via sync-dialog what branches he want to synchronize/compare)
