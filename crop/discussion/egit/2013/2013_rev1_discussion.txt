DESCRIPTION

Change the graph table to automatically grab all available space

The commit graph table in the 'History' view currently leaves a lot
of extra unused horizontal space. This causes it to clip the last
column despite the fact that it could expand that column's width
to show all of the content of that column. The fix is to alter the
table's layout to force its columns to always take up the all the
space that's available.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

I kind of like that behavior better than the current one, but the problem is that there is no scrollbar anymore that allows me to scroll to the right to see the stuff that doesn't fit into the current width of the table (see screenshot). Is there a way to fix this?

Where do I see this screenshot? I don't see a link here or in Bugzilla. Though I think I know what you're talking about.

It's really hard to get it to expand beyond the allocated space because it's "preset" to be 100%. I think you need to resize the first two or last two columns a few times to (somehow) force the final column to be capable of going beyond the allocated space (100%) of the table. I'm not aware of any straightforward workarounds off-hand.

Sorry, I got interrupted in the middle of writing this... The attachment is now in bugzilla. If we can't resolve that problem, how should we continue then?
