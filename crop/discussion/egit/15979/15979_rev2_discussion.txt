DESCRIPTION

Do not abort when the user tries to start a nested rebase

When the user tries to start rebase in the middle of another rebase do
not abort since this could destroy the work done while resolving
conflicts in the first rebase. Instead display a warning and give hints
how to proceed.

Patch Set 2:

Why not disallow starting a new rebase in the first place by disabling the commands?

Patch Set 2:

disabling would prevent the problem but users may wonder why the action is disabled

any idea how we could provide this hint when the corresponding menus are disabled ?

Patch Set 2:

The status "rebasing" is already shown as decoration on the project and staging view, or am I remembering incorrectly (can't check right now)? Also, the user should see that skip and abort are enabled, which also means that a rebase is in progress.
