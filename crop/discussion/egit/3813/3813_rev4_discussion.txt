DESCRIPTION

Consider logical model when replacing files

When replacing files from the repository, we should ask all model
providers if this set of resources is consistent in itself or if we
need to replace more resources to have a consitent model.

Patch Set 4:

tried with your sample model:

we should not show the dialog "Selection Adjustment Required" if replace wouldn't touch the involved files as there is no diff. E.g. if the selected resource including its dependent model files are unchanged and the user clicks "Replace With > HEAD Revision" there is no need to show this dialog as the operation is a null op anyway.
