Line:289, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> Why the change for the space before {branch_status}? The space inside it is a deliberate format instruction for only putting the space iff branch_status is non-empty. Otherwise the label looks like "[repo master ]" instead of "[repo master]". Please change it back and add an explanation to the comment above it.
