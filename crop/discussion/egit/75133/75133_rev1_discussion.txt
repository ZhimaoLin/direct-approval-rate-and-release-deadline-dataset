DESCRIPTION

Test stability: try to fix three frequently failing tests

* Wait for shells to close after having clicked finish button
* Wait for add to/remove from index jobs
* Open global git config preference page differently, and move opening
  the page into the test methods to get at least screenshots in case
  it fails.
