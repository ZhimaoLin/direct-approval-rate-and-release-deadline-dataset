Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Would be good to use the monitor to record the number of projects.

monitor.beginTask("Refreshing projects",projects.length)
for(project:projects)
if(monitor.cancelled())
  break;
...
refreshLocal(INFINITE,new SubTaskMonitor( monitor, 1) );
monitor.worked(1);
}
monitor.done();

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> We should put a child monitor here, set it to the number of units of work that the project has, and do 'worked' for each one of them.
