Rebased.

Dariusz, any chance to review this? I tried several combinations of staged/non-staged changes and for me, the selection is right in the commit dialog. Do you have a scenario that shows the problems mentioned above?

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

- do a modification in a file outside eclipse workspace but inside repo (e.g. parent pom.xml in egit)
- synchronize
- in changeset model select working directory node and click commit
- modified file outside eclipse workspace will not be preselected in commit dialog, this is not consistent with modifications inside workspace (commit dialog now supports committing non workspace changes)

Line:782, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> style nit: whitespace errors

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: all footers should be in last paragraph so remove this blank line
