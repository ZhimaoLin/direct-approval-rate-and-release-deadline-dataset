Patch Set 2:

I doubt this is really useful, to my experience both the number of tags and remotes isn't changing often so what's the point in seeing these numbers ? What's changing much more often is the number of local branches but I also don't see why the number would be important. If certain platforms don't show if the node has content or not we should rather file a bug for SWT to fix this.

I like this change, just it's mostly aesthetic.

It would also be cool to style labels for branches so you'd get a shorten SHA-1 and message... similar output to 'git branch -v' but have that styled.

I don't think so that this feature could be useful. I just don't see any use case for it.
