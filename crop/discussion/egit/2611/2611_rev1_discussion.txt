DESCRIPTION

Re-enable MergeCommand for RefNode and TagNode

The org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.repository.tree.command.MergeCommand
has been (accidentally) disabled for RefNodes and TagNodes. Thus the
'Merge' entry in the context menu on a branch within the repositories
view had been disabled. This fix enabled the entry again.
