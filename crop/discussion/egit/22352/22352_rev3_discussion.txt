DESCRIPTION

Add ability to reword a commit directly from the history view.

This adds a new menu item Modify > Reword to the context menu of
the history view. It can be used to reword a commit, prompting for
a commit message.

An error will be displayed if the selected commit cannot be reached
from the current HEAD commit. This is done so as to avoid the need
to checkout another commit automatically before executing the reword
procedure.

Line:55, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/RewordHandler.java -> I think we should use a WorkspaceJob here in order to ensure that resource change events triggered when rebase moves HEAD will be batched until the end of the job execution

Line:69, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/RewordHandler.java -> why CHERRY_PICK, this is REWORD

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/RewordHandler.java -> what's the reason you enable the command and then raise an error message in case the selected commit isn't reachable from the current branch ? For squash we instead disable the command.

Line:55, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/RewordHandler.java -> I believe this originated from the cherry-pick handler. But I'll have another look at WorkspaceJob as you suggest.

Line:69, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/RewordHandler.java -> right, this must have slipped through the cracks all along

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/RewordHandler.java -> Actually I did the same for squash.

The reason is that I want to give more information about why the command cannot be executed right now. If we instead just disable it, the user might become confused as to why the command cannot be accessed. There is just not enough information contained in a disabled menu item.

Line:55, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/RewordHandler.java -> I fixed this in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22013/ which was submitted recently

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/RewordHandler.java -> ok

Line:55, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/RewordHandler.java -> right, I noticed it when I was reviewing which commit this change had been rebased onto
