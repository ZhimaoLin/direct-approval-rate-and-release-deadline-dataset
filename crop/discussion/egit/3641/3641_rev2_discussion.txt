DESCRIPTION

Get rid of regexps in STRING_ASCENDING_COMPARATOR

This makes the code both faster and easier to read (no complicated
lookahead/lookbehind pattern).

In a real-world use case for sorting 755 refs (a great number of tags),
the result is:

before: 22 ms
after: 3 ms

Using a list of 10000 elements also shows a factor of about 8.
