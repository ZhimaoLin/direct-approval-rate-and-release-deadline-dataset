DESCRIPTION

Allow push of single Refs/Commits from Repo & History Views

This adds a new SimplePushWizard which just allows selecting a target
remote and ref name. It then pushes out the selected Ref/Commit to the
selected target ref.

While implementing this I split out the Ref content assist functionality
from the existing RefSpecDialog to be reusable by this code.
