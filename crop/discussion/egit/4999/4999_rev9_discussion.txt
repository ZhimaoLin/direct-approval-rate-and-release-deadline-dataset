DESCRIPTION

Allow push of single Refs/Commits from Repo & History Views

This adds a new SimplePushWizard which just allows selecting a target
remote and ref name. It then pushes out the selected Ref/Commit to the
selected target ref.

While implementing this i split out the Ref content assist functionality
from the existing RefSpecDialog to be reusable by this code.

Line:131, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/SimplePushSpecPage.java -> Strictly seen this only makes real sense if the user pushes to the repo which is configured for this branch. But if he pushes to another one, I would say that it is not wrong to suggest the same remote branch if there happens to be one with the same name.

Line:155, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/SimplePushSpecPage.java -> There is a NPE if the user selects a URI to push to because then assist has no config. This did not occur before because RefContentAssistProvider was only used for a given remote.

I think the fix would be to somehow pass the URI to the RefContentAssistProvider in SimplePushRefWizard.

Line:131, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/SimplePushSpecPage.java -> you're right, but i also think that it is ok the way it is. if somebody thinks different, chime in :)

Line:155, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/SimplePushSpecPage.java -> i changed the RefContentAssist to work with URIish's and the two callers to pass them in.
