DESCRIPTION

Allow push of single Refs/Commits from Repo & History Views

This adds a new SimplePushWizard which just allows selecting a target
remote and ref name. It then pushes out the selected Ref/Commit to the
selected target ref.

This fixes three bugs (see below), and i feel it would be a really cool
feature for 1.3!

There is room for improvement, and i need help with implementing content
assist for the target ref selection - this should be a combo much like
the destination combo in the existing RefSpecPanel

Patch Set 3:

no, since the server migration left our firewall exceptions in a wrong state, and our IT department is slow in reacting.... i cannot connect to the new server. please fetch patch-set 2 (maybe rebase it), and re-push.
