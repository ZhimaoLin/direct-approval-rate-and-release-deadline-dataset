DESCRIPTION

Allow push of single Refs/Commits from Repo & History Views

This adds a new SimplePushWizard which just allows selecting a target
remote and ref name. It then pushes out the selected Ref/Commit to the
selected target ref.

While implementing this i split out the Ref content assist functionality
from the existing RefSpecDialog to be reusable by this code.

Patch Set 10: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check in

I think that the IP-review could be started now

Line:124, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/SimplePushRefWizard.java -> style nit: unnecessary blank line

Line:24, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/PushCommitHandler.java -> this Javadoc doesn't fit to this class
