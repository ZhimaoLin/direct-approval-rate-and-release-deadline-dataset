Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful; IP review completed

I've run seven times hudson CI build. In any of those builds SynchronizeViewTest was failed therefore I think that this change can be merged into master.

why do consistently failing tests qualify for submitting this change ?

Patch Set 1:

Because another test are failing. Those failing tests don't have anything to deal with this change, it only fixes tests in SynchronizeViewTest case not any other test suites or test cases

I see, then you didn't mean : "In any of those builds SynchronizeViewTest was failed" but the opposite :-) I will try your change on mac and if that's ok accept it
