DESCRIPTION

Add repository state to Git Project Label Decorations

With the advent of merge capabilities, we should
make the repository state (mostly merge, rebase)
 visible in the Git label decorationsfor projects.
Instead of adding another tag, we re-use the
"repository name" tag and append the repository state separated by 
a pipe similar to the behavior in msysgit. 
This allows to elegantly treat the "SAFE" state that we don't
want to show explicitly: we just add nothing to the repository name.
This avoids ugly formatting issues which we would run into
if using a separate tag: unless we would want to always show
the state (even if it is SAFE) we would introduce ugly spaces
into the label decoration in case the state is SAFE (and thus the
displayed value is null or an empty String). The alternative of howing 
the state always does not appear to be the right thing, either, as it
would pollute the label decoration with un-needed information in the
99 percent case.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Anyone think we can accomplish this better via a icon decoration versus a label decoration? Other than that, I'm fine with this change.

Patch Set 1:

Carlie Harper and I have discussed the question icon vs. text decoration. The problem here is that we can only have ONE icon decoration at any given time, so we would have to replace that bottom right decoration with something different. And we would have to think of different icons for the different states...

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

I understand the desire to use text, but I think people notice their projects and files adorned more with a special icon (ie., the red conflict decoration) than a label. I opened a bug to consider this usability change in the future...

Also, how many different repository states are there? MERGE, REBASE and SAFE?
