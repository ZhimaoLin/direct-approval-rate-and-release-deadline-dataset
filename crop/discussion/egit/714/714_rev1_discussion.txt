Patch Set 1: No score

One thing to note is that this code will only work if a checkout was performed using the BranchAction. This will not fly if the user were to checkout another branch from the command line.

Though technically speaking, that is a general problem (see bug 313046).

Line:1568, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> The platform has an API for this. Just call 'page.findViewReference(VIEW_ID)' instead.
