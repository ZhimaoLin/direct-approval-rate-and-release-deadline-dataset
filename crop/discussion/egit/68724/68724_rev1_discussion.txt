DESCRIPTION

Do not swallow error in FetchGerritChangePage on finish

internalDoFetch() must not handle the error but propagate it. When
called from the background job, the job must translate exceptions into
an appropriate status. Then let the job framework handle notifying the
user of the error.

@Guy: does this solve the problem you've been seeing?

egerrit's use of FetchGerritChangeWizard in ChangeDetailEditor is really relying on an EGit internal non-API class. We don't promise to never change that interface.

It is much better. The user can now read the error and take appropriate action.
