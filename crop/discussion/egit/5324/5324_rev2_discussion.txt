DESCRIPTION

Propperly filter EGit generated contents from commit message

Currently, the staging view falsely determines whether the user entered
a commit message, as it sees its own generated contents.

Line:1125, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> shouldn't the delimiters added in line 1100 also be removed here ?

Line:1129, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> also Signed-off-by footer can be auto-generated, see preference Git > Team > Git > Commit Dialog > Insert Signed-off-by

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo: s/Propperly/Properly/

thanks for the review!

Line:1125, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> is it reasonable to assume that DELIMITER can be a non-whitespace ever? if it is not, i don't need to do extra handling as the string is trimmed anyway

Line:1129, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> ok - i added logic for it.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
