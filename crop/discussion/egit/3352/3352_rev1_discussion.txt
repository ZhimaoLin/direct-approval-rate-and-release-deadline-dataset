DESCRIPTION

Small UI improvements in commit dialog

- Added a sash after commit text to ease editing of larger 
  commit messages.
- Moved link to preferences to the right side of the dialog.  This
  better separates it from checkboxes and uses free room at the right
  more efficiently.
- Added a small gap before the "Show untracked files" checkbox to
  make clear it belongs to the list below and not to the commit
  options.

I had some thoughts on how to compact the commit dialog here:

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,2090

I think that is the better direction to go imho...

I think with the merged change
"Change Ibd108151: Add toolbars and file icons to commit dialog"
this change is obsolete. Please abandon if you agree.
