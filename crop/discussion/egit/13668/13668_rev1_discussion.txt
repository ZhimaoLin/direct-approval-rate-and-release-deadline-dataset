DESCRIPTION

Prefer to create new branch based on remote tracking branch

Prefer to use a remote tracking branch as the base of a new branch if it
is created by selecting a commit in the history view multiple branches
are referring to. This makes sense since most often the user wants the
new local branch to track a remote tracking branch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/CreateBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> I assume that excluding the current branch was done in order to avoid the current local branch as input for the CreateBranchWizard. This is not needed anymore with your solution. If there is only one local branch pointing to the currently selected commit, it will not be chosen default if it is checked out.

Optional: Fix this also in this change by just changing getBranchesExcludingCurrent.
