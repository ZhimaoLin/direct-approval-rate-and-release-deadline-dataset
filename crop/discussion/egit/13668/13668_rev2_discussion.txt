DESCRIPTION

Prefer to create new branch based on remote tracking branch

Prefer to use a remote tracking branch as the base of a new branch if it
is created by selecting a commit in the history view multiple branches
are referring to. This makes sense since most often the user wants the
new local branch to track a remote tracking branch.

Also do not exclude the currently checked out branch as a candidate base
branch for the new branch to be created since the user may want to track
a local branch which is currently checked out.
