DESCRIPTION

Suppress "Unnecessary cast" errors in Mars

Bug 430981 changed the API of IServiceLocator#getService(Class) and
made casts unnecessary. But we still need to compile against older
releases. CommonUtils#getService(..) is a solution that works in both
worlds.

Just one point, otherwise looks good. Thanks for doing this!

Line:156, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> Could you please add a note here that this method can be removed when we depend on Eclipse 4.5 or higher? I've found it useful to search for "Eclipse \d" in the past to find stuff that is no longer needed.
