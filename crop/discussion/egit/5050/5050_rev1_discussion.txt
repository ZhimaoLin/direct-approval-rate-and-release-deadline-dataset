DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Hide additional Refs by default

The normal user is not interested in Refs like FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD
etc. when using the HistoryView. However, these Refs can pollute the
view as they can not be hidden independently if "Show All Branches" is
active.

The additional Refs are now hidden by default and the user can have
them displayed by checking the Show->Additional Refs menu item toggle
button. The HEAD Ref is always shown independent from this switch.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Now also the remote tracking branches are not shown when additional Refs are hidden. Is this intended? I would like to switch off only FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD etc., but not the remote tracking branches.
