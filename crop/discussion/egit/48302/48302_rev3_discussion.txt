DESCRIPTION

[wip] Prefer selection adaption to ResourceMapping instead of IResource

When handling the selection EGit now checks if the selected elements can
be adapted to a ResourceMapping first. Only if this is not possible it
is checked if the elements can be mapped to IResource.

This is helpful in cases where the selected element is for example a
virtual node in the project explorer. By first adapting to a
ResourceMapping the virtual node has the chance to return multiple
resources instead of only one.

Thanks for your review!

I will integrate all your comments in the next Patch Set.

Line:244, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionUtils.java -> Will be fixed in next PS.

Line:307, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionUtils.java -> Will be fixed in next PS.

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CompareWithPreviousActionHandler.java -> What I wanted to achieve is to return the latest commit which changed at least one of the resources before the current commit. But now I see that I actually only solved the special case when the current commit changed all of the resources.

Will be fixed in the next PS.
