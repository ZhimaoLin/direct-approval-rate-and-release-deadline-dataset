DESCRIPTION

[wip] Prefer selection adaption to ResourceMapping instead of IResource

When handling the selection EGit now checks if the selected elements can
be adapted to a ResourceMapping first. Only if this is not possible it
is checked if the elements can be mapped to IResource.

This is helpful in cases where the selected element is for example a
virtual node in the project explorer. By first adapting to a
ResourceMapping the virtual node has the chance to return multiple
resources instead of only one.

@Stefan: is this still WIP? If so, what's still in the works? If it's ready for review/submitting, please remove the WIP marker from the commit message.

Hi Thomas. This review is a proposal of how certain problems could be solved within eGit. However I am no longer sure if preferring the adaption to ResourceMapping is always the best way to go.

In the mean time other reviews regarding the problem are now merged, therefore the concrete issue this review solved no longer exists. However since the merged reviews are not yet in any release we still need (and might modify) this review for example for the Collaborative Modeling Build.

Abandoned

This is no longer needed since the Modeling Build switched to the latest Papyrus version
