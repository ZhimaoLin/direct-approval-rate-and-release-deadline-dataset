DESCRIPTION

[wip] Prefer selection adaption to ResourceMapping instead of IResource

When handling the selection EGit now checks if the selected elements can
be adapted to a ResourceMapping first. Only if this is not possible it
is checked if the elements can be mapped to IResource.

This is helpful in cases where the selected element is for example a
virtual node in the project explorer. By first adapting to a
ResourceMapping the virtual node has the chance to return multiple
resources instead of only one.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionUtils.java -> Seems to me that the changes in this class are the only ones that correspond to the commit message, while all the other changes are about an unrelated issue about finding the previous commit. Or am I missing something?

Would be better if this could be split in two commits, one per feature.

Line:227, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionUtils.java -> Shouldn't ResourceMapping be preferred over IResource here, too? If not, why not?
