DESCRIPTION

Stabilize Core Tests

There are currently failures when the test workspace is not cleared.
In the TrackUntrackOperation test, apparently, the check whether a file is "tracked" was too
simplistic.
Other fixes were required because resources were not handled properly.
With these fixes, it is possible to run the tests without clearing the
test workspace.
The fixes have successfully been tested on Helios, too.
