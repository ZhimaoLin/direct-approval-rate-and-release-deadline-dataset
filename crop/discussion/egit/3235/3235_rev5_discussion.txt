- rebased
- improved commit message

I still see the following open issues to be improved:
- creating branch based on Refs like FETCH_HEAD should be still possible
- source should have label "Source Ref" instead of "Source Branch"
- is there a reason why the refs in the Source Ref combo are not sorted alphabetically ?
