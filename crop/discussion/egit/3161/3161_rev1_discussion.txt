Could you please file a bug for what you are trying to fix here ? Explain what's the misbehavior and also add the stack trace.

I think providing a generic error message doesn't really fix the problem, instead we should handle bare repository in a different way. We know that this exception would occur if the repo is bare, so we should handle this case appropriately instead of frightening the user with a hard to understand error message.

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitSelectWizardPage.java -> why did you touch formatting here ?

Line:896, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> don't use string concatenation to build sentence as grammar could be different in other languages, instead use NLS.bind()

this is a rather unspecific error message, why don't you want to disclose that having no work tree is the problem

seems the author abandoned this change, if you want to revive it to clarify what this is good for then do so
