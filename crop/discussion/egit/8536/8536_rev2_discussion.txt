Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)



Line:81, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Shouldn't this rather be named "getChangedPaths" (as the event is also called "IndexChangedEvent")?

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think this can be abandoned now that  I5cd27f79606decca73b7a0977d147c97e06bfaba was merged
