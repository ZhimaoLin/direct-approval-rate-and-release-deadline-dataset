DESCRIPTION

Oomph setup: include TPD and AnyEditTools

TPD is needed to work with our target platforms. AnyEditTools is
generally useful for a variety of things, including avoiding
trailing whitespace.

The only downside of this I see is that both TPD and AnyEditTools
are unsigned and thus the user will be presented with a dialog
during installation.

Line:72, tools/oomph/EGit.setup -> can we link to the latest release
http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/2.12.0/ instead of using the composite p2 repo in order to avoid that we have to download the p2 index of all the xtext releases which takes a long time ?

Line:72, tools/oomph/EGit.setup -> We could, but that would update automatically to xtext 2.12.0. TPD works with xtext >= 2.7.0... Hmmm. For an Oomph setup of a developer eclipse, always upgrading to the latest xtext would probably be OK? Do they have a "latest" URL? I'd prefer that over having to specify 2.12.0 here.

Couldn't find a "latest" url on the download server, maybe they are willing to add one ? It's a bit messy to maintain since AFAIR the download server doesn't follow symlinks for security reasons
