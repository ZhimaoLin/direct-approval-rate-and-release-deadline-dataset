DESCRIPTION

Oomph setup: include TPD and AnyEditTools

TPD is needed to work with our target platforms. AnyEditTools is
generally useful for a variety of things, including avoiding
trailing whitespace.

The only downside of this I see is that both TPD and AnyEditTools
are unsigned and thus the user will be presented with a dialog
during installation.
