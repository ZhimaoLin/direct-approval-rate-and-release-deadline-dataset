DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Try to fix spurious NPE on hard reset

Instead of getting the GitHistoryPage from the currently active part,
get it from the event. This may be more reliable.

If this fixes the problem, the other uses of getPage should also be
changed.

Thanks for testing. Let's not submit this yet, I'd like to clean up the code some more, e.g. we could directly get the selection from the event instead of getting the part first.
