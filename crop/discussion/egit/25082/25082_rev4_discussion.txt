DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Get selection from ExecutionEvent instead of active part

Instead of getting the selection from the currently active part, get it
from the event. This is more reliable, as the active part can change.

This change also adds getSelectedCommitId and getSelectedCommit methods
to the base class for convenience.

The change looks good and fixes the NPE on Luna for me too.
