Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Some new images are not displayed, mainly in the new chapters "Viewing Commits" and "Searching for Commits". The reason seems to be that the links refer to image names starting with lower case but the images are stored with upper case.

For example, the link http://127.0.0.1:60701/help/topic/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/images/git-search-page.png does not work, but http://127.0.0.1:60701/help/topic/org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/images/Git-search-page.png would work (Tested in Firefox).
