DESCRIPTION

Adds support for comparing two remote branches

The main reason of not displaying synchronization data for two remote
branches was that GitResourceVariantTreeComparator was using standard
SyncInfo class which uses local file to determinate change kind.

The new GitSyncInfo is looking for a first diff for given file in given
range of commits. Based on this it determinate change kind and
direction.

Git specific SyncInfo is activated only when used doesn't select
"include locally changed files" in synchronization dialog. When this
option is selected standard implementation of SyncInfo will be used.

Additionally "Workspace" model is only enabled when "include locally
changed files" option is selected, in other case this model will be
excluded.

Looks good.

Please have a look at my comments.

Line:77, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitModelSynchronizeParticipant.java -> I think we should also exclude the Java workspace model: org.eclipse.jdt.ui.modelProvider. It also operates on the local workspace.

What do you think about returning only GitChangeSetModelProvider if !gsd.shouldIncludeLocal() and not filtering out a predefined list?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> determine instead of determinate

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> determines instead of determinate

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> the user instead of used

Line:77, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitModelSynchronizeParticipant.java -> Yes, returning only GitChangeSerModelProvider when !gsd.shouldIncludeLocal()  seams to be reasonable.
