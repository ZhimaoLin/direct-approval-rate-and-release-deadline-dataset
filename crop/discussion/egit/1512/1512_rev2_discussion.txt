DESCRIPTION

Adds support for comparing two remote branches

The main reason of not displaying synchronization data for two remote
branches was that GitResourceVariantTreeComparator was using standard
SyncInfo class. With uses local file to determinate change kind.

The new GitSyncInfo is looking for a first diff for given file in given
range of commits. Based on this it determinate change kind and
direction.

Now we can display differences between two remote branches also in
ChangeSet and in normal synchronization mode.

Now the Git Change Set Model works fine for comparing two arbitrary branches.

But on the other hand, the workspace model is now broken when the HEAD is synchronized with another branch. In the workspace model the left side is the workspace version of the file. Now uncommitted changes are not visible anymore in the synchronize view.

Furthermore the workspace model is still broken in case of comparing two arbitrary branches (see bug 322489). Could it be switched off in that case?

Stefan, what you would like to switch off? GitSyncInfo in case of synchronizing with local changes or Workspace model when we synchronize two remote branches?
