DESCRIPTION

Adds support for comparing two remote branches

The main reason of not displaying synchronization data for two remote
branches was that GitResourceVariantTreeComparator was using standard
SyncInfo class which uses local file to determinate change kind.

The new GitSyncInfo is looking for a first diff for given file in given
range of commits. Based on this it determinate change kind and
direction.

Now we can display differences between two remote branches also in
ChangeSet and in normal synchronization mode.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I would like to switch off the workspace model in case of comparing two arbitrary branches because it compares the workspace with the remote state. I suppose that here the team API must be extended.

But the main issue with this change is that the workspace model is now broken when the HEAD is synchronized with another branch. Now I do not see the local changes anymore, even if I check the "Include local..." checkbox.
