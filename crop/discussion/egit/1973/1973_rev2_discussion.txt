Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

If I leave the user and password field empty to clear the stored credentials this data seems not to be persisted. E.g. if I want to clear valid user / password values stored in secure store by leaving the fields empty in the "Change credentials" dialog I still can successfully connect (which shows that user/password have not been replaced by empty string).

Line:892, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> should be lower case s/Credentials/credentials/

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo: s/Authentification/Authentication/
