Looks ok.

Line:75, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/credentials/LoginService.java -> We should look at creating a EGitCoreActivator and EGitUIActivator or something like EGitCore and EGitUI to simplify access to the activators.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Authentication? Authentification sounds German :)
