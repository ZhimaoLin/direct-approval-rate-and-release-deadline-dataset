DESCRIPTION

Add a test for cloning via HTTPS

Tests that cloning from an HTTPS server that has a certificate that
doesn't validate pops up the correct dialog, and that after trusting
the server all the same, the clone proceeds successfully.

Fixes some bugs in apparently never used parts of the
CustomPromptDialog that the EGitCredentialsProvider uses to get user
input.

Patch Set 6:

I hate UI tests. Locally, this test has always succeeded. On Jenkins, we have a problem with finding the active shell after the credential provider's dialog closes. Might be a difference between Mac (local) and gtk (Jenkins).

I notice that we do have two other tests that have similar problems and that I have seen failing from time to time before:

* org.eclipse.egit.ui.gitflow.CommandEnablementTest.testRepositoryViewStartFinishEnablement
* org.eclipse.egit.ui.httpauth.PushTest.testPush

So let's try something different. If that doesn't work, I'll try waiting for the dialog closes and then activating the wizard shell programmatically.
