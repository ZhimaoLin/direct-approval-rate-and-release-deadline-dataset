DESCRIPTION

Add a test for cloning via HTTPS

Tests that cloning from an HTTPS server that has a certificate that
doesn't validate pops up the correct dialog, and that after trusting
the server all the same, the clone proceeds successfully.

Fixes some bugs in apparently never used parts of the
CustomPromptDialog that the EGitCredentialsProvider uses to get user
input.
