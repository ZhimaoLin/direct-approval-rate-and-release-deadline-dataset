Patch Set 2:

You can access all registered commands trough ctrl + 3 shortcut even if project isn't shared with git. Currently if you try to launch "fetch from gerrit" wizard when any repository isn't selected you'll get NPE.

Please see my inline comment.

What so you think about:

To be able to fetch changes from Gerrit you need to select a project which is shared with a Git repository and which is configured with Gerrit as a remote repository.
