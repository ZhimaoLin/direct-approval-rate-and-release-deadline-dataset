How can I test this? Should have UI tests for the DecoratableResourceMapping.

Line:201, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> Seems to me that this is not really used. GitLightweightDecorator.DecorationHelper.decorateText doesn't use the value of getName() in the BINDING_RESOURCE_NAME binding. It only provides a prefix and a suffix and the BINDING_RESOURCE_NAME is only used to figure out which one is being constructed; the name itself is provided by whatever label provider is active.

So it doesn't matter at all what you provide here.

Hi Thomas,

Thank you for your review. I addressed your comment and added some test classes for the decoratable resource mapping (and the decoratable working set). Hopefully, this will make the behavior clearer. Thanks!

Line:201, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> You are absolutely right. I exchanged the comment to explain the situation.
