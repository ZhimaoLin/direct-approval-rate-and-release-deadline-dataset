Looks good; one minor comment. I'll wait for an answer to the precedence question.

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecoratorTest.java -> This should be final.

Hi Thomas,

Sorry for the delay. I talked to Stefan and he agrees that for our case (Papyrus) the solution works either way. So it is hard to tell which should be the correct behavior. Nevertheless, I propose to leave the order as it is now to keep this change less invasive.

If we come across a case that clearly favors one case over the other, we can adapt the behavior in a separate change. In such a change we would probably also need to ensure that there are no other areas in EGit where such a precedence assumption has been made with regard to Resource vs ResourceMapping.

What do you think?

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecoratorTest.java -> Thanks! Somehow I do not get the FindBugs notification for this, although it seems the project has FindBugs configured. Are you by any chance aware of any guide that shows how to use FindBugs in the context of EGit?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecoratorTest.java -> http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Findbugs/article.html#using-findbugs-in-eclipse

I haven't set it up for me. But it _is_ enabled on Hudson, and I tend to check the findbugs statistics there from time to time and examine any new findings. For me, that's good enough.
