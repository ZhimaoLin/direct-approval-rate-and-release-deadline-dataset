Patch Set 5:

I tried the following scenario (using git commit model in synchronize):
- modify some files in working tree
- click "Team > Synchronize with Workspace", synchronize view shows the modifications I did (though it doesn't respect ignore rules)
- click "Pin Synchronization"
- restart Eclipse
- select the pinned synchronization
- neither "Populate" nor "Synchronize" restore the view to show the above mentioned modifications

Do I miss something here ?

Patch Set 5:

Really strange, this scenario is working on my machine. I've tested it also for 'partial synchronization' (when you choose "synchronize workspace" on eg. package element). Tried to change pinged synchronization after restart, and all those scenarios was OK (the synchronization was restored). I've run all my tests on Indigo.

Did you use 5th patch set ? Which Eclipse version did you use ?

Patch Set 5:

Same problem for me, patch applied on v2.0.0.201206130900-r tag.
Eclipse Indigo SR2 20120216-1857.

After restart, pinned git synchronization are restored, but all modifications are hidden.

On one synchronization, view display « No changes in 'Git (projectName)' », on another, display « There are X hidden changes. The models that contain the changes may be disabled. » and a « Enable All Participating Models » link.
In the last case, all models are enabled in prefs, and clicking on « Enable All Participating Models » change nothing.

Patch Set 5:

Now I see the problem. I was always testing on workspace model, but it seams that git committs model is not restored. I'll investigate this later this week.
