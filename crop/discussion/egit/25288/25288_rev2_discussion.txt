DESCRIPTION

Don't look for .git in subdirectories of project

Connecting a project with a .git repository in one of its subdirectories
breaks the Team menu for the project and makes the subdirectory
disappear. When this happens with "auto share", it's very confusing.

Other places in the code could also not really handle this, e.g. the
share wizard displayed the repository location as ".git", when it really
should have shown "sub/dir/.git".
