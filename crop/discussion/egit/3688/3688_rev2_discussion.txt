DESCRIPTION

Use commit time if author time is not available.

The revision class is required to return a non-null date 
and this change now respects that by returning authored date 
first, then committer date if no author exists, then
new Date(0) if no committer exists.

This also prevents blame revisions from being created when
the blame command returns a null commit for the current line
number.
