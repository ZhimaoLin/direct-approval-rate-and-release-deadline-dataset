DESCRIPTION

Synchronize - accurate revisions for remote and ancestor

This removes two unused (and outdated) tests in
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest. The third one was removed since
it was not testing what was advertised : it mocked a use case where the
user was synchronizing a branch with only one commit with a master that
also had a single commit, that thus acted as both the "remote" _and_
"common ancestor" of the synchronization. What we want is a use case
where all three revisions are distinct.

Sorry about that... This second patch set removes the typo in the commit message and the huge block of commented out code in the tests.

I know that you have a lot of reviews pending ... but this one seemed quite trivial? If there's anything I can do to ease the review process, do not hesitate to ask.
