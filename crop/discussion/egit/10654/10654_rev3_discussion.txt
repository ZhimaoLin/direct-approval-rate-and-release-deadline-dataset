DESCRIPTION

Synchronize - accurate revisions for remote and ancestor

This removes two unused (and outdated) tests in
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest. The third one was removed since
it was not testing what was advertised : it mocked a use case where the
user was synchronizing a branch with only one commit with a master that
also had a single commit, that thus acted as both the "remote" _and_
"common ancestor" of the synchronization. What we want is a use case
where all three revisions are distinct.
