nice idea, thanks for working on this

Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitLabels.java -> don't hardcode the decorator, it's configurable under "Preferences > Team > Git > Label Decorations" on tab "Text Decorations". Also you should decorate the icon to e.g. denote partially staged changes like we do for projects in e.g. package explorer. Decoration of resources is handled in org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.decorators.GitLightweightDecorator

don't make changes depend on each other if they are not related to each other, providing dirty decoration for a repository is completely unrelated to multi push support

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitLabels.java -> getIndexDiffCacheEntry() can return null

Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitLabels.java -> we can do this in another change as the other decorations for repository node in repositories view is also hardcoded at the moment
