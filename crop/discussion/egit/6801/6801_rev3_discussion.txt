DESCRIPTION

Don't interrupt user on first keystroke

The Push Commit... dialog always interrupted the user after the first
keystroke in the Target Ref Name field. To avoid this, we pre-fetch the
remote refs in the background.

The pushMode is now passed in the constructor of
RefContentAssistProvider. This fixes a latent bug in the caching story
of getRefsForContentAssist(boolean): Caches didn't distinguish
pushModes.

Sorry about the compile errors. I was a victim of https://bugs.eclipse.org/385472 .

Patch Set 3:

There are two problems:

1) fetchJob.getResult() != Status.OK_STATUS
This condition is wrong: if the job ends with an error, then it will report an error on each key stroke (log and maybe also a dialog).

2) When the job got cancelled (for whatever reason) we should probably scheduled it again.


I know you hate it, but if you could add your credentials to each file (or add "and others."), it would save me some cycles.
