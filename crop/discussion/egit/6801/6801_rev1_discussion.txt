DESCRIPTION

Don't interrupt user on first keystroke

The Push Commit... dialog always interrupted the user after the first
keystroke in the Target Ref Name field. To avoid this, we pre-fetch the
remote refs.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

With this fix, one can no longer just paste an existing/known ref into the field and continue without waiting.

I'd prefer a solution where the refs are pre-fetched in background.
