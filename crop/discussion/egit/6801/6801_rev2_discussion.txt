DESCRIPTION

Don't interrupt user on first keystroke

The Push Commit... dialog always interrupted the user after the first
keystroke in the Target Ref Name field. To avoid this, we pre-fetch the
remote refs in the background.

The pushMode is now passed in the constructor of
RefContentAssistProvider. This fixes a latent bug in the caching story
of getRefsForContentAssist(boolean): Caches didn't distinguish
pushModes.

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

This causes compile errors.

I first thought it's a problem in my workspace or the Gerrit Fetch command, but verifying the files in patch set 2 also indicate that RefContentAssistProvider.preFetchPushDestinationRefs() is missing.
