DESCRIPTION

Fix CommitGraphTable after I693694bca055c4b913b064a3e3f3a0bced058296

CommitGraphTable is also used in CommitSelectionDialog. In this case,
the input member may be null which resulted in NullPointers while
rendering the dialog and subsequent test failures.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Totally makes sense. But UI tests are still failing for me :-(
