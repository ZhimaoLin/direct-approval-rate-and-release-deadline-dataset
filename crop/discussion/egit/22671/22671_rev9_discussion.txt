DESCRIPTION

Introduce internal API to integrate Team merging

Team provides a number of APIs to provide access to merge,
comparison and synchronization features. This introduces a
git-specific Subscriber implementation that can retrieve
information from three different sources, along with
implementations to use the index or a TreeWalk to populate
these three 'sources'.

Patch Set 9:

Could you add some tests ? This patch has a lot of new code which isn't covered by existing tests. Or did you add tests in other changes depending on this one ?

Patch Set 9:

These are tested through https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/30190/ and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/30191/ . At the time I wrote these tests I didn't want to make all changes interdependant from each other, so they are in their separate dependency tree.

Now that the other changes 30190 have been merged, I guess I can make it a parent of this one. We'd end up with something close to that (these are the gerrit change numbers):

30190 -> 30191 -> 22671 -> [...]

sorry about that, the sentence was meant to be *Now that the other changes 30190 depended on have been merged [...]*

Patch Set 9:

I see, but usually it is easier to review and test a contribution if it includes the tests. I guess that's what Matthias is asking about.

Patch Set 9:

I have pushed a new review, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/42873/ that is basically a copy of this one which is :

- rebased onto the current master
- augmented with tests for what can be tested unitarily in these new APIs
- maded to depend on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/30190 which extracts testing API I reused in these new tests

Should I abandon this current review (22671) in favor of the new one (42873)? Or would you rather I re-use this one and avoid pushing new ones (abandoning 42873)?
