DESCRIPTION

Introduce internal API to integrate Team merging

Team provides a number of APIs to provide access to merge,
comparison and synchronization features. This introduces a
git-specific Subscriber implementation that can retrieve
information from three different sources, along with
implementations to use the index or a TreeWalk to populate
these three 'sources'.
