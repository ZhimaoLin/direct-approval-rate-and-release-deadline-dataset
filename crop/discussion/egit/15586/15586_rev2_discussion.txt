I'd submit the parent change but we're currently blocked by the Hudson transition.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just a nitpick, but we normally start the subject line with a capital letter, "Provide ...". Also on the parent change.

Also, could you mention that the fetch from gerrit wizard now uses this and provides selection of an existing branch and branch editing?

I don't quite get how the selection dialog is supposed to work in "Fetch a change from Gerrit".

When I select an existing branch with "Select" and then click "OK", an error "A branch or tag with name foo already exists" is shown. So apparently I am supposed to enter a name of a new branch there. In that case, it doesn't make sense to name the button "Select".

Is it e.g. so that the user can first delete an existing branch to make the name available again?

In that case, it should probably be named something like "Edit Branches..." and "Cancel" and "OK" should be replaced by "Close" and not do anything - it currently writes the name of the selected branch in the text field, which triggers the error above.

Also, "New Branch..." doesn't make much sense in that case, or does it? Do you have an example use case for doing this in that context?

Line:4669, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIText.java -> These two should be BranchSelectionComponent, right?

Yes, that's the use case I had in mind. Deleting/renaming a branch that causes the conflict without leaving the Fetch wizard.

> In that case, it should probably be named something like "Edit Branches..." and "Cancel" and "OK" should be replaced by "Close" (...)

Makes sense.

> Also, "New Branch..." doesn't make much sense in that case, or does it? Do you have an example use case for doing this in that context?

You're right, there's no need for that action here.

Line:4669, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIText.java -> Right, I missed those.

Tomasz, are you working on a new patch set for this? Would be nice to get into 3.1.

Not at the moment, but will try to revisit this change later this week. I've been swamped with work for the last 2 weeks, sorry.
