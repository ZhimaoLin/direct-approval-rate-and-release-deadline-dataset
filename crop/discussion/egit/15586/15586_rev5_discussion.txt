Patch Set 5: -Code-Review

Rebased the change, there were some conflicts caused by I8701aee4bb12de0848f4820a3f7725435cbf106d.

There are still some things that I'm not sure about. E.g. LocalBranchSelectionDialog is not used except as base class for BranchEditDialog. And BranchSelectionComponent has a selectButton which does not select but rather edit.

Do you have plans for using BranchSelectionComponent somewhere else?

please rebase and resolve conflicts

Line:22, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchEditDialog.java -> I think BranchEditDialog should override getTitle() since the branch selected in this dialog isn't used in the caller, at least not in FetchGerritChangePage.

There this title is misleading since it says "Select a branch or work with branches" but there is no button to accept the selection, selecting a branch and clicking "Close" has no effect on the state of FetchGerritChangePage.

Also it looks strange that a dialog class which inherits from a class named LocalBranchSelectionDialog actually doesn't allow to select a branch ;-?

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/LocalBranchSelectionDialog.java -> missing license header

Line:9, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/LocalBranchSelectionDialog.java -> style nit: remove unnecessary blank line
