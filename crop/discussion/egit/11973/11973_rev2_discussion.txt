DESCRIPTION

New Subscriber to create ActiveChangeSetManager

To create an ActiveChangeSetManager (useful for Mylyn connector or other
similar plug-ins), I created a new Subscriber. GitUpdateSubscriber
extends GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber, and contains some needed
modifications to generate a valid change set manager.

With this Subscriber, the cache of a specific resource is synchronized
each time this resource changes. Moreover, the new created Git projects
are saved in cache too.

It would be great to have EGit support change sets like the other team integrations do.
