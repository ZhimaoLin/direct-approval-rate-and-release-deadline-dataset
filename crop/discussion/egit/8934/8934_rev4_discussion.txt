Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:856, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> I don't agree here. The dialog should have precedence over settings which should just set the default for the dialog.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Robin, that's a flaw in the current design. When the preference is set, untracked files will be included in the commit. Thus, the dialog must make sure that the committer recognizes this. If the dialog doesn't show them they might be accidentally committed without recognizing. I don't think that's the intent.

Line:856, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> We could signal that in the dialog using an alert icon instead.
