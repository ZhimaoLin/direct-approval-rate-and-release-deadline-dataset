DESCRIPTION

Honor workbench setting for Dialog font

If a (non-standard) dialog font has been select in the workspace prefrences,
it must be set in all dialogs and wizard pages.
Note that this does not include the RepositorySearchDialog, since
there is an outstanding fix for this which will take dialog font
setting into account.
