DESCRIPTION

Add overview annotations to DiffEditorPage

Add overview annotations for added/removed lines in the unified
diff.

* Add annotations for the DiffRegions of a DiffDocument.
* Coalesce adjacent DiffRegions in DiffRegionFormatter.
* Fix a layout problem with the overview ruler when used in the
  DiffEditorPage.
* Derive the annotation colors automatically from the line background
  colors as set by the user preferences or by the current theme.
* When colors change, use invalidateTextPresentation() in DiffViewer
  instead of refresh() in order to maintain display state (scroll
  and caret position, selection, folding, etc.) refresh() would reset
  all those and jump to the beginning of the document.
