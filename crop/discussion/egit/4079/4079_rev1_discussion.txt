Line:120, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitDocument.java -> Isn't this check testing that we are on a unborn branch and complain only when we are on a unborn branch? Somehow the opposite of what you wanted to achive, or?

Line:120, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitDocument.java -> No. It is a normal, though unusual, case that HEAD exists, but it cannot be resolved.  The detection of the unresolved HEAD is at line 110.
