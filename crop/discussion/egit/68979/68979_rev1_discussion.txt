DESCRIPTION

Test stability: fix FeatureFinishSquashTest

The test didn't wait for the shell to open in
AbstractFeatureFinishHandlerTest.finishFeature(). Unfortunately, that
shell didn't have a title, and was thus a bit inconvenient to wait for.

* Give that shell (a TitleAreaDialog) a title.
  TitleAreaDialog.setTitle() does not set the shell's title!
* Simplify the code: use the async clickContextMenu instead of the
  sync variant wrapped in an asyncExec.
