DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable test in SynchronizeViewGitChangeSetModelTest

shouldExchangeCompareEditorSidesBetweenIncomingAndOutgoingChanges was
failing sporadically. The problem was that SWTBot found the same
StyledText using styledText(0) and styledText(1).

When getting the compare editor, we now focus it to make sure that it's
enabled. This results in the right StyledTexts to be returned.

Yay! Now we just have to fix the other unstable tests. I opened bug 345812 about GitRepositoriesViewFetchAndPushTest.
