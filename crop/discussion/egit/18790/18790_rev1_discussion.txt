DESCRIPTION

Make "Copy" command for reflog entries unambiguous

It is unclear what is copied when using that command. Therefore changed
to "Copy SHA-1" (which is also used in the commit viewers context menu
of the SHA1-1).

This is very weird: When trying this out, the label for the menu entry is still just "Copy" here. Any idea what might cause this?

I've experienced the same. Only a complete rebuild of the workspace helped. The old value is also still shown in the tooltip of the resource editor, which indicates that eclipse misses to rebuild correctly.
