DESCRIPTION

Factorize comparison and synchronization code

Use the same code for all comparison actions, making sure that
a comparison launches a synchronization instead when there is more
than a single resource to compare (either when the user selected
more than one resource or when the selected resource is part of a
larger logical model).

This created dead code within CompareUtil and GitSynchronizeModel,
which has been removed or made private.
