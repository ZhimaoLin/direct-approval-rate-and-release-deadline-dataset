DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Fix rebase buttons being shown after startup

When the staging view is shown after startup and it's still
initializing, the rebase buttons were shown for a time, and then hidden
after initialization was finished.

The reason was that updateRebaseButtonVisibility schedules the hiding
using Display#asyncExec. When called from createPartControl, this is not
necessary, so hide it directly there.
