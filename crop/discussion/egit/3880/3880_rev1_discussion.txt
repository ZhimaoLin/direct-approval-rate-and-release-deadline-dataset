Repository view.

Nice change, I really like it, just a few minor notes though.

Line:143, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditor.java -> "Title" is the id correct?  I would suggest making it "repositoryName" or something a bit more descriptive.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I suggest making the commit message more active:

Move the repository to the right side and only show the commit id on the left. In addition, clicking a repository reveals it in the Git Repositories view.
