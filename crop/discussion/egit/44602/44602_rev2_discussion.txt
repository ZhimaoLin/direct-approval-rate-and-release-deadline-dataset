DESCRIPTION

[wip] Consider the logical model when retrieving the previous revision

Resources from the logical model also need to be taken into
consideration when computing the previous revision. The previous
revision of a file will be the most recent revision from the set of
previous revisions in which any of the resources from that file's
logical model has changed.
