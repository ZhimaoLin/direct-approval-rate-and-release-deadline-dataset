DESCRIPTION

Consider the logical model when retrieving the previous revision

Resources from the logical model also need to be taken into
consideration when computing the previous revision. The previous
revision of a file will be the most recent revision from the set of
previous revisions in which any of the resources from that file's
logical model has changed.

Patch Set 1:

While fixing the previous revision problem, I also moved the prepareContext method from the CompareUtils to the ResourceUtil class, because the latter seemed as a more appropriate location for it. The prepareContext method is now needed in the RepositoryActionHandler, for retrieving the resource mappings when searching for the previous commit. If you do no agree with this change, I also pushed change 44600 (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/44600) to Gerrit, that leaves the prepareContext method in the CompareUtils class.
