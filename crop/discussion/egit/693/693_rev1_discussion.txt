DESCRIPTION

Relax constructor parameters of EGit operations

Certain EGit operations takes a Collection<IResource> as a
parameter in its constructor. The problem with this type is that
one cannot pass in a Collection<IFile> or a Collection<IFolder>.
Instead, you are forced to alter your existing collection into one
for IResources. The fix is to alter these constructors so that they
take a Collection<? extends IResource> instead.

Patch Set 1: No score

The other option is to just make them take IResource[] as the parameter. It doesn't really matter to me what happens but at the moment, there are constructors that takes collections and constructors that takes arrays. This inconsistency is very annoying.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

Yes, that is annoying. I guess we couldn't make our minds up. For the time being this change is ok. 

This variant works well with the fact that clients construct collection and a collections make a smooth interface, while arrays seems to be more "eclipse"-style.
