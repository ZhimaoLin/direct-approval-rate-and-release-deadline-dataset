EGit must work with Eclipse Luna. So something like this which relies on new API introduced only in platform.text 3.12 for Oxygen can only be used once the EGit baseline has advanced to Oxygen. Our current baseline is Luna.

Guess I spoke too quickly. Yes, it might work with older platform.text... just without the display fix.

Here's a way to make this compile without errors also against older platforms:

Line:72, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/OldNewLogicalLineNumberRulerColumn.java -> Move to LogicalLineNumberRulerColumn and make protected. Give it a javadoc that indicates it's part of the work-around.

Line:95, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/OldNewLogicalLineNumberRulerColumn.java -> Move these two functions also to LogicalLineNumberRulerColumn and remove xxx@xxx.xxx (Interestingly, we don't seem to have missing override annotations configured as error or warning...)

Line:162, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/OldNewLogicalLineNumberRulerColumn.java -> Also belongs to LogicalLineNumberRulerColumn
