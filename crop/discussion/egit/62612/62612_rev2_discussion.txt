DESCRIPTION

Make fetch from gerrit trim text.

When coping ref from gerrit web ui it often happens to copy it with a
leading and/or trailing space. Adding verify listeners on the text field
that trims the string handles these cases automatically and saves time
to not delete the space manually.

Bug: 484335
