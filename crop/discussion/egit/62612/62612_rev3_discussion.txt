DESCRIPTION

Make "Fetch from gerrit" trim input text

When coping a ref from gerrit web ui it often happens that it's copied
with a leading and/or trailing space. Adding verify listener on the text
field that trims the string handles these cases automatically and saves
time to not delete the space manually.
