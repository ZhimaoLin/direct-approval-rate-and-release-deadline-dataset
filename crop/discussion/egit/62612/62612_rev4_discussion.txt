DESCRIPTION

Make "Fetch from gerrit" trim input text

When coping a ref from gerrit web ui it often happens that it's copied
with a leading and/or trailing space. Adding a verify listener on the
text field that trims the string handles these cases automatically and
saves time to not delete the space manually.
