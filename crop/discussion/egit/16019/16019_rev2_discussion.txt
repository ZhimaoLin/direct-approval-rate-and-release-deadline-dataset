DESCRIPTION

GitSyncObjectCache erroneously changes the sync state of resources

When using the mapping context to determine the synchronization state
of individual resources, the GitSyncObjectCache changes all other
resources' state to "in-sync"... and never looks back. This causes
very weird issues when using Team APIs, and a totally unspecified
behavior such as a resource going from "MODIFIED" to "IN-SYNC" for no
obvious reason.

@Matthias: It's still ok to submit non-committer changes, right?

Patch Set 2:

Since we don't need a release review for a maintenance release we can accept non-committer changes until we create the 3.0.2 release. 

Though the size of this change is > 250 LOC so it looks like we need to file a CQ for it. Which fraction of this change comes from you and how much from Laurent and Mikael?

Patch Set 2:

Ok, that's good. Comparing to the first patch set from Laurent, it's about 30 % Laurent, 50 % Mikae?l and 20 % Robin. Do you file the CQ or should I try?
