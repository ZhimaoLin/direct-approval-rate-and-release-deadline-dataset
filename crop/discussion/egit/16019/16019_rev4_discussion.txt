DESCRIPTION

GitSyncObjectCache erroneously changes the sync state of resources

When using the mapping context to determine the synchronization state
of individual resources, the GitSyncObjectCache changes all other
resources' state to "in-sync"... and never looks back. This causes
very weird issues when using Team APIs, and a totally unspecified
behavior such as a resource going from "MODIFIED" to "IN-SYNC" for no
obvious reason.

Patch Set 4:

Reproduced the problem as core test in GitSubscriberResourceMappingContextTest#hasLocalChangeWhenRefreshingParentFolder and fixed in GitSyncObjectCache. The problem was that the refresh was done on the project level, and the filtering matched only exact paths. Now it also checks if any parent path was filtered.
