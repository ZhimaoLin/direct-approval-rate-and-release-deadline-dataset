Line:145, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> Looks like a trailing whitespace made it in here, could you remove it?

Line:10, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> Often people only have the source and then it is good if they can just open the bug from it. I don't see any value in suppresing that information.

Do you still want me to remove the bug number?

Line:145, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> Not really. If you look at the left side you will see that the trailing space was there before and is also in 'master'.

But I can of course remove it for you if you want.

Line:145, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> You are right, I assumed Gerrit only highlighted new whitespace in red.

Could you remove it?
