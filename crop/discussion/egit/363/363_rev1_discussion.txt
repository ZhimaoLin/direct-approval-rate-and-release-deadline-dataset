DESCRIPTION

Update EGit help pages from latest version of EGit user guide

Don't use image names containing underscores since wikitext 1.3.0 is
replacing them by blanks [1] which leads to broken links.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Files generated by wikitext. I had to manually fix some image links pointing to the navigation pictures (next.gif, prev.gif, home.gif) which are wrongly generated (images/images/xxx.gif instead of images/xxx.gif).

Looks good. 

Can you file the bug against wikitext for the images path?

Also, I need to update wikitext. Will file a bug.

We should also add the Git For Eclipse Users piece to the doc [1].
