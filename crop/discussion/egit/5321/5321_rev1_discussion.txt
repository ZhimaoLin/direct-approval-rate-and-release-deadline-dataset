DESCRIPTION

Change rebase tool bar button to pulldown

This change converts rebase tool bar button from push style to pulldown.
With such approach we can add missing continue, skip and abort actions.

Skip and abort actions are enabled only when repository is in rebasing
mode; continue action would is enabled when all conflicts are resolved.

Also fixes some possible NPE in rebase actions.

Very nice :-)

When the repository is selected in the Repositories View (or any node under the repository) the icon in the git toolbar looks disabled even when actions "Abort" and "Continue" in the drop-down are enabled. I think this is a general problem and selection of nodes in Repositories View doesn't enable corresponding git actions in git toolbar but it should do so. Probably some adapter to RepositoryViewNode types is missing here.

I think this drop-down should be also added to the staging view as this is a very convenient place to find and resolve conflicts.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Now after having resolved a conflict the user can press the button "Rebase" again which opens the branch selection dialog. This is not meaningful in state "Rebase interactive". Is it possible to disable the button but enabling the list in this case?

Patch Set 1:

Good catch Stefan! Yes, we cannot disable rebase icon because the drop down menu will be also disabled, but we can prevent action from being executed ... maybe also add an information dialog, but I'm not sure about this idea. I'll push another version in a minute ;)
