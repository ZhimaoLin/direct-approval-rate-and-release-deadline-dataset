DESCRIPTION

Change rebase tool bar button to pulldown

This change converts rebase tool bar button from push style to pulldown.
With such approach we can add missing continue, skip and abort actions.

Skip and abort actions are enabled only when repository is in rebasing
mode; continue action would is enabled when all conflicts are resolved.

Also fixes some possible NPE in rebase actions.
