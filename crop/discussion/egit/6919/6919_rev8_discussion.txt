DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Delete command for files and folders

Works on workspace and non-workspace resources.

For sharing the code with the Staging View, extracted the UI logic into
a new DeletePathsOperationUI class. This dispatches either to the
standard action from org.eclipse.ui or to DeletePathsOperation.

DeleteResourcesOperation was renamed to DeletePathsOperation to make it
clear that it operates on paths, not on potentially non-existing
resources.

Undo is also supported if all selected elements are resources.
