DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Delete command for files and folders

Works on workspace and non-workspace resources.

For sharing the code with the Staging View, extracted the UI logic into
a new DeleteResourcesOperationUI class. This dispatches either to the
standard action from org.eclipse.ui or to DeleteResourcesOperation.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

DeleteResourcesOperationUI and DeleteResourcesOperation should not use IResource for non-workspace resources, but accept IPaths instead, see here:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=378948#c12

I'll rework this change to fix this.
