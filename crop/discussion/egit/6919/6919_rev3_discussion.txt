DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Delete command for files and folders

Works on workspace and non-workspace resources.

For sharing the code with the Staging View, extracted the UI logic into
a new DeletePathsOperationUI class. This dispatches either to the
standard action from org.eclipse.ui or to DeletePathsOperation.

DeleteResourcesOperation was renamed to DeletePathsOperation to make it
clear that it operates on paths, not on potentially non-existing
resources.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Could you use the existing command with id org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete? This is done for all the other delete menu entries in EGit. It has the advantage that then the default key binding with the delete key works.

Patch Set 3:

No, the problem with that is that it does not work for non-workspace files - files which are not imported into Eclipse (e.g. README in jgit).
