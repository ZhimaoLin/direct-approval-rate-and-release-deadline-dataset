DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Delete command for files and folders

Works on workspace and non-workspace resources.

For sharing the code with the Staging View, extracted the UI logic into
a new DeletePathsOperationUI class. This dispatches either to the
standard action from org.eclipse.ui or to DeletePathsOperation.

DeleteResourcesOperation was renamed to DeletePathsOperation to make it
clear that it operates on paths, not on potentially non-existing
resources.

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

It seems that the test org.eclipse.egit.core.test.op.DeletePathsOperationTest.testDeleteResourceOutsideOfProject
is not stable (see hudson result).

I guess that the indexDiffCacheJob was already finished when the assert was called.

Maybe you can rather somehow check the expected result of the indexDiffCacheJob?

I pushed change I20c7a50b2034ce140396f0c639da082086ada510 for that some time ago, but it has not yet been reviewed. Could you review it please? Then I can rebase this change.

Ah, I haven't seen that (at $DAY_JOB time for egit is very limited at the moment). I submitted the change.
