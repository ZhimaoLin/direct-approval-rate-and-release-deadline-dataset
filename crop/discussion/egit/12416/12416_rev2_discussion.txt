DESCRIPTION

Perform CRLF conversion when saving index in partial staging

Before, it would just copy over the bytes as they were in the editor
(with working directory EOLs). So they ended up in the index and in the
repository.

Now we perform input CRLF conversion on save if configured.

Also gets rid of some unnecessary array copies in EditableRevision.
