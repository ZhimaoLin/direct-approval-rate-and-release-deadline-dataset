DESCRIPTION

Remove content length checking from AddOperationTest

With JGit updates to correct how smudged index entries
are handled these tests were currently failing.

Remove the explicit length checking from AddOperationTest
but still verify added entries are present in the index.

Length checking is not necessary here since files being in
the index after the operation completes is what is being
validated and file length checking is done in lower level
JGit unit tests.
