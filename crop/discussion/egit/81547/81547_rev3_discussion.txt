The patch reverts the CompareUtils to the state before the patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/43528/, with small corrections to the changed API in GitModelSynchronize.

Thanks. 

Probably this will be better, but unfortunately I have no idea what the original patch is supposed to fix (commit message does not say me anything I can understand because I'm not familiar with ModelProviders) and how it is used by the rest of the world.

Patch Set 3:

I don't see a way to provide a satisfactory fix in time for EGit 4.5, so I agree that the problematic commit should be reverted.
However, I would revert commit 218f8cec2b7ceb5b9b6d64bb037e8f875521e27a fully because there's no reason to keep the rest of it if a RemoteMappingContext is not used.
