Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I do not understand what the change should achieve. It skips the call of Team.isIgnoredHint(resource) for the parent and subsequently each second ancestor.

Thanks. It apparantely did not achieve what it was supposed to do. 

Unfortunately isIgnoreHint seems pretty fast, so If noone can prove there is a performance benefit we should leave the code as is. The reporter thought this was a problem, but I don't see any significant performance boost from fixing bug 330917
