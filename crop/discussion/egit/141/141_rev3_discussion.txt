DESCRIPTION

Fix sharing wizard page "Select Git Repository Location"

- enable selection of alternative repository mappings, this was not
  possible since treeItem didn't show selectable text in first column
  (Bug 296807)
- re-establish multi-selection by displaying most likely mapping on
  tree top level and avoiding tree if only one git dir found (bug 297139)
- fix rendering of git directory in column Repository
  - on Windows drive name was displayed in relative path
    e.g. C:.git instead of .git
  - on Windows backslash was used as separator before .git
    which is inconsistent:
      e.g. src/org\.git instead of src/org/.git

Bug: 296807, 297139

Looks great.

However, there is one problem: You can select more than one repo per project; it is not clear which one is taken in the end.

I have a fix for that and post a new patch.
