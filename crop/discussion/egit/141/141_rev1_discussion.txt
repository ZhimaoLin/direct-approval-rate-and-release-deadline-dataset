DESCRIPTION

Fix sharing wizard page "Select Git Repository Location"

- enable selection of alternative repository mappings, this was not
  possible since treeItem didn't show selectable text in first column
  (Bug 296807)
- re-establish multi-selection by displaying most likely mapping on
  tree top level and avoiding tree if only one git dir found (bug 297139)
- fix rendering of git directory in column Repository
  - on Windows drive name was displayed in relative path
    e.g. C:.git instead of .git
  - on Windows backslash was used as separator before .git
    which is inconsistent:
      e.g. src/org\.git instead of src/org/.git

Bug: 296807, 297139

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/ExistingOrNewPage.java -> do you take care about NoSuchElement Exceptions? Previous code did
