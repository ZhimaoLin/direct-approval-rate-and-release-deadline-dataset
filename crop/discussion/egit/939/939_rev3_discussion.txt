DESCRIPTION

Use "ssh" instead of "git+ssh" as default scheme for ssh protocol

This is the canonical URI form used by most other git tools. Add tooltips
to reduce the confusion for users used to the old syntax.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This looks good to me. I suggest this gets added (and the dependent one abandoned) as a means of fixing the ssh/git+ssh issue simply - then work on a new way of exposing the set of exported protocols from the JGit layer instead of the EGit layer.
