DESCRIPTION

Add "Pull from current branch" action to Team menu

This uses the new JGit Pull Command API which doesn't offer any
parameters (yet) and assumes that the upstream configuration for the
currently checked out branch specifies the correct origin and remote
branch for merging.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Shouldn't it be called "Pull current branch", "Pull to current branch" or "Pull into current branch"
