DESCRIPTION

Add "Pull" action to Team menu

This uses the new JGit Pull Command API which doesn't offer any
parameters (yet) and assumes that the upstream configuration for the
currently checked out branch specifies the correct origin and remote
branch for merging.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(5 inline comments)

See inline comments.
Some UI issues/proposals:
1. Result dialog has no title
2. 4 lines would be enough for fetch result table
3. Fetch Result and Merge Result could be grouped using frames with title "fetch result" and "merge result"

Line:201, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/merge/MergeResultDialog.java -> remove TODO

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PullFromUpstreamActionHandler.java -> Don't derice from MergeActionHandler. Extract canMerge to a utility class instead.

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PullFromUpstreamActionHandler.java -> In case of error the Job framework already sends an error popup and logs the error.

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> You can use Activator.error to create an error status.

Line:60, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullResultDialog.java -> Don't know if if this reuse of dialogs might cause problems.

Line:201, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/merge/MergeResultDialog.java -> Done

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PullFromUpstreamActionHandler.java -> Moved canMerge() to RepositoryActionHandler

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PullFromUpstreamActionHandler.java -> Done

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> Done

Line:60, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullResultDialog.java -> It did cause problems, and I had to adjust the other dialogs in order to fix these problems, but I think it is still a better solution than trying to re-implement the result display from scratch.
