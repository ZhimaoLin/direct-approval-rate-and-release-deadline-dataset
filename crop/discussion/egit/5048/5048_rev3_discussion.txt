Line:516, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> The button is still enabled when the configFile is not writable. I propose to instead use setEnabled(false) at the beginning of this method and setEnabled(true) inside the isWritable(...) block.

Line:516, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> That was intentional to be consistent with the other buttons to change and remove entries since they are still enabled when the file is not writable.

Thinking about it more I think I may broaden this commit to cover these cases as well so all buttons are consistent when the file is missing or not writable.
