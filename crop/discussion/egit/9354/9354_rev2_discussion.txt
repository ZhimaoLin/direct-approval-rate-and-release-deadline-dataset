DESCRIPTION

Remove the word Editor in the content menu in history filediff pane

The term editor implies `editableÂ´ which is misleading since it's
read only.

Line:1311, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> I like it in general, just not the parentheses. How about "Open Version", "Open Commit Version", "Open Committed Version", "Open This Version", "Open Version from Commit"?
