Line:82, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> this condition, negated, can be added to the if above:

if(!p.isOpen || projectLocation == null || !repositoryPath.isPrefixOf(projectLocation))

this saves us the more expensive IO check for the file.exists()

Is the automatic Hudson build on vacation?

Line:82, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> Done. The "projectFilePath.toFile().exists()" should actually not be required at all. But maybe it's a required workaround because EGit still circumvents the workspace model and directly fiddles with the file system.
