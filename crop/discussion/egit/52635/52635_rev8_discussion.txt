That would be quite smart of the plugin. :)
It sounds like an interesting enhancement, and maybe a replacement for a possible "Gitflow Branches View", I'm currently not sure how hard it would be to implement, though.
For me personally, I think it could occasionally be useful.
If that is something you would like to see in Gitflow, please open an enhancement request.
