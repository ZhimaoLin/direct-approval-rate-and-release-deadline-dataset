DESCRIPTION

Fix regression of switched sides in "Compare with Version in Ancestor"

In EGit 3.0, the "new" state was shown on the left and the "old" on the
right, which is consistent with other Eclipse usage, see bug 213780.

In the fix for bug 416808, the sides were switched (probably not
intentionally).

This restores the order and also renames the parameters in the compare
methods to be more clear. It's now also more consistent with how
includeLocal is handled, as local is shown on the left and uses the
"old" parameter for the right side.

Patch Set 1:

This was indeed unintentional. However, I really don't like "new" and "old" as the names of the compared states.

The "right" state might be a remote commit. This remote commit might very well be newer than the one we have locally (left). "local" and "remote" aren't good names either since the right might also be local. "ours" and "theirs" may be better?
