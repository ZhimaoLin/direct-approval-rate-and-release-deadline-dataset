DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Fix NPE when nested project is not connected

When there's a connected root project and a non-connected nested
project, ResourceUtil would return the resource from the nested project.
This would later lead to an NPE because the RepositoryMapping could not
be found. We now also take into account whether the resource has the Git
provider or not.
