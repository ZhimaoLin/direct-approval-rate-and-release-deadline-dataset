DESCRIPTION

Make commit viewer diff list scrollable

If a commit contains a big number of files, then the commit viewer diff
list cannot be scrolled down to see more than the very first files. This
seems to be caused by the section widget, which automatically sizes the
file list to contain every item.

By providing a size hint, the section no longer expands to contain all
items, but only consumes the available space of the editor.

Patch Set 1:

I guess this needs to be rebased onto https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/111897/ .

What I don't quite see is why this only occurs now. Perhaps the order in which these tests are run has changed. We don't seem to have any build records older than Nov 19, so I can't go look it up.
