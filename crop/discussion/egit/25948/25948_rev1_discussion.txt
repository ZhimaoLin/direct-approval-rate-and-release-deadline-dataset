DESCRIPTION

Enable logical merge support for projects not at repository root.

repository's root was failing due to erroneous handling of file paths.

Line:143, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/merge/TreeWalkResourceVariantTreeProvider.java -> This implementation is wrong. We want all "non-zero" modes to be equal, yet this will fail if, for example, base is non-zero but ours is. Replace this with the following once our dependencies are merged.

FileMode mode = FileMode.fromBits(modeBase);
if (mode == FileMode.MISSING)
	mode = FileMode.fromBits(modeOurs);
else if (modeOurs != 0 && mode != FileMode.fromBits(modeOurs))
	return false;
return modeTheirs == 0 || mode == FileMode.fromBits(modeTheirs);
