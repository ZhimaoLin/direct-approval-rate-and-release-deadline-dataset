DESCRIPTION

Always schedule repositories view refresh job if requested

Don't rely on Job.getState() API: "Note that job state is inherently
volatile, and in most cases clients cannot rely on the result of this
method being valid by the time the result is obtained."

The fix should not add any extra overhead but avoid unstable tests and
occasional missing refreshes of the repositories view.
