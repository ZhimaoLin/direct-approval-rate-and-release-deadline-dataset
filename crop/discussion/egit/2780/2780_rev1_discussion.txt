DESCRIPTION

Fetch and Push wizards: allow to finish on first page

If the user selects a remote (and not a URI) for push and fetch,
respectively, the corresponding wizards should allow to hit "Finish"
on the first page if the remote is configured properly (i.e. has at
least one URI and a ref spec (for fetch).

The bugs mentioned below are more concerned about the complexity of
the RefSpec page, so if the remote is not configured correctly, this
does not solve the issue, but for the 90 per cent case, the user will
be able to simply hit "Finish" without having to go through the other
pages. This also dramatically improves performance, as the
long-running ListRemoteOperation is not needed anymore to fill the
RefSpec combo boxes on the RefSpec page.
