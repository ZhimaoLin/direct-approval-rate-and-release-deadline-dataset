@Andre: is this still WIP? If so, what's still in the works? If it's ready for review, please remove the WIP marker from the commit message.

I was not sure if the patch is complete. Now our developers have used this patch now for some time and it looks like it's working with nested repos. I'm not using it daily and hope it make not problems. So i've removed the WIP state. Thanks! --> PS3
