DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Ensure reload occurs on UI-thread

This adds more guards and checks to the process of reloading
the staging view with a specified repository.  Reload clears
the current UI if a null repository is specified and so the
method should now always run on the UI-thread.  Also more strict
checks should be added to ensure the repository being displayed
is valid and registered.
