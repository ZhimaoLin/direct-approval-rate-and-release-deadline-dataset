Line:238, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> I think the dialog should be shown in any case because the user expects a dialog if the action label ends with ...

Line:271, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> How can it happen that there are unmerged commits? The currently checked out branch is not deleted by the action. Thus commits will not be lost.

Line:315, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> Does it make sense to continue here? Or just return false.

Line:324, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> nearly the same as in lines 224-233

Line:238, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> Good point. In terms of usability, however, if there is only one (not-checked-out) branch which is merged, I think we shouldn't bother the user (similar to the logic when deleting branches from the RepoView)... So perhaps we should rather drop the ellipsis instead?

Line:271, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler.java -> The logic is stolen from the similar action implemented in the RepoView. You may be deleting a branch which is ahead of the currently checked out one or you may be headless. In both cases, when the branch is deleted, there is nothing left after deletion that would keep the garbage collector from gobbling up the commit.
