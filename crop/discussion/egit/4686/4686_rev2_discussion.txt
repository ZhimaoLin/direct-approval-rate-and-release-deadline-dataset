Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I found the following problem:

1. There is a commit c with branch b pointing to it
2. I checkout c itself to get a detached HEAD (did it on command line)
3. Now I execute the Delete Branch action and do not get a warning.
As result I have a commit c with no branch pointing on it.

Patch Set 2:

Well, if you didn't submit anything with that new branch, that's fine. The logic comes from DeleteBranchOperation from egit.core, so there is nothing special here.
