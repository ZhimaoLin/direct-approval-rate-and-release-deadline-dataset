DESCRIPTION

Fix NPE with withAllProperties in platform.team < 3.8

withAllProperties of IFileRevision mentions in the Javadoc that null is
a valid return value. Unfortunately, platform.team did not check for
null until bug 358392 was fixed with 3.8.

To fix this for older versions, remove the overridden implementation and
use the method from the GitFileRevision parent class which returns this.
