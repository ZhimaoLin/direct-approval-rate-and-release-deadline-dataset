Line:1024, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Actually I think we should keep this. It works on 4.2+ without it, but frankly said I'm not sure it should. That it does may also be unintended behavior of the e4 implementation of actionbars. Plus I find it kind of logical that an item that toggles its visibility is dynamic.
