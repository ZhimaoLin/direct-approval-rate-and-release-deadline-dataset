DESCRIPTION

Default to the "Workspace" format for creating patches

This increases interoperability with the CVS plugin in Eclipse, which
can't apply patches in the "None" format, the previous default.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

The shared "Apply Patch..." wizard can handle the Git format. E.g. try this:

1. Change some lines in pom.xml of org.eclipse.egit.core. 
2. Create Patch in "None" format (this should really be called "Git" format, but that's another problem)
3. Run Team -> Disconnect on org.eclipse.egit.core (the Git provider is no longer active)
4. Run Team -> Apply Patch...
5. It should find the file and apply the patch cleanly

Do you have an example where this does not work? Or does the CVS plugin use a different wizard than the default one?

The reason I'm skeptical of this change is that changing it to "Workspace" breaks applying the patch in command-line Git and possibly other tools.

Abandoned

This indeed works with e.g. Eclipse 4.3. I used Eclipse 3.7 to work with CVS, which does not know where to apply a Git-style patch.

I'll rather update my Eclipse installation for CVS than pursue this change.
