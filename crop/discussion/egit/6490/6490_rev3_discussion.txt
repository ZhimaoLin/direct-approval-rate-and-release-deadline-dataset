DESCRIPTION

Open multiple detail dialogs from MultiPullResultDialog at once

This change enables multi-select in the MultiPullResultDialog and
changes the Details button to work with multi-selections. Together with
<https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/6291/>, this offers a better workflow for
users who want to review incoming changes from multiple repositories.
