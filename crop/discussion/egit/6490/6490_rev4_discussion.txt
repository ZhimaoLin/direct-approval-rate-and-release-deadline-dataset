Patch Set 4: Verified; IP review completed

The code looks good and works. The only small problem I see, is that the dialogs are hiding each other and one doesn't see immediately that more than one gets opened. We could set a different location for each dialog (move each a few pixel down and to the right).

Patch Set 4:

Yeah, I also thought about the overlapping, but I wanted to keep this change simple, and I actually like it better if they're all at the same place. You'll work through them sequentially anyway, so having them at the same position is no big deal and even avoids stealing more screen space.

In the long run, all these result dialogs should be moved into a view anyway. But I don't think anybody has time to do this right now, so I just wanted to improve the current situation without too much effort.
