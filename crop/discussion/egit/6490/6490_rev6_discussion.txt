DESCRIPTION

Open multiple detail dialogs from MultiPullResultDialog at once

This change enables multi-select in the MultiPullResultDialog and
changes the Details button to work with multi-selections. Together with
<https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/6291/>, this offers a better workflow for
users who want to review incoming changes from multiple repositories.

The change in PullResultDialog ensures that simple result dialogs
without updates also store their location (but not their size).

Patch Set 6:

Dani convinced me that the flush-stacked dialogs don't look nice. Fixed that by adding horizontal and vertical offsets to the child dialogs.

Patch Set 6 also fixes a bunch of related issues:
- correct persisting of the location of trivial update result dialogs
- don't store bad locations due to our shifting
- better focus behavior when closing one of multiple result dialogs
