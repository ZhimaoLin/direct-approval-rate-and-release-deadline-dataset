DESCRIPTION

Open multiple detail dialogs from MultiPullResultDialog at once

This change enables multi-select in the MultiPullResultDialog and changes the Details button to work with multi-selections. Together with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/6291/ , this offers a better workflow for users who want to review incoming changes from multiple repositories.
