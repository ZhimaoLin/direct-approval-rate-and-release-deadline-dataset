DESCRIPTION

Add Compare/ReplaceWithPrevious support for multiple files

The CompareWithPrevious and ReplaceWithPrevious actions now also support
scenarios where the current selection consists of multiple files (for
example via ResourceMappings).

The previous commit is the next-to-last commit which touched any of the
files.
