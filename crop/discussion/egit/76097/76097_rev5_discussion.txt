DESCRIPTION

Compare/ReplaceWithPrevious support for multiple resources (in mappings)

The CompareWithPrevious and ReplaceWithPrevious actions now also support
scenarios where the current selection consists of a single object but
maps to multiple files (commonly via ResourceMappings).

The previous commit is the next-to-last commit which touched any of the
resources.

Patch Set 5:

Thanks a lot for your review!

I think you managed to find the single slightly confusing case ;) When distributing your projects above multiple working sets (so no "working set = repository" mindset) or only working from within Eclipse (no commits touching resources outside of the workspace) or simply not looking especially for the commit id, I think there would have been no confusion ;)

Thanks for your time!
