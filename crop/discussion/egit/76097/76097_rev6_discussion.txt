DESCRIPTION

Compare/ReplaceWithPrevious support for multiple resources (in mappings)

The CompareWithPrevious and ReplaceWithPrevious actions now also support
scenarios where the current selection consists of a single object but
maps to multiple files (commonly via ResourceMappings).

The previous commit is the next-to-last commit which touched any of the
resources.
