DESCRIPTION

Prune deleted repositories from RepositoryCache

RepositoryCache is not removing repositories that were deleted. When queried
it will deliver old entries for a new repo created at the very same path.
I now remove dead repos when they're looked up and when all repos are
requested:

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryCache.java -> looks like you incompletely renamed V to Repository

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/RepositoryCacheTest.java -> this license header doesn't match the Eclipse license template. compare it to the header in other source files.

Line:49, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/RepositoryCacheTest.java -> how does this assertion prove that the repository is no longer in the cache ? I'd expect isNotIn here, or do I miss something ?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/:/./
