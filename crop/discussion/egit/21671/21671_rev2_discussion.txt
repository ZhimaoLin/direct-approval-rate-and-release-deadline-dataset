DESCRIPTION

Prevent premature UI refreshes by batching resource changed events

All long running operations which may potentially lead to premature UI
refreshes e.g. by changing files in the file system should use
WorkspaceJob. This will batch resource change events until the job is
finished running and remove the overhead imposed by repeated UI
refreshes reacting on events trickling in if not batched.
