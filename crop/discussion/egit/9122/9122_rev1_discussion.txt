DESCRIPTION

[sync] Show single non-workspace file in Git Commit Model

Combination of small errors in current implementation leads to "no
changes" when only one non-workspace file was modified. Now any
modification to non-workspace files (addition, deletion, modification)
will alwasy be shown in synchronize view.
