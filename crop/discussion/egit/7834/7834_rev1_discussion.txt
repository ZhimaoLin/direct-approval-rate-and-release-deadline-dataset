DESCRIPTION

Fix dialog activation order with multiple detail dialogs

Multiple detail dialogs are stacked, and the user expects that when he closes the topmost dialog, then the next in the stack comes to front.

The current implementation doesn't work reliably due to https://bugs.eclipse.org/388667

I also hate to ask every contributor for these assertions, I voted on this bug

Line:287, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/MultiPullResultDialog.java -> mark this as a TODO

Line:294, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/MultiPullResultDialog.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:294, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/MultiPullResultDialog.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: this commit message is too wide, format it according to [1] or use EGit's auto hard-wrapping
