Patch Set 2:

Looks like change I00abb25 breaks something. Since that change, which is the grand-parent of this one, GitRepositoriesViewTest.testLinkWithSelectionNavigator() is blocked indefinitely. Main task is constantly busy in TestUtil.processUIEvents() while the WorkbenchTestable thread is blocked in TestUtl.showView() waiting to do its Display.syncExec...
