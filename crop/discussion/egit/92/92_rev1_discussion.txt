DESCRIPTION

Specify explcitly that unit tests should be run in UI thread

Every time when launch configuration opened in a 'Run
configurations...' dialog a parameter 'Run in UI thread' would be set
to true. Launch configuration file would be modified unnecessarily
when user runs it. So this value has been set explicitly to prevent
this annoying behavior.

I don't see this behaviour, nor the option  Could you, please add some information on Eclipse version and where in the dialog you see this or reference to a known eclipse bug, if any.

Ok, I checked this for JUnit Plug-in Test configuration type under the Test tab. There is no such option for Version: 3.4.2, Build id: M20090211-1700. But it's there for Version: 3.5.0, Build id: I20090611-1540 (Galileo) and Version: 3.5.0, Build id: I20090917-0100 (Helios).
