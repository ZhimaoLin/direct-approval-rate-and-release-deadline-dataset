DESCRIPTION

Specify explcitly that unit tests should be run in UI thread

Eclipse 3.5 introduced a new parameter 'Run in UI thread' in a 'Run
configurations...' dialog. Every time when a launch configuration opened
this parameter would be set to true and a launch configuration file would
be modified unnecessarily. So this value has been set explicitly to
prevent this annoying behavior.
