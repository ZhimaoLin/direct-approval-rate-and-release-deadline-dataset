- always persist dialog width; only persist height for nontrivial
content

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good (though I would inline the persistedSize variable)

Line:67, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullResultDialog.java -> It's the "nontrivial" in "only persist height for nontrivial
content".

See further down in createDialogArea(..), where the "else if (hasRebaseResults())" branch only creates one-line labels. "hasUpdates" is not the condition we should use here.

We don't want to persist the size of the "small" dialogs, that's why I renamed the field from "hasUpdates" to "persistSize" when I fixed the condition.

Robin, have you seen Markus' explanation? For me, this now looks good to me.
