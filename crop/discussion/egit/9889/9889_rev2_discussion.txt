Patch Set 2:

I'm not absolutely sure, but I don't think that my changes affect the failed test. When debugging the failed test locally, my changes don't even get called (locally the test is green), however, I'm not familiar with UI-Tests.

Can anyone confirm that my changes broke the test ReplaceActionsTest.testReplaceWithPreviousWithMerge? How so?
