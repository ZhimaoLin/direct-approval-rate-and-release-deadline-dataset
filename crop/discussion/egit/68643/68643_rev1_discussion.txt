DESCRIPTION

Fix potential NPE in IndexDiffCacheEntry

It's possible that an IndexDiffCacheEntry is disposed while an
IndexDiffUpdateJob is running. While we do cancel such a job, we do not
join on it. We do, however, null out the previous IndexDiffData. A still
running job therefore needs to be careful about using this property.

I've seen this occasionally in our Hudson logs, the last time in [1].
