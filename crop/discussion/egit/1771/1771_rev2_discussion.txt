DESCRIPTION

Git Project import: don't hide but gray out existing projects

The changes in the tests were found to be needed in order to stabilize
the GitCloneWizardTest when started alone (outside the suite).
The initialization logic for setting the default target directory was moved
to the base test class and removed from the specific subclasses.
