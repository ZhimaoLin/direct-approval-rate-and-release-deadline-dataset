DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Store the commit message on Eclipse shutdown

When closing Eclipse or only the staging view, the commit message (and
amend state, author, etc.) are stored now. Previously it was stored only
when switching the repository displayed in the staging view.

The restore part already exists and together with this change will now
prevent lost commit messages due to Eclipse restarts.
