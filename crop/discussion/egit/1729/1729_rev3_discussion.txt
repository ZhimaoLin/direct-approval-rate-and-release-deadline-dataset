DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Enable multiple resource selection

Enable Team->Show in History on a multi-selection of resources. The
selected resources will be used as a filter for the History View.
This does NOT work for the generic Show In->History action; also, if
"Link with current selection" is on, this will always work for the last
clicked resource. The latter limitations are due to a shortcoming of the
history framework.
