DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Enable multiple Resource selection

Enable Team->Show in History on a multi-selection of Resources. The
selected resources will be used as filder for the history view.
This does NOT work for the generic Show In->History action; also, if
"Link with current selection" is on, this will always work for the last
clicked resource. The latter limitations are due to a shortcoming of the
history framework.
