DESCRIPTION

Fix repository actions not working if project is root of repository

Ifdda37fc51a0cb29145e1c29b09d45317fc068ea changed
RepositoryActionHandler to use ResourceMapping.getMapping(IPath) (it
used the IResource variant before). That used to return null when the
passed path was the repository working directory.

This change fixes it to also return the correct mapping for the
repository working directory path.
