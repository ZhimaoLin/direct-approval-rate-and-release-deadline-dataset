DESCRIPTION

Decorate lightweight tags with checked out overlay.

Lightweight tags that point to the current detached HEAD commit
will now display the checked out overlay in the top right corner
similar to branches and annotated tags.

This also removes the 'L' overlay currently shown for lightweight
tags since it was displayed in the top right corner and would be
invisible when the checked out overlay was also drawn.

The 'L' looked abnormal when in tested in other corners so instead
a new icon was added for annotated tags and lightweight tags will
use the simple tag icon.

The new annotated tag icon is the standard tag icon with an
author overlay on the right side denoting that the tag has a
known tagger and message.

Patch Set 1:

the author overlay is hard to spot at least on my mac book screen, it rather looks like the icon got dirty on the right side. Maybe you could choose a different color compared to the blueish icon yielding better contrast for this overlay
