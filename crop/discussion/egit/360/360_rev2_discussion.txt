DESCRIPTION

Remove dependency on org.eclipse.ui bundle from org.eclipse.egit.core

CloneOperation, ListRemoteOperation and PushOperation not implement
IRunnableWithProgress and just provide the run method. The caller of
these operations can then use a Job or an
IRunnableWithProgress/ModelContext when required.

Now it's safe to remove dependency on org.eclipse.ui bundle.
