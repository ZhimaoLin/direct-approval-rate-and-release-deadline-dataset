Line:23, org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport/pom.xml -> style nit: trailing whitespace

Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.repository/pom.xml -> style nit: trailing whitespace

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.repository/pom.xml -> why isn't that part of the 4.6 target platform ?

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> what's the motivation to have importer and smartimporter ? What's the difference ?

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.repository/pom.xml -> 4.6 TP already referencs Mars SimRel. I believe if main EGit bundles want to keep backward compatibility, then we should avoid polluting TP with newer artifacts that are only necessary for this extension.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> There is no difference. The "legacy" one relies on the e4 bundle, whereas the new one relies on Platform 4.6.
As long as EGit doesn't depend on Platform 4.6, I thought it could be interesting to keep both versions, but if you prefer, I can simply "migrate" the existing one to Platform M6.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> ok, please mention this consideration in the commit message

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.repository/pom.xml -> Ok, thanks. However, since the API is in Neon M6 and that the referenced URL contains Neon M5, it means that this build is going to fail.
Either we wait for M6 to be done before merging the patch, or we can consider updating the target file to rely on the /staging/ simrel URL.

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.repository/pom.xml -> that's the purpose of the egit-4.6-staging.target, I'll upload another patchset setting this as the default target platform in pom.xml
