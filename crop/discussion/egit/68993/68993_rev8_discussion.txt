org.eclipse.e4.ui.importer bundle for backward compatibility purpose.

Patch Set 8:

This contribution removes older bundle (relying on deprecated e4 bundle) and replaces it by a new one, that simply depends on org.eclipse.ui.ide 3.12.0+ (containing the API that was previously in e4, with changes).

I need to fix the issues with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69099/ in order to fix this build error caused by the fact that we still build EGit against Mars. 

Some sessions with Nevaeh Johnston revealed that the problems with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69099/ are caused by the fact that platform now builds using Java 8 and Java 7's unpack200 can't unpack pack200 archives built with Java 8 :-(. 

So we have to switch the JGit and EGit builds to Java 8 using source and target version 1.7 since Java 7's unpack200 fails to unpack platform bundles. p2 erranously reports these errors as download errors 
:-{O} 

We still want to support Java 7 so that EGit can be used with Java 7 in older Eclipse versions so we still need to generate Java 7 compatible byte code
