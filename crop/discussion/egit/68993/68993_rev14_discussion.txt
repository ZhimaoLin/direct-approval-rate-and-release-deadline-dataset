This last patch is IMO good to go. The failure on CI are not related to the change.

Patch Set 14: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

As discussed earlier the importer test should be improved to not rely on cloning an externally hosted repository, this is slow and doesn't work if there is no internet connection or a proxy is in between.

accept this for now to include it in M7, though we should improve the test
