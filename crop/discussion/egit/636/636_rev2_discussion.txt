DESCRIPTION

Make the org.eclipse.core.test bundle a fragment bundle

A fragment bundle allows us direct access to internal packages of the
host bundle that we are testing without the hazzle with export/import.

Since we cannot have an activator for a fragment we now set up the
MockSystemReader in the GitTestCase that our tests derive from anyway.
