DESCRIPTION

Use the source revision instead of local data for synchronizations

EGit allows for comparisons with three remote revisions (notably through
"synchronize with each other" with two branches selected in the
repository explorer). However, Team always uses the local data as the
"source" (or left) side of a comparison. This patch allows us to use the
actual source commit instead of the local file when needed.

This also changes GitModelSynchronizeParticipant#asCompareInput() since
we can use the cached content fetched by the subscriber context instead
of re-fetching it from the remote.

Patch Set 6:

This fix is very bad: it makes the left side of the compare editor read-only, so that one can no longer type and Copy Right To Left is not available.

Please either fix this asap or revert this change until a solution is available. Currently, the nightly build is unusable for me due to this bug.

Patch Set 6:

Dani, I can indeed reproduce when using "synchronize with workspace". Was that your use case too (looking into that one)?
