DESCRIPTION

Use the source revision instead of local data for synchronizations

EGit allows for comparisons with three remote revisions (notably through
"synchronize with each other" with two branches selected in the
repository explorer). However, Team always uses the local data as the
"source" (or left) side of a comparison. This patch allows us to use the
actual source commit instead of the local file when needed.

Yes, the failure is most likely due to this change, but try as I might, I have not been able to successfuly run the SWTBot tests locally. I planned to update this change request with the updated test, but for now I cannot fix it. There is no use reviewing this for now, sorry about that.

Patch Set 2:

What is the problem with running the SWTBot tests? Maybe I have encountered it before. A gotcha is that they need to be run with a special runner, not the normal "JUnit Plug-in Test": http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#EGit_UI_Tests

Ah, just saw your post on the mailing list. Have you tried running just the single test with SWTBot?

Patch Set 2:

I am totally stupid -_-. Yes, The test does run locally if I run it alone (I lost a full day trying out to run the suite :s). I'll update this change request after I've tried your proposed workaround on the mailing list (who knows, that might also fix the "random" errors from swtbot tests).
