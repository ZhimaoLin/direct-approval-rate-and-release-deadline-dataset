DESCRIPTION

Project importer: consider different users and repo suffixes

Two URLs differing in users *and* repo suffixes (.git) should be treated
the same.  This was not handled properly with the last fix for bug
453892.

In addition there is now also test cases for the relevant parts of
ProjectReferenceImporter.
