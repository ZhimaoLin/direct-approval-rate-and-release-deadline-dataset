DESCRIPTION

Scalability: label decorator should cache computed repo branch state

In workspaces with lot of projects from the same repository the most
decorator time is spent on computing branch state of the same
repository. A repository/branch state weak hash map is introduced in
DecoratableResourceHelper to avoid redundant calculation of the
repository branch state. The map entries are invalidated by
GitLightweightDecorator on each index change.
