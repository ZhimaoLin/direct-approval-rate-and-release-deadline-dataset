DESCRIPTION

Remove default handlers for checkout commands

Provide dedicated handlers with appropriate activeWhen clauses
instead.

The remaining default handler for org.eclipse.egit.ui.commit.Checkout
cannot be removed (yet). The command is used for the checkout button
in the CommitEditor's toolbar. This is in the header of a
SharedHeaderFormEditor, and the usual technique for eliminating
default handlers doesn't work in that case: the button always
remains disabled. Something strange with the site or the selection
provider is going on, or these toolbar buttons need some more
hook-up, but I don't see what's missing.
