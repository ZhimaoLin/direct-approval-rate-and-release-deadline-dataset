DESCRIPTION

Add a "Git Repositories View"

This is a very first implementation of a "Git Repositories View"
(analogous to e.g. CVS Repositories View). It allows addition
and removal of local Git Repositories, cloning of Git
Repositories as well as checking-out of branches.

Project import can be done using the standard "Import Existing Projects"
wizard.

We should use bug 301168 to discuss this.
