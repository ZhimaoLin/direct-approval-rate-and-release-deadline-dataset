resource modified in working copy is selected. It is disabled when there

resource, this allow commit partial staged resources eg. when user use
compare editor to stage only single change in file.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

It works as you described but I think this behavior is inconsistent and hard to understand:
- if there are some staged modifications and some non-staged modifications in a different file and no files selected in commit dialog the staged modifications are committed
- if some non-staged modification is selected in the commit dialog then staged modifications are no longer committed
- also the decorators in the commit dialog don't show the difference between staged and non-staged modifications so it's hard to spot the difference (only tooltips show that)
- meaning of checkboxes is different when comparing behavior for staged and non-staged changes
- is it important that the selection scope decides on checkbox state for files listed in commit dialog or could we drop this ?

Maybe we should change the commit dialog to also use standard git commit semantics and only commit staged changes. "Add to index" is already available in the context menu, we should then also add all the menu entries available in staging view. This would mean the commit dialog could probably share more of its implementation with staging view.

Good point Matthias, I'll work on improving commit dialog so that it will mimic native commit behavior.
