DESCRIPTION

Configurable date format used consistently throughout EGit

Part 1: UI and use it in history view.

* New DateFormatPreferencePage.
* New UI preferences.
* New PreferenceBasedDateFormatter.
* Changed uses of GitDateFormatter and DateFormat to use the new
  PreferenceBasedDateFormatter.

Some implementation notes:
* The default format is the custom format (already existing DATE_FORMAT
  preference. Reasons: this is a reasonable (local) format, and if
  the user had configured something there, it will still be used. Keep
  surprises for the user at a minimum.
* PreferenceBasedDateFormatter is a subtype of GitDateFormatter to keep
  changes at a minimum. It also helps in the views where the user can
  explicitly force RELATIVE dates.
* The old date format (under "Label Decorations/Other/DateFormat")
  preference UI has been removed.
* Where we use label providers, make those listen to preference changes
  related to their labels (dates, showing e-mails), not the viewers.
  The label providers fire an event when their state changes, users
  can just listen on those events. Limits the proliferation of checking
  specific preferences, and simplifies some code.
* Otherwise, views or viewers refresh on date format preference
  changes.
* This commit also fixes
   - bug 339797 (custom format for date column in history view),
   - bug 477151 (preference page silently ignores incorrect date
     formats)

Patch Set 2:

Part 2 will be using the new PreferenceBasedDateFormatter in the rest of the EGit UI. I just split it up to remain well below the limit of 1000 added lines beyond which a CQ would be needed. It's also a bit easier to verify if UI behavior changes occur (for now) only in history and the two dialogs.
