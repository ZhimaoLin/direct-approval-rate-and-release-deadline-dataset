DESCRIPTION

Push Tags: Fix reveal code

When the code was changed from a table to a tree during review, this
broke (just using reveal does not seem to work for a tree).

can't spot a difference in behavior compared to the previous version so what's the problem you are trying to fix ? I tried on Kepler SR1

Patch Set 1:

In the repositories view, select the 3.2.xxx tag of the jgit repo, and then do "Push Tag...". The tag should be checked and it should also be visible (tree scrolled to the end).

With just reveal as before, it doesn't work here on Linux, the tree's scroll position is at the start. With this change, it works.

Maybe it's a platform-specific problem?
