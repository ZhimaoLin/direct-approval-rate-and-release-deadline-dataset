DESCRIPTION

Push Tags: Fix reveal code on Linux

Just using viewer.reveal does not work on Linux. So set the selection
with reveal and then clear the selection again.

Also fix the code to not cause creating of the same TagNodes twice by
remembering them.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Looks like a bug in SWT on Linux (GTK) then. I changed the comment. Also fix the inefficient use of the content provider (it created the tag nodes twice before).
