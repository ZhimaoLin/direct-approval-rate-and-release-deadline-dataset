DESCRIPTION

Load branches, tags, and diffs in background job

Previously the CommitEditorPage loads all data displayed
on the UI thread which would cause temporary freezes for
branches with many tags/branches or commits that changed
many files.

Now all loading is done in a background job with only the
author, committer, parent, and message displaying initially.
