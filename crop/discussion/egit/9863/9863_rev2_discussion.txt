DESCRIPTION

Revert "Ensure consistent ignore handling compared to cgit"

Use Eclipse' ability to automatically ignore resources.

This reverts commit 4a87652bde4f88327288a9cc02f3f4951fdf3aab.

The reverted commit makes it hard to use EGit. The cited
discrepancy is a very very small issue and the fix is
much worse.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think I managed to implement auto-ignore of derived resources which IMO fixes this problem in a better way, see I02d0e12e9bee94b1121a1fa57eedfc268dd8e5ef

We merged Matthias' change for 2.3, and I also think that it's better than reverting to the previous state (which also had problems).
