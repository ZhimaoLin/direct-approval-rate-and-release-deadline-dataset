DESCRIPTION

Interactive rebase view toolbar can incorrectly activate buttons

Currently interactive rebase view plan toolbar can incorrectly handle
changeset table selection changes in case of multiple selected
changesets.
RebaseInteractiveStepActionToolBarProvider#mapActionItemsToSelection
activates corresponding button on the toolbar in case of single
selection and can deactivate all buttons in case on multi selection (if
selected changesets have different rebasing plans). Current
implementation does not handle situation in which another button needs
to be activated. For example, if previously selected changeset had
"reword" plan ("reword" button activated) and new selection is two
changesets with "fixup" plan then expected behaviour is to activate
"fixup" button, but actually "reword" button will remain activated. 

Proposed implementation always activates button corresponding to the
first selected changeset plan and deactivates this button if necessary
(i.e. selected changesets have different plans).

Thanks for your contribution!

Could you please rebase both changes on the current master? As this is a new feature this is where they should be applied.

This change looks good and also fixes the case when you have selected commits with multiple actions and deselect commits so that you end up with a selection that has only one kind of action. In that case all buttons remained disabled. With this fix it correctly enables the button for the single action.
