Patch Set 10:

The last patch set should be fine, though I somehow created a rebase mess.
It would be great if 52635 [1] could be merged first, so I can fix this on top of master HEAD.

Patch Set 10: Code-Review-1

with this change when finishing a feature the squash option doesn't work anymore, I get the error message:

An internal error occurred during: "Finishing feature...".
Cannot combine --squash with --no-ff.
