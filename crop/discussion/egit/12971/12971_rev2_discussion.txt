DESCRIPTION

Share project: Allow "Create Repository" when repo exists in parent

When one has a .git e.g. in /home/username and a project somewhere
below, the only choice offered by the wizard was to use that repository.
This change also enables creating a new repository at the project
location (but only if such a repository does not already exist).

Ok, should be fixed. The change with the welcome view was because it failed locally. Removed because it's unnecessary code, it's already done in the EGitTestCase base class.
