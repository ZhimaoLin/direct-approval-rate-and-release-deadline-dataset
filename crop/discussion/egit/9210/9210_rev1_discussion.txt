DESCRIPTION

Add apache commons compress to target platform

We use a private copy of an Orbit I-build which contains this library
since no S- or R-build is available in time for releasing JGit 2.2. We
will replace this with an official S- or R-build as soon as this is
available.

Patch Set 1:

`mvn clean install` in egit works with this change again, but I'm getting an error when installing pgm from the resulting update site:

Missing requirement: Eclipse JGit Command Line Interface 2.2.0.201212131007 (org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.feature.group 2.2.0.201212131007) requires 'org.kohsuke.args4j [2.0.0,3.0.0)' but it could not be found

I don't know if that's related though.

true, I need to combine this with the changes
- I60425c746cd50f1875ef8597a8bbefb598b8c982 "Ensure that jgit p2 repository is self-contained"
- Iee995dcde4a1ce48ea9a17b54ba8299132c09ff1 "Ensure that egit p2 repository is self-contained"

and also package the apache commons compress bundle into our p2 repository during the build

Ah, ok. Let's submit this now so that the nightly update site will at least build again, agreed?

Thinko there, the nightly build is based on master.. But we should submit it nevertheless.
