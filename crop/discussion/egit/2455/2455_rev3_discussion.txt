Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I guess we should follow up in

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,2456

If that's correct, please abandon this one.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

Oh, I'm sorry. Total confusion on my side...
In the long run, we should replace the coding in CloneOperation to a neat little call to the JGit API CloneCommand, but a quick look tells me we can't do this yet...
Thanks for the fix.
