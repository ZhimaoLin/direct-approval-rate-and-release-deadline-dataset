DESCRIPTION

Fix history view context menu

The entries "Compare with working tree", 
"Compare with each other" and "Open"were shown not only 
for a commit but also for a file in the list of files contained 
in a commit. However, they opened a compare editor 
for the resource which is the input of the 
history view.
