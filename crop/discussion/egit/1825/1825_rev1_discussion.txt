DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Refactor menu contributions

This moves the context menu handling out of the GitHistoryPage
into the respective controls (commit graph table, commit file viewer,
and commit details viewer, respectively).
This reduce the complexity of the GitHistoryPage, and it puts the
responsibilities where they belong.
The new menu contributions discussed in the bug below were also
added to the CommitFile viewer context menu.

Good idea to clean this up.

This change has quite a number of pure formatting changes, maybe these could be factored out into a separate change only having formatting changes. Also the new menu contributions don't seem to be related to this refactoring but deserve another change

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> looks like this is a separate change
