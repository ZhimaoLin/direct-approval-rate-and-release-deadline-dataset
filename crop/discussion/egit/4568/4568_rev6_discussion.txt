I tried again and observe still same wrong behavior, here the steps
- create 3 tags on subsequent commits in history view
- in repositories view open the tags node and select the first 2 tags just created
- click "Delete tag" and cancel the confirmation dialog
- select only the first tag
- again click "Delete tag" -> confirmation dialog asks if it should delete 2 tags
- click "Ok" -> first 2 tags get deleted

My environment:
- Mac OS X 10.6.8
- Indigo SR1 Eclipse SDK
- Java 7 Mac Preview

Patch Set 6:

I was able to reproduce on Mac OS X, I think it may be due to this platform bug:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=355200

When I debug this, the selection returned is two elements even though only one element is actually selected.

- ok, I would then accept this change if this works on other platforms
- though on Mac the new delete tag tests consistently fail

Patch Set 6:

Also on linux testDeleteTag and testDeleteTags are failing. It seams that SWTBoot can't find "Delete Tag" menu option ... AFAIR we already have workaround for this issue in sync view test cases ...
