Line:10, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> it seems this is not available in Indigo SR1, currently we support Galileo and newer, we announced to drop Galileo support with the next EGit release but we want to still support Helios. If this version is not available in older platforms this needs to be installed as a separate optional feature.

This dependency update also breaks the current Hudson build which checks for Galileo compatibility.
