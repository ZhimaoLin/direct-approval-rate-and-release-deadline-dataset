Line:17, org.eclipse.egit.import/plugin.xml -> You will need to update Eclipse to 3.8 M6, which is coming out this week, or one of the latest I-builds. The change causing this has been introduced in bug 372020. This should also fix the problem you see in the page class.

Line:17, org.eclipse.egit.import/plugin.xml -> could you point me to a working I-build ? I tried I20120312 but didn't succeed to compile egit.ui and egit.mylyn.ui with that version as it couldn't resolve some swt widget dependencies:

The type org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files	GitVariableResolver.java	/org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/variables	

The type org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files	CommitHyperlinkDetector.java	/org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui

Line:17, org.eclipse.egit.import/plugin.xml -> Hmm, I've just upgraded to I20120313-2000 and see no errors. There were 3 builds on March 12th: at 0800, 1300 and 1800. Which one did you pick? I will download the same one. You're on Windows, right?

Will try to update to the build you mentioned.

Patch Set 7:

Matthias, something must be broken on your side (workspace). I did not have any issue (errors) when I looked at patch set 7 and just now I verified this on the latest 3.8 build (N20120320-2000, Windows 7) with a new workspace. Maybe your PDE target platform is pointing to a wrong (old) build?

With patch set 8 I get two errors saying that Javadoc is missing for new public methods, which I think you added yourself.

Can you please try again?

Patch Set 7:

I looked a bit closer at the errors you get, and I suspect that you get hit by the infamous bug 73957. Please try whether importing 'org.eclipse.swt' and the SWT fragment for your platform (use File > Import... > Plug-ins and Fragments) solves the problem. Do a Project > Clean... all + rebuild after the import in case there are still errors.

Patch Set 7:

Very strange. I assume you already tried to re-add the target platform. Maybe something else you have in your workspace is causing the conflict. Create a new 'Eclipse Application' launch configuration and on the 'Plug-ins' click 'Validate Plug-ins'. Maybe this reveals some conflicts.

Without having the workspace at hand, I can't say more and I won't be at EclipseCon. Maybe it helps if you simply start with a new workspace, load the change and then import the relevant projects. Don't add the test projects as a start, to verify that at least the production code compiles and we can proceed with the CQ.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:17, org.eclipse.egit.import/plugin.xml -> I've downloaded Eclipse 4.2.0 I20120313-1735 for Cocoa x64_64, cloned JGit and EGit, imported required deps from Orbit, fetched 4899/7 from Gerrit. The only errors I see are related to API usage/compatibility, all from JGit. I've got no clue why you're seeing those SWT errors. Can we have someone else to look at this?
