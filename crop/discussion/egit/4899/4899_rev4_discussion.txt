Patch Set 4: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this; Unclean IP, do not check in

- rebased and updated versions to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
- added missing pom and added modules to parent
- added missing project prefs
- added missing about.html
- verified it works when using Juno 4.2 M5 :-)

TODOs: 
- make modules optional so that maven build only builds these modules when run against Juno
- file CQ
- could you come up with a test (can come in a separate change)

I see what you're saying, would in that case "import" be any better? In Platform/Team the package is called "importing" but I don't think gerund is suitable for the project name.

Mykola, is that because of bug 372020?

If fix for 372020 will break current implementation, does it make sense to implement org.eclipse.core.filesystem.filesystems right now?

"import" sounds better than "scm"

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/plugin.xml -> if your inline comment is shown as draft on patchset #2 you need to click the review button on the patchset #2 this draft is residing in and click "Publish Comments", this should publish this draft comment

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/plugin.xml xxx@xxx.xxx an eventual fix for bug 372020 definitely won't break the extension in the proposed shape. 

The fix should make Platform/Team not require a fileSystemScheme when importing bundles via SCM URLs. Supported values provided in org.eclipse.team.core.bundleImporters ext point [1] should be enough. In other words, the fix in Platform/Team will make this particular change obsolete.

I'm working on that fix right now...

> file CQ

I wanted to do that, but apparently I'm only allowed to start a CQ for these projects: eclipse.e4, eclipse.orion, eclipse.platform.releng, eclipse.platform.team.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The fix makes the plug-ins appear in the list but I am not able to import it: when I choose to import 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui' and click 'Next' I get the complete list of non-Git bundles instead of 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui'.

/org.eclipse.egit.scm.ui/.classpath is broken. It looks like  someone manually entered "JavaSE-1.5" which is not a valid   EE. It must be "J2SE-1.5".

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/plugin.xml -> I've removed the hack in the latest patch set. In order to work bug 372020 needs to be fixed first. It's already marked as blocker.
