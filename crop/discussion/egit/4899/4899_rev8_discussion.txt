DESCRIPTION

Add support for Eclipse-SourceReferences header

Add extensions required to import a plug-in using SCM URL from its
MANIFEST.MF. To give it a try, open Plug-ins view, select a plug-in,
right click and Import As > Project from a Repository.... Then follow
instructions in the wizard. Importing with a tag is not supported yet,
see bug 367712.

This allows EGit compilation against all supported eclipse platform
versions but only builds the p2 repository when built against
Juno.

Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- rebased
- added import feature to p2 repository
- compile import plugin and feature only when built against juno
- current limitation: can't build p2 repository for platforms older than juno

- open: error raised by workbench on import's plugin.xml needs to be fixed

I tried again with 3.8 I20120320-1400 and 4.2 I20120321-0610 (Mac OS X 64bit) and still hit the same problems. Don't know what is wrong here. If you are visiting EclipseCon we could meet and have a look at my workspace.

I tried importing org.eclipse.swt and mac platform fragment both with 3.8 and 4.2 but this doesn't fix the problem

Patch Set 8:

Validating plugins in a new run configuration for an Eclipse application reveals the following problem messages:

 org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.cocoa.macosx.x86_64
     Platform filter did not match: (& (osgi.ws=cocoa)(osgi.os=macosx)(osgi.arch=x86_64))
 org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64
     Platform filter did not match: (& (osgi.ws=cocoa)(osgi.os=macosx)(osgi.arch=x86_64))
 org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64.source
     Platform filter did not match: (& (osgi.ws=cocoa)(osgi.os=macosx)(osgi.arch=x86_64))

Any clue what this means ? I am quite sure that I am running on cocoa macosx x86_64

Patch Set 8:

This looks like either your JRE and the installed Eclipse version don't match (not same bit size) or you start Eclipse with some explicit options that cause the mismatch (osgi.ws, osgi.os or osgi.arch system property; -ws, -os or -arch command line argument).

Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I found the reason for my problem, my target platform had the wrong 32 bit architecture configured, no idea how this happened.

I'd like to have an explicit target platform definition to enable working on this also using older Eclipse versions. I'll create that in another change. Will ask Chris to PMC supervise this change so that we can avoid a CQ as Remy is a committer.
