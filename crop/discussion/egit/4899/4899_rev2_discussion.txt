- org.eclipse.egit.scm.ui/pom.xml missing
- integration with maven build missing
- I will upload fixes for these issues in a few minutes
- we'll need a CQ for this change
- can we find a less prominent name than org.eclipse.egit.scm* as everything in egit is about scm so I think this name is misleading

Line:19, org.eclipse.egit.scm-feature/pom.xml -> update to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Line:5, org.eclipse.egit.scm.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> update to 2.0.0.qualifier

Line:17, org.eclipse.egit.scm.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> update versions to 2.0.0

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> update to 2.0.0

Line:3, org.eclipse.egit.scm.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> here you target Java 6 in Manifest Java 5, this is inconsistent

Line:5, org.eclipse.egit.scm-feature/feature.xml -> update to 2.0.0.qualifier

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/plugin.xml -> Nice catch! After having a closer look at Platform/Team code it turned out to be a bug in org.eclipse.team.ui.TeamUI.getPages(...), see bug 372020. A file system is not required by the import operation whatsoever, the scheme is only used to check if the SCM URL can be processed by the given provider.
