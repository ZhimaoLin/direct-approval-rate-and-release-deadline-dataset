DESCRIPTION

Add support for Eclipse-SourceReferences header

Add extensions required to import a plug-in using SCM URL from its
MANIFEST.MF. To give it a try, open Plug-ins view, select a plug-in,
right click and Import As > Project from a Repository.... Then follow
instructions in the wizard. Importing with a tag is not supported yet,
see bug 367712.

This allows EGit compilation against all supported eclipse platform
versions but only builds the p2 repository when built against Juno.
This should be improved in a subsequent change.

Patch Set 16: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

The change looks good! I verified that the fix works against the latest 3.8 RC2 build (I20120521-2100) and the latest 4.2 RC2 build (I20120521-1900). I also verified that for targets < 3.8 the feature is disabled and EGit works as expected.

Given we are at RC2 already, and the test issues are not strictly related to this bug, I suggest we make an exception and merge this change, so that a wider audience can also test it. In the meantime we can continue to work on the test infrastructure.
