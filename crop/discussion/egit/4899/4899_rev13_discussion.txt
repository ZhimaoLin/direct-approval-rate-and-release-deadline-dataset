DESCRIPTION

Add support for Eclipse-SourceReferences header

Add extensions required to import a plug-in using SCM URL from its
MANIFEST.MF. To give it a try, open Plug-ins view, select a plug-in,
right click and Import As > Project from a Repository.... Then follow
instructions in the wizard. Importing with a tag is not supported yet,
see bug 367712.

This allows EGit compilation against all supported eclipse platform
versions but only builds the p2 repository when built against Juno. 
This should be improved in a subsequent change.

Looks good to me, but we have to wait for the blocking change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5543/3

Patch Set 13: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

A rough test from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5644/ checks if the import wizard look and behave properly e.g. if the import page is in place. The test still requires more love, but even in its current shape verifies the latest patch set from here works as expected.

I am still fighting with the failing test in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5406/ which blocks https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5543/ which blocks this one :-(
