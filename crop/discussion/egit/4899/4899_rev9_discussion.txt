DESCRIPTION

Add support for Eclipse-SourceReferences header

Add extensions required to import a plug-in using SCM URL from its
MANIFEST.MF. To give it a try, open Plug-ins view, select a plug-in,
right click and Import As > Project from a Repository.... Then follow
instructions in the wizard. Importing with a tag is not supported yet,
see bug 367712.

This allows EGit compilation against all supported eclipse platform
versions but only builds the p2 repository when built against
Juno.
