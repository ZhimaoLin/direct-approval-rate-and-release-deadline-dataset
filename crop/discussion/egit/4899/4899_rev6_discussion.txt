Patch Set 6:

* make modules optional so that maven build only builds these modules when run against Juno

I guess this is why the latest build failed. How do I do that? Where do I start?

* file CQ

Matthias, could you please open the CQ for me? I cannot do it for EGit.

* could you come up with a test (can come in a separate change)

Will do, but no sooner than next week, sorry.

Patch Set 6:

I will look into making the build of this module optional and file the CQ soon

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I tested this with the fix for bug 372020 and also with an additional fix that I had to make in PDE (bug 372726). Overall it looks good, but when one imports an already existing project the patch causes havoc: it deletes the project on the file system (i.e. from the repository).

Note that this will be more tricky than just replacing the deletion with removing the link in the Git importer, since once cannot assume that the existing project was imported by/from the same importer/repository.

Patch Set 6:

I investigated the deletion problem and we're lucky because the deletion is done in the generic import operation in PDE. I committed a fix that solve the issue (see bug 372796 for details).

Tomek, there is one minor issue in the 'GitScmUrlImportWizardPage': 'descriptions' can be 'null' hence on line 178 it should read:
if (head && descriptions != null)
