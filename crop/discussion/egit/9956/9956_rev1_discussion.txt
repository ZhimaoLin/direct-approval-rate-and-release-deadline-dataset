Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitTreeTraversal.java -> do you have any practical reason for replacing array with array list?

theoretically simple array should consume less memory and be faster then creating ArrayList object, adding objects and converting it back to array.

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitTreeTraversal.java -> Yes. Because of the `if (resource != null)` below, the old code with the array could contain null values, which could cause problems later.
