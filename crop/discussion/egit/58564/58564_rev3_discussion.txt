And some javadoc fixes. Looks like https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/7748/ hangs.

long footer lines seem to be still be soft wrapped, this feels odd. After commit long footers look ok (one line per footer)

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> this seems not to match the definition given in
RevCommit.getFooterLines() which says that a footer line's key must match

Well, the viewer is created with soft-wrapping (SWT.WRAP) and thus any line longer than the whole viewer gets soft-wrapped. I'm not aware of any way to make a SWT.WRAP viewer wrap only parts of its text. The best I can do is make sure that our hard-wrap and our own soft-wrap via the segment listener don't wrap those lines. And I don't like the alternative of dropping SWT.WRAP entirely for the SpellcheckableMessageArea.

What do you suggest?

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> Wasn't aware of that function. Will change the key pattern to that one.
