DESCRIPTION

Don't reveal selection on refresh

The selection must not be revealed when the viewer gets refreshed. This
is distracting in the UI and also not necessary, because refresh(...)
and setInput(...) already have code to preserve the selection.

See inline comment, otherwise looks good (and verified).

Line:12, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Is this a policy thing? Because if everybody did that, the whole git log of this file would be here (76 lines). Just asking, maybe there is a situation where this information is useful outside of log/blame.

The copyright notice in EGit source is a mess. You can find many different formats. Some list the contributions, some don't. I normally simply continue the style that's already  in the file(s) I touch.

Ok, fair enough. I'm also not sure what to put where sometimes. Maybe that should be brought up on the mailing list and bulk-cleaned up.
