DESCRIPTION

Fix build broken on Galileo

Commit 199adc61d412c5eb13088b741a673de5debd2335 broke the EGit build
since it uses org.eclipse.team.core.ScmUrlImportDescription
and org.eclipse.team.core.ProjectSetCapability.SCHEME_SCM
which are only available in team framework starting with 3.6. Copy them
to fix the build until we drop support for Galileo.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The change looks good to me. Sorry for missing the dependency nuance. I filed bug 365397 against API Tools to prevent this kind of situations in the future. Do you have a bug for dropping support for 3.4? I'm feeling obliged to update the code once you bump the dependency to 3.6.
