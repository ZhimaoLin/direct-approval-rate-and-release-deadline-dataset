Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> don't repeat the bug number which is already available in the commit message

Line:364, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I think it would make sense to also enable this for additional refs like FETCH_HEAD (their context menu provides checkout command as well)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> looks like there are two blanks between "always" and "done"

Let me know what you think and I'll then submit a new version of my patch.

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Often people only have the source and then it is good if they can just open the bug from it. I don't see any value in suppresing that information.

Do you still want me to remove the bug number?

Line:364, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I agree with you but it is not related to the reported bug and in the EGit contributor guide it says to keep patches small and split work in smaller pieces.

I have no problem adding it in my next patch though, if you want.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Indeed ;-)

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> yes, please remove it. You are the first contributor who wants that. If somebody wants to see which bugs have been fixed for a certain source he anyway needs to look at the history to find out what was changed to fix the bug. Also it's already a challenge to get this consistently maintained in the project's history, replicating this into the sources manually would most probably lead to inconsistent information. If you really want this we should generate a cross reference from the git history during the build which could be included into the source bundles. But I am not sure if this is worth the effort.

Line:364, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> you are right, this should be done in a separate patch. It just came across my mind when testing your change :-)
