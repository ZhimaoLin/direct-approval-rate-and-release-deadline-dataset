Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- the label "Current HEAD" isn't left-aligned with the label "Resetting to" but "Resetting to" seems to be left-aligned with "Reset type"
- when the branch names have different length the newly displayed information looks cluttered, maybe better use a table layout for better alignment
