I still face the issue with the conflicting folders. I misused bug 318473 to upload two screenshots.

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantComparator.java -> But AnyObjectId overwrites equals and this should work. 

Anyhow, this change does not solve the error I face: I still see for some projects conflicting folders, with their path relative to the git repository and not relative to the workspace.

Stefan, could you somehow share with me this project? Currently I'm testing this on current egit clone, and comparing main with v0.8.4 I didn't get any conflicts.

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantComparator.java -> Yes I know that it overwrites ... but for some reasons it return false
