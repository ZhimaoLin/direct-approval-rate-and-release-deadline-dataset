Patch Set 2:

Carlie Harper:
"I get suddenly a lot of conflicting changes"

This is because two different instances of same ObjectId (both have same SHA1) are different according to equals method. I'll implement this comparison on "string level", comparing SHA1 strings of both objects.

Patch Set 2:

Carlie Harper: "The remote file content of the diff view started from the workspace model contains stuff like "40000 projb" and some unreadable characters"

Could you be more specific? When I launch compare editor everything seams to be OK.
