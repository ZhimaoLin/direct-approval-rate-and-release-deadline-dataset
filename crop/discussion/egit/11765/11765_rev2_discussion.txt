DESCRIPTION

Ambiguous parameter naming

What GitFileRevision really expects is a path, not a file name. Most
usages of the constructors already passed in a file path... but the
parameter naming led to a number of clients to use a file name, which
creates FileRevisions with no resolvable path. This fixes all
ambiguous parameter names and usages.

Line:27, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/storage/WorkspaceFileRevision.java -> This is wrong. getFullPath returns the workspace path (e.g. /org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml). It should use getLocation(), which returns the file system path.

Line:27, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/storage/WorkspaceFileRevision.java -> Well, for a "Workspace"FileRevision, I really thought that a client would expect a path relative to the workspace. But indeed, it would probably be more coherent with a file system path (other users of the GitFileRevision constructor use a git path, relative to the repository).

Done
