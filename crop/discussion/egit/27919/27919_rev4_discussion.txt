DESCRIPTION

Add support for cherry-picking multiple commits at once.

This modifies the Cherry Pick menu item in the History view such that
multiple selected commits may be cherry-picked at once, instead of
one-by-one.

Cherry-picking now uses the mechanics of interactive rebase. If a
conflict occurs during merging one of the commits, it needs to be
resolved manually, and then the interactive rebase may be resumed
(just like with a regular interactive rebase.)

Cherry-picking a single commit uses the same mechanics just mentioned.

Hm, I missed this one. The user experience when there is a conflict is now pretty bad, there is no message at all as to what happened and what the user has to do.

I filed this bug, would be nice if you could look into it Maik: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=443016
