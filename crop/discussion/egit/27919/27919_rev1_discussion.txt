DESCRIPTION

Add support for cherry-picking multiple commits at once.

This modifies the Cherry Pick menu item in the History view such that
multiple selected commits may be cherry-picked at once, instead of
one-by-one.

If a conflict occurs during merging one of the commits, the whole
process will stop with an error message. The conflict then needs to be
resolved and committed. (This has not changed from the previous
behaviour.) After that, cherry-picking may be resumed manually with the
leftover commits.

Just to note, I'm working on a similar change for reverting commits.

Hi Maik, what do you think about using the interactive rebase machinery for cherry-picking multiple commits? It has a nice UI presenting the currently cherry-picked/rebased commit and also allows to continue after conflicts in a user-friendly way.
One may even optionally stop after initializing the 'cherry-rebase', so the user can reorder the commits to pick or perform further action an the picked commits.

Hmm, sounds good to me. I'll try to go that route and see how it goes, but it may take some time because I can't work on this every day.

yes, Konrad is right, this should be built based on rebase machinery
