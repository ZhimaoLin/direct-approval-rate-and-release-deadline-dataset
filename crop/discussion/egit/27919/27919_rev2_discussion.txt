DESCRIPTION

Add support for cherry-picking multiple commits at once.

This modifies the Cherry Pick menu item in the History view such that
multiple selected commits may be cherry-picked at once, instead of
one-by-one.

Cherry-picking now uses the mechanics of interactive rebase. If a
conflict occurs during merging one of the commits, it needs to be
resolved manually, and then the interactive rebase may be resumed
(just like with a regular interactive rebase.)

Cherry-picking a single commit uses the same mechanics just mentioned.

Okay, I've reworked the mechanics to use interactive rebase now. You may safely ignore patch set #1. Please also note the modified commit message.

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CherryPickOperation.java -> should I be fiddling with that? I'd rather prefer not to touch it unless it is necessary

Line:78, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CherryPickOperation.java -> whoops, silly me
