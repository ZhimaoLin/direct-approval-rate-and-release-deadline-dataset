DESCRIPTION

Push Tags wizard

Can be started with one or more selected tags from the repositories
view. It's also available from the team menu and the context menu of a
repository.

In the "Create Tag" dialog, there is an additional button which can be
used to create the tag and then start the push wizard for it.
