DESCRIPTION

Push Tags wizard

Can be started with one or more selected tags from the repositories
view. It's also available from the team menu and the context menu of a
repository.

In the "Create Tag" dialog, there is an additional button which can be
used to create the tag and then start the push wizard for it.

nice improvement

some issues I found:
- checking "Show final report dialog only when it differs from this confirmation report" seems to have no effect, when trying to push the same tag a second time to the same remote I still get the confirmation dialog
- I don't understand what's the purpose of the dialog opened by "Configure..." on the result page. It allows to configure push for the current branch, why do I need to reach this from the result dialog of "Push Tags..." ?
- this configure dialog doesn't show all possible known URLs of all remotes I have defined, I tried with a repository having 2 remotes for 2 different remote repositories, one using https and the other one file protocol. But the configure dialog always only shows the file URL.

Line:122, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/TagActionHandler.java -> style nit: no braces around single line block

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushTagsWizard.java -> I think we should have a force checkbox, since otherwise the following scenario would move a tag in the remote repository and the user wouldn't know about that:

- Joe creates a new tag and pushes it to the remote
- he moves this tag locally
- then later, after having forgot about moving this tag he pushes the same tag again, and voila the tag in the remote is moved forcefully, but Joe didn't say he wants to use force flag

I think we should make this explicit

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushTagsPage.java -> style nit: no braces here

Line:151, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushTagsPage.java -> style nit: no braces here

Fixed, thanks! Turns out this was also broken for the "Push Branch" wizard, see change https://git.eclipse.org/r/18779. Also see https://git.eclipse.org/r/18780 for (hopefully) better labels.

Good catch! I didn't see a "Configure..." because with my test repositories were already configured. But "Configure..." should not be shown when pushing tags. Fixed with newest patch set, see changes PushOperationUI.

Line:122, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/TagActionHandler.java -> Done

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushTagsWizard.java -> Joe will see that the tag is moved on the confirmation page because it doesn't say "foo [new tag]" but instead "foo [1234567...89abcde]".

Do you think that is not explicit enough? Where should the checkbox be, below the tag selection table, something like this (off by default)?:

[ ] Force overwrite of tags in case they already exist
