DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Honor label decoration preferences

Reuse DecorationHelper in StagingViewLabelProvider, which ensures that
the preferences are applied.

This way, for users who don't want a text decoration or a different one,
the Staging view now behaves as expected.

Also, the "staged change" icon was not the same as in the resource
decorations.
