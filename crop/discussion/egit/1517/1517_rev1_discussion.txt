DESCRIPTION

Cleanup of SourceBranchPage

By using the CheckboxTableViewer, we can get rid of much boilerplate
code that was introduced for the checked-state handling. In addition,
content and labels are cleanly separated by the providers. Added
icon to help the user identifying the content of the list.
