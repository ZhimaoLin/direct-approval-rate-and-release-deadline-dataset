DESCRIPTION

Add content proposal to Git Wizards URI field

Add a content proposal to the URI field so that
the end user can see a list of previously used
URIs in the Git wizards (GitCloneWizard, PushWizard)
for easy re-use of these URIs.
The URIs are only added if an import or push was 
completed successfully.
