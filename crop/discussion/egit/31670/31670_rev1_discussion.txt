DESCRIPTION

Fix error due to overlapping StyleRanges in CommitMessageViewer

This was caused by using setStyleRanges in
I2cf1e67e23f8d32a5a88b45ea5839f51b90c853a. With the individual
setStyleRange method, overlapping was handled by StyledText.

By using setStyleRanges for the format job results first (which are
ordered and non-overlapping), we still get the better performance of
setting these in bulk. The hyperlink style ranges are then applied on
top to handle overlapping, but they should be much fewer in numbers.
