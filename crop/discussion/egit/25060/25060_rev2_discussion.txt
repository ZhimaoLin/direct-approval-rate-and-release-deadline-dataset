Patch Set 2:

My change does not fix the repository cache issue pointed out by Robin. It removes the isValidPath check, as that one can only be used for workspace paths, not for file system paths (i.e. on Windows I see "C:/path is not a valid path" due to that for the input "C:\path").

Additionally I've done minor UX changes (show warning for non empty directory, put cursor at end of input, always trim input).

Side note: I'm not sure how I should set all the fields and entries in the commit message when modifying an existing change of yours. So any advice on that is also appreciated.
