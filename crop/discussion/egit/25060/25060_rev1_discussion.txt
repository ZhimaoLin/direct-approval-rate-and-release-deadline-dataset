Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I don't yet understand why the test SharingWizardTest.shareProjectWithExternalRepo() is failing.

Somehow these changes prevent that the newly created repository is shown and selected in the repository combo box of ExistingOrNewPage. I have no clue why.

Line:64, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/NewRepositoryWizard.java -> On the right, you no longer add the repo to the cache. Because of that, it's no longer equal to any of the repository objects as returned from RepoComboContentProvider#getElements.

This is the reason for the test failure.

IMO having the repositories as elements directly is kind of dangerous (as this problem shows), maybe we should change it so that it uses the File objects instead?
