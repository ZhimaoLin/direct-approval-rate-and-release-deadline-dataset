DESCRIPTION

Preliminary support for ChangeSet's in Sync View

Adds proper representation of git changes that occurs between two ref's.
Changes are displayed as Team ChangeSet instance. All commits are listed
as a child's of node that represent repository. Every commit node
contains tree-list of all changed, added or deleted resources.

Double click action on leaf node will open properly initialized CompareEditor
(it will only contains changes between current selected and previous
commit). Merging changes inside CompareEditor is disallowed.

Currently we don't support displaying change direction
(incoming/outgoing/conflicting) in SyncView tree. This will be
implemented in feature
