DESCRIPTION

Preliminary support for ChangeSet's in Sync View

Adds proper representation of git changes that occurs between two ref's.
Changes are displayed as Team ChangeSet instance. All commits are listed
as a child's of node that represent repository. Every commit node
contains tree-list of all changed, added or deleted resources.

Double click action on leaf node will open properly initialized CompareEditor
(it will only contains changes between current selected and previous
commit). Merging changes inside CompareEditor is disallowed.

Currently we don't support displaying change direction
(incoming/outgoing/conflicting) in SyncView tree. This will be
implemented in feature

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

- I do not see all commits which I expect to see, see inline comment to GitModelRepository.

- Now all folders are marked as conflicting in (Java) workspace model.

- The Context menu from synchronize view is gone

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/model/GitModelRepository.java -> This does not do the right thing. There are outgoing and incoming commits which were created before both srcRev and dstRev.

What you want is to get all commits between the common base and srcRev and all commits between common base and dstRev, right?

You have already determined the base commit in GitBaseResourceVariantTree, so why not have two RevWalks, one from base to srcRev  and one from base to dstRev?

Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

Handling context menu when we have both ChangeSet and workspace or java model displayed is much more complicated, therefore I decided that this will be included in another patch

I'll inspect why we have so much conflicting changes in synchronize now.

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/model/GitModelRepository.java -> You have right here, I'll reimplement this
