DESCRIPTION

Add ability to edit a commit directly from the history view.

This adds a new menu item Modify > Edit to the context menu of the
history view. It can be used to edit a commit, then manually amending
the commit afterwards.

An error will be displayed if the selected commit cannot be reached
from the current HEAD commit. This is done so as to avoid the need
to checkout another commit automatically before executing the edit
procedure.

Whoops, embarrassing bug there. Good catch.

It works fine for me now; the IllegalArgumentExceptions are gone. But the message in the staging view is still the wrong one initially. When clicking the Amend button there twice, it gets corrected.

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/EditHandler.java -> we need to open the views in a UIJob using the same scheduling rule as used by the command EditHandler to prevent that this happens concurrently

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/command/EditHandler.java -> this can be shortened using JobUtil
