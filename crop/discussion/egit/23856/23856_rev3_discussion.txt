DESCRIPTION

Add ability to edit a commit directly from the history view.

This adds a new menu item Modify > Edit to the context menu of the
history view. It can be used to edit a commit, then manually amending
the commit afterwards.

An error will be displayed if the selected commit cannot be reached
from the current HEAD commit. This is done so as to avoid the need
to checkout another commit automatically before executing the edit
procedure.

Patch Set 3:

I had to rebase the change to the current master, hence the many changes in patchset 3. I've changed only the two EditHandlers from patchset 2. All the other changes can be ignored due to the rebase.

Patch Set 3:

If need by, I can try and rebase the changes to the parent of patchset 2, then commit here, so that the new patchset can be compared to patchset 2 more easily. After that, I would rebase in a separate patchset.

Please advise if I should do so.
