DESCRIPTION

Add ability to edit a commit directly from the history view.

This adds a new menu item Modify > Edit to the context menu of the
history view. It can be used to edit a commit, then manually amending
the commit afterwards.

An error will be displayed if the selected commit cannot be reached
from the current HEAD commit. This is done so as to avoid the need
to checkout another commit automatically before executing the edit
procedure.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

- I think the interactive rebase view should be opened / made visible by this action
- looks like the interactive rebase view needs to be refreshed if it was already open, I saw wrong content in that view several times and refreshing fixed this
- the amend button of the staging view should be checked automatically in the same way we do this for full-blown interactive rebase

Line:44, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/EditCommitOperation.java -> style nit: trailing whitespace

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/EditCommitOperation.java -> no braces around single line block

Patch Set 2:

I've added code locally to open the rebase view and set amending in the staging view. I *think* the code is correct, but I'm running into all sorts of problems here:

- When aborting the rebase, I get multiple IllegalStateExceptions.
- Setting the staging view to amending works, but it shows the wrong commit message. Clicking the "amend" button off and on again shows the correct message.

I'm not sure how to proceed here. Would it be okay to commit the changes into Gerrit so that you can have a look?
