the normalisation of branch name on rename is different compared to creating new branch:
* create branch -> type a name containing a blank -> normaliser does auto-normalise
* rename branch -> type branch containing a blank -> instead of auto-normalisation an error message is shown

-> this inconsistent behaviour should be fixed

Line:22, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/branch/BranchNormalizerModifyListener.java -> we don't use author tags, authors are already tracked in git history

I don't see that. This is what I fixed. I think you did not include the change.
