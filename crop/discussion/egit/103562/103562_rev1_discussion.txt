DESCRIPTION

Trim history search input

It is very easy to copy an SHA1 including some whitespace into the
search field, as I accidentally did today. Therefore trimming seems
useful here.

We could restrict the trimming to SHA1 search (instead of all types of
searches) if committers feel that it is an important use case to be able
to search for terms starting/ending with whitespace.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

It's not that simple. If we trim() here, we have to trim() elsewhere, too, and we should not start new search jobs if the trimmed pattern is the same as the one used in the last search.

I'll push an update shortly.
