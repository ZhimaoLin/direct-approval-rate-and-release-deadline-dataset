DESCRIPTION

Trim history search pattern

It is very easy to copy an SHA1 including some whitespace into the
search field, as I accidentally did today. Therefore trimming seems
useful here.

Add logic to prevent starting multiple search jobs for the same
trimmed pattern. This could happen easily now when the user is
typing in a search pattern containing blanks (such as "history
search": we'd get two identical jobs for raw inputs "history"
and "history ").

> Looks okay to me. I cannot judge the font related change part.

The font thing was another commit https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/103672/; just shows up when you compare PS 1 with PS 2 because of the rebase I did on PS 2. Comparison against base shows the real differences in this change.
