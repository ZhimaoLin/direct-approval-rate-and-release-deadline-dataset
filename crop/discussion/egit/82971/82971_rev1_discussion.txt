DESCRIPTION

Test stability: get node anew after having refreshed the view

GitRepositoriesViewBranchHandlingTest occasionally failed to select the
correct node, and then could not find the "Delete Branch" menu item. Try
to fix that by getting the local branches node afresh after the view has
been refreshed.
