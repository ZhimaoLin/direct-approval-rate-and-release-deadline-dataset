DESCRIPTION

Compare using model provider if possible

The previous implementation of 'asCompareInput' hijacked any comparison
using model providers through the synchronize view. Even when
double-clicking on files that are part of a model, only the "git" model
would have been allowed to provide comparison input. This commit
modifies to implementation to prefer the model input if available.

Patch Set 1:

I'm investigating the test case failures. It seems that the comparison now does not honor the "local changes should be included in comparison" settings. This causes the the left side of the compare editor (in the test case) to always contain the "Locel File Workspace" leading to the test failure
