DESCRIPTION

Fix ConfigureGerrit Task to respect http.sslVerify config parameter

The ConfigureGerritAfterCloneTask opens a HttpURLConnection to talk to
the REST API of a potential gerrit server. If this is a connection for
the https protocol and if the repository has http.sslVerfiy configured
to false then this task should respect this and accept connections from
servers which certificates can't be validated.
