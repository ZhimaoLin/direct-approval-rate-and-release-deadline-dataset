DESCRIPTION

Disallow quotes in Ref names.

Quotes (") can be used in the command line to "continue" commands
across line breaks and such, but it is not possible to create a branch
containing a quote in it's name.
Trying to do this with the EGit UI results in a RuntimeException 
anyway, but the user should be notified about this immediately.
This was found while working on bug 318249, but it doesn't directly
fix this bug.

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/ValidationUtils.java -> I wonder if we should push this to Repository.isValidRefName as JGit would suffer from the same problem when using it pragmatically.
