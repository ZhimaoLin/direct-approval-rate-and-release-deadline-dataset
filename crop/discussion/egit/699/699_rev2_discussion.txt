DESCRIPTION

Precheck selected files in the commit dialog

The commit dialog presents all local modifications of files but
does not respect the user's selection. The dialog should precheck
any files that the user has selected and any files that are in any
folders that the user has selected.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

One thing we might think about is the handling of untracked files. When I select the checkbox "Show untracked files" the untracked entries belonging to the user selection are not checked. But I suspect that that can get complicated...

Patch Set 2:

I think if an untracked file is selected, then that option should be checked and then it can just be preselected like any other file. Unchecking and checking it back on won't select it again but I think the behaviour of ticking the checkbox if something is untracked seems like something the user would want.
