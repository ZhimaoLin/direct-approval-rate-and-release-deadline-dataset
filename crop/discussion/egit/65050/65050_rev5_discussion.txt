DESCRIPTION

Make the gitflow UI tests independent of the keyboard layout

Use setText() instead of typeText(); otherwise these tests fail unless
the keyboard layout happens to be en-us (or mac-en-us).

Patch Set 5:

I've decided to take this apart; was mixing two different things in one commit.

This now has only the keyboard layout stuff, the screenshot improvement is in https://git.eclipse.org/r/65209 . (And, since the screenshot-capture change already is in SWTBot's nightly build (thanks, Mickael!), is done by using a snapshot build of SWTBot.)
