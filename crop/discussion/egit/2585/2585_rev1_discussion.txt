DESCRIPTION

Extension point to hook into commit process

Functional Requirements:
- add / remove files to commit (after user had made his decision)
- ability to cancel commit although user pressed [Commit] button
- finally be noticed if commit was successfully performed

To implement these requirements an extension point has been added,
named CommitObserver. CommitObserver need to implement an interface in
order to be able to take influence a commit. Several CommitObserver
can interact.

Patch Set 1:

Just take the commit you made, amend it and edit the commit message (and the files, if you want). Then commit and push again (make sure, that the Change-Id in the commit message is the same like the one from this change, that should automatically happen if you amend the right commit). Then changed commit should be added as Patchset 2.
