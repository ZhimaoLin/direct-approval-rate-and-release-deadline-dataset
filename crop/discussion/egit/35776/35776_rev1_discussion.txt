DESCRIPTION

Fix Team context menu entries not showing in certain editors

Apparently WTP does things differently than other editors. The default
selection object is not meaningful there, so extend the enablement
expression to check activeEditorInput as well.

Also, when executing the command, the selection object is both an
ITextSelection and an empty IStructuredSelection. By checking for
ITextSelection first, we get a result instead of an empty selection.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

I was able to successfully test this patch by cherry-picking it on top of 3.5.0, which is used by my test environment. 

BTW, for SSE-based editor the 'Show Annotations' action is available in the Team submenu of the ruler's context menu instead of having it directly in the ruler's context menu. Is it supposed to be like this?
