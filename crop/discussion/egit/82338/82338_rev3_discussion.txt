DESCRIPTION

Clean up "Show Blame" handling

* Replace deprecated ObjectContribution extension by Command/Handler
  combo and remove the default handler for the
  org.eclipse.egit.ui.team.ShowBlame command.
* Remove now unused legacy ShowBlameAction and the (wrong) command id
  in ActionCommands.

This does not yet remove the default handler for the history view's
org.eclipse.egit.ui.history.ShowBlame command. Apparently there were
once problems with creating this context menu declaratively (see bug
322751 and commit 44dfabcd); apparently having to do with the
availability of the selection. As a consequence this menu is built
programmatically but relying on some declarations (including default
handlers) in plugin.xml. These default handlers can still be invoked
outside of their intended context, but cannot be removed easily. The
approach taken for now for this ShowBlameHandler is thus to at least
prevent exceptions when it is invoked when it shouldn't be:

* Prevent NPE in the ShowBlameHandler (history view).

Patch Set 3:

Changes from PS2:

* Cosmetics in the handler activation expression. Children of an <adapt> expression are and-ed anyway.
* The <activeEditorInput> expression needs to be guarded by a check that the active part indeed is an editor. <activeEditorInput> is also available when the active part is _not_ an editor...
* Fix the visibility; the command was missing in the context menu of a text editor.

I noticed a couple more problems with this command, but they are unrelated to this change (also exist without this change). See bug 505938, bug 505939, bug 505940.

These git repository view tests are getting on my nerves. Looks like fixing the preference change listener was not good enough yet to make them stable. I don't see where these view refreshes that interfere with the SWTBot tests do come from.
