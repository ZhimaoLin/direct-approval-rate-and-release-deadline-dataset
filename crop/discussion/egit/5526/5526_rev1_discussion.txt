DESCRIPTION

Provide extensibility for suggesting branch names

* Extends the existing extension point for commit messages
  with branch name suggestions.
* Adds a config option for specifying the default source ref
  when branching:

  [workflow]
        defbranchstartpoint = refs/remotes/origin/master

This change is needed to enable the automatic creation and
checkout of branches based on the active task.
