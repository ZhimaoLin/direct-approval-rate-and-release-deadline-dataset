DESCRIPTION

Provide extensibility for suggesting branch names

* Extends the existing extension point for commit messages
  with branch name suggestions.
* Adds a config option for specifying the default source ref
  when branching:

  [workflow]
        defbranchstartpoint = refs/remotes/origin/master

This change is needed to enable the automatic creation and
checkout of branches based on the active task.

Line:5, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/IBranchNameProvider.java -> Is this really the copyright of Thorsten and Manuel or a consequence of copying the license header from somewhere else ?

style nit: remove unnecessary second blank line

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> as this is based on work from Manuel you may consider to give credit to him by adding the additional footer

Line:5, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/IBranchNameProvider.java -> Done

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for pointing that out. Manuel wrote almost all of the code so I have changed the author and updated the commit message accordingly.
