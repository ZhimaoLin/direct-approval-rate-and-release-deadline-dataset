The blob id is not a good content identifier because it is not displayed
elsewhere in the UI. The commit id is much better suited.

Line:65, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariant.java -> Can't we here just abbreviate commit ID eg:
revCommit.abbreviate(7).name() + "..."
?
