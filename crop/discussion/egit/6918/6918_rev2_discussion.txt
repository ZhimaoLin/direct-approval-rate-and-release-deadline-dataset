Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The code would have worked before in principle if the nodes had been from different repositories. Now you assume that they are from the same repo:

AddToIndexCommand.java l. 38
IPath workTreePath = new Path(repository.getWorkTree().getAbsolutePath());

On the other hand, by calling enableWorkingDirCommand(evaluationContext)it is ensured that the command is only enabled if "All selected nodes belong to the same repository".

Therefore I think it's ok.

Patch Set 2:

You're right. Hm, we could extract the inner part of getSelectedFileAndFolderPaths as getPath(Object node), and keep the code in AddToIndexCommand the same by looping over selectedNodes and using the repository from there.
