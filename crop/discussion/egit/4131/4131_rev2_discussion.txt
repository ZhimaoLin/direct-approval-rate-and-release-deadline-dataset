DESCRIPTION

Support selection of commit SHA-1 in blame annotation.

Switched from using a Hyperlink widget to a StyledText widget
with a style range that mirrors the appearance of a hyperlink.

The SHA-1 can now be selected and copied to the clipboard but
still open in a commit viewer when clicked.
