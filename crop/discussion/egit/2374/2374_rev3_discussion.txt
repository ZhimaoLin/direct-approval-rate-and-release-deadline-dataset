DESCRIPTION

[sync] Fix StackOverflowError and cache/working tree model

After change I137e703f Cache tree and Working tree model does not have
any containers because cached structure of tree cannot be build properly
based on IPath keys. Therefore I decided to revert part of this change
in case of working tree and cache tree models.

In previous implementation the StackOverflowError can occures when
repository contains a file without extension, now this should be also
fixed.
