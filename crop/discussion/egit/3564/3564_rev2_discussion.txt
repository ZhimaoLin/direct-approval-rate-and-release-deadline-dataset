Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

* rebased

I cloned 2 local repositories using file:// URI, committed a change in both and tried to push both changes in one go. Push failed with error "push rejected, funny refname", this was caused by wrongly built refspecs, which both looked like "HEAD:/master"
