DESCRIPTION

Push Branch: Preselect merge/rebase if branch already configured

In case the branch already has an upstream configuration, preselect the
correct configuration in the wizard. With that, it's not overwritten
with different values than before if the user is not careful.

Also, only show the "overwrite" warning when the chosen values differ
from the existing configuration.
