DESCRIPTION

Rebase Interoperability: do not auto-abort upon conflict

This depends on JGit change

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,1986

(which actually make the two rebase implementations interoperable).
Once interoperability is reached, EGit can stop and have the user
resolve the conflicts; they can then switch to the command line
to continue. Abort is also provided so that users can abort the
rebase in EGit (only if it is an interactive rebase).
