DESCRIPTION

Rebase Interoperability: do not auto-abort upon conflict

EGit now stops when a conflict is found during rebase and allows the
user to manipulate the content; they can then switch to the command
line to continue the rebase.
The rebase result dialog also offers the options to abort the current
rebase altogether or to open the merge tool to work out the conflicts.
