DESCRIPTION

Use ImageDescriptor.hashCode instead of System.identityHashCode

This ensures that images are properly reused from the
ResourceManager when a DecorationOverlayDescriptor is used
in conjunction with a ResourceManager.

Without this change a new image would be created for
composite image descriptors that contain the same base
description and overlays.
