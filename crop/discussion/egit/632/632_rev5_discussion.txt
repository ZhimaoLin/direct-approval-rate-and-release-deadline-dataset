DESCRIPTION

Remove usage of unpublished API's in org.eclipse.egit.core

This also flags further such use in this bundle as errors and
upgrades other compiler settings to Eclipse 3.5.2 defaults.

A testcase is introduced to cover error handling pattern, but
it is incomplete and only implemented for BlobStorage.

Bug: 310933 (partial fix)

Line:14, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> since org.eclipse.egit.core.test is a test fragment now we don't need to make it x-friend anymore, right ?
