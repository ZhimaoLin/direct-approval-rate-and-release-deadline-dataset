DESCRIPTION

Remove usage of unpublished API's in org.eclipse.egit.core

This also flags further such use in this bundle as errors and
upgrades other compiler settings to Eclipse 3.5.2 defaults.

A testcase is introduced to cover error handling pattern, but
it is incomplete and only implemented for BlobStorage.

Bug: 310933 (partial fix)
