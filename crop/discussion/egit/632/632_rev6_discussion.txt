DESCRIPTION

Remove usage of unpublished API's in org.eclipse.egit.core

This also flags further such use in this bundle as errors and
upgrades other compiler settings to Eclipse 3.5.2 defaults.

A testcase is introduced to cover error handling pattern, but
it is incomplete and only implemented for BlobStorage.

Bug: 310933 (partial fix)

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

That's fine.

In the future, we need to refactor things to be org.eclipse.egit.internal.*

instead of org.eclipse.egit.core.internal*... internal is in the wrong place ;)
