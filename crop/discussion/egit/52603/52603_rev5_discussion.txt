DESCRIPTION

Fix NPE in GitFlowRepository::isDevelop

NPE is thrown in isDevelop(), therefore the JGit repository must be
null.
That repository is only set in the constructor, and I found 
two paths in non-test code, that could lead to this.
To make sure this fixes the issue, I added null guards for both.

Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/ReleaseStartHandler.java -> GitFlowRepository() should mark its parameter xxx@xxx.xxx then null analysis can detect at compile time if null could be passed

Line:95, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/ReleaseStartHandler.java -> mark return value xxx@xxx.xxx then null analysis can detect such NPEs at compile time

Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/selection/SelectionPropertyTester.java -> this null check can be done before casting to Repository, also you should check if the passed object is of type Repository in order to prevent CCEs
