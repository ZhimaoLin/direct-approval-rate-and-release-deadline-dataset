DESCRIPTION

Do not consult Team.isIgnoredHint for enablement of Ignore Action

Currently Team->Ignore is disabled on derived resources (e.g. bin)
because Team.isIgnoredHint is consulted in the isEnabled method of the
action. Now the action is always enabled to allow the user adding
derived folders to .gitignore.
