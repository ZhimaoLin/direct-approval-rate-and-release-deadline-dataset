DESCRIPTION

Use FOLDER icon when displaying branches in hierarchical mode

The current REMOTE_SPEC icon looks odd when browsing local branches
checked out from Gerrit ie change/7130/1. The fix replaces the icon with
FOLDER.

Patch Set 2:

> "change" and "7130" could use the folder icon

Good point. The only thing left is ordering, I find it cumbersome that "change" is now at the bottom of the branches list. Shouldn't it be sorted just like any other branch?

In other words, switching to hierarchical mode changes the ordering so leaves always precede non-leaf nodes. This is not right imho.

yes, sorting shouldn't change when switching between hierarchical and flat branch display
