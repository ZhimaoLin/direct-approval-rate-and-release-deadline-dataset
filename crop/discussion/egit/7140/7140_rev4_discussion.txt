DESCRIPTION

Use FOLDER icon when displaying branches in hierarchical mode

The current REMOTE_SPEC icon looks odd when browsing local branches
checked out from Gerrit i.e. change/7130/1. The fix replaces the icon
with FOLDER. It also make sure sorting doesn't change when switching
between hierarchical and flat mode.
