DESCRIPTION

Use BRANCHES icon when displaying branches in hierarchical mode

The current REMOTE_SPEC icon looks odd when browsing local branches
checked out from Gerrit ie change/7130/1. The fix replaces the icon with
BRANCHES.

Patch Set 1:

Definitely better than current icon (I don't use hierarchical layout hence I didn't recognize this). But how about using a folder icon for non-leaf sections of hierarchical branch names ? In your example change/7130/1 in hierarchical layout "change" and "7130" could use the folder icon and only "1" the branch icon as only change/7130/1 is a branch (you can't have another branch one folder higher, e.g. change/7130 can't be a branch. This is caused by git's storage implementation for hierarchical refs which stores non-leaf sections of branch names as directories.
