DESCRIPTION

Fix Compare With > HEAD of file for initial commit

CompareWithHeadActionHandler now also uses the correctly behaving
getHeadTypedElement from CompareUtils for a single file.

The existing useful behavior of getting the commit that last modified
the file (instead of HEAD) is moved to the getHeadTypedElement method,
so all other users also benefit from that.

Also, release the used RevWalk.
