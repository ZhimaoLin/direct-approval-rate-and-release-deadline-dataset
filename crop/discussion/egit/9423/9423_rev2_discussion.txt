DESCRIPTION

Improve precision of detached head decoration

For decorations in EGit we want to display the name used for checking
out a tag. If a tag was checked out HEAD points to a commitId directly,
but the reflog contains the tag name used. Scan the reflog and use the
latest checkout whose refname resolves to the same commit as HEAD.

If not try, as before, to find any matching ref and use the one last
updated.
