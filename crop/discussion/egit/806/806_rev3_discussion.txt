DESCRIPTION

Remember to dispose the clipboard after use

Once the clipboard is acquired, we should dispose of it afterwards to
prevent memory and resource leaks.

Not all the text on the clipboard will be text; if it isn't, then we'll
get a null back. Handle that case specifically.

If the text begins (or ends) with whitespace, trim it before checking.
