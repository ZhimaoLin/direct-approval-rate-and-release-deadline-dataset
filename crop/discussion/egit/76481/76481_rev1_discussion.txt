DESCRIPTION

Suppress bare repositories in GitImportWizard

When a bare repository is selected in the GitSelectRepositoryPage, the
import wizard throws and reports multiple NoWorkTreeExceptions.

Since a bare repository has no working tree, one cannot import from a
bare repository. Therefore, suppress bare repositories in the
RepositorySearchDialog which is used to add repositories to the
GitSelectRepositoryPage when used from the GitImportWizard. The
user thus cannot select a bare repository.
