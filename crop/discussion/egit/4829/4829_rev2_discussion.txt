DESCRIPTION

[findBugs] Add setter for sharedDocumentListner

Part of LocalNonWorkspaceTypeLelemnt has copied logic from its base
class with uses haderDocumentListener flag internally. This flag is
set inside base class but derived class doesn't overwrites setter
therefore part of copied logic was never executed.
