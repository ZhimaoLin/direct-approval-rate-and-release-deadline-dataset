DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Perform clear on background thread when disposed

An NPE can occur if SWTCommitList.clear() is called
from dispose() while fillTo() is running from
GenerateHistoryJob.

dispose() is always called on the UI-thread so schedule
a background thread that synchronizes on the instance
and calls clear since all other state accessing calls to
the SWTCommitList instance are done inside synchronized
blocks.

Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

yes, 62f7bfff9 added this clear to fix a memory leak. It occurred when switching the input to another repository, which cancels a running GenerateHistoryJob, since disposeListeners weren't deregistered so that SWTCommitList didn't release the list of commits of the no longer interesting repository
