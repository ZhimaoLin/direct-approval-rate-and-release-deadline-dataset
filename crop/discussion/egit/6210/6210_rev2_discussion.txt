DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Perform clear on background thread when disposed

An NPE can occur if SWTCommitList.clear() is called
from dispose() while fillTo() is running from
GenerateHistoryJob.

dispose() is always called on the UI-thread so schedule
a background thread that synchronizes on the instance
and calls clear since all other state accessing calls to
the SWTCommitList instance are done inside synchronized
blocks.

Looks good to me, and couldn't reproduce the NPE with it.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

This probably fixes the problem. I couldn't reprodue this eiher, even without this patch. Threading problems. 

A wonder if the clear call is needed. It was added, allegedly to fix a memory leak, but i'm not sure the
clear call belongs in the dispose method. For lack of a better solution, this one should go into 2.0
