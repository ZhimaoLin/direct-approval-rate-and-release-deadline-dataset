DESCRIPTION

Simple Configure Push/Fetch: hide "Configure" button

The result dialogs shown when "Dry-running" fetch and push from the
"Configure Push to upstream" and "Configure Fetch from upstream"
dialogs, respectively, should not show the "Configure..." button, as
they have already been started from that dialog.
