DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Use jface.text framework for ref tooltips

By using AbstractHoverInformationControlManager instead of bare SWT, the
following bugs are fixed:

* Tooltips block clicks in history view
* Tooltip on history view remains open when switching applications

Also, it seems to behave more than one would expect with regards to how
fast it appears and how it stays visible.

And to top it off, it's less code.
