DESCRIPTION

Allow empty commit in the case of a merge commit

It sometimes happens that a resolved merge is the same as HEAD, in which
case no files are staged for commit.

Before this change, the user was stuck in this state as the staging view
and commit dialog both refused to do a commit without staged files.

With this change, an empty commit is now allowed when the repository
state is MERGING_RESOLVED.
