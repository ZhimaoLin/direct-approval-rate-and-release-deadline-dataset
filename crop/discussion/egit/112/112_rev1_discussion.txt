Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

In my opinion the "Compare with Revision" feature should open a dialog. If just the History View opens the user does not directly know what to do further.

In the History view I would prefer a menu entry "Compare" which compares with the working tree in case one commit is selected and which compares two revisions in case two commit are selected. But I could also live with the double-click solution.

All in all I think that you should split the patch into three patches which could be discussed independently:
- the fix for the GitCompareFileRevisionEditorInput
- the new CompareWithRevisionAction
- the new behaviour of the GitHistoryPage

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CompareWithRevisionAction.java -> I doubt that this is what a user expects. I would expect that a dialog opens where I can choose a revision to compare with.

Line:332, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Unsafe cast: The return value could be a ResourceList!

Line:344, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> This leads to a ClassCastException if resource is a Folder or a Project. Better check this before; in this case we do not show a diff of course.

Line:254, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitCompareFileRevisionEditorInput.java -> I would suggest to show here the short message of the commit like in the History View (in class CommitMessageViewer) using element.getComment(). This would be more consistent and be more relevant for the user.

Hi Stefan,

I really appreciate your exact feedback and understand the reasoning to divide the patch set into three patches. Could you please help me with this division as i do not exactly know how I should do it. You could send me hints per email too.

Thanks

Hi Mihael,

you could create three new patch sets in the following way:
- Split your commit locally into three commits using the command git rebase -i (for a description search for "if you wanted to split a commit" in
http://book.git-scm.com/4_interactive_rebasing.html
). While doing this check that there is no entry "Change-Id:..." in the header of the commit message. If there is one, delete it. 
- Push each commit to gerrit

I think that you could achieve three commits which do not depend on each other.

If you want we can do this split for you.

Thanks, Stefan

I have a problem with splitting the commits: Git tells me, that my working tree is dirty because tag_egit.sh needs an update. The only change are the file permissions, which I did not change. I suppose this is because I work under Windows XP and I have no idea how to fix that.

So I would be glad if you could split the commits for me to enable further discussion.
Maybe you have hints about this file permission issue too.

Best regards
Rayna Casey

Mihael, use the following to disable file mode handling on your repository:

  git config core.fileMode false

This should work around the executable mode bit difference caused by the mismatch of Cygwin and Git.
