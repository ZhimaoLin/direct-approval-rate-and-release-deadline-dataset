Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

any idea what's the performance impact of this change (are there situations where this would copy a lot of arrays ?)

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/Utils.java -> how is this change related to this commit's intent ?

Patch Set 3:

The motivation should be better than just "findbugs says" as exposing representation is often done as a tradeoff.

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Utils.java -> Let this utility remain internal. The move is not even mentioned in the commit message. This should be a separate commit if done at all.

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Utils.java -> A simple clone works fine. You do not need this method.

Line:64, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java -> The inversion of logic is not mentioned in the commit message.

Line:65, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java -> Use roots.clone() instead, here and elsewhere
