DESCRIPTION

Do not add untracked folders if they are ignored

When a folder is ignored via the extension point
"org.eclipse.team.core.ignore" this property is not
inherited to contained resources. Therefore we have 
to check for folders if they are ignored and return false
in the visitor's visit method.
