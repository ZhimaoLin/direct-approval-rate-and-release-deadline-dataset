DESCRIPTION

Decorate IFolders that are submodule working directory roots

Introduce a new configurable submodule text decoration used for folders
that are submodule working directory roots. The default is identical to
the project text decoration except that it doesn't contain the
repository name, as that is always the same as the folder name.
