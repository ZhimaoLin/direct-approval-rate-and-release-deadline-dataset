Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> The root folder of a submodule alway has the same name as the submodule, so this decoration shows the submodule name always twice:

 <submodule> [<submodule> <branch> <commitId>]

I think it would make more sense to show (similar to how submodules are decorated in the repositories view):

 <submodule> [<ref> <commitId>] <commit msg header>
