DESCRIPTION

Decorate IFolders that are submodule working directory roots

Introduce a new configurable submodule text decoration used for folders
that are submodule working directory roots. (Or working directory roots
of nested repositories.)

The default shows the a dirty indicator, the branch, branch state, and
the head commit's short message. The repository name is omitted since
it'll always be identical to the folder name.

Added a new variable for the short message of the head commit.

I'm trying to understand how to support other nested repos.

Line:438, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> How is the branch information only related to submodule?
Expected something like isSubmodule()

Line:440, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> For submodules we have new decoration now. Should we add for other nested repos a new decoration too? Why not reuse or extend the project decoration in all cases?

Line:438, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> Agreed. However, isSubmodule() is perhaps not the best name yet, since this also applies to nested repositories.

But one can sure come up with a better name, and add an appropriate getter to IDecoratableResource. Perhaps isWorkingDirectoryRoot().

Line:440, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> It *is* used also for nested repositories. All this submodule stuff so far does not distinguish between submodules and nested repositories. (I had intended to deal with submodules, but in the end the code doesn't make any assumptions and thus also works for nested repositories.)

I will push my update after more testing to:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67233/2

Line:438, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> I see, Thanks :) I have now my version rebased and running with linked ressources. The name "isWorkingDirectoryRoot()" may be is not good, but to be changed later.
--> https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67233/2

Line:440, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> Thanks again. So i'm using the same decoration for other nested repos too.
