DESCRIPTION

Gerrit doesn't need /p anymore

Since Gerrit 2.3 the path segment /p is not needed anymore when
accessing Gerrit with the http protocol [1]. This patch was initially
created because there was a bug in Gerrit when pushing with /p [2],
which is fixed in the meantime. When testing the change, bug 407984 was
detected. Too fix bug 407984, avoid unnecessary complexity and because
Gerrit 2.3 is now out for half a year, the logic to add /p is removed
from the Gerrit Configuration wizard.
