  of all currently open projects not connected to any team provider
- 'Configure Git Repository' dialog with a selected project would be
  presented to user

Patch Set 2: No score; No score

tested ok, please fix style nit (sorry, I missed that in the last comment) and update https://bugs.eclipse.org/291283 with the final patch version and put the contributor statements required for external contributors according to http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/committer_howto.php#external_contrib into the bug

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/ProjectNameParameterValues.java -> style nit: we don't put braces around single line blocks
