DESCRIPTION

Fix ResourceUtil.getResourceForLocation returning folder as IFile

IWorkspaceRoot#getFileForLocation returns an IFile when asked with a
folder location. This can later lead to problems because exists()
returns false.

By checking with exists(), ResourceUtil now correctly returns an
IFolder. And it's now actually consistent with its own Javadoc.

This is necessary for I7d986900e713b581b7baa19a8e850a5ee37585a7 to work
with folders.
