DESCRIPTION

Fix NullPointer in HistoryView

With 7f6821cfd3b577bbb82f12e54f36cd8e6d1904da a NullPointer was
introduced.  This is fixed with this commit.

Now currentWalk is not set to null per default and it is only 
released if necessary. Because cancelRefreshJob() may set currentWalk 
to null it has to be newly created in case it is null.
