DESCRIPTION

Allow to move changes in compare editor

All compare editors that compares working version against version in
index can now move particular hunk from left to right and other way
around. All changes are persisted to file system/git index after saving
compare results.

To add this functionality we need to wrap team's specific OpenInCompare
action into our own (GitOpenInCompare) action, because team framework
forces right hand side to be always read only. We want this writable
instead since we want to move changes from working copy to git index.

I've change patch order, now this change depends on:
* Change  I929c3c32: Support getting repository mapping for non-workspace files
* Change I47c8dac0: Add ResourceUtils.isNonWorkspace(IResource)

IMHO it makes more sense to merge those changes it that order.

- when saving the compare editor it seems the synchronize view doesn't auto-refresh, when explicitly synchronizing again it looks fine
- can't open compare editor from staging view for non-workspace files
