DESCRIPTION

[sync] Allow to move changes in compare editor for working tree file

Now in 'Git Commits' model you can move particular change in files from
'<working tree>' node between working copy and staged version. All
changes are persisted to file system/git index after saving compare
results.

To add this functionality we need to wrap team's specific OpenInCompre
action into ours own (GitOpenInCompare) action, because team framework
forces right hand side to be always read only. Such behavior ins't true
for us when we want to move changes from working copy to git index.
