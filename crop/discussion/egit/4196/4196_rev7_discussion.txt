DESCRIPTION

[sync] Allow to move changes in compare editor for working tree file

Now in 'Git Commits' model you can move particular change in files from
'<working tree>' node between working copy and staged version. All
changes are persisted to file system/git index after saving compare
results.

To add this functionality we need to wrap team's specific OpenInCompre
action into ours own (GitOpenInCompare) action, because team framework
forces right hand side to be always read only. Such behavior ins't true
for us when we want to move changes from working copy to git index.

nice feature, works as expected

How about adding a test for this non-trivial feature ?

I think it would be more consistent to also provide this same functionality when the compare editor is opened from synchronize view in workspace mode and also when opened from the staging view ?

Line:10, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/action/GitOpenInCompareAction.java -> I guess you borrowed this from Team ?

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> better:

We want this writable instead since we want to move ...

Patch Set 7:

I'll add tests for this in a separate change set.

I'm not quite sure if we should add this functionality to 'workspace model' because we compare there working tree against HEAD, not working tree against git index. Therefore putting some changes in index isn't straight forward behavior in this view.

IMHO enhancing compare editor from staging view should be also added in separate change, I could also work on this in  nearest feature ;)
