DESCRIPTION

Fix diff icons and left/right sides in History View compare

When comparing two commits via "Compare with Each Other" in History
View, there were two problems:

1. For CHANGE cases, the commit ID label and the actual content of the
   sides did not match. This is fixed by always showing compareRev on
   the left, consistent with setLeftLabel and setRightLabel earlier in
   the code.

2. For ADDITION/DELETION cases, the icon shown in the tree was reversed.
   For an addition (file doesn't exist in base/right, exists in
   compare/left), a [-] was shown (weird). By ORing it with
   Differencer.RIGHT, we get a nice left to right arrow with a +/- in it
   (which is then correct).
