DESCRIPTION

[releng] Use findbugs 3.0.3 for Java 8 support

This will be needed by the Neon target platform, which does require
building with Java 8. Findbugs 3 works both with Java 7 (which actually
is its minimum requirement) and with Java 8.

I don't get it. Just changing the findbugs version, and then we hit that "can't find libgthread-2.0.so.0" error in the easymport wizard test?? Doh. What else besides the Java version has changed in the Hudson job?

Cna it be that we run (or require) 32 bit Eclipse on 64 bit JVM

Perhaps. I see "-Dosgi.arch=x86" in the logs. Shouldn't that be x86_64? But where does this come from?

Vice versa. See http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/tracecompass-dev/msg00355.html . We're running a 32bit JVM, which then doesn't find the 32bit libgthread library on the 64bit HIPP installation. We should be running a 64bit JVM.

That can be fixed only on Hudson.
