DESCRIPTION

Remove redundant type information from org.eclipse.egit.ui

org.eclipse.egit.ui has been upgraded to Java 1.7 a while ago. 

This allows to avoid the redundant definition of type information. This
commit removes them and set the compiler level to errors for these to
avoid creating this redundant information again.
