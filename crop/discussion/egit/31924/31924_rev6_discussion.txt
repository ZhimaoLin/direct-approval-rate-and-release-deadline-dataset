Patch Set 6:

Hi Matthias & others,

I missed some possibilities to do multi push.

Now you have the possiblities in the following cases to do a multi push:
- In the package/project explorer
- In the menu bar if you configure git in the "Action Set Availability"
- In the "Git Repositories" view

I also added the copyright.

Thanks if somebody takes the time for reviewing und merging :)
