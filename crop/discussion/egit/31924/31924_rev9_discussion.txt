- multi-push is only enabled if git toolbar is activated, otherwise "Push to Upstream" is disabled in all menus
- if there's an error the error message is shown in a single line which is pretty hard to read, see http://i.imgur.com/0dJ3rDU.png
- if there's no error the "Errors occurred" column shows "No Errors", I rename this column to "Status message" and show the summary status line from the details page, e.g. "master -> master [up to date]" since this is the most valuable information if push succeeded.
- if there's nothing to push I have to wait a long time and always one out of 2 push operations has a failed status, I suspect something goes wrong in case there's no commit to push for multiple selected repositories

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> Why are you removing the feature that we show the push branch wizard if upstream isn't configured ?

What will happen if the user clicks push and multiple repositories are selected out of which some or all have no upstream configured ?

Line:3947, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIText.java -> style nit: remove trailing whitespace

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushResultDialog.java -> did you mean "either ... or" ? what's the other case ?

Line:89, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushResultDialog.java -> missing braces

Line:87, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushOperationUI.java -> style nit: remove unnecessary blank line

Line:95, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushOperationUI.java -> we could push to different repositories in parallel, this would probably reduce the time to finish the multi-push

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushOperationUI.java -> style nit: we switched to use braces around single line blocks for new code since a while [1], more occurrences in this patch

[1] https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Braces_for_one-line_statements

Line:139, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushOperationUI.java -> this is used once only so you could inline this call

Line:173, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushOperationUI.java -> mark xxx@xxx.xxx since this method can return null

Line:176, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/MultiPushOperationUI.java -> missing braces

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperationResult.java -> s/repository/repositories/

Line:102, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperationResult.java -> s/isSuccessfulConnectionForAllURI/isSuccessfulConnectionForAllURIs/

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> remove trailing whitespaces

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> "comparison" sounds strange, maybe better:

"Corresponding to the multi pull dialog also support multi-push."

- Could you provide some more details?
- Does this imply any changes for how single push works ?
- what happens if some of the pushes fail ?
- what happens if some of the repositories have upstream configured and some not ?
