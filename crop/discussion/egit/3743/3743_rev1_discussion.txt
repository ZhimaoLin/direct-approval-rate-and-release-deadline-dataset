DESCRIPTION

Added the 'Follow Renames' feature to the history page.

This adds a dedicated BooleanPrefAction, which is added to the 'Show'
sub-menu. When activated, an history page on one single regular file
sets a proper FollowFilter instance as TreeFilter for the current
walk.

This looks good, but the problem with the File list should be fixed before the change can be accepted. You may ask on the JGit mailing list how this can be solved.

Line:1625, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> You did not specify a filter for the fileWalker. Now all the files are listed in the file list.

I tried just to add the FollowFilter to the fileWalker like below. This however does not work, the fileWalker cannot handle the rename.  

We need somehow to set the correct file filter when the selection of the CommitGraphTable changes.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please add a line "Bug: 302549"

Please do not forget to add the Change-Id.

Patch Set 1:

you should add the change-id to the last paragraph of the commit message otherwise amending will lead to another new change in gerrit. So for this change copy the change-id from the gerrit webui and add it to the commit message when amending this commit
