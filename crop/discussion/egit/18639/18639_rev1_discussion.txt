DESCRIPTION

Blame annotations: Add link for showing commit in history and open

Showing only an abbreviated commit ID makes room for adding two links,
one for opening the commit (before, this was the link on the commit ID
itself), and one for showing it in the history view. With this, both
actions are now explicit.
