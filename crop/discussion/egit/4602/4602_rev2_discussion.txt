On repository nodes I now see both
- Properties
- Show In > Properties
I think the first one should be removed

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo: s/movse/moves/

Patch Set 2:

Yes that is intended, similar to files in the Project Explorer, there is action to view the property page as well as to show the element in the properties view.
