This breaks the test GitRepositoriesViewTest.testLinkWithEditor() which should be adapted to use the linkWithSelection toggle instead of the linkWithEditor toggle button. 

Hiding linkWithEditorAction is fine, but IMO linkWithSelection should also link with the corresponding editor, I think that's what you meant here https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=350686#c2, correct ? This should also fix the above test failure.

I think it's ok to retarget this change for 3.0 if you can fix these issues.
