Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Doesn't fill in a proper change-id:
- do some change
- Team > Commit
- Enter some text into commit message
- select "Add signed-off-by"
- select "Compute Change-Id for Gerrit Johnathan Pham"
- this adds a change-id "I0000..." (all zero)
- in the message pane of the commit dialog there is no proper line break between change-id and signed-off-by line
- selecting "Compute Change-Id ..." unchecks "Add signed-off-by" checkbox
- click "Commit"
- inspect commit message in history view :
- commit message, signed-off-by and change-id are there with proper line breaks
- but Change-Id is still "I0000..." (all zero)
