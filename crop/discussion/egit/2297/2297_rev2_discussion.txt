DESCRIPTION

[sync] Next package of performance improvements

After reverting change I6b030af13ba092855ef68e5a6087bb357fdb7bb2
synchronize view perform very badly. This change improve its performance
by reducing calculation of common ancestor commits in 'git change set'
model objects. This change introduce also some caching of
IResourceVariant's, introduce reusing of FileTreeIterator in ...,
replaces getContainerForLocation() with combination of getProject() and
getFolder() calls.

With such improvements synchronization time seams to be same as with
after merging change I6b030af13ba092855ef68e5a6087bb357fdb7bb2
