DESCRIPTION

Git Repositories View: Bare Repositoy Support

The following actions are disable for a "bare"
Repository:

- checkout of branches
- browsing the working directory
- import of projects

The "bare"-ness of a Repository is visualized
in the "Working Directoy" node which displays
"This is  a bare Repository" instead of the
working directory.
