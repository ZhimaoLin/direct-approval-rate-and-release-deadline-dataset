DESCRIPTION

Fix NPE accessing body of RevCommit returned from getCommonAncestor

This was introduced in I2e0ea4a9da7fb756354bd6df9f6051e5b0db9a7f, where
setRetainBody(false) was added.

But the returned RevCommit is later used to get author information,
which is only possible with a parsed body.

Also release the RevWalk.
