DESCRIPTION

[wip] Provide a remote mapping context to ModelProviders

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these "unknown"
files into account.

Overall, this test looks good to me.

I only have a few questions concerning the changes of CompareActionsTest. Also I was wondering if we should add a test case for CompareUtils.canDirectlyOpenInCompare, since we modified the behavior of this method in contrast to just passing the context.

Line:86, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/CompareActionsTest.java -> Do we expect no changes and no untracked files only in this test case? Shouldn't this be fixed in the superclass instead? Feels like it isn't on purpose that the .project file isn't committed, right?
