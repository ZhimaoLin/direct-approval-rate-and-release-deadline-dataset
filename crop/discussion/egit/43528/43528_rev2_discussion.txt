DESCRIPTION

[wip] Provide a remote mapping context to ModelProviders

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these "unknown"
files into account.

Patch Set 2:

This latest patch set fixes the tests. we were previouxly expecting "no changes" even though git status properly reported one untracked file. The synchronization was thus wrong even with a "local" resource mapping context.
