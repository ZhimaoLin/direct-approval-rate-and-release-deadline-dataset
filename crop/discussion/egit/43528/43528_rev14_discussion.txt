DESCRIPTION

Provide a remote mapping context to ModelProviders

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these locally
unknown files into account.
Note that several model providers will provide mappings for a projet,
causing the label displayed in the Sync view to be sightly different,
hence the change in CompareActionsTest.

This does not resolve all the use-cases we expect. I -1 it until a solution is found.
