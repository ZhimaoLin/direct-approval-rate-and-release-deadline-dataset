DESCRIPTION

Provide a remote mapping context to ModelProviders

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these locally
unknown files into account.
