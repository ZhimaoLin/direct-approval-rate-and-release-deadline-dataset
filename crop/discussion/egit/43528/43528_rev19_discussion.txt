DESCRIPTION

Provide a remote mapping context to ModelProviders

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these locally
unknown files into account.
An interface to allow ModelProviders to be ignored in synchronizations
has been added.

Patch Set 19:

Hello Matthias,

If you want to test the modification, I pushed a test repository at
https://github.com/ldelaigue/test_git_logical
In a runtime eclipse, clone this repo and get the 'remote_context' project. Compare file 'index.mocklogical' master vs branch.
It should open the Synchronize view and display 5 files (file1.txt to file4.txt plus index.mocklogical)

Without this patch, the files that are part of the logical model only on the remote side would not appear.

I hope this helps you to test!
