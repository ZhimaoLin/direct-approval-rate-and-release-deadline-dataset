DESCRIPTION

[wip] Provide a remote mapping context to ModelProviders

Allow model providers to use remote information when trying
to determine whether a file is a part of a logical model or
not. When a file has been deleted locally, or when a file
has been created on one of the remote sides, the local side
is not enough to compute a full model. ModelProviders will
need access to the remote file data to take these "unknown"
files into account.

Patch Set 1:

The tests failures are related, but they seem to indicate a failure to detect differences in the previous version. "ProjectWithoutDotProject" _does_ have a ".project" file locally, and there thus should be a diff detected. I don't know why the preivous version of this code didn't. I'll continue investigating, please ignore this review for now.
