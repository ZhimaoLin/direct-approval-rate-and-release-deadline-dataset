DESCRIPTION

Adding a parameter to the extension point ICommitMessageProvider

Adding of the "preselected files" as parameter of the extension point
ICommitMessageProvider.
Originally, there was only one parameter which contained the modified
projects. Providing the preselected files gives information about the
user selection when he performed the commit action, and therefore,
allows to generate more precise commit comments.
