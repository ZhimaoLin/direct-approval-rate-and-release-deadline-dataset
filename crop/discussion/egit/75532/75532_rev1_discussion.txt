DESCRIPTION

Use jobs instead of threads for searching in history

The main reason for doing this is that I wanted to get rid of the custom
progress meter. It's also a first step towards using a CommitSearchQuery
instead of yet another custom-written search logic, and a first step
towards getting a more compact search widget that perhaps can be even
moved into the toolbar.
