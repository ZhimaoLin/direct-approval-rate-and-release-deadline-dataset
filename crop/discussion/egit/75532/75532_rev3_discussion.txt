DESCRIPTION

Use jobs instead of threads for searching in history

The main reason for doing this is that I wanted to get rid of the custom
progress meter. It's also a first step towards using a CommitSearchQuery
instead of yet another custom-written search logic, and a first step
towards getting a more compact search widget that perhaps can be even
moved into the toolbar.

Also make the text field a search field, and react to ENTER and to the
search icon being clicked. Add a new listener interface IFindListener
to disentangle the toolbar, the job, and the find results.
