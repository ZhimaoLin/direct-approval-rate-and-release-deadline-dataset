DESCRIPTION

Fix NoWorkTreeException in GitImportWizard

When a bare repository is selected in the GitSelectRepositoryPage, the
import wizard throws and reports multiple NoWorkTreeExceptions.

Since a bare repository has no working tree, one cannot import from a
bare repository. Therefore, do not display bare repositories in the
GitSelectRepositoryPage at all when used in the GitImportWizard. The
user thus cannot select a bare repository in the first place.

If some bare repositories are omitted, display a message saying so.

I pushed alternative approach https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76481 which suppresses bare repositories in RepositorySearchDialog, what do you think about that ?
