DESCRIPTION

Fix NoWorkTreeException in GitImportWizard

When a bare repository is selected in the GitSelectRepositoryPage, the
import wizard throws and reports multiple NoWorkTreeExceptions.

Since a bare repository has no working tree, one cannot import from a
bare repository. Therefore, do not display bare repositories in the
GitSelectRepositoryPage at all. The user thus cannot select a bare
repository in the first place.
