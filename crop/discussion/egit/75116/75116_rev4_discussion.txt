DESCRIPTION

Fix NoWorkTreeException in GitImportWizard

When a bare repository is selected in the GitSelectRepositoryPage, the
import wizard throws and reports multiple NoWorkTreeExceptions.

Since a bare repository has no working tree, one cannot import from a
bare repository. Therefore, do not display bare repositories in the
GitSelectRepositoryPage at all when used in the GitImportWizard. The
user thus cannot select a bare repository in the first place.

If some bare repositories are omitted, display a message saying so.

I fear that's too expensive; it would require creating a Repository object for each directory.

In general, adding bare repos makes sense. Importing from them doesn't. Filtering in the add dialog, or even warning there, may be too expensive. I've taken the simplest approach and just tell the user if the repository selection dialog hides bare repositories.
