Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Double clicking a folder does no longer work. E.G. double clicking "Local Branches" collapses and then immediately expands the folder.

Patch Set 3:

I've double check that it and it seams to be working OK.

Jens, are you sure that you made double click on label "Local Branch", not on expand/collapse button ?

Checked it again. Yes, I double clicked on the label.

When I comment out, everything is o.k.:

			public void mouseDoubleClick(MouseEvent e) {
...
//	else // expand element if it does not contain data
//		item.setExpanded(!item.getExpanded());

Are you working with Windows or with another OS?

Line:108, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> The tree already expands on double click. This code then reverts the expansion (Tested on Windows).

Patch Set 3:

I'm using Linux, so it seams that this is OS dependent feature.

IMHO it should be fixed in SWT instead of making workarounds in EGit code. Right ?

Patch Set 3:

Don't think so. Windows tree expands automatically when clicking on a folder. Windows users are used to this, so SWT should not change the behaviour.
Your expansion code conflicts with this behaviour. I think there are 2 options:
1. remove the expandion code
2. implement expansion code only on non Windows platform.
I would prefer option 1.

Patch Set 3:

I mean that, no reaction on double click on tree element in Linux is an SWT issue and it should be fixed in SWT not in EGit.

Expanding tree elements on double click is default action not only for Windows but also for other systems. I don't want to remove it, I only want same behavior on other systems.
