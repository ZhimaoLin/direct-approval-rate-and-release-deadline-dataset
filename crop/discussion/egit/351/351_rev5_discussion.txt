Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The double-click is cool. I'm not sure, though, why we need to listen for right-arrow key events. At least for me, this works already.

Line:109, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> Do we really need this? Expand on right-arrow does work for me already.

Line:458, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> See above

Patch Set 5: No score

I've never used EGit under Windows so it is possible that those features already works on it. I'll check that and if it is already working I'll abandon this change.

From the other hand it is strange that SWT has so many differences (or rather lacks of usability features) between Windows and Linux.

Patch Set 5: Abandoned

This features are already supported on Windows platform. It is strange that this isn't supported on Linux.
