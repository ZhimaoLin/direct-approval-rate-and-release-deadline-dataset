Hmm.  Isn't this a duplicate of Ibcad902caea33ab1379f089714f2286701727fa4 ?

Both patches are identical in ~80%, I forgot to abandon the oldest version.
This path contains one more improvement in double click handler (double click on node that can be expanded/collapsed trigger expand/collapse action instead of changing branch).

Generally right now I'm learning how to use Gerrit so I made that stupid mistakes :| Both changes should be in one "merge request".

some style nits and typos

Your commit messages needs some reformatting: shorten the first header line of the commit message and add the remaining text after a blank line. For the reasons see e.g. http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> style nit: we don't use curly braces for single line blocks

Line:107, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> typo: s/contains/contain/

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> typo: s/three/tree/

Patch Set 1:

I've implemented Matthias suggestions: http://egit.eclipse.or/r/#change,366

By the way, I don't know why this patch doesn't goes to this patch set, maybe there is something wrong in my local repository or I'm doing something wrong.

Patch Set 1:

You need to have the ChangeId: footer in the commit message in order to tell Gerrit that new patchsets should replace older ones for the same change [1]. Either put that manually into the second patchset or install the Gerrit commit-msg hook [2] (this only works if you commit using native git since EGit doesn't support hooks yet).

Patch Set 1:

Now everything is clear why Gerrit doesn't "connect" both patches. I've recently installed hooks but for making commits and pushes I've used EGit.

I'll abandon http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,366 and recommit it with popper Change-id, so that it will be linked with this patch.

Patch Set 1:

I don't have any idea how to link that two patches, I've tray several combination's (some of them you can see in yours mailboxes) and none of them were successful. Gerrit reject them with message "squash commits first" or treat it as a new change. Now I'm out of ideas :|

Maybe I'll simply abandon this one, and add a new patch ...
