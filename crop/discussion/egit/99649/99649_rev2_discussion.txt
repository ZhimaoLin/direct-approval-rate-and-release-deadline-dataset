DESCRIPTION

Use StringBuilder in org.eclipse.egit.ui

StringBuilder is a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer and faster, as
it avoids the (unnecessary) synchronization. org.eclipse.egit.ui uses in
two places still StringBuffer, all other places are already
StringBuilder. Usage should be consistent.

It isn't. Anyway, we do accept changes without bug report.
