DESCRIPTION

Add Team context menu for working sets

The menu now shows repository actions in case all projects of a working
set are connected to the same Git repository. This is enabled by adding
a property tester that does the logic in code instead of XML.

To adjust the enabled checks of some actions, some selection-related
methods were moved out into its own util class. This also made some
other duplicated logic for getting the repository obsolete.

I think the following also make sense (and probably also benefit from the work of above change):

* Synchronize Workspace
* Create Patch
* Show in History
* Show in Repositories View

For the others, I think it's better if we don't add them. I'll look into the above soon.
