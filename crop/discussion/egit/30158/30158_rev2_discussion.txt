DESCRIPTION

Add Team context menu for working sets

The menu now shows repository actions in case all projects of a working
set are connected to the same Git repository. This is enabled by adding
a property tester that does the logic in code instead of XML.

To adjust the enabled checks of some actions, some selection-related
methods were moved out into its own util class. This also made some
other duplicated logic for getting the repository obsolete.

Patch Set 2:

why don't you expose the same set of commands as on a project ?

The following are available on projects but not on working set: Commit, Synchronize Workspace, Create Patch, Add to Index, Remove from Index, Ignore, Show in History, Show in Repositories View

Patch Set 2:

Some of those are implemented as actions currently (because they're also in the toolbar), which makes it more difficult. Last time I tried to convert them to the non-deprecated way I hit some platform limitations, see bug 414612.

But maybe we can just leave the toolbar items be actions and use org.eclipse.ui.menus for the menu. Will look into it. (But that should go in a separate change.)

Regarding "Add to Index" and "Remove from Index", would you expect them to operate on the whole repository or only on the connected projects that are in the working set? I personally would be a bit scared to use them on a whole working set, maybe they shouldn't be available.

"Ignore", on the working set? I don't think that's needed.
