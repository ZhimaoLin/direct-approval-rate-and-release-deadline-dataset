DESCRIPTION

Create temporary decorations for project nodes

The label decoration of project nodes contains important information,
i.e. the repository name as well as the current branch. This change
introduces a temporary decoration for project nodes that only contains
this textual (label) information and is shown immediately. The final
decoration is shown as soon as a full recursive walk through the whole
project has been performed.
