Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SynchronizeWorkspaceActionHandler.java -> I think this is only correct for branches with only one path segment, but for hierarchical branch names like "refs/heads/feature/xyz" it yields wrong results, for this example you would end up with mergeBranchName = "/xyz" instead of "/feature/xyz".

Also the variable name is a bit misleading as this always starts with a leading slash which isn't common for a branch name.

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SynchronizeWorkspaceActionHandler.java -> True, I'll just remove refs/heads/ prefix from mergeBranchName and it should work for all cases
