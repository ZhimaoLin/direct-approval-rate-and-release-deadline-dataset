DESCRIPTION

Use branch.<name>.mergeoptions to set merge defaults

When presenting the MergeTargetSelectionDialog look at the mergeoptions
configuration to pre-select the merge type (commit/no-commit/squash) in
the dialog. This was already done for the fast forward configuration.

Also honor the configured merge options when merging without a dialog.
