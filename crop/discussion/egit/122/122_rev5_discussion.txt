DESCRIPTION

Implement "Compare with Revision" feature in history view.

When a user double-clicks on an entry in the CommitGraphTable
the selected file is compared with the working tree.

Stefan added handling for the case that the file is not contained 
in the commit.

Now I'm convinced that the double-click solution is a good one (as CVS does it the same).

Could you please fix the minor issues? I just copied my remarks from the original patch set.

Maybe it would be enough to do nothing, when selected resource is not a file. The CVS plugin switches to synchronized view in similar occasions but EGit offers revision details anyway in history view.

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I changed the coding which used an eclipse 3.5 feature (GitHistoryPage, l.422).

The bug mentioned by Matthias is not related to this change, there even already exists a bugzilla entry (302145).
