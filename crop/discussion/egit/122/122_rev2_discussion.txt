Thanks for your comments Stefan,
I will look into the issues as soon as possible but it could take me some days. I have little spare time atm.

CVS doesn't show folder history, presumable because that would be expensive. EGit, on the other hand filters history at folder level so we should not behave like the CVS plugin in this respect.

Line:332, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Unsafe cast: The return value could be a ResourceList!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:344, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> This leads to a ClassCastException if resource is a Folder or a Project. Better check this before; in this case we do not show a diff of course.
