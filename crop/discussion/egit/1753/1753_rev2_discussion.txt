DESCRIPTION

Allow to open History View from Repositories View

In that case, the filter icons are disabled (as we don't have a
resource filter to apply).
In the course of this, the ResourceList object was removed from
EGit core and replaced with HistoryPageInput.
Furthermore, the GitHistoryPageSource was moved to the
correct package and the createPage logic was fixed (the old
logic would always do a setInput on the new page which was
double work as the history framework would to this again).
A better implementation of setInput() results in far fewer calls
to setInpu() (the history framework will only call setInput if the
new object is different from the previous input, but the existing
implementation would return something different upon getInput
than was provided during setInput).
The All Branches and Compare Mode buttons were changed 
to use Preference Actions so that their toggle state survives a 
restart now.
The rest of the changes is adjusting the handlers to deal with
File as input (instead of IResource).

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I tried with two repositories and found the following scenario to fail:
- show history for first repository
- in repositories view select second repository and click "Open in History"
- the History View gets the focus but the history is not switched to the one for the second repository, instead still the history of the first repository is displayed.

- can we rename the context menu entry to "Show in History" instead of "Open in History" to make this consistent with the entry in the team menu ?

- could you split the change into several ones ? Looks like changing to use Preference actions and adjusting handlers to deal with File are independent from the rest.
