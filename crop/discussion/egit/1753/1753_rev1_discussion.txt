DESCRIPTION

Allow to open History View from Repositories View

In that case, the filter icons are disabled (as we don't have a
resource filter to apply).
In the course of this, the ResourceList object was removed from
EGit core and replaces with a package-local HistoryPageInput.
Furthermore, the GitHistoryPageSource was moved to the
correct package and the createPage logic was fixed (the old
logic would always do a setInput on the new page which was
double work as the history framework would to this again).

- I would prefer "Show in History" to make this more consistent with the team menu
- could we use potentially available selection in e.g. package explorer as filter input ?
- TODO in OpenHistoryCommand needs to be done to handle exception properly

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/OpenHistoryCommand.java -> exception handling missing, please fix that
