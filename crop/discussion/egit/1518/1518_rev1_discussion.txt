DESCRIPTION

Don't start SourceBranchPage with a warning

Currently the SourceBranchPage starts with the warning that the
repository is empty as we're just about to fetch the refs. We should
only check if the repository is empty when we are done with fetching
its branches. This avoids a warning the user should only see in the case
the repository really is empty.
