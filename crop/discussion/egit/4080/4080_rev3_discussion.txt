DESCRIPTION

Fix for problem with single project repositories and GitFileHistory

The GitFileHistory class must Consider empty relative path to project for
repositories that contain one single project and the project contains
the .git folder. This patch adds the necessary check to the GitFileHistory
class and a JUnit test that verifies that the fix works as expected.
