any hint how to test this fix ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: commit message isn't formatted along the git convention mentioned in the contributor guide [1].

Patch Set 2:

I assume you have a test for the GitFileHistory already? If so, run that test on a project that contains the .git folder. Without this fix that test will fail.

Patch Set 2:

The existing test org.eclipse.egit.core.internal.storage.BlobStorageTest obviously doesn't test this case, as otherwise it would have failed already earlier. Could you enhance this test to cover this fix ?
