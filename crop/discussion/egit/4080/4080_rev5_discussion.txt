DESCRIPTION

Fixes problem with single project repositories and GitFileHistory

The GitFileHistory class must consider empty relative path to project
for repositories that contain one single project and the project
contains the .git folder. This patch adds the necessary check to the
GitFileHistory class and a JUnit test that verifies that the fix works
as expected.
