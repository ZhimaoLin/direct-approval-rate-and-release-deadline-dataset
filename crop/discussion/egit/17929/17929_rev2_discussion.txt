DESCRIPTION

Improve rendering of file diffs in History view

The Comment pane in the History view should render a blank line after
the commit message and before the diffs for the files selected on the
right.

The fix for bug 410220 made this old rendering bug much more apparent,
especially in repos with terse commit messages.

This fix also renders EGit's additional
------ path/to/file.ext ------
header line in grey to make it stand out from the "diff -git ...".

Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+1

The new patch set only adds a trailing LF to the commit message if there is not already one (native Git also behaves this way), solving the 2 LF problem.

I think we should submit this and create a bug for further bigger improvements (reusing the commit editor, etc).
