DESCRIPTION

Support spellchecking in commit dialog

In order to improve user expierence during commit, this introduces
spellchecking and quick fixes for the commit message. In addition,
a margin was added to help wrapping the commit messages. In the
future, it may be feasible to have preferences for the margin width
and visibility.

Patch Set 2:

Unfortunately, this has destroyed some UI tests that are trying to set a commit message in the commit dialog using SWTBot.textWithLabel().setText(). The (some?) text control is returned by textWithLabel(), but setText() does not have an effect... Any idea?
