DESCRIPTION

Support spellchecking in commit dialog

In order to improve user expierence during commit, this introduces
spellchecking and quick fixes for the commit message. In addition,
a margin was added to help wrapping the commit messages. In the
future, it may be feasible to have preferences for the margin width
and visibility.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Cool! What would be missing is a way to re-activate spell checking after it has been deactivated using the context menu.
Also, I wonder if we can make this locale (language) aware?
