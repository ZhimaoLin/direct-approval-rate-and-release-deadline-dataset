DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Fix context menu for modified+added file

For a file that is not in HEAD, but added to index and modified in the
working tree, the context menu was wrong. It was handled just as
"modified". Now it's also handled specially like modified+changed.

Renamed the PARTIALLY_MODIFIED value to make it clearer.
