DESCRIPTION

Sort commits by repository name first instead of object id.

Sorting by SHA-1 offers little value to the user when
a search string such as 'HEAD' is entered.  Instead sort
by repository name so that repositories like 'egit' and
'jgit' will be consistently relative to each other in
the list of matching commits.
