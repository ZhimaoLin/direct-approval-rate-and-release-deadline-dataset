Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/ReleaseStartOperation.java -> this will throw an NPE on an empty repository (HEAD not yet created), also check for potential NPE in findHead()

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> what is EGitFlow ? if you want to tag this commit is about gitflow I'd prefix this with

 [gitflow]

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> remove this empty line, commit message footers should be located in the last paragraph by convention

I thought this was covered by MissingObjectException.
Created new test case.
