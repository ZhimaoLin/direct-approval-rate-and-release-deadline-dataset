DESCRIPTION

Add progress monitor to "Import Projects" wizard

On the GitCloneWizard, the progress monitor was already there, while
it was missing on the "Import Projects" wizard (available from the
Repositories View).
Code inspection also revealed some minor issue with handling of
cancellation (monitor.done() missing).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I tried that with org.eclipse.cdt repository containing 134 projects. During project import I see a lot of progress dialogs popping up for a millisecond and in the main dialog I can't cancel. So it looks like this needs some improvement.
