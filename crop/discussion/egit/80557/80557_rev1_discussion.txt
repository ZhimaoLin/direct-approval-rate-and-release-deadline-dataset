DESCRIPTION

More efficient label provider for the staging view

The staging view's label provider was derived from
DecoratingLabelProvider, which is an ITreePathLabelProvider. For these,
the TreeViewer's WrappedViewerLabelProvider computes the tree path for
each element, which then ultimately isn't used because the
StagingViewLabelProvider is _not_ an ITreePathLabelProvider. This tree
path computation is, at least on GTK, fairly expensive.

By not deriving our label provider from DecoratingLabelProvider but
wrapping it, we can ensure that the framework does not compute these
tree paths that are then not used anyway, and decorations are
significantly faster on GTK.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> "Significantly" meaning: for my (ridiculous) flat test directory with 50k unstaged files, the time to open it in the staging view comes down from 60-70s to about 40-45s.
