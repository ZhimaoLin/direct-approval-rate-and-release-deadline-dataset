DESCRIPTION

[sync] Sync remote branches that don't belong to any remote repo

Allow synchronize on remote branches that are located directly in
refs/remotes folder (they don't belong to any remote repository). Such
branches are created by git-svn bridge and should be also supported by
synchronize view.
