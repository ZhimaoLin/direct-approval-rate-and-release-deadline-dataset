DESCRIPTION

Only include resources that are part of the data set in synchronize

Workspace synchronization is launched on a given repository (or "a
project of a given repository"). This repository may contain commits
on files that were not imported in the workspace. In such a case, the
GitContainerMapping corresponding to that commit shouldn't create
traversals for the files that are not in the workspace.

Found another problem (was already there before, sorry about that).

Line:116, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitContainerMapping.java -> getLocation() can return null, must be checked. It should probably not be included then.

Line:118, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitContainerMapping.java -> getLocation() can also return null here. The path should not be tested in that case.

Laurent, could you address the comments?

Patch Set 5:

Laurent is currently in vacation. I would have liked to address the comment, but I cannot push a review on behalf of Laurent. If I change the "signed-off", the commit review process tells me that the author of the commit has not "signed-off" the commit. 

Any idea if it could be done before Laurent come back?

I'm not sure if it's possible since verification in Gerrit was turned on, see here for overview:

Could you try if pushing works after adding the following line below "Bug:"?:
