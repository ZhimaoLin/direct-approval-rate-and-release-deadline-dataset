DESCRIPTION

Only include resources that are part of the data set in synchronize

Workspace synchronization is launched on a given repository (or "a
project of a given repository"). This repository may contain commits
on files that were not imported in the workspace. In such a case, the
GitContainerMapping corresponding to that commit shouldn't create
traversals for the files that are not in the workspace.
