DESCRIPTION

Only include resources that are part of the data set in synchronize

Workspace synchronization is launched on a given repository (or "a
project of a given repository"). This repository may contain commits
on files that were not imported in the workspace. In such a case, the
GitContainerMapping corresponding to that commit shouldn't create
traversals for the files that are not in the workspace.

Looks good otherwise.

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitContainerMapping.java -> In which cases is it OK to set dataSet to null? Looks like it will just lead to an NPE later on. Better to abort earlier here and throw an exception (or return an empty array?).

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitContainerMapping.java -> I had done this to keep the current behavior when the data set cannot be found (when the context is not a GitSubscriberContext, which should never happen). However this will indeed end in an NPE as it stands...

Changed so that a null dataset reverts to the old behavior (take everything in the repository).
