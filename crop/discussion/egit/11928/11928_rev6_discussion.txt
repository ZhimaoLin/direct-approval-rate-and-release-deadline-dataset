DESCRIPTION

Only include resources that are part of the data set in synchronize

Workspace synchronization is launched on a given repository (or "a
project of a given repository"). This repository may contain commits
on files that were not imported in the workspace. In such a case, the
GitContainerMapping corresponding to that commit shouldn't create
traversals for the files that are not in the workspace.

Patch Set 6:

The solution was to reference Laurent in "Also-by" and to change the author of the contribution to my name. I hope Laurent and you does not bother about that. I did it to speed up the integration of this patch.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

I think I can change it before submitting it, so we don't have to wait for the verification to be changed.

I just noticed that shouldBeIncluded also exists in GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber and has nearly the same implementation (but it doesn't check for null return of getLocation). Could we move the implementation into a method on GitSynchronizeDataSet instead, so the code is shared?
