DESCRIPTION

[UI RFC] Publish branch/initial push wizard

With certain workflows (non-Gerrit), creating a branch and pushing it to
a remote (including setup of branch tracking) is a common operation.
Currently, this is pretty complicated with EGit and a source of errors,
bug reports and help requests.

This change tries to provide a solution for the following use cases:

* The user created a new repository and wants to push it for the first
  time (no remotes yet).

* The user created a new feature branch and wants to push it to a
  remote, and set up tracking in the same step (git push -u).

It adds an additional wizard and provides it in place of the "push to
upstream" action when no tracking branch is configured yet. It's also
available in the context menu of a branch in the repositories view.
