DESCRIPTION

Push branch/initial push wizard

With certain workflows (non-Gerrit), creating a branch and pushing it to
a remote (including setup of branch tracking) is a common operation.
Currently, this is pretty complicated with EGit and a source of errors,
bug reports and help requests.

This change tries to provide a solution for the following use cases:

* The user created a new repository and wants to push it for the first
  time (probably one branch and no remotes yet).

* The user created a new feature/release branch and wants to push it to
  a remote, and set up tracking in the same step (git push -u).

It adds an additional wizard for both the above cases. For the toolbar
push action, the wizard is started when no upstream branch is configured
yet.

It's also available in the Team menu and the context menu of the
repositories view (on repo and on individual branches).

- I feel it's not obvious what is the source branch and what is the target branch of the push being configured here
- how can I configure the upstream branch I want to push to ?

> I feel it's not obvious what is the source branch and what is the target branch of the push being configured here

I'm not sure what you mean by source and target.

The branch being pushed is either the selected branch or the current branch if invoked via team menu. It is shown in the wizard title (e.g. "Push Branch foo").

What the branch should be named on the remote (which is usually the same as the local name) can be entered on the page in the "Branch name" text field.

> how can I configure the upstream branch I want to push to ?

Can you give an example of what you are trying to do?

The wizard does the same as `git push --set-upstream remote-name` when the current branch is selected. If another branch is selected, it's `git push --set-upstream remote-name branch-name`. If the branch name is changed in the text field, it's `git push --set-upstream remote-name local-branch-name:remote-branch-name`.

Ping. Does this have a chance of getting into 3.1?
