Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

you added some junk files which seem to be totally unrelated for this change:
- 0001-first-version.patch
- org.eclipse.egit.core.test/Localorg.eclipse.egit.core--All-Tests.launch
- org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/org.eclipse.egit.ui--All tests A).launch
- temp.java
