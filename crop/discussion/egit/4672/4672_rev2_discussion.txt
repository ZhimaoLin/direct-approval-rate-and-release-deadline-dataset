DESCRIPTION

Make "Select Repository" wizard page accessible from the outside.

Third-party projects building upon EGit should be able to re-use EGit's
select repository wizard page, as this enables them to have all
repository management functionality (adding, cloning, selecting) built
into their wizard with nearly zero effort.

I am not convinced that we want to make this API

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/IGitSelectRepositoryWizardPage.java -> missing license header

Patch Set 2:

so would there be another way to do the same thing without
 1) copy & paste the already existing code from EGit
 2) access internal packages of EGit (which of course works but is ugly)
 3) rewrite functionality from scratch that is already there and working.

i know, the select repository page is not sooo extremely complicated, but still...

it would be great if third-party developers (i, for example ;) ) could re-use things that already exist in egit without hacks. that would also enable us to benefit from bug fixes and enhancements in those parts.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

i re-implemented all i need on my own side. of course this is some code duplication, and make it less future-save, but now i don't use internal things anymore.
