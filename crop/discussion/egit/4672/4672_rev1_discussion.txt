DESCRIPTION

Make "Select Repository" wizard page accessible from the outside.

Third-party projects building upon EGit should be able to re-use EGit's
select repository wizard page, as this enables them to have all
repository management functionality (adding, cloning, selecting) built
into their wizard with nearly zero effort.
