Patch Set 2:

(1 comment)

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, the current commit message on patch set 4 is fine.

Matthias evidently had some old unpublished draft comments on patch set 2, and when he left his new comment about the tests on patch set 4, the new Gerrit version automatically also published these very old comments.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Hi. The commit message, you are referring to, is years old. The current commit message should be ok.
Is there a need / a way to fix the old commit?
