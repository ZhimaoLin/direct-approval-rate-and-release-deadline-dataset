Patch Set 10: Code-Review+2

Manually tested failing extension creations (by writing a little plugin that contributes via special-purpose failing IExecutableExtensionFactory classes: throwing an exception, or returning an object of a wrong class). Found that the error messages could be improved to help identify the wrong extension (not just the bundle it comes from).

Works nicely now, even when provider creation fails, or providers fail or return null.

A pity we can't mock this extension creation...
