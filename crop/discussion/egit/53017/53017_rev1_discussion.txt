DESCRIPTION

Fixed double size calculation on selecting new diff

Do not call resizeCommentAndDiffScrolledComposite() from
controlResized() if we are already during calculation. This halves
execution time. 

Additionally don't call both commentAndDiffComposite.setSize(size) and
commentAndDiffScrolledComposite.setMinSize(size) - last one is enough
for scrollable content update.
