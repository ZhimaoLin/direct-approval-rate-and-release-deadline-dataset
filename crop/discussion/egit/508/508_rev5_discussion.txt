DESCRIPTION

Make tracing 3.4 compatible and plug-in local

Sharing trace classes between plug-ins
is bad, as the OSGI tracing infrastructure
will write the ID of plug-in that exposes
the trace class into the trace file.
Instead the ID of the plug-in that is
writing the trace should be written.
This is achieved by obtaining a separate
Location for each plug-in.
In order to achieve 3.4. compatibility,
a temporary trace implementation using
System.out is used.

Patch Set 5: No score

Worked in cosmetics and changed the implementation to use the ILog interface instead of System.out. Thanks Robin for pointing this out.
