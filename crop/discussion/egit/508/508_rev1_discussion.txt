DESCRIPTION

Make tracing plug-in local

Sharing trace classes between plug-ins
is bad, as the OSGI tracing infrastructure
will write the ID of plug-in that exposes
the trace class into the trace file.
Instead the ID of the plug-in that is
writing the trace should be written.
This is achieved by obtaining a separate
Location for each plug-in.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Also I'd prefer that you format the message with slightly longer lines. Please tell if the dialoge suggests this line length in your Eclipse. In my Eclipse, breaking the lines within the dialog it would look like below:

Line:403, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/Activator.java -> Method removed in next patch set. I did not change the project settings whatsoever, but since this (in 3.5) overrides an interface method, it was not marked as error.

Our project settings should give you an error here.
