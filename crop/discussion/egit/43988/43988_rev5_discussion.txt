DESCRIPTION

Wizard invoking automated import

This contributes a new Git import wizard, reusing most pages of the
current Git import wizard, but delegating the actual import actions to
the more intuitive import framework currently incubating at e4.
The benefit of this new import framework is to detect and configure
projects automatically, without user having to understand or know what
kind of project they're working on.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

* transformed new bundle into a fragment
* fixed maven build (had to move the new fragment to the root folder for local maven build
* adjusted preferences to use egit standards
* export new package and mark internal
* externalize texts in manifest

I didn't yet succeed to install the new fragment into Mars M5 committer package, probably something is wrong with dependencies

Patch Set 5:

In order to install it, you need to first install the importer framework from http://download.eclipse.org/e4/snapshots/org.eclipse.e4.ui . This won't be part of any EPP package for Mars.

Patch Set 5:

then we should add an experimental feature which helps to do that in one step, maybe in another change

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

Yes, I believe it would fit in another change.
What would be interesting would be to have the EGit repository referencing the e4.ui repository, so p2 would be able to resolve dependencies.
