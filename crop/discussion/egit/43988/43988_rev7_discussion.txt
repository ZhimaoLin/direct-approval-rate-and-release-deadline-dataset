DESCRIPTION

Wizard invoking automated import

This contributes a new Git import wizard, reusing most pages of the
current Git import wizard, but delegating the actual import actions to
the more intuitive import framework currently incubating at e4.
The benefit of this new import framework is to detect and configure
projects automatically, without user having to understand or know what
kind of project they're working on.

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.repository/category.xml -> this also didn't help to reference the e4 p2 repo

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer/META-INF/p2.inf -> tried this to add a reference to the e4 repo, the touchpoint ends up in content.xml of the egit repository but it doesn't work ;-(

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.repository/category.xml -> Unfortunately, Tycho doesn't support it yet: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=453708

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer/META-INF/p2.inf -> I believe it's because touchpoints are only applied while installing the IU, whereas what we want is something that is applied before installation, while resolving dependencies.

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer/META-INF/p2.inf -> I found the tycho bug for this:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=453708

it's possible now to add referenced sites in category.xml but there is still a problem with Tycho. So for now I think you will need a workaround like Mickael's mojo or similar.

the approach with the touchpoint doesn't work because it comes too late in the process (only when installing the IU, but it needs to be in place when resolving already)
