Why is GitTestCase changed here?

Patch Set 1: No score

As I explained on egit-dev list, conventional maven project layout results in the following repository nesting (I hope formatting will be readable)

parallelip-egit <= egit source tree root
  /.git
  /org.eclipse.egit.core.test
    /target
      /work
        /data     <= test workspace
          /.git
          /.metadata
          /Project-1

So if we keep nested repo check in the test, then we either need to move test workspace out of the build tree (where to?) or change the code not to look above test workspace root. Personally, I tentatively prefer second approach. Several maven operations, like "mvn clean" assume conventional layout and would have to be reimplemented. At the same time, I am too new to git, so I am willing to implement whatever egit developers think is correct here.

Ok, but update the commit message to explain it right there. You should probably drop the check method too, unless someone is actually using it. It's farly new so there is little legacy and it should be replaced by a mechanism like Git's GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES.

Robin, what about a half baked patch to implement an environment variable named GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES which you've mentioned in http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg00277.html? Are there any progress?
