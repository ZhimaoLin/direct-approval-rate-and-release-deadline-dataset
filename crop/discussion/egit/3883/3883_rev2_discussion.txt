Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Thanks, Benny!

One small remark: It is good practice to answer the inline comments whenever you have reacted to them. In this case you could have just have added a reply 'done'. Then it is easier for a reviewer to see if every comment was addressed with the new patch set.
