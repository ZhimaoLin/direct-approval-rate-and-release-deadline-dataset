Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I think it should only be visible like other "repository-level" actions such as push. When files are selected, it shouldn't be available, as that could be understood to only stash the selected files.

For this, I think it has to be defined in org.eclipse.ui.menus.

Line:37, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/StashCreateActionHandler.java -> Shouldn't we check if the repository contains any changes or untracked files using IndexDiffCache here?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Idea: Now that we have a viewer for stashes, how about making the menu like this (and also change the repo view menu to that):

* Stashes  (submenu)
  * Stash Changes...
  * ---
  * 0: work on foo
  * 1: try fixing bar

When there are no stashed changes, it could look like this:

* Stashes  (submenu)
  * Stash Changes...
  * ---
  * (no stashed changes)  (disabled)

This way, while the user clicks on "Stash Changes...", it's already shown where the stashed changes will be accessible. This is currently still hidden in the repo view.
