DESCRIPTION

Avoid opening dialogs from push/fetch background jobs

Doing so quite frequently led to UI deadlocks when modal dialogs were
active when the job's result dialog popped up. Instead use the progress
framework's mechanisms to give the user a possibility to open a job's
result dialog at his leisure. Thus there is no danger of conflicting
with any modal shells.

Push and fetch UI tests adapted to the new behavior.
