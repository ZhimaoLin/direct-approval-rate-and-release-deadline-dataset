DESCRIPTION

Avoid opening dialogs from push/fetch background jobs

Doing so quite frequently led to UI deadlocks when modal dialogs were
active when the job's result dialog popped up. Instead use the progress
framework's mechanisms to give the user a possibility to open a job's
result dialog at his leisure. Thus there is no danger of conflicting
with any modal shells.

Push and fetch UI tests adapted to the new behavior.

Line:116, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchOperationUI.java -> I see no reason for this to be a WorkspaceJob. Fetching should affect only the repository and not change any workspace resources.

This was originally a plain Job; it got changed to a WorkspaceJob in a mass-mutation in commit 7866980.

Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/jobs/RepositoryJob.java -> An alternative might be KEEPONE_PROPERTY here (and adapting the belongsTo() method) to keep only the last job and result.

Line:55, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/jobs/RepositoryJob.java -> The text set on the status is taken as the link text in the job's entry in the progress view. With Status.OK_STATUS, we'd get links reading "OK". Therefore construct our own OK status with a more meaningful text.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> There may be other places in EGit where we have such background jobs. PullOperationUI looks as if it does that, too, but has logic that is quite different.
