DESCRIPTION

Avoid opening dialogs from push/fetch background jobs

Doing so quite frequently led to UI deadlocks when modal dialogs were
active when the job's result dialog popped up. Instead use the progress
framework's mechanisms to give the user a possibility to open a job's
result dialog at his leisure. Thus there is no danger of conflicting
with any modal shells.

Push and fetch UI tests adapted to the new behavior.

Line:44, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/jobs/RepositoryJob.java -> The return value of run() must be non null. This can be here Status.CANCEl or something, but not null.

Line:44, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/jobs/RepositoryJob.java -> In theory. The Job framework explicitly deals with misbehaved jobs that do return null.

I had at first @NonNull IStatus performJob(), but that led to warnings in implementations of performJob() because Status.OK_STATUS is not xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:44, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/jobs/RepositoryJob.java -> No, this is not a theory, it is an API contract we must fullfill here. The return value form a Job.run() method must be non null. Annotation is a different story, but the return value is not.
