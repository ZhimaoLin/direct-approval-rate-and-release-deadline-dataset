Just some nits, otherwise looks good. Please fix them locally, amend your commit and push again.

Line:190, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/op/CloneOperationTest.java -> Isn't it possible to call `clonedGit.close()` directly?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please remove the "." at the end, and add an empty line after this. Git commit message style is to have the first line be like an e-mail subject, then an empty line and then paragraphs of text.
