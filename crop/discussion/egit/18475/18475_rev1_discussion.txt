DESCRIPTION

Remove Compare With > History...

It's confusing because it just opens the history view (which can also be
done using Show In > History and Team > Show in History) and then leaves
it to the user to find out how to do a compare. Compare With > Commit...
offers a better alternative by listing the commits in a dialog.
