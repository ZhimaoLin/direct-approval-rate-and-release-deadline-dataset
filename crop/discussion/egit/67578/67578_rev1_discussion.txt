Patch Set 1:

I had thought about that, and decided against it. If a user wants that, he can customize the label decoration.

I usually have many projects from a few repositories in my workspace. I don't want to see the last commit message on all of them. Seeing the same message repeated on many projects is just visual clutter. Besides, I don't know how costly it is to parse the head commit to get the short message, but I suspect it may be non-negligible.

On submodules and nested repos, it makes sense to show that by default; those typically won't appear in multiple places in the navigator, and it helps emphasize the difference to top-level repositories.

I'd rather see this decoration business refactored such that the DecoratableResourceAdapter knows the variables that'll be used and computes only the items needed. If the format doesn't reference the short_message variable, there's no need to compute its value...
