Line:279, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/ReflogView.java -> Isn't this a bit boring? 

You could display "You" when the entry matches the committer and the full name only when it it doesn't?

I'm not sure why you want this, though there are rare cases where you want the changer. 

The timestamp I fully understand.
