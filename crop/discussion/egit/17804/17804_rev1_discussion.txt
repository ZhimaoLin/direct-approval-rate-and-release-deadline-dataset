Hm, I missed that the other fix breaks showing the styled text (commit title in grey besides branches) in the branch selection dialog.

At the moment it looks to me that we can have either styled text support or tooltip support, but not both. I'll look into how to fix this in platform UI.

Ok, the newest patch set of Ia644bb62adfed327d4988ee07dc4652d5d6be58b now fixes both problems. So if the above is submitted, this change can be abandoned.

Abandoned

Abandoned as it is no longer needed after the other change was merged.
