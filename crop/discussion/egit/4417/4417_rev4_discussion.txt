DESCRIPTION

Restrict synchronization cache updates to specific resources

If a synchronization operation is only asking a specific set of
resources to be updated, only that particular set of resources
should be filtered out for an update of the synchronization
cache. This removes the need to walk the entire tree when the
user has only made changes to a small number of resources.
