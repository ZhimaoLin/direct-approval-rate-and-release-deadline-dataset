DESCRIPTION

Restrict synchronization cache updates to specific resources

If a synchronization operation is only asking a specific set of
resources to be updated, only that particular set of resources
should be filtered out for an update of the synchronization
cache. This removes the need to walk the entire tree when the
user has only made changes to a small number of resources.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Now it works perfectly for use case described earlier. Apart from that use case I've test it on my small testing project which have .git folder in his root (eg TestProject/.git) and in such situation sync view isn't refreshed after save action.

To solve this probably we should perform full cache refresh if one of resource repository relative path is empty. Or somehow figure out that git repository is inside changed project.
