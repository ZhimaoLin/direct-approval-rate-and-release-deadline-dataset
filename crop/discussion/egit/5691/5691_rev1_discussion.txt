DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Do not store the RevWalk as a field in GitHistoryPage

When the history is redrawn a new RevWalk is created and configured
corresponding to the settings of the history view. This RevWalk is used
in the scheduled GenerateHistoryJob.

The RevWalk was stored in a field in the GitHistoryPage, although it is
not a property of such a Page. This can potentially lead to problem, and
indeed it caused bug 374675 which was fixed by
3604b5cd5fbf6ac354bc2a247115df7eade81959.

By passing it as a parameter the scope of the RevWalk instance is made
clearer.

Line:1489, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> This TODO is no longer possible now that the walk is no longer stored, right? -> Remove

Line:1768, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Would be nice if the argument was named the same everywhere (newWalk vs currentWalk). Maybe just walk?

Line:1489, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> That's right. 

I hope that Matthias' Change Change-Id: I99c34657e6c5485a1303a13c4126b0049ea350d9 will improve response time of reading history, thus we would not need other optimizations anymore.

Line:1768, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Done
