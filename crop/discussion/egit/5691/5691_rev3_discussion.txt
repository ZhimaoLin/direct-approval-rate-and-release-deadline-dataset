DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Do not store the RevWalk as a field in GitHistoryPage

When the history is redrawn a new RevWalk is created and configured
corresponding to the settings of the history view. This RevWalk is used
in the scheduled GenerateHistoryJob.

The RevWalk was stored in a field in the GitHistoryPage, although it is
not a property of such a Page. This can potentially lead to problem, and
indeed it caused bug 374675 which was fixed by
3604b5cd5fbf6ac354bc2a247115df7eade81959.

By passing it as a parameter the scope of the RevWalk instance is made
clearer.

Line:1531, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Is hasWalk really needed? It's initially set to false when GitHistoryPage is instantiated, but after the first time the history is displayed, the condition never changes (it's never set to false again).

In the initial case, headChanged should be true, because currentHeadId is null after instantiation, right? If so, the hasWalk condition is redundant.
