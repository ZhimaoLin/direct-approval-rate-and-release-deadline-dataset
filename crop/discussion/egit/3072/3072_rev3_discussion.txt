DESCRIPTION

Add Page for Gerrit push configuration to Clone Wizard

If fetch URI used for cloning is using HTTP(S) we choose the same
protocol for pushing, Gerrit's path prefix for smart HTTP is handled
automatically. Otherwise SSH protocol is proposed for pushing changes
to the Gerrit review queue.
