Patch Set 3:

Fixed the following issue:

setup the following tree in the working tree:
src src/a/b/test/C.java (untracked) src/a/b/test2/D.java (committed)
this yields wrong state for folder test2 src/a/b/test2/ (untracked -> this is wrong)
when C.java is added (new file) test2 has correct decoration (committed)
