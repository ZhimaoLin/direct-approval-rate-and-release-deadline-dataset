DESCRIPTION

Don't provide repository adapter to external resources

GitFlowAdapterFactory should not adapt links to external files (not
managed by git) to git repositories. This causes test failures in
LinkedResourcesTest, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/51157/.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Looks good to me.
Gitflow behavior seems unchanged.
I did not test linked resources, though.
