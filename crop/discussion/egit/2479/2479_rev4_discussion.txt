Patch Set 4: Unclean IP, do not check in

Looking better but this requires a CQ now.

The CQ approved for Change I56a1d4cd5078240a9bb518d7991d01f033a0fd51 can't also apply to this change. Every change which changes more than 250 LOC must go through IP review individually, for each one a dedicated CQ must be filed and approved. See [1].

I don't get where these actions are used (didn't find them in EGit UI). How can your implementation be tested? How about an automated test ?

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> I don't get why any EGit action label has to start with "EGit: " this looks very weird
