DESCRIPTION

Revert "Remove no longer needed org.eclipse.egit.psf-feature".

This reverts commit 70c892198c8519422abec216c505c28523e72a2c.
The psf feature was removed because egit 2.2 no longer supports eclipse
3.6, however it can still be required by certain third party plugins and
applications. Removing it now may prevent upgrading to egit 2.2, as
reported in the mailing list with SpringSource STS/GGTS:
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg02925.html
Eventually STS/GGTS will remove such dependency (see
https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-3078) but in the
meantime we should make sure people can upgrade to egit 2.2.
