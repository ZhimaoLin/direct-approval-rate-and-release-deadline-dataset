DESCRIPTION

Reorganize Git Repositories View tree

1, Split the "Branches" node into a "Local" and "Remote"
part
2. add a "Tags" node to separate them from the branches
3. show the full name of the reference behind HEAD
4. cleanup context menus (in particular, do not allow
to checkout tags, as this is currently not supported)
5. Better icons (taken from CVS UI).

tried this change, this looks much better organized :)

for HEAD you give the full ref:
  refs/remotes/origin/master
for other remote branches you leave out the refs/remotes
  e.g. origin/stable-0.7
this looks inconsistent to me
maybe the remote HEAD could be also marked with the little
check mark like for local branches ?

One of the first requirements was to show the "shortened" name for branches, e.g. instead of refs/heads/master just master in order to imprvoe readability of the tree. This confused people because there could be refs/heasds/abc and refs/remotes/abc (and perhaps also a refs/tags/abc) which would result in three nodes with the same text. Thus separation by the remote/local/tag nodes. However, in case of showing the reference HEAD points to, we need to use the full name to avoid ambiguities.

What is the remote HEAD?

Patch Set 1:

remote HEAD:
search for set-hard in http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html

According to that section a remote HEAD specifies the default branch for the named remote. If you leave out the branch in a remote ref the default branch is assumed. E.g. "if the default branch for origin is set to master, then origin may be specified wherever you would normally specify origin/master"
