DESCRIPTION

Reorganize Git Repositories View tree

1, Split the "Branches" node into a "Local" and "Remote"
part
2. add a "Tags" node to separate them from the branches
3. show the full name of the reference behind HEAD
4. add a "Symbolic References"node to show
other symbolic references
5. cleanup context menus (in particular, do not allow
to checkout tags, as this is currently not supported)
6. Better icons (taken from CVS UI).

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

HEAD is now redundantly shown twice in the repository view, once immediately before the branches node and another time under symbolic references.

Please do proper error handling right from the beginning, printStackTrace() is a hack.

Line:132, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewContentProvider.java -> Why don't you immediately do proper error handling ?
