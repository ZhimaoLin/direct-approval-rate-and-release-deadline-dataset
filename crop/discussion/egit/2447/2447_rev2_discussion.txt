DESCRIPTION

Add a "Fetch Change from Gerrit" action

The action is available from the Repository view (on Repository nodes)
as well as via Team > Remote > Fetch a change from Gerrit.

The user needs to select a URI (the dropdown is populated from all
URIs available from all remotes of the current Repository) and a
change. There is a content assist for the change. By clicking
CTRL+Space, the user can see a list of changes and select one.

The user can also paste the change in the form

refs/changes/<nn>/<nnnn>/<nn> from the Gerrit WebUI or type it in
manually if they know the specifics...

There are several options available to perform after fetch was done:
creation of a local branch (default), creation of a tag, checking
out FETCH_HEAD, or doing nothing else (just updating FETCH_HEAD).

If a branch or tag is to be created, a name is suggested in some
pseudo-hierarchical format ("change/<nnnn>/<nn>" which comes in handy
when the user activates the "hierarchical branch layout" in the
Repositories view)...

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful; IP review completed

- retargeted for stable-0.11
- rebased
- added missing license headers
- changed keyboard shortcut to explicit CTRL+SPACE to make this also work on Mac where M1+SPACE  translates to COMMAND+SPACE which clashes with spotlight shortcut
- changed to reverse sort order of gerrit changes since the newest ones have the highest number so this should reduce the need for scrolling
- improved order of actions in menu

I'm pushing this in for now. There's a bit of work we can do to improve the UI and code but this is OK for now.

Line:355, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> This should be refactored into a command and out of the wizard.
