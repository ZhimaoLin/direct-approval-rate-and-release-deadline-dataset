DESCRIPTION

Trigger a merge commit 

Allows to commit when merge conflicts are resolved.
To avoid unnecessary complexity file selection is switched
off in the commit dialog. Workspace selection is not
taken into account.

Uses JGit's commit command which handles determination
of parents and resetting repo state.

The merge message is preset in the dialog. No addititional
hints are presented (like when using the command line).
