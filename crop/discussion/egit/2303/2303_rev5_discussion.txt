DESCRIPTION

[sync] Next package of performance improvements

The NonIgnoderFilter was removed from TreeWalk used in
GitResourceVariantTree, since there we only work on data from the
repository with shouldn't include ignored files.

In GitModelCommit.hashCode() instead of calculating object hash we
simply reuse hash code of wrapped RevCommit object.

Update UI status every tenth file read by
GitFolderResourceVariant.getMembers().
