DESCRIPTION

[sync] Next package of performance improvements

It seams that IWorkspaceRoot.getContainerForLocation() and
IWorkspaceRoot.getFileForLocation() are very expensive therefore there
were changed by IWorkspaceRoot.getProject()/IWorkspaceRoot.getFolder()
and IWorkspaceRoot.getFile().

The NonIgnoderFilter were removed from TreeWalk used in
GitResourceVariantTree, since there we only work on data from the
repository with shouldn't include ignored files.

In GitModelCommit.hashCode() we instead of calculating object hash we
simply reuse hash code of wrapped RevCommit object.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This looks wrong to me.  You can't replace code like:
  workspaceRoot.getContainerForLocation(location);	
with:
  resource = workspaceRoot.getFile(location.makeRelativeTo(workspaceRo
ot.getLocation()));

You are making implicit assumptions about how resources are layed out in the filesystem relative to the workspace.  It's important to remember that IProjects may live anywhere on disk, and IResources in general may be links to anywhere on disk.  As a result when trying to resolve an filesystem location to a workpace full path, you must use the workspace methods #{get|find}{Files|Containers}ForLocation.

Performance of this has been improved in 3.7.  If it's still suboptimal, please file a bug against core.resources.

something is wrong here, look at the changes when synchronizing jgit master with stable-0.7, I doubt that the changes displayed are correct. Almost every change claims to change pom.xml ...
