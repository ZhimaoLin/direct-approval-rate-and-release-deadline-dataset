DESCRIPTION

Initially disable buttons in branch selection dialog

The enablement of the buttons in the branch selection dialog depends on
the highlighted initial branch. But if there is no initially highlighted
branch, then the delete and rename buttons should be disabled (as it
already happens for the okay button).

The buttons will automatically be enabled if there is some initial
branch highlighting, as that is evaluated afterwards (see existing
comment in line 327).
