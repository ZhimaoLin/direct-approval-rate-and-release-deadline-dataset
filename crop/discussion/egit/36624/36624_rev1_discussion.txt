DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Show date columns in local time zone, original on hover

The local time zone makes sense to the user as they can compare the
different commit dates much easier, and it is what is shown in other
places of the UI as well.

On hover, the full date in original time zone is shown in ISO format.
