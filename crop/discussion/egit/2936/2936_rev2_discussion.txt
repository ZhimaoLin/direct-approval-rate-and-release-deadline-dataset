DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  0.12|git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git|master|org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

No UI interaction has been implemented yet.

Patch Set 2:

Mykola: I squashed your change about the pom into this one, so that we can have a clean build here, I hope that's ok.

Also added a version string at the front of the reference string (as CVS and SVN do).

Line:261, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> And because it's default is the home directory, i always set that path to my folder, where all Git repositories are and should be located. I don't clone them into the workspace because of some bugs with m2eclipse. Nevertheless what the default is, i think, we should either respect and use that option wherever it's possible, or remove it. If there is that option, and some part of EGit uses it, and other parts don't use it, it would be confusing for the users, and that's something we should avoid.

Line:261, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> That is exactly why I placed a TODO here. +1 for asking user where to clone but -1 from implementation PoV ;-)

Line:4, egit.psf -> May be itt would be better to start from scratch? It should be '1.0' as it's actualy the first version of reference's format.

Line:261, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> I already raised the issue that the home directory is a bad default on another change, maybe that needs to be discussed on the mailing list.

Ok, so it should show a dialog here, similar to the clone dialog (but only once, not for each repository). I'll do that for the next patch set.

Line:4, egit.psf -> What do you mean, start from scratch?

I thought maybe it should correspond to the EGit version. But 1.0 makes sense, I'll change it.
