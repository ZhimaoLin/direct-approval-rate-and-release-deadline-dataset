DESCRIPTION

Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  1.0|git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git|master|org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I have 2 points:

- It would be nice if the cloned repository were added to the Repositories View automatically
- Choosing a different username for the clone operation would also be nice. If i export a Team project set, all repository urls contain my username for the repositories (since we have no anonymous access). So everybody have to edit the psf-file manually and add their usernames.

Patch Set 6:

1. Hm, they're not? They should be, will have a look later.
2. That can be a problem, depending on the URLs used. Unfortunately, we can't add custom UI to the import/export process.

Patch Set 6:

I just did a quick try, and the cloned repository wasn't added to the view. I will try it another time, when i'm at home, my business notebook is not the best one.
