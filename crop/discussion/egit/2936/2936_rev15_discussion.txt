DESCRIPTION

Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  1.0,git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git,master,org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Add the repository to the Repositories View.
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

Patch Set 15:

By the way, epl-v10.html was copied from another feature (don't know if egit or egit.mylyn), so they also should be cleaned up.

Another thought: Should we somewhere document/add a TODO that we can delete the psf-feature as soon as Eclipse 3.7 is our minimal requirement?

Patch Set 15:

I pushed change I65d7607528e29330144fcef0e9b7ec23ea1b4787 for review to fix the other license files.

I filed bug 354300 to track that we should delete the psf-feature when our minimum requirement becomes 3.7
