DESCRIPTION

Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  1.0,git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git,master,org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Add the repository to the Repositories View.
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

Patch Set 12:

Can you extract ProjectReference as separate class? I would need this for my work (or should i push a new patchset with my suggestions)?

That's no problem. If it would be discarded, then i would have to write something own, now i just used it to spare my efforts (and to bring my other features into a runnable state).

Patch Set 12: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I tried rebasing this to current master but then project set export doesn't work anymore, it's then always exporting (using Indigo workbench) :

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<psf version="2.0">
<provider id="org.eclipse.egit.core.GitProvider"/>
</psf>

without rebasing it works fine. I couldn't spot the reason. Could you rebase and fix this problem then I will start IP review to get this change approved and will accept it. The remaining issues you listed in bug 296082 can be done in subsequent changes.
