DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git|master|org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

No UI interaction has been implemented yet.

Patch Set 1:

There are some TODOs in the code where I need some advise and I don't know if the org.eclipse.egit.psf-feature works like this.

Line:253, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> The default repository folder path from the Team preferences would be better (and would be the path that i would expect).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

A project reference string in the project set file should support versioning of the reference's format like:

    git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git|1.0|master|org.eclipse.egit

Line:253, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> Do you mean the one under "Git"? I disagree, because that preference defaults to the home directory. And the CVS project set import also imports into the workspace.
