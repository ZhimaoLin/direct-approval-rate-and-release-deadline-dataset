DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  1.0|git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git|master|org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

No UI interaction has been implemented yet.

Patch Set 3:

Guys, I need some help here with the clone destination directory.

The problem is this: GitProjectSetCapability is in core (not ui), because it is configured in GitProviderType, which in turn is configured in the "org.eclipse.team.core.repository" extension point in core/plugin.xml.

So showing a dialog is not possible from GitProjectSetCapability, right?

Ok, so maybe we can just use the "default_repository_dir" preference? The problem with this is that this preference is also in ui. Can we move it to core? I don't know, it's used in GitPreferenceRoot via the preference store.
