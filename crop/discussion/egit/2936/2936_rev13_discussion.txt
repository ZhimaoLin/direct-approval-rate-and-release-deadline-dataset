DESCRIPTION

Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Ace Duncan in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  1.0,git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git,master,org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Add the repository to the Repositories View.
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

Patch Set 13:

Rebased and confirmed to work in Helios here.

Probably the problem was that in 97fa14744a9d9ad8983975d09d9a44fdb04946ab, org.eclipse.egit.core.internal.GitRepositoryProviderType was added in org.eclipse.egit.core/plugin.xml. In earlier patches on this change, it the class was org.eclipse.egit.core.GitProviderType.
