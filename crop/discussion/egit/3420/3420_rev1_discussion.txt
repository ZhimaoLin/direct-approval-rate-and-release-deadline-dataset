DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable SynchronizeViewGitChangeSetModelTest without setFocus

In 19a693daeb5c3894c3d8ab624d70932dc40aa093, Mathias removed the calls
to setFocus, in order to not bring the window to the front.

Because we just want to make sure that the StyledText is enabled, we can
also use waitUntil(Conditions.widgetIsEnabled(styledText)).
