DESCRIPTION

Change the icons for clone, add, and create repositories

Those icons in the repositories view's toolbar were just too
cluttered, and the small text didn't work well. Simplify the
graphics re-using the cloud metaphor as suggested on bugzilla.

Patch Set 1:

if not looking carefully these 3 icons look very similar (especially add and clone since the shape of a folder is similar to the cloud shape) since they all are pretty yellowish and they are lined up next to each other in the toolbar. Could we use a different color for some element in each of these icons to facilitate differentiating them ?
