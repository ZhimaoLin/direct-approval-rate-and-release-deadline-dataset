Patch Set 1:

I think that also hashCode and equals should be added into GitRemoteResource since SyncInfo.equals try to compare given instances of IResourceVariants

Patch Set 1:

Both concrete subclasses of the abstract class GitRemoteResource implement equals() and hashCode(), hence I don't see what's missing here. Do you want me to pull up the implementation to the abstract super class ?

Patch Set 1:

Damn, I didn't spot that ... I've should add abstract hashCode () and equals() method to abstract GitRemoteResource to keep it more explicit but this is different case ;)
