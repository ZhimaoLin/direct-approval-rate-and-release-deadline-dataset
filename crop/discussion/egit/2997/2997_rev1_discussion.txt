DESCRIPTION

Enable cherry-pick conflict resolution

When a cherry-pick fails due to conflicts, the user has to resolve the
situation. With this change, the repository is set to the "Conflicts"
state and the merge tool is enabled.

Also, the original commit message and author is preset in the commit
dialog. The message includes a "Conflicts" section as in C git.

This depends on JGit change I947967fdc2f1d55016c95106b104c2afcc9797a1.
