DESCRIPTION

Fix IAE in DiffViewer.refreshStyleRanges for binary change

The problem was that the underlying document did not yet contain the
text that the style ranges were referring to.

In DiffEditorPage#formatDiff, the job calls
DiffStyleRangeFormatter#write, which flushes the output stream at the
end. So implement flush in DocumentOutputStream to make sure the
document is complete.
