DESCRIPTION

Perform synchronization for logical models in Commit and History View

When comparing files in the history (or commit) view which are part of a
logical model all relevant changes to all relevant files must be viewed
together. Thus a synchronization will be performed if the system is
capable of detecting a logical model that is based on multiple
resources.
