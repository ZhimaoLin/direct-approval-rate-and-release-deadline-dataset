DESCRIPTION

WIP: Git 2.5 worktree: accept working-tree created with native git with
"git worktree add"

JGit change "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/" adds the evaluation
of ".git" file with "gitdir" link to worktree and evaluates commondir.

With this change EGit should not check or expect the file "config" is
located in GIT_DIR, because in case of worktree it's located in
GIT_COMMON_DIR.

Generall question is why should EGit check the existence of some files
located in protected ".git" folder (database)? This task should be done
by JGit, e.g. validate the mapped repository:
* adapted GitProjectData-map() to use
RepositoryCache.FileKey.isGitRepository()
* adapted RepositorySearchDialog+findGitDirsRecursive() to use
RepositoryCache.FileKey.resolve() directly with same logic

Line:618, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> remove this comment, it doesn't add value

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> *why is this a WIP ?
* this line is too wide

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> this change already makes sense without support for git worktree

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> this is true

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> you don't need to describe what can already be seen from the diff
