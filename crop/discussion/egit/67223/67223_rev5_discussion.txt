DESCRIPTION

Git 2.5 worktree: accept working-tree created with native git

JGit change "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/" adds the evaluation
of ".git" file with "gitdir" link to worktree and evaluates commondir.

With this change EGit should not check or expect the file "config" is
located in GIT_DIR, so this task should be done by JGit.
