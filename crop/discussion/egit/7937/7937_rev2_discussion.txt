DESCRIPTION

RFC Add branch and state info to commit dialog

One cannot always see this information in the UI, so add
it to the commit dialog. Also added state, because that is
relevant.

I intentional skipped some the i18n stuff for the draft

So, as this is an RFC, have you seen my comment about adding this to the title instead? Thoughts?
