DESCRIPTION

RFC Add branch and state info to commit dialog

One cannot always see this information in the UI, so add
it to the commit dialog. Also added state, because that is
relevant.

I intentional skipped some the i18n stuff for the draft

Patch Set 1:

The information could also be added to the dialog title. It's currently "Commit Changes to Git Repository", but it could be e.g. "Commit on master (Merged)". This way no additional vertical space would be needed.
