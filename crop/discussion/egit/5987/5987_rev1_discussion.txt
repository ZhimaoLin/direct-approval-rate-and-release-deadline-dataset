DESCRIPTION

Do not run tests using maven-surefire-plugin in OSGi environment

Running plain junit tests in an OSGi environment using
maven-surefire-plugin isn't guaranteed to work as split packages can
lead to signing errors when the maven-surefire-plugin loads classes not
respecting OSGi class loading rules. Hence run the few plain junit
tests as part of the swtbot tests which are run on top of Eclipse
platform's OSGi runtime.
