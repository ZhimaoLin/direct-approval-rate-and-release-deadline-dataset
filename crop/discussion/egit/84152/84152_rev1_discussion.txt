DESCRIPTION

Trim git config keys

When copy-pasting git config values from websites it can easily happen
that they contain leading or trailing whitespace. Leading whitespace
breaks the git config parser of egit, leading to exceptions on many user
actions.

The value part has not been trimmed, since leading and trailing
whitespace is legal in the INI file format and I'm not aware of
additional restrictions in the git config format.
