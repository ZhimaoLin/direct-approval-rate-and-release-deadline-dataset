DESCRIPTION

Add support for git variables in launchers

This adds git_dir, git_work_tree, git_repo_relative_path and
git_branch. The all work on the selected or named resource, i.e.

$|git_branch] would return the current branch in the (first)
selected project. $|git_branch:org.eclipse.jgit/.project] would
return the current branch of the main jgit repository in the
workbspace.

The code to pick the selected resource is stolen from Chris
Aniszczyk's commit on a similar topic.
