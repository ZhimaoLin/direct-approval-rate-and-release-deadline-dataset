DESCRIPTION

Add support for git variables in launchers

This adds git_dir, git_work_tree, git_repo_relative_path and 
git_branch. They all work on the selected or named resource, i.e.
${git_branch} would return the current branch in the (first)
selected project. ${git_branch:org.eclipse.jgit/.project} would
return the current branch of the main JG	it repository in the
workspace.

The code to pick the selected resource is stolen from Chris
Aniszczyk's commit on a similar topic.
