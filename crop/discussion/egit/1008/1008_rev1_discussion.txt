DESCRIPTION

Show truncated commit ids when in comparison view

When comparing two resources, the full commit identifier is shown.
This is generally too long (and unnecessary) so truncate this as we
are doing elsewhere.

Make a helper method to return that truncated form so that we can
change the parameterisation if necessary (and/or a preference).
Leave it private in this class until otherwise needed.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Tested with Eclipse SDK Version: 3.5.0, Build id: I20090611-1540.

Alex, you are not using commit-msg hook [1] and that's why your commit has no Change-Id, right?

Works fine.

The commit-msg hook does not yet work with EGit, therefore we do not yet require a Change-Id in the first patch set.
