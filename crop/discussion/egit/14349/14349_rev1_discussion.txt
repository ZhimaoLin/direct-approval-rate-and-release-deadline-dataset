DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Fix deletion of files when dragging from Navigator view

In NavigatorDragAdapter, used by the Navigator view, dragFinished
deletes the dragged resources when the operation was DND.DROP_MOVE.

This resulted in the dragged files being deleted when dropping onto the
"Unstaged Changes" or "Staged Changes" in the Staging view.

This was the case even before bug 385412 introduced the possibility to
stage via drag and drop from Package Explorer.

The reason that this bug didn't occur with the Package Explorer is
because it doesn't delete files after DND.DROP_MOVE (which seems like a
more sane behavior).
