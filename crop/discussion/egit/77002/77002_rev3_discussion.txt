DESCRIPTION

Keyboard shortcuts for the rebase interactive view

As suggested in the enhancement request:
* 'e' -- edit
* 'f' -- fixup
* 'p' -- pick
* 'r' -- reword
* 's' -- squash
* DEL -- skip
* Ctrl/Cmd-Arrow_Up and Ctrl/Cmd-Arrow_Down for moving lines up/down.

Shortcuts are displayed in the context menu and in the tooltips of the
toolbar items. Toolbar items give back the focus to the commit table to
enable seamless working with toolbars, context menu, or keyboard.

These actions are a bit special since they react on unmodified
keystrokes. At least on Mac and on GTK there is some navigation
behavior on plain keystrokes: when a key is pressed, the selection
jumps to the next row that has a cell that starts with that key.
On GTK, there's even a text input pop-up that steals the focus in
this case. Since our menu also reacts on unmodified keys, it is
rather confusing if the selection changes when one hits a key not
handled here. Disable this, but allow normal table/tree navigation
keys to pass through. The "prefix navigation" is still available
by typing upper-case letters (shift + key).
