DESCRIPTION

Keyboard shortcuts for the rebase interactive view

As suggested in the enhancement request:
* 'e' -- edit
* 'f' -- fixup
* 'p' -- pick
* 'r' -- reword
* 's' -- squash
* DEL -- skip
* Ctrl/Cmd-Arrow_Up and Ctrl/Cmd-Arrow_Down for moving lines up/down.

Shortcuts are displayed in the context menu and in the tooltips of the
toolbar items.

These actions are a bit special since they react on unmodified
keystrokes. At least on Mac and on GTK there is some navigation
behavior on plain keystrokes: when a key is pressed, the selection
jumps to the next row that has a cell that starts with that key.
On GTK, there's even a text input pop-up that steals the focus in
this case. Since our menu also reacts on unmodified keys, it is
rather confusing if the selection changes when one hits a key not
handled here. Disable this, but allow normal table/tree navigation
keys to pass through. The "prefix navigation" is still available
by typing upper-case letters (shift + key).

Not sure it _is_ a bug. Testing on my Mac seems to indicate that this is some kind of accessibility or built-in keyboard navigation thing. It also happens in the project explorer, and also outside of Eclipse in the Mac's Finder. In a tree control on Mac, typing a character navigates to the next row that has a cell starting with that character. And if you type fast enough to the row (cell) starting with the typed character sequence.

I have now disabled this in the rebase interactive view. BTW, that focus thief (text pop-up) on GTK appears to be non-functional. One can enter text, but then nothing happens.

Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/PlanContextMenuAction.java -> On Mac, this produces U+2326 (decimal 8998), which then gets set as accelerator instead of SWT.DEL (127). The accelerator is shown nicely in the menu.

On GTK, we get "Delete", which indeed results in 127 being set as accelerator. Another bug in SWT on GTK apparently prevents showing this accelerator in the menu. I notice that the global delete action also has no accelerator text shown in the menu on GTK.
