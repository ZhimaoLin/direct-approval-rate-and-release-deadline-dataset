DESCRIPTION

Consider initial selection in Interactive Rebase view

If the selection, retrieved in the newly implemented init method, can be
used for the setInput method, then it is used. Otherwise the selection
is derived from the active editor. In both cases the existing
selectionChangeListener gets reused.
