Patch Set 1:

Can be tested by e.g. trying to push to jgit origin. This results in error message:

Transport error occured during push operation: http://egit.eclipse.org/jgit.git: not authorized

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks fine.

We may want to clean this up more in the future but for now it's better than it was before.
