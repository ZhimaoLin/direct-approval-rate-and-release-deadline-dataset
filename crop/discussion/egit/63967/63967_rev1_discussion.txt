DESCRIPTION

Make RebaseInteractivePlan.planChangeListeners thread-safe

Listener lists should always be thread-safe. If it is known that such
a list is modified rarely and contains only a few listeners, a
CopyOnWriteArrayList is a simple way to achieve that.

Thomas, looks good. 

Do you had a chance to check why it fails in 4.2, I mean, which change may have introduced this? Or was it always there?

I didn't check. The report did not include any hints as to what the user had been doing, nor any steps to reproduce, so I cannot do so. I just inspected the code and noticed that there may be multiple jobs modifying this list, once by the index diff change job and then through RebaseInteractiveView.showRepository(); call at line 349 from a preference change listener, and called from setInput(), which in turn gets called by a selection changed listener. This code appears to have been introduced in the implementation of "linking with selection" for the RebaseInteractiveView (bug 444660), which means it's been around since EGit 3.6.
