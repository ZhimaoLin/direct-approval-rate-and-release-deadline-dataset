DESCRIPTION

Introduce context menu "import changed projects"

The context menu action "import changed projects" analyzes the files of
the commit and is importing the matching projects. This is a handy
feature for very large repositories with lots of projects where it is
impossible to import all projects. Import only the relevant projects
needed for the selected change/commit.

please move the changes you did here to the other change based on the master branch, it's hard to check if you did what I requested in the other change here. I tried to rebase this change onto master but this hits conflicts I don't have the time to look into

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportChangedProjectsCommand.java -> I am sure I didn't write this class
