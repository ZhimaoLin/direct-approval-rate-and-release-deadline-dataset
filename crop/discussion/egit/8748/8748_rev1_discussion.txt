DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources.

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, decorators, actions, etc.

Line:118, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryAction.java -> Shouldn't we also check isEnabled() which checks handler.isEnabled()?
The reason I'm asking is because this change request provides most handlers with an implementation of isEnabled() that checks whether linked resources are selected. But if handlers are called without prior checking of isEnabled() then maybe a double check should be made in the handler.execute().
Comments anyone?

I resubmitted it with a new id because it's owned by an old user id that I can no longer use.

Patch Set 1:

Filtered resources must also be ignored (e.g. for hierarchical project layouts).

I'm not sure how they work and if they need to be ignored explicitly. Just wondering if there is potential in designing a "should this resource be ignored" method in a way that it could also work for filtered resources. (Sorry that this is bit vague, I don't have access to the code right now.)
