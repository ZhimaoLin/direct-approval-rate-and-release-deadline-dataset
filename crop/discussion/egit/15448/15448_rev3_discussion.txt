DESCRIPTION

Reorder Push, Fetch, Pull menu entries in Team

This orders them like in the toolbar, Git menu and repo view.

It was not clear how to order menu entries defined via the deprecated
org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus (they seem to be ordered reverse as defined).
So they are now defined using the non-deprecated org.eclipse.ui.menus.

To not duplicate visibleWhen expressions, they are defined via
org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions, which enables reuse.
