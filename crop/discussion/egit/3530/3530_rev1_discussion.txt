DESCRIPTION

Fix NumberFormatException on "Create Branch"

When a repository contains a branch or tag which includes many numbers
(e.g. stable-1-0-0_2011-05-25), it was impossible to create a new branch
because of a NumberFormatException:

  java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "10020110525"

The cause was in CommonUtils.STRING_ASCENDING_COMPARATOR used from here:

  org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.repository.CreateBranchPage.createControl(CreateBranchPage.java:182)

The (not optimal) fix is to use BigInteger instead of Integer.parseInt.

Patch Set 1:

Note to self: The comparator should be overhauled anyway, the result is not correct for e.g. ["project-1-0-0-final", "project-1-0-1-beta"] because it uses "project----final" and "project----beta" for comparing.

Please review change I599b2783b6ac23c429c08144f41aac9916e06356 instead, which also fixes the second issue.
