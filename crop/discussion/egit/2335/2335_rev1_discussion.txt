DESCRIPTION

Mark .git folder as team private

The .git folder is marked as team private in ConnectProviderOperation
if the .git folder resides in the project.
This improves performance because team private resources are
usually ignored (decoration etc).

Good point. I checked it. It does not work because .git is not visible as resource when GitProjectData.markTeamPrivateResources is called.
