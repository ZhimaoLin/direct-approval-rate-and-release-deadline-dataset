That's a know unstable test.

Line:389, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/branch/BranchOperationUI.java -> With only one button labeled "Close" I think it should not matter how I close the dialog to have the setting updated. Currently it is updates only if I do close the dialog via the button. If I close the dialog by closing its window or hitting ESC, the setting is not updated even if I did toggle the checkbox before.

Perhaps just ignoring the result here would be a possibility. What do you think?

I'm not sure. I agree, that it should not matter for a dialog only with a close label. But it is not consistent with e.g. the exit dialog (although this is not the same "kind" of dialog).

I know; I'm not sure myself. But there I have a choice of not exiting, so even if I flipped the toggle, I didn't really make a decision if I then choose not to exit. In Oxygen, the dialog says "Do you want to exit foo?" and the toggle label is "Remember my decision". So if I abandon exiting by closing the dialog in any other way than clicking on the "Exit" button, it feels OK if the toggle is not updated.

Here I only have the choice of closing the dialog. It's a bit strange that if I change the toggle, the state is remembered only if I click on the "Close" button.
