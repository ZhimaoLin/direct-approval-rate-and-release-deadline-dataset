DESCRIPTION

[sync] Improve performance

Adds thin cache that contains meta data (like changed object id's and
change type) from git. This cache is filled in background process just
before synchronization is launched and then it is used for quick
obtaining list of members for particular folder.

During my tests this implementation reduce time needed to compare linux
kernel source (version 2.6.38-rc2 against 2.6.36) in less then 1min
(usually 55s), when implementation from 1.0 needs 1m 40s.

Additionally some tests were updated.

This change requires also jgit change
