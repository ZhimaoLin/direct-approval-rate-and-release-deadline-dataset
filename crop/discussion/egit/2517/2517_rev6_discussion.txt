DESCRIPTION

[sync] Add tests for GitChangeSetSorter

This change adds tests for GitChangeSetSorter. It also fixes minor
issues in this class that were found during writing tests.

GitChangeSetSorterTest is fully independent from Eclipse RCP therefore
it can be launched as pure JUnit4 test case.

MockRevCommit class is added to be able to set commit time without
setting up a full git repository, therefore
GitChangeSetSorter.shouldOrderCommitsByCommitDate() will fail with
ClassNotFoundException when this tests is launched as a plug-in test.
