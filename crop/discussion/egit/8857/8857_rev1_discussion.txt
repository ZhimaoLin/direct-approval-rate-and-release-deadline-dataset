DESCRIPTION

Mark org.eclipse.egit.core bundle to provide project set feature

In order to not prevent upgrade from egit 2.1 when the psf feature was
installed we mark the org.eclipse.egit.core bundle to provision this
feature using p2 instructions.

With this change I was able to upgrade STS 3.1.0 from egit 2.1 to a
local 2.2-SNAPSHOT build which was reported [1] to not work without this
patch.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I can confirm upgrading is possible. Better this than my change which I abandon!
