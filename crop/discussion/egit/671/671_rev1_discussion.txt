Patch Set 1: No score; No score

What does this patch change for the decoration ? I couldn't see any difference in the RepositoryView's label decorations.
Could you add a sentence to the commit message why this change is needed ? From your commit message I expected to see full refnames for branches but I still get shortened refnames :
e.g. master instead of refs/heads/master
