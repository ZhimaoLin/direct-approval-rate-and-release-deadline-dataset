DESCRIPTION

Retain password in the RepositorySelectionDialog

internal URIish representation, otherwise it won't be available
to a downstream transport instance.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Needs to be rebased onto a change that updates the manifest.mf  version numbers first.

Patch Set 1:

Right now, this change causes the password to be stored in plaintext inside of .git/config.  That is far from optimal, as this file is often world-readable.

We need to either extract the password and store it in ~/.netrc (and honor reading from ~/.netrc) to be compatible with C Git, or we need to start using the encrypted password storage within Eclipse like the CVS team provider uses.  Or both.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Stalled, but this has already been addressed in EGit. I don't think we need this change anymore from me.
