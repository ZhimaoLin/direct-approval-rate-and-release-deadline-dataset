DESCRIPTION

Make the rebase command stop after initialization

Preparing the rebase todo lines in a callback method may be a long
lasting user interaction. Doing this with the callback method
RebaseInteractiveHandler.prepareSteps() implies to make the thread that
is calling back sleep until the user has finished preparation.

In contrast when the rebase command is returning after initialization
there is no need to make a thread sleep. The rebase todo file can be
edited using Repository.writeRebaseTodoFile(). The interactive rebase
has then to be invoked with PROCESS_STEPS in order to start processing.
Note that the method RebaseInteractiveHandler.prepareSteps() will be
called anyway just before starting to process the rebase todo file.
