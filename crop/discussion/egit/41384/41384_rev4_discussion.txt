DESCRIPTION

variables. This change allows git config variables to be accessed
within java templates.

Patch Set 4:

Looks much better, thanks.

One thing: I haven't yet time to load this into the IDE, but can you please check if the modified git plugin works fine with C++ IDE https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/lunasr1a or PHP IDE https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-php-developers/lunasr1a ?

Can you please attach screenshots to the bug where one can see *where* in the preferences one can find or configure new template variables and how it looks like in the editor afterwards? This helps to understand what we are going to deliver with this change and can be reused for N&N page. It is all about "better marketing" of your change :-)

Patch Set 4:

P.S. C++ and PHP IDE's because they don't have JDT included.

This change does not appear to cause any issues with C++ or PHP IDEs. Please note however this change only adds template variables for Java; you can only access git_config() template variables from Java projects.

Patch Set 4:

can you provide an example how to use this ? I tried but I didn't get variables replaced, i tried this:

 template gitusername
 ${user:git_config(user.name)} ${mail:git_config(user.email)}

when using the template I got just

 user mail

but not git name and email configured in ~/.gitconfig

Within a Java project that is connected to egit create a new class using the wizard and make sure you have the generate comments box checked.

Does that work for you?
