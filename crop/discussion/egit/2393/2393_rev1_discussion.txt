DESCRIPTION

Streamline Import Wizards second part: always share projects

Remove the option whether to share the projects altogether and always
share newly created projects; one test seems to fail with this, so we
don't check there for the moment whether the project is shared and put
a TODO in to fix with a later path in this set.
