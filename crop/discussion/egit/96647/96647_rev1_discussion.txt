DESCRIPTION

Avoid multiple tree-walks in model-aware git synchronizations

GitLazyResourceVariantTreeSubscriber performs a full tree-walk over the
repository for each resource that is not cached. However, it actually
needs to do only one tree-walk. If the requested resource is still not
cached, it doesn't exist.
