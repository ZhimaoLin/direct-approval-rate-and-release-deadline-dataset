DESCRIPTION

Avoid multiple tree-walks in model-aware git synchronizations

GitLazyResourceVariantTreeSubscriber performs a full tree-walk over the
repository for each resource that is not cached. However, it actually
needs to do only one tree-walk. If the requested resource is still not
cached, it doesn't exist.

Patch Set 2:

Sorry I merged by reflex, thought this was an emf compare change. This only seems to impact the subscriber used in model aware comparisons and it does so without impacting the behavior (but adding a tremendous increase in performance) as far as my testing went.

Hey, it's OK. You _are_ a committer, and you'd been the person of choice to review this anyway.
