Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

I think this is submittable, but its missing obvious stuff like adding the newly created .gitignore to the index automatically when the first entry is added.  It also allows you to add the same path twice.  :-(

Alex, care to give me a +1 before I submit it?

Looks good to me.

We should file bugs for missing functionality, like the lack of adding to the .gitignore doing this op and whether we actually consult the ignored list during presentation etc.
