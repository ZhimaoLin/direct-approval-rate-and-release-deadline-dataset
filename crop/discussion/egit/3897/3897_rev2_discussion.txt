Patch Set 2:

You could use the same message as we have in CommitAction_MergeHeadErrorMessage

But I really wonder if there is a way to help the user to resolve this state. Looking at bug 352243, it seems the user has no clue how he got into this state and what to do.

Patch Set 2:

I do not know how the user can get into this state of missing MERGE_MSG. But together with JGit Change  http://egit.eclipse.org/r/3900 he is able to commit his merge commit. Of course the user has to provide an own message in this case.
