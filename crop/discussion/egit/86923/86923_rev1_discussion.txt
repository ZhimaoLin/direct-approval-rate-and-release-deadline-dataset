DESCRIPTION

Add an outline page for DiffEditorPage

Introduce a MultiPageEditorContentOutlinePage for the CommitEditor
that manages outline pages for nested editors. Give the nested
DiffEditorPage its own fully functional outline page. The outline
page is linked to the editor page: its selection updates when the
caret's position in the editor moves between file diffs. It also
has a simple context menu giving access to actions for opening the
files in an editor, or for showing a file diff in a compare editor.
