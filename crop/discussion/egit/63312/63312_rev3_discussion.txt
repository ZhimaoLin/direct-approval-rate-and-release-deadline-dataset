DESCRIPTION

Disable Gitflow menu in History view already on first access

open it while a non-develop branch was checked out.

No, that's not what I see. Like Matthias said, the submenu item is enabled for non-gitflow-enabled repositories.

See change Ia8ba640.

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/menu/DynamicHistoryMenu.java -> Wrong indentation.

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/menu/DynamicHistoryMenu.java -> I thought "release branches" were always created from the development branch in git flow?[1][2] If so, that "!" is wrong.

You are right. Maybe I was looking at the wrong change. It should be fixed in I8bc769f.

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/menu/DynamicHistoryMenu.java -> Yes, the commit must be on the develop branch (though it does not have to be HEAD). Currently there is no check for that, though. I'll add a new bug.
Checking, if the checked out branch is develop does not make sense, I think because the HistoryView can display other branches as well.

You are right. This should be gfRepo.getConfig().isInitialized()
