DESCRIPTION

Set initial rebase selection to upstream branch

Inspect the repository's config to determine the likely
merge target for the currently checked out branch and
select and reveal then upstream branch in the dialog if
found.

This has already been changed in the merge dialog and the
rebase dialog should be consistent with it.
