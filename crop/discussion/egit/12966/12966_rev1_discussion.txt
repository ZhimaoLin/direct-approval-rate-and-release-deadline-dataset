DESCRIPTION

Move implementation of import feature to o.e.egit.ui bundle

Since the oldest release EGit will support with 3.0 is Juno we can move
the implementation for importing a git repository from an installed
bundle with a Eclipse-SourceReferences header in its manifest to the
org.eclipse.egit.ui bundle and remove the indigo target platform.

Line:106, pom.xml -> What's the egit.repository module? Is it related to egit.import?

hudson ran out of disk space hence it can't run builds at the moment, I filed https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=408467 to track this problem

Line:106, pom.xml -> It's creating the egit p2 repository packaging all bundles and features. It was created only on platform versions the import feature could be built on (Juno & Kepler but not on Indigo) since Tycho doesn't allow conditional packaging, it always wants all the features/bundles listed in the repository's category.xml and fails the build if any is missing.

Now with this change all supported platform versions (Juno & Kepler) provide the necessary API for the import feature hence packaging the p2 repository doesn't need to depend on the platform version any longer. So the repository module is now moved to the global modules section (see below) to ensure it's built always.
