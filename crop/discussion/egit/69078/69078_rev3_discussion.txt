DESCRIPTION

Fix Activator.error() calls that should have been Activator.logError()

error() just creates an IStatus. Replaced by logError() in all places
where the returned IStatus was ignored.

It's an easy mistake to make, especially since the UI Activator also
has operations logError() and error(), but there both _do_ log.

CommitMessageComponent should use the UI Activator, not the core one.
