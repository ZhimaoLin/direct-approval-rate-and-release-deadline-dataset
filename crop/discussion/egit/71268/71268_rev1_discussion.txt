DESCRIPTION

Avoid IAE when disposing GitDecoratorPreferencePage

PreferencePages have their contents created lazily. It's possible that
the page is disposed before the contents were created. Since the
GitDecoratorPreferencePage creates its listeners only when it creates
its contents, it has to care about this in dispose() and de-register
the listeners only if they had indeed been created.
