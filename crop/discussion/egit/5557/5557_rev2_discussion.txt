Patch Set 2:

I tried this with the EGit clone wizard, but when I deselect all branches from the source repository the wizard raises a warning that at least one branch needs to be selected and doesn't enable "Next" and "Finish". So how can I use this change ?

Patch Set 2:

good question :) i have written a very basic IDE integration on top of EGit/JGit just for our company, which uses a CloneOperation to do the cloning. This stopped working, and it seemed like a bug to me. If it isn't at least the JavaDoc has to be adapted (it says pass null for no branch). After all this is "public" API.

Patch Set 2:

- ok, I suspected that already
- we should then fix the EGit clone wizard accordingly
