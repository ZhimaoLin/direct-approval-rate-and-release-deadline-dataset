DESCRIPTION

Handle relative paths in RepositoryMapping creator

file.getAbsolutePath() with a relative path here resolves against
the current working directory of the Eclipse instance. The path is,
however, relative to the IContainer being mapped!

This causes many of the various occurrences of errors in the log about
gone repository mappings, especially those where the absolute path is
nowhere near any expected directory.
