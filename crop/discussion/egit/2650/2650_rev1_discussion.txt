DESCRIPTION

Show commit corresponding to selection in commit graph table

Let the commit graph selection follow the Ref selected in the
Repositories View so that the corresponding commit is visible in the
History View. If a resource is selected HEAD will be made visible.
This is done if History View is configured to follow selection and
filter is set to show all changes in the repository.

Cool feature. See inline comments, though.

Line:1003, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Why is the filter setting checked here? Doesn't the commit graph table simply ignore the calls if the selected commit is not in the list?
If we really need to check whether the list is filtered, then a check for SHOWALLREPO as filter is not sufficient: if the input is a Repository (because you selected a repo in the repo view), then the filter buttons are simply deactivated, but the previous setting will still be active; however, the user can not change the setting, so we would have to check for filter != SHOWALLREPO && ((input.getItems() != null) || (input.getFiles() == null))) (or something like this).

Line:1016, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Same as above
