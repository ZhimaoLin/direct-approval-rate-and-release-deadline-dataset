DESCRIPTION

Show commit corresponding to selection in commit graph table

Let the commit graph selection follow the Ref selected in the
Repositories View so that the corresponding commit is visible in the
History View. If a resource is selected HEAD will be made visible.
This is done if History View is configured to follow selection and
filter is set to show all changes in the repository.
