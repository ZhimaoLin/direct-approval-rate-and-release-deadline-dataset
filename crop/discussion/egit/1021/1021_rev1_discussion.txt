Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

In principle the approach is correct, but as I learned about HandlerUtil recently (from Jaylon Avila), I believe we should to this properly: use the HandlerUtil.getCurrentSelectionChecked() and HandlerUtil.getActivePartChecked(), respectively, and propagate the ExecutionException to the callers. This should improve our Exception handling here siginificantly.
