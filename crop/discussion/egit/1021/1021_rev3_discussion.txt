DESCRIPTION

Fixed 318436: CCE when deleting branch and cleaned RepositoryViewCommandHandler

Introduced getShell on RepositoryViewCommandHandler to easily retrvieve the active Shell.
This is used in almost all commands and we can get rid of the getView().getSite().getShell() chain.
In addition, the RepositoryViewCommandHandler now uses HandlerUtil to obtain the context variables
and propagates possible exceptions to the callers.
