DESCRIPTION

IndexDiffCache: synchronize calculation with workspace changes

The index diff calculation jobs now wait for the workspace lock before
calculation of an index diff starts. This avoids starting calculation of
an index diff while the workspace changes (e.g. due to a branch
operation). The index diff calculation jobs do not lock the
workspace during execution to avoid blocking the workspace.
