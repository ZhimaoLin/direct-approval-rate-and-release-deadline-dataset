DESCRIPTION

[reflogView] Do not show "from" column

The commit IDs shown in the "from" column are redundant as they are
already displayed in the previous reflog entry. Hence only show the
commit IDs of the former "to" column. Native git's reflog command also
only displays the commit ID of the new commit after the corresponding
ref has moved.
