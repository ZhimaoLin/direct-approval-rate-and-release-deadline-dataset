Perhaps. If the bridge is Luna-compatible it might work. Currently it isn't; it requires org.eclipse.core.runtime 3.12.0 whereas Luna has 3.10.0. It also requires slf4j-nop 1.7.10; Luna has slf4j 1.7.2 and slf4j-log4j 1.7.2. I doubt this is going to be backported, and having different minimum requirements than the rest of this logging (see logging/pom.xml) is probably also not a good idea.
