(6 inline comments)

please address the concerns which were already raised on patchset 2, in order to simplify tracking of fixed ones you may want to mark them "done" in the patchset in which they were raised

Line:33, org.eclipse.egit.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> this should be moved to o.e.egit.mylyn.ui, o.e.egit.ui should not depend on mylyn

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/TaskBranchNameSuggester.java -> why 2004 ?

Line:20, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/TaskBranchNameSuggester.java -> we don't use author tags, instead add some meaningful javadoc

Line:211, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> style nit: formatting doesn't follow project conventions, we use blanks around operators, see contributor guide

Line:213, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> text needs to be externalized

Line:666, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> style nit: needs to be formatted properly
