Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

May I point out that these classes are _not_ API. If egerrit is using them directly, it's walking off-limits.

Line:640, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Why? Which checked exception is thrown here?

In test code "throws Exception" may be fine, but in production code this I'd rather not have that.

Line:672, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> What is this trying to accomplish? Why not handle e directly, without this strange re-throw?

Line:726, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> See above; and strange formatting.

Line:757, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> And anyway: the exception is handled here, now re-thrown, then caught and again re-thrown and then handled above.

Sorry, but all this makes no sense to me.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit message is lacking an explanation of why these changes are done.

Also, please see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines and make the commit message comply.

Patch Set 2:

A bit of background. I posted this change to illustrate which behavior would be needed. I our case, we use the FetchGerritChangePage in order to allow users to fetch a change. 
When an error occurs during the fetch operation, for instance if the user doesnt have permission, or the remote selected in the wizard screen is no valid, an error is reported but appears so quickly that the user cannot see it.
This is the idea behind this change.
If you have another method to suggest for resolving this issue, please provide it.
Thanks

I don't think a background job should throw error dialogs at the user at all. Probably the best is to log the error only. Perhaps keep the job in the progress view, give it an error icon, and an action to show the error.
