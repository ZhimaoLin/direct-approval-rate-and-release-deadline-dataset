DESCRIPTION

Activator.isActive() should not call into UI thread

Current isActive() code calls into UI thread but can be called itself
from long running low level egit jobs via
IndexChangedListener.onIndexChanged(), so it is can cause deadlock
situations between UI/job threads.

The patch avoids calling into the UI thread directly and introduces new
"uiIsActive" field to track window activation and deactivation via
already existing IWindowListener callbacks.
