DESCRIPTION

Define a layout data for the warning composite

A composite in the history page was relying on a layout request to
have the layout data automatically generated and set onto the
composite. In the event that the composite's shell has been asked
to have its layout operations deferred, the layout data will not be
automatically generated or set, resulting in possible errors
farther down the code path when another method tries to ask the
composite in question for its layout data. The fix is to explicitly
set a layout data on the composite so that it doesn't have to rely
on a layout operation to have one.
