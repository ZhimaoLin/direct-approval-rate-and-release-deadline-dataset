DESCRIPTION

TestRepository: use cached repository instance

TestRepository used its own Repository instance while EGit operations
used in the tests use the instances provided by RepositoryCache. This
caused update problems. Now TestRepository also uses the instances
provided by RepositoryCache. This change is a prerequisite for
removing the sleeps in CommitOperationTest.
The sleeps were removed.
