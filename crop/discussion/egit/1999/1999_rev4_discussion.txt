DESCRIPTION

Fix reuse of field labels (incl. shortcut mnemonic) in error messages

This patch fixes the reuse of field labels in error messages on the
clone wizard. This is necessary due to the fact that field labels
contain a shortcut mnemonic (&) that is not interpreted but displayed
when the label is reused as part of an error message.
