DESCRIPTION

Enable multiple project input from working tree

Enables selecting multiple projects from the working tree and use
the "Import Projects" context menu.

It uses the legacy import wizard in case multiple projects are
selected until smart importer can handle the same function.

works nicely :-)

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCreateProjectViaWizardWizard.java -> why fFilter and pFilter ? I'd just use filter for both

Line:445, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> unrelated formatting change

Line:62, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportProjectsCommand.java -> style nit remove the prefix "p"

Line:79, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportProjectsCommand.java -> this comment is unnecessary as the method below already says it's opening the smart import wizard

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCreateProjectViaWizardWizard.java -> I do think that having a uniform coding style is more important than my personal style so I will take your suggestion or call it "myFilter" like the style in this class. My ideas about this are below.


I was "annoyed/puzzled/etc.." by this naming style too when I first saw it. However, over the years I have come to the conclusion that I want to make absolutely clear in my code where I am dealing with a field, a parameter or a local variable. This style is dismissed by many in favor of the coloring capabilities of the IDE (or I'm asked if I have heard of the "this.fieldName" construct.) In Eclipse, method parameters are colored the same way as local variables and there are cases where people have troubles seeing or interpreting colors. 

In addition, when reading code outside the IDE you don't have to guess where the field comes from. For example, this very Gerrit review editor does not tell you by color if it is a field, parameter or local variable.

Line:265, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCreateProjectViaWizardWizard.java -> TODO: They are not regex. Must be fixed.

Line:445, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> Missed that. Thanks!

By the way, I am using EGit's code formatting rules which cause the old code to be reformatted anyway. Too bad especially since I am a big CTRL+F fan.

Line:62, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportProjectsCommand.java -> Ok.

Line:79, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportProjectsCommand.java -> Ok

@Andrey. I did not introduce the smart import wizard, it was already there.
