I think that change isn't necessary any more, since ProjectSetConverter is now in Mylyn versions.

Patch Set 2:

It depends if EGit is willing to consume Mylyn 3.8 at this point. Would definitely makes sense for the future but for now it seemed easier to keep a copy of this in EGit.

I agree that it's easier to have a copy until we fully rely on Mylyn 3.8. Though we should have some test proving this works.

Line:48, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/ProjectSetConverter.java -> if this is a copy from Mylyn this should be explicitly mentioned here and a corresponding bug should be filed to remind us that we should remove the copy as soon as we fully rely on Mylyn 3.8 in a future version of EGit

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/ProjectSetConverter.java -> we don't use author tags
