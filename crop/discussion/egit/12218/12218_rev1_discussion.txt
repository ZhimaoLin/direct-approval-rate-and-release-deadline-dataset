DESCRIPTION

[historyView] "Search all" option for find toolbar

Sometimes one wants to find a commit by author, sometimes by comment.
Currently this requires the user to switch between those modes.

This change adds a new "All" mode, which just searches all fields. The
performance is good enough that this can be the default mode.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think it would be better to make the selections not mutually exclusive and enable all.

Patch Set 1:

Good idea. In that case, what should the button show? It currently shows the selected mode. Clicking on it cycles through the modes.
