DESCRIPTION

[historyView] "Search all" option for find toolbar

Sometimes one wants to find a commit by author, sometimes by comment.
Currently this requires the user to switch between those modes.

This change adds a new "All" mode, which just searches all fields. The
performance is good enough that this can be the default mode.

This also fixes a bug where cycling through the options by pressing on
the button would persist the wrong preference value.
