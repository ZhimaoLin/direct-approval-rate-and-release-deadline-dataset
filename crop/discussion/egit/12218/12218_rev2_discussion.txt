DESCRIPTION

[historyView] "Search all" option for find toolbar

Sometimes one wants to find a commit by author, sometimes by comment.
Currently this requires the user to switch between those modes.

This change adds a new "All" mode, which just searches all fields. The
performance is good enough that this can be the default mode.

See the comment by Dashawn Dalton here. In his experience, drop-downs with check options don't work well:

He would prefer the solution in this change. So, can we submit it like this?
