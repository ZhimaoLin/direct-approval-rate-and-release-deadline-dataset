DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Show Push/Fetch nodes correctly

The "Fetch" node should always be shown if there is at least one fetch
URI, while the "Push" node should always be shown if there is either a
fetch URI or at least one push URI.

The existence of RefSpecs should not be checked here, as there is a
default RefSpec for pushing (we should also have one for fetching, but
it's not implemented yet).
