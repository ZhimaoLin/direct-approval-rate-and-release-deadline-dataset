DESCRIPTION

Save Actions for removing braces of one-line statements

The EGit/JGit code style is to write the following:

  if (cond) {
    doSomething();
  }

as follows:

  if (cond)
    doSomething();

As this may need getting used to and as it comes up frequently in
reviews, automate it by configuring it as a Java Editor Save Action on
the projects.

Line:18, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs -> It's a setting that was not available when this file was originally created, Eclipse adds it when it's not already there. false is the default value, and means "do nothing" (for all the cleanup actions I think).

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

+1 from me ... strange that no one didn't come with such idea later ...

Patch Set 1:

This change causes patches to be bigger than needed because it converts otherwise untouched code. Is this really what you want? It makes patch reviews much harder.

Patch Set 1:

No, the goal was to make reviews easier because code is automatically formatted before it hits review.

For existing code, it would probably be a good idea to clean the code base up in commits specifically for that.

But this now means a contributor has to first clean up the code with a separate patch before he can submit his (clean) changes. This seems like lots of work for both, the contributors and the committers.

Patch Set 1:

I was more thinking of a big change for the whole egit repo, which would only need to be done once.
