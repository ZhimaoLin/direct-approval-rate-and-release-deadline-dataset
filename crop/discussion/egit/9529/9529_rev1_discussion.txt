DESCRIPTION

Do not replace Change-Id in commit message in case of a conflict

When cherry-pick results in a conflict and the user adds the conflicting
file to the index egit replaced the existing Change-Id with an empty
one. This is not what the user expects.

Line:543, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitMessageComponent.java -> - why isn't this logic implemented in calculateCommitMessage() ?
- I think at the moment findOffsetofChangeIdLine() is incorrectly implemented since it would also accept a change-id line which isn't in the footer but an earlier paragraph, I'd use RevCommit.getFooterLines() to extract footers.
- also it could make sense to move findOffsetofChangeIdLine() to jgit

Line:543, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitMessageComponent.java -> As far as I understand the method calculateCommitMessage is used to ask the provided instances of ICommitMessageProvider. This is only done if there is no message set yet. So the method name is misleading.

I'll push another implementation of findOffsetofChangeIdLine() in JGit in a subsequent commit.
