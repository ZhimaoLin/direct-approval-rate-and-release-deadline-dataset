DESCRIPTION

Cleanup repositories in LocalRepositoryTestCase

Repository instances are now closed in method afterClassBase.
Deletion of files is retried if files are locked.
File.deleteOnExit() is no longer used. This guarantees a proper shutdown
of the test class.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

A bit hackish due to the retries but looks good.
