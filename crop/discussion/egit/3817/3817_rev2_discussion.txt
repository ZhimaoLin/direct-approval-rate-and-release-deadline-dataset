DESCRIPTION

Fix remote tracking branch update on push

Pushing via "Team->Push to upstream" and pushing via executing "Push" on
a remote's push node now updates the related remote tracking branch.
A third constructor was added to PushOperationUI to enable pushing on a
given remote name. The constructor of PushOperation was changed to take
the remote name instead of a remote config.
The new constructor in PushOperationUI was required because JGit's
PushCommand only updates the remote tracking branch if a remote name is
given. No update is performed if a push uri is provided.

Depends on JGit change
