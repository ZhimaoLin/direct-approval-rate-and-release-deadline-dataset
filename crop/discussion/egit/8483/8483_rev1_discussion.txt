DESCRIPTION

RevisionSyntaxException in the Push wizard

The push dialog's refspec panel passed surplus text to the revision
parser. The revision parser used to allow garbage after the revision,
but was tightened, which then triggered this bug.

Remove the part following the branch name that is just UI decoration
before sending the branch name to the revision parser.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The code in ComboLabelingSupport is kind of strange. In setProposals, the items are set to the labels, in the selection listener of the constructor, it does setText with the content. So in the selection listeners, getText returns the content, but otherwise it returns the label as set by SWT.

How about doing the fix in ComboLabelingSupport? Add a getCurrentContent to it that does the following:

    String text = combo.getText();
    for (IContentProposal p : proposals)
        if (text.equals(p.getLabel()))
            return p.getContent()
    return text;

Then in the validateCreationPanel, use creationSrcComboSupport to get the src instead (same for dst). I would also replace the other usages of getText and remove the strange setText code in SelectionListener.

I can prepare a patch if you want.
