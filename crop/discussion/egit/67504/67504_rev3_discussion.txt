DESCRIPTION

Test stability: properly wait for refresh jobs in Gitflow test

SWTbot tests shall never ever just sleep(). That's a sure recipe for
an unstable test, and caused the instability in
FeatureFinishSquashHandlerTest. Better wait for a defined job family,
if available, or even better until a defined event occurs.

Here, however, we have neither a family nor an event to wait for.
Resort to waiting until things have quieted down.

Also use setText() instead of typeText(); the latter may fail if the
keyboard layout is unknown to SWTbot (such as my MAC_DE_CH layout).
