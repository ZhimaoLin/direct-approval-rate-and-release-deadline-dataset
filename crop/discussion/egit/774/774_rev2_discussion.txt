DESCRIPTION

Fix failing SharingWizardTest.shareProjectWithNewlyCreatedRepo

This test failed when run from maven because the page where the team
provider selection would occur was short circuited by Eclipse, since
only one provider exists. We could skip that part and the test would
run in maven, but not using the default options from Eclipse, or as
this patch does, add another team provider, e.g. CVS to the running
test.
