DESCRIPTION

Fix SharingWizardTest.shareProjectWithNewlyCreatedRepo

This test failed because the page where the team provider selection
would occur was short circuited by Eclipse, since only one provider
exists. We could skip that part and the test would run in maven, but
not using the default options from Eclipse, or as this patch does,
add another team provider, e.g. CVS to the running test.
