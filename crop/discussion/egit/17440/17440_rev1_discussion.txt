DESCRIPTION

PSF import also supports checking out tags, not only branches

Don't prefix refname from project set file with Constants.R_HEADS to
allow CloneOperation to work as designed [1]: it accepts refname as a
full or short name of either tag or branch.

works like a charm, just a minor nit in the commit message

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/either tag or branch/any ref (usually tag or branch)/
