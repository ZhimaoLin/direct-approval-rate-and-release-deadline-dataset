DESCRIPTION

Allow users to push to upstream when committing in the staging view

I added 2 new buttons to the form, that allow the user to commit
and to commit + push changes upstream in a single step.
The push occurrs either to the default remote or to the user
configured push (via push configuration dialog).

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I couldn't find a way to set the focus to the "Commit" or "Commit and Push" button without using the mouse, I think this needs to be fixed, I think every widget accepting any kind of input must be reachable via keyboard

Patch Set 6:

Matthias: Traversal works here (Linux). Does it work in other dialogs? Are you on Mac OS X? Maybe the following default setting is the problem: http://www.danielschneller.com/2009/01/mac-os-x-full-keyboard-control.html
