I'd prefer to leave buttons in the toolbar since this looks nicer and the text field for writing the commit message can be larger which is useful when writing larger commit messages.

Line:60, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitJob.java -> style nit: remove unnecessary blank line

Line:85, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitJob.java -> s/commit/push/
