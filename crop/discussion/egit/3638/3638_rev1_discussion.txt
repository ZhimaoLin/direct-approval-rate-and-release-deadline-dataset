DESCRIPTION

Fix handling of line endings in commit dialog

The widget used for editing the commit message uses Text.DELIMITER as
line ending. Commit messages are persisted in git using "\n" line
ending. Properly normalizing line endings fixes bug 348153 which
caused the commit dialog to erroneously generate a new change-id when
amending a commit already containing a change-id.
