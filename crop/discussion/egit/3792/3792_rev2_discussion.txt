Line:277, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/ReflogView.java -> Style nit we don't use brackets for single line blocks

Line:255, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/ReflogView.java -> To prevent memory leaking you should also remove this change listener when view is destroyed

Patch Set 2:

addRefsListener method returns ListenerHandle instance. You should assign it to private field and then call remove method.
