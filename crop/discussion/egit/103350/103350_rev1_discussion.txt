DESCRIPTION

Improve commit message validation & remove leading whitespace

Before committing, EGit checked whether the commit message was empty.
However, if a commit message only contained a Change-Id line, it was
considered not empty and would pass. Strengthen the check to consider
commit messages containing only footer lines to be empty.

Also remove leading whitespace (including leading empty lines) before
actually committing.
