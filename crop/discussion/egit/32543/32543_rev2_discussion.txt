With that the user doesn't yet have a chance to set the commit message for a merge commit since there is no way to enter the custom message. If you add that to the UI the merge commit message should be initialised with the generated standard message.

Line:125, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/MergeOperation.java xxx@xxx.xxx tag shouldn't be required here since this class is in an internal package

Line:166, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/MergeOperation.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

I use EGit's MergeOperation only as a standalone operation, not in a UI way. I agree if I add that to the UI the merge commit message should be initialized with the generated standard message, but this is not the case because I use a standalone operation.
I can create an enhancement in bugzilla if you want.
