DESCRIPTION

Work-around: don't auto-refresh ignored top-level folders in projects

The auto-refresh done by EGit on index changes until now refreshed
everything in all projects in a certain repository. As discussed in
bug 500106, this may be a very costly operation and may lock the
workspace for extended periods. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem
to be a reasonably simple way to get precise information about which
files in the workspace were touched by the last git command as was
suggested in bug 416199.

As a work-around, change the project refresh logic to exclude
git-ignored top-level folders in projects. That at least will
resolve the problem for the occurrence reported in the bug
(Node.js nodemodules folder).

Unchanged in this commit but IMO also questionable: refreshing the
projects runs with the workspace root as scheduling rule. This might
not be necessary since the actual refresh acquires per-project
scheduling rules anyway. Moreover, all projects are refreshed
sequentially. I wonder if this could not be parallelized and be
run without a workspace lock.

A better approach is in changes

* https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100916/ (JGit) and
* https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/100917/ (Egit)

I'd prefer that one, so let's try this only if the other attempt doesn't work out.
