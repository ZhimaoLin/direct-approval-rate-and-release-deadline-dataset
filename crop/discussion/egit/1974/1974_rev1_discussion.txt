Line:239, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/TestRepository.java -> I think we should clean that up in a different way: 

AFAIK we do no longer have a difference between "add to index" and "track", so I think we should delete the track() here and replace it by addToIndex().

In addition we could use the jgit AddCommand to heavily simplify this class.

Line:239, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/TestRepository.java -> Good hint with the AddCommand, that's in. As for removing track(), I'm reluctant as the use of track() and addToIndes() is wildly mixed all over the tests, and the parameter is File here and IFile there, so we need some bigger refactoring here.
