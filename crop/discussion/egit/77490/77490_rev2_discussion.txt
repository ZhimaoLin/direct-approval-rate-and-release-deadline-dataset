DESCRIPTION

Handle edge case in GitAdapterFactory

In the bug report we ended up with an empty project relative path.
Although I don't quite see how that could happen (GitModelBlob for a
project should not occur), let's catch this case and return the project
itself in that case.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I do wonder whether this might be related to http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg04120.html , where a submodule gets a file icon (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/pngmXaUcHJoD2.png ) ?
