DESCRIPTION

Convert tests to JUnit 4 style

The maven-osgi-test-plugin doesn't find JUnit4 with package dependency to
org.junit;version="[4.3.1,5.0.0)". Hence require bundle org.junit4.
Filed https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/TYCHO-360 for this problem.

Rename T0002_history so that it is detected as test class by
maven-osgi-test-plugin default logic (see [1]).
