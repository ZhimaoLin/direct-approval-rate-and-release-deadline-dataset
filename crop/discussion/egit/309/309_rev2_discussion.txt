DESCRIPTION

Convert tests to JUnit 4 style

Tycho eclipse-test-plugin doesn't find JUnit4 with package dependency to
org.junit;version="[4.3.1,5.0.0)". Hence require bundle org.junit4.
Still Maven 3.0/Tycho eclipse-test-plugin don't run T0002_history.

Simplify T0001_ConnectProviderOperationTest.testNoRepository().

Patch Set 2: No score; IP review completed

I have no idea why Maven 3/Tycho don't execute tests in T0002_history.java. From Eclipse this works. This was also the case with the old state using JUnit 3.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There seems to be a spurious change in the T0001:47.

Line:14, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Do we want to explicitly refer to bundle name instead of package name here? Do we want to put 4.3.1 instead of 4.3?  Do we need to change any pom.xml as well?

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/op/T0001_ConnectProviderOperationTest.java -> This change doesn't appear to be related to the JUnit migration?

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/T0003_AdaptableFileTreeIteratorTest.java -> We changed the name before; but not here. Should we have changed the previous?

I'll post a new patch set soon

Line:14, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> - Reference to package isn't respected by Tycho osgi-test-plugin, by experiment I found that bundle reference seems to work. In Eclipse both are working as expected. This is most probably a bug in Tycho. Hence I added Igor to the reviewer list.
- We want to be Eclipse 3.4 backward compatible, 4.3.1 is the version available there.
- pom.xml change shouldn't be necessary since we do manifest-first here, i.e. Maven /Tycho should pick dependencies from the manifest.

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/op/T0001_ConnectProviderOperationTest.java -> That's right, I'll split that into a separate change.

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/T0003_AdaptableFileTreeIteratorTest.java -> Aargh, I don't know what I thought when I wrote that.
