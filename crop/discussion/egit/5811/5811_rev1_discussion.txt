DESCRIPTION

Don't cast node object to Ref

The reset command currently fails when a repository
is selected because the getLatestCommit method
casts the node's object to a Ref without checking the
type.

This change just passed the target branch and repository
to the getLatestCommit method for looking up the commit
that the target branch is pointing to.
