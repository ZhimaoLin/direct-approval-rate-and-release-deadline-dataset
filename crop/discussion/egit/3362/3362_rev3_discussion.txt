Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I found out that the error is related to bug 292138. It only occured when the history page was already there on workbench startup and the framework instantiated two HistoryPages.

I added a line that fixes it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:611, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> It's not required to rebuild the commit list here. Just refresh the table: graph.getTableView().refresh();
