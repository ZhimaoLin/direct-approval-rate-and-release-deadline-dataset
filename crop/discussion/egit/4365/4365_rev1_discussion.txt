DESCRIPTION

Enforce the use of Java5 API:s only (with a few exceptions)

This only works with Eclipse 3.6 and newer and requires installation
of new package. Documentation is not very good, but there is a blog
about it here: http://eclipseandjazz.blogspot.com/2011/10/of-invalid-references-to-system.html

API checking is especially useful on OS X where Java5 is not readily
available.
