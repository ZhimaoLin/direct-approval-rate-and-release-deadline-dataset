DESCRIPTION

Tycho build for org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

org.eclipse.ui and org.hamcrest need to be referenced via require-bundle.

Also introduce maven property platform-version-name to simplify building
against different Eclipse platform releases. E.g. to build and test
against helios platform release run

mvn -Dplatform-version-name=helios clean install
