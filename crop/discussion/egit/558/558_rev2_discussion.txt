DESCRIPTION

Tycho build for org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

Fixed dependencies:
- correcting wrong version range for org.eclipse.core.filesystem
- org.eclipse.ui and org.hamcrest need to be referenced via require-bundle

Also introduce maven property "platform-version-name" to simplify building
against different Eclipse platform releases. E.g. to build and test
against helios platform release run

mvn -Dplatform-version-name=helios clean install

No idea yet why, running tests from Eclipse works.

I suspect that the perspective is not available.

You could try printing out what perspectives are available via bot.perspectives() and get an idea of why that perspective is unavailable.

Could be a language setting or a missing plugin that contributes the perspective.

I'll work on improving the error message so it throws a WidgetNotFoundException instead of an Arrayexception.

Patch Set 2:

Found https://docs.sonatype.org/display/TYCHO/How+to+run+SWTBot+tests+with+Tycho.

Looks like I missed to run tests on top of Eclipse SDK ;-)
Currently testing this, seems to work but it's a bit slow since it downloads full SDK. Preparing patch soon.
