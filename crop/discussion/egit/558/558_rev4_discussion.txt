DESCRIPTION

Tycho build for org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

Following approach described in [1].

Fixed dependencies:
- correcting wrong version range for org.eclipse.core.filesystem
- org.eclipse.ui and org.hamcrest need to be referenced via require-bundle

Also introduce maven property "platform-version-name" to simplify building
against different Eclipse platform releases. E.g. to build and test
against helios platform release run

mvn -Dplatform-version-name=helios clean install

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved; No score

SWTBot is running with helios, but p2 provisioning fails with ganymede.  Also, some tests fail on my desktop.  I'm not sure if its an existing test breakage, or something wrong with this build configuration.  Right now I'm thinking its just existing test breakage...

If you're getting WNFE but actually see the widget on screen, chances are there's a padded whitespace on the widget text.

Patch Set 4: Do not submit; No score

The egit and jgit features are missing in the test harness, hence the tests are failing. I am working on a new patchset.
