DESCRIPTION

Tycho build for org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

Following approach described in [1].

Fixed dependencies:
- correcting wrong version range for org.eclipse.core.filesystem
- org.eclipse.ui and org.hamcrest need to be referenced via require-bundle

Also introduce maven property "platform-version-name" to simplify building
against different Eclipse platform releases. E.g. to build and test
against helios platform release run

mvn -Dplatform-version-name=helios clean install

Patch Set 3: No score; IP review completed

This seems to work, I don't get these exceptions anymore. 
I need to re-run the tests tomorrow, my DSL link at home is
 too slow so I run into timeout issues.

As a next step I will work on running the git daemon for the
 repository needed for the tests locally from the test 
environment instead of relying on a remote server.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Minor style nit, otherwise seems OK to me.

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/pom.xml -> Tab here and on next line, but we use spaces only in our pom.xml files.

Patch Set 3:

If you are testing against current JGit, you might need my I0b4d9cbd346d5dc225ec12674da905c35457fa7c to get the EGit unit test environment patched up.
