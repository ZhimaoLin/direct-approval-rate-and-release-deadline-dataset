DESCRIPTION

Tycho build for org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

Following approach described in [1].

Fixed dependencies:
- correcting wrong version range for org.eclipse.core.filesystem
- org.eclipse.ui and org.hamcrest need to be referenced via require-bundle

Also introduce maven property "platform-version-name" to simplify building
against different Eclipse platform releases. E.g. to build and test
against helios platform release run

mvn -Dplatform-version-name=helios clean install
