DESCRIPTION

Disable actions when HEAD cannot be resolved

Actions like: tag, branch, reset, merge and synchronize should be
disabled when repository has no commits yet. A special decorator
"NO-HEAD" is added into project node in this case.

Additionally push and fetch actions should be disabled when there are
no remote configurations.

Also updates context menu actions in Repositories view so that they
don't appear on empty repository or when fetch/push remotes aren't
defined. This also needs to updates some tests.
