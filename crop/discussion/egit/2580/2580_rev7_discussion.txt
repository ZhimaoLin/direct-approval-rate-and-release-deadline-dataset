DESCRIPTION

Disable actions when HEAD cannot be resolved

Actions like: tag, branch, reset and merge should be disabled when
repository has no commits yet. A special decorator "NO-HEAD" is added
into project node in this case.

Additionally push and fetch actions should be disabled when there are
no remote configurations.

Also updates context menu actions in Repositories view so that they
don't appear on empty repository or when fetch/push remotes aren't
defined. This also needs to updates some tests.

Patch Set 7:

Rebased

repositories view
* actions like merge, rebase, tag, create branch, import projects are disabled instead of removing them from menu

In case of "Configure fetch from/push to upstream", those actions assume that the source/destination branch exists in repository, but in our scenario such branch does not exist therefore those actions are disabled

Now "Fetch from..." action in enabled all the time.
