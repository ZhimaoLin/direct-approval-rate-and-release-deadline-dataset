DESCRIPTION

Disable actions when HEAD cannot be resolved

Actions like: tag, branch, reset and merge should be disabled when
repository has no commits yet. A special decorator "NO-HEAD" is added
into project node in this case.

Additionally push and fetch actions should be disabled when there are
no remote configurations.

Also updates context menu actions in Repositories view so that they
don't appear on empty repository or when fetch/push remotes aren't
defined. This also needs to updates some tests.

Patch Set 8: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

- rebased
- found a use case why "Import Projects" should not be disabled: create a new project, share it with Git, create new repo, remove repository and project from workspace but don't delete them, add the repository again, now you need a way to import the project again despite the repo is empty, hence re-enabled "Import Projects"
- disabled also "Push..." in the git repositories view
