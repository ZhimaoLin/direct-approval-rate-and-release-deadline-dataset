DESCRIPTION

Enable linking with merge tool input

When the merge tool is open, the package explorer "Link with Editor"
action now works when a resource is the input.

A nicer solution would be to have ResourceEditableRevision implement
getAdapter for IFile/IResource and then delegate to that. But that has
strange side effect such as "Save" in the merge tool no longer writing
to the file.
