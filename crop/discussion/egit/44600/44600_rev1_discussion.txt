DESCRIPTION

Consider the logical model when retrieving the previous revision

Resources from the logical model also need to be taken into
consideration when computing the previous revision. The previous
revision of a file will be the most recent revision from the set of
previous revisions in which any of the resources from that file's
logical model has changed.
