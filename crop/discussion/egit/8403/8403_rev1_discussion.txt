CommitOperation: Handle parsePersonIdent returning null

It's already checked in CommitMessageComponent, but we also need to
check it in CommitOperation, otherwise there's an NPE later.

Looks good but some minore issues:
- commitDate =Â»         new Date();
              ^^^^^^^^^^
- the copyright notices need to be updated
