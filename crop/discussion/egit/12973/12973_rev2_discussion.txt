DESCRIPTION

Improve new UI of reset dialog introduced by I6dfd318

* Format the author/committer dates in the current locale and with time
  zone information and fix a misplaced space
* Remove the borders from the labels (the table layout itself is enough
  to structure the data, additional borders just clutter the UI)
* Use "Commit" instead of "SHA-1" as in other places
* Externalize the new labels
