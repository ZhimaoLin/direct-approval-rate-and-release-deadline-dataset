Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)



Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ExceptionCollector.java -> Right here, it can never be null, so your change seems pointless to me!

Line:86, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ExceptionCollector.java -> I'm not sure how statuses can ever be null.  It just should  not be.
