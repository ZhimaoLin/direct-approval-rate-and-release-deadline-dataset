Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:34, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> I'd prefer Replace with file in Git Index

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> Do we know this is a refresh and not something entirely different. or opposed to the IOException, which we really don't know much about either

Line:63, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> Non-checked exceptions gets swalllowed and ignored here. Catching RuntimeException would tell the user something bad happed

Line:122, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> CoreException is much wider than ResourceException, which is the one
you want to ignore. Wouldn't explicitlyt checking whether the resource exists be more precise?

Patch Set 7: No score

In regards to DiscardChangesAction.

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> For the IOException, I could say that something went wrong while interacting with the index, since it isn't necessarily going to be an issue with the checkout failing.

Line:122, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> The comment inside the catch was a bit misleading. According to the javadoc, if a resource is a closed project, or does not exist, then the members() call will throw a CoreException. I've changed this method to not add members of a given resource if their "parent" throws this exception.
