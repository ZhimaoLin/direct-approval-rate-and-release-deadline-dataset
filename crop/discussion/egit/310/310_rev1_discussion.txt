DESCRIPTION

Add option to discard changes to files that are not checked into index.

This is the equivalent of 'git checkout' on a list of files from the
command-line.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think the terminology needs to be changed to fit in with other Eclipse team providers. If I wanted to undo such a change with SVN or CVS, I'd do Team -> Replace With HEAD (or Replace With Version). Wouldn't that have the same effect here?

There are some messages which we need to internationalise in the error dialogs as well.

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> Other team providers use 'replace with HEAD' or similar. Can we use that terminology here instead of 'discard changes'?

Line:34, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> These messages need to be internationalised as well.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/DiscardChangesAction.java -> Also needs to be internatoinalized
