Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Very useful patch.

However, it does not replace with the HEAD but with the git index. I would suggest to put the action completely out of the Team menu but to the "Replace With" sub menu, in analogy to the "Compare With" -> "Git Index".

When the project is in a conflict state there is an exception. Maybe you could check this before?

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> This is not what the action does. It does not replace the content with HEAD but with the staged content in the index (as git checkout does).

So why not call it "Replace with Git Index".

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryAction.java -> Why do we need to change this?
