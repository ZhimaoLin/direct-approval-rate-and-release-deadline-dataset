DESCRIPTION

Remote connections: allow to configure a timeout

This adds a preference page with a "remote connection timeout" that
lets the user configure a timeout for remote connection. 0 is the default
and corresponds to no timeout.
The different operations opening Transport instances use this timeout
and set in the Transport instance.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks good.

I'm going to open a bug to look at refactoring our preference pages a bit... I think we have too many pages and we can just use the first "Git" page.
