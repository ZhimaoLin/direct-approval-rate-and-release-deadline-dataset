DESCRIPTION

Always listen to POST_CHANGE events in GitProjectData

Offering the option not to listen to POST_CHANGE events makes no sense
anymore; GitProjectData always needs to listen to these events in order
to detect submodules in subfolders.

Also, the only call to attachToWorkspace() passed true anyway.
