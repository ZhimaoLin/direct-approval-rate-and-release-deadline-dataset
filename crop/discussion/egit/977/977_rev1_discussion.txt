Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Couldn't we do a better encapsulation by using an enum instead of a class?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Oh good grief, not an enum. Enums represent the ultimate evil for potentially extensible data sets as it's impossible to add new irks after the fact. In any case, this should really be a front to a call in JGit rather than permanent code in EGit

For internal use within the class an enum will be much better thatn this. For the API we should use strings.
