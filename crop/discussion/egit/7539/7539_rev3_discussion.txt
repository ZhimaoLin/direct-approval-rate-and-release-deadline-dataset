The preference affects more tabs hence it's better how we do it on the Git page. On the CVS tab, it's acceptable because it is close to the preference that allows to disable decorations (Git does not have that).

Hm, it was already merged in the meantime with change Iaa1002d69cb7b2fa3f80e52b8b42b1e07a5eb6d1. But please don't revert the whole change, the other things should be good.

I can also live with that solution but I would have expected that I get at least asked to review that change since it is a follow-up / change of "my" fix.

Yes, sorry for forgetting that. I wasn't expecting it to get merged so quickly :).
