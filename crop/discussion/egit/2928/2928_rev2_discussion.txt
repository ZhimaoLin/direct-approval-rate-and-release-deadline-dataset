DESCRIPTION

Proper result dialog when pulling from multiple Repositories

The dialog presents a list of Repositories and an overview about fetch
and update (merge/rebase) results for each Repository. Users can drill
down and see detailed information (i.e. the "normal" PullResultDialog)
by selecting a line in the list and hitting a "Details" button.

This also enables pull for multiple Repositories in the Git
Repositories View.
