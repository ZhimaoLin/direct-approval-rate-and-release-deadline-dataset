Patch Set 4:

- on Mac this only shows borders on the left and right edges, so it rather looks like rounded brackets instead of a border, not sure if this is what you intended
- the yellow and orange colors you picked are hard to distinguish

Patch Set 4:

That look on mac was not intended, it is supposed to be an outline all the way around.

Can you post a screenshot of the current history view on Mac as well?
