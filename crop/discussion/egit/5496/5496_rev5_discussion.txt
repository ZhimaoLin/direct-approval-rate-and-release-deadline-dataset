Patch Set 5:

I updated the sizing a bit, here is how it looks on Linux: http://img.skitch.com/20120401-qupsapitb18dbqhksim5ac2rq6.png

Hopefully it won't crop the borders on Mac anymore.

I picked yellow & orange for the colors of lightweight and annotated tags since it looked like the current behavior colored them similarly.
