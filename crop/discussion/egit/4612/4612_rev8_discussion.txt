DESCRIPTION

Add cherry pick action to commit editor toolbar

This moves the bulk of the logic of the cherry pick handler
to a class in the commit.command package and updates the
history handler to forward to the new commit handler.

This also adds a confirmation dialog telling the user what
branch the commit will be cherry-picked on top of.
