DESCRIPTION

Add cherry pick action to commit editor toolbar

This moves the bulk of the logic of the cherry pick handler
to a class in the commit.command package and updates the
history handler to forward to the new commit handler.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

It would be great if we could have some unit tests that will prevent from braking this functionality in future.

Patch Set 4:

what's the reason to move the logic to the commit.command package ?

Patch Set 4:

The reasoning is that the current cherry pick handler in the history package is coupled to the history view and currently cannot function with a handle to the view.

The handler should only require a commit to operate and that packaged seemed most appropriate.
