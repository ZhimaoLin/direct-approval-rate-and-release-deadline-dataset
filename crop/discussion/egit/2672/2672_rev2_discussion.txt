DESCRIPTION

Fix CommitOperationTest on Mac

A Thread.sleep(1100) between commit and performing the next
change seems to be required on file systems with time stamp resolution
of 1s. The workaround can be removed when GitIndex is removed from
CommitOperation.

Patch Set 2:

That would also apply to Linux. Even if some Linux file systems, like XFS, have better resolution the JDK on most drops the sub-seconds parts. For some reason I recall having seen subsecond resolution in Java on Linux, but I've been unable to figure which JDK it was (on Mandriva).
