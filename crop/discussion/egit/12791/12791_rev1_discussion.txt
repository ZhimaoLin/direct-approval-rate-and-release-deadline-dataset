See bug 335082 for UI comments.

As for the change in general, I'm not sure we should include this in 3.0 this late in the cycle. What do others think?

- nice improvement
- I think we should include it in 3.0 if we do so soon
- the icon overlay doesn't look like rename, I'd rather use something arrow'ish, e.g. we could use the blue arrow from the clone toolbar button in the repositories view as an overlay
- the compare editor should show the full path of the file versions at least in the case when a file moved to another folder
