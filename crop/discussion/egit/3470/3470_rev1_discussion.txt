DESCRIPTION

Fix exception in isEnabled of CompareIndexWithHeadActionHandler

This fixes the following exception currently happening each time the
context menu of a Git-shared project is opened:

  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Empty path not permitted.

This happened in isStaged because resRelPath is "" when a project is at
the root of the repository.
