MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/ProjectReferenceTest.java -> I would name it smth like createFromValidString, avoiding test* pattern.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:23, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/ProjectReferenceTest.java -> I would also use single assert per test. This way it's clear - one problem is the cause for one and only one broken test.

Now, if you have problems with asserts #1 and #4, test will break after #1 and you have to fix it first and only then you'll find out that there is another problem.
