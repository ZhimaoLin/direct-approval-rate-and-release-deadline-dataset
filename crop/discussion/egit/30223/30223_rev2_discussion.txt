DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Don't show old diff while calculation the new one

While format job is preparing the new diff data, the diff area still
shows the diff of the previously selected file and history view is in
inconsistent state. This commit simply resets the text area until the
format job will provide new data for selected file.
