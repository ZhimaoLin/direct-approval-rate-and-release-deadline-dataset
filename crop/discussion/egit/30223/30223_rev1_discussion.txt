DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Don't show old diff while calculation the new one

While format job is preparing the new diff data, the diff area still
shows the diff of the previously selected file and history view is in
inconsistent state. This commit simply resets the text area until the
format job will provide new data for selected file.

I tried a few things but couldn't reproduce the problem. Could you describe when this is visible?

Patch Set 1:

This is visible if you create breakpoint in the org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.history.FormatJob.run().

The mentioned inconsistency is probably not visible in real life for average repositories, but on huge repositories/huge commit messages it can be observed.

Thanks, had another look now.

I now notice that the message area quickly flashes when I move from commit to commit. It didn't do that before, and I actually prefer the old way.

Could we show the progress in a different way, maybe by setting the view to busy? That would only flash the view title..

The change is not important for me (just found it odd to see the old content on new selection), so if you have problems we can just skip this.
