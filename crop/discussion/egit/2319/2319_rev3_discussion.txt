Patch Set 3:

Rebased the change set

>Assuming that bug tracker and git repository reside on the same host is an over-simplification which e.g. fails for Eclipse

This is true, but if repository url is not provided at all, things go even worse. 
Mylyn will use first repository provider which will say that it found something like task id in commit message.

I've made this url resolving optional now, so if nothing matches, the adapter will return null as before.

For bugs.eclipse.org Open Corresponding task works if full bug url is pasted into commit message.

What do you think if repository url will be read from some special config entry? For example 'bugtracker.url'

please fix line endings, diffs are currently rendered useless by wrong line endings. We use UTF-8 text encoding and unix text file line delimiters (LF) (see Eclipse Preferences > General > Workspace)

Assuming that bug tracker and repository are on the same host IMHO doesn't work (at least it doesn't work for any of the projects I am participating in). I think we need to store the association between bug tracker base url and git repository. Assuming that all bugs for a given repository are tracked in the same bug tracker seems reasonable to me. Maybe we should simply store this as a repository configuration parameter ?

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> fix user name as mentioned in comment for patchset 2

Patch Set 3:

@Matthias 'Maybe we should simply store this as a repository configuration parameter ?'

Subversion provides a property bugtraq:url (eg https://codebeamer.com/cb/proj/tracker/itemDetails.do?task_id=%BUGID%) thus it can be figured out where the issue tracker host is.

We would like to see the upcoming egit support 'Open Corresponding Task' support because that is import not just for us but also for our customers.
