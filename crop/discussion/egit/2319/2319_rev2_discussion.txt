This change looks like it's based on change I2d265c8b. Don't mix up your change with Benny's as they are done by different authors. To resolve this issue rebase your change onto change I2d265c8b. Let me know if you need help with that.

Assuming that bug tracker and git repository reside on the same host is an over-simplification which e.g. fails for Eclipse

Line:7, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/MylynCommitMessageProvider.java -> how is this related to your change ?

Line:21, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> - why do you switch from package dependency to bundle dependency ?
- why do you switch version range ?

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> please give your name without "_" and with proper case : s/Aniyah Best/Carla Osborn/ as this is meant for the human reader
