DESCRIPTION

Bug 513247 - a DropAdapter for GitHub URLs to clone GitHub repo

GitCloneDropAdapter will currently check to see if the URL includes
"github" as a verification. You are able to drag and drop a Git URL into
a running workspace to spawn a Clone Git wizard.

I've done some preliminary changes that reflect most of the comments about my patch. I will work more on the sanitiziation, gitUrlHandler as well as the startup technique once that is more formally discussed.
