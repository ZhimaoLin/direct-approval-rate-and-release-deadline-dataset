DESCRIPTION

Open the clone wizard when a git URL is dropped anywhere on Eclipse

Created new GitUrlChecker class that allows for checking strings to
see if it is a proper git URL. You are now able to drag and drop a git
URL into a running workspace to spawn a clone wizard (implemented by
GitCloneDropAdapter).

GitCloneDropAdapter is copied from MarketplaceDropAdapter with minor
modifications (run clone wizard, resolve compiler warnings, improve a
misleading exception handler).
