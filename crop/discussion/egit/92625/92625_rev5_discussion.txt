DESCRIPTION

Created new GitUrlChecker class that allows for checking strings to
see if it is a proper eGit URL. You are now able to drag and drop a Git
URL into a running workspace to spawn a Clone Git wizard (implemented by
GitCloneDropAdapter).

Hi Tom,

I took all your comments and have pushed a fix for them. However, I wasn't able to test the multiline bug as when I try to drag and drop a link that isn't from my browser, Eclipse doesn't take it as a drag object. Hopefully you could run a quick test to see if it is fixed and if not, perhaps you can let me know how you have been testing that?
