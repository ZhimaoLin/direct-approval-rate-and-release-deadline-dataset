DESCRIPTION

Handle linked resources in the same repository

This already worked kind of if both the link source and the link target
were in EGit-managed projects. It didn't work if the link target was in
the same repository, but not in a project.

* ResourceUtil.getRepository(IPath):don't even try the
  RepositoryMapping. If one only needs the repository, going through the
  RepositoryCache is sufficient, and assuming there are less
  repositories than projects and RepositoryMappings, which in my
  experience is usually the case, also faster.
* Add a new operation to get the repository relative path to
  ResourceUtil.
* Make GitResourceDeltaVisitor handle linked resources.
