DESCRIPTION

Clean up "Replace With..." actions

Replace deprecated <objectContribution>s by command/handler combos.
Remove now unused legacy actions.

"Replace with HEAD" and "Replace With Index" also work on multiple
repositories. Change the resourcesAllInRepository property test to also
handle repository property tests in order to be able to test the isSafe
property.

Restrict the "Replace with Previous" to tracked resources; on untracked
resources it would only open a dialog telling the user that there was
no previous revision. Which is correct, but then why allow trying to
execute the command at all?

Visual change: previously, "Replace with HEAD" and "Replace With Index"
did not appear on a WorkingSet containing projects from several
repositories. Now they do. It's unclear to me why they didn't before,
and in any case they also appeared before on WorkingSets containing
projects from a single repository. Both commands are and were active
when projects from several repositories were selected.
