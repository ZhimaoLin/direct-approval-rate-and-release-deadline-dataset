DESCRIPTION

Depend on org.hamcrest via Import-Package instead of Require bundle

It is the preferred way to declare dependencies and that way we don't
depend on the bundle being supplied via SWTBot, but can use the one 
that comes with Eclipse in case SWTBot change. Hamcrest is neeeded
by JUnit 4. Also fix syntax of version specifications.
