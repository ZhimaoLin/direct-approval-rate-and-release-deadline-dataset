DESCRIPTION

Git Repositories View UI Tests II

Second part: reactivate the tests in test class GitRepositoriesViewTest and
fix the productive code accordingly.
The "Open Properties" command had to be adjusted and the corresponding
method in RepositoriesView. The changes in uitext.properties are adding
keyboard shortcuts that are being used in the test to activate radio buttons.
