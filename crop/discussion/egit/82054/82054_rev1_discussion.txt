DESCRIPTION

Fix in Git Repositories View update

That view was updated on any preference change in the plugin's
preferences. That's actually unnecessary, all this view cares about is
changes to the list of configured repositories.

Cherry-picked from master commit 8a7e9a13.

Patch Set 1:

We get many unstable builds on stable-4.5 due to failures in the repo view UI tests. It appears that this change from master actually fixes those failures (at least I haven't seen any build fail because of that on master since it has been merged there). Therefore I propose that we do this in stable-4.5, too. Note that it may cause a merge conflict when merging back to master due to the Runnable/lambda difference.
