DESCRIPTION

Git Repositories View: performance optimization

The view is currently refreshed after each repository
change event. Instead, the refresh should be deferred
by a second or so in order to avoid too many refreshes.
Another optimization is for the hasChildren() method
of the content provider.
Finally, some tracing was added for the refresh.
