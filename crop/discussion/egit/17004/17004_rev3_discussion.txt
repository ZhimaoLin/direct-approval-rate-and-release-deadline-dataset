DESCRIPTION

Fix "overlaps the location of another project" when importing

Given the following:

* Git repository containing a .project at the root of the repository
* .project contains "foo" as project name
* Repository is called "bar" on the server

Do the following:

1. Start the Git import wizard
2. Clone the repository directly into the workspace (e.g. /home/ws and
   clone destination is /home/ws/bar)
3. Select "Import existing projects"
4. Finish

Expected: The project is successfully imported
Actual: Error "/home/ws/bar overlaps the location of another project:
bar"

This change fixes it by using the same logic as platform uses, see
WizardProjectsImportPage.ProjectRecord.
