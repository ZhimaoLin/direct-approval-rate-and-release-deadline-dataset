DESCRIPTION

Add "Show Annotations" to ruler menu of revision editor

For a file editor that was opened e.g. from the history view using "Open
This Version", the ruler menu now also includes "Show Annotations". It
opens the annotations in a new editor, I couldn't figure out how to
reuse the same editor. But better than not having it.
