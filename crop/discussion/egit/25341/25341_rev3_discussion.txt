DESCRIPTION

Fix "Open This Version" for file deleted in commit

In case of a deleted file, use "Open Previous Version" as the menu
label. Also change the text of "Compare With Version in Ancestor" to
match the "previous" terminology (which is also used in the Compare With
menu).

Patch Set 3:

It has happened quite a few times that I wanted to open the previous version, especially when using a filtered history and its not clear how to find that version.
