retriggering the build didn't help since I bumped the version to 4.2.0-SNAPSHOT last night and the EGit build jobs now use this version of JGit, hence your change didn't compile anymore since it was based on a an earlier 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT version.

I rebased your change on origin/master which should fix this
