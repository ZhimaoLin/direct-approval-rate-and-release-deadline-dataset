DESCRIPTION

Remove discouraged access warnings from github bundles

Both the egit.github.* and mylyn.github.* bundles are managed together
with egit in the same repository. It seams reasonable to allow x-friend
access to egit internal packages in the same manner that other egit
bundles allow this, since incompatible changes will immediately lead to
compile errors.

The change only adds x-friends for actually existing discouraged access
warnings from *.github.* to *.egit.* (somewhat more than 100 warnings,
that are now gone). It does not fix any other discouraged access to
platform or mylyn.core.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not really. All the github bundles are in a separate repository and have been basically unmaintained since the original developers are no longer active on that project.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> And if that does occur, we will need to remember to update the feature dependency to egit in org.eclipse.mylyn.github-feature/feature.xml. I notice it still specifies >= 3.2.0. OTOH, the target platform in github.target uses EGit nightly.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> yes, unfortunately contribution rate to egit-github dropped dramatically when Kevin stopped maintaining it. We get few contributions (mostly for the github client) once in a while and I keep creating releases whenever I release a new version of egit.

@Michael: would you be interested to help maintaining egit-github ?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> oops, I didn't notice that when creating egit-github releases since 3.2, will try to remember this for new releases
