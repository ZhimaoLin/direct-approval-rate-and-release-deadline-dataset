DESCRIPTION

Refactor GitHistoryPage

Explicitly clear contained views (CommitFileDiffViewer and
CommitMessageViewer) by setting fields to 'null'. When used, throw an
IllegalStateException if a field is 'null'. This prevents strange
effects caused by outdated references that are hard to debug.

Call 'showHead', 'showRef' and 'showTag' only after the commit graph
has been initialized/ updated (initAndStartRevWalk).
