DESCRIPTION

Fix GenerateHistoryJob running forever

GenerateHistoryJob can run forever and therefore the History
view leaks memory. This can happen when the find toolbar
is enabled (incremental loading) and the number of commits is
greater than the maximum number to display.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Hi Marc-Andre,

the change fixes the bug.
But I see two issues with this change:

- When the search toolbar is not switched on, the box "The list is incomplete" does not go away when I scroll down to the first commit. incomplete always stays true
- When the search toolbar is switched on, the incremental load only works once. Afterwards both incomplete and
lastIncomplete are true and the redraw is not done in updateUI
