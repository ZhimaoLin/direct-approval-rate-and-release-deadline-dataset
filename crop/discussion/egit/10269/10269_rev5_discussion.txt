Works very well, I'm quite happy with this solution. See minor inline comments.

Also, the copyright is not yet updated in all files.

Line:487, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Hm, a new preference page only for this? Maybe we could add it to "Projects"?

Line:305, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Should the listener also be removed again in stop()?

Line:1054, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> "Automatically ignore derived resources" would be a bit less "techy". Maybe we could also append something like " (add to .gitignore)" or mention it in the tooltip to make it clear which "ignore" is meant here.

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/op/ConnectProviderOperationTest.java -> Could this also use the isIgnored which is now exposed because of the previous change?
