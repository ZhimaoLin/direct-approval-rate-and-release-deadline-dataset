Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Seems to work.

Line:329, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> How is this useful. autoIgnoreDerived never returns false

Line:358, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Shouldn't we inform the user when we modifiy files?

Line:329, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> will be fed from a new preference (todo) to allow switching off auto-ignore

Line:358, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> good question, opening a dialog seems too intrusive, we could log that to a git console which was suggested already in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=399776

Line:314, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> I'm guessing this should access a preference in the future?

Line:314, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> exactly that's what I meant with the TODO in the commit message
