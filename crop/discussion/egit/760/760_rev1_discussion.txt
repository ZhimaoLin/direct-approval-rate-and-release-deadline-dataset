DESCRIPTION

Make dependency on wikitext bundles optional

We only need the wikitext jars during maven build when updating the help
content from the egit wiki. If these dependencies are not optional the
installation of egit fails on Eclipse installations that do not have
wikitext.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Verified that starting from empty local maven repo the help content download still works from maven build still works
and that result can be installed on Helios without having wikitext installed.
