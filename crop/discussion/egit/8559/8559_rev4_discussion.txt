DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] Improve support for logical models in Compare With operation

When comparing a file with another branch, tag or reference, take the
model providers into account and launch the synchronize perspective
instead of comparing the single, selected file into a compare editor
if this file is part of a model spanning more than one resource.
