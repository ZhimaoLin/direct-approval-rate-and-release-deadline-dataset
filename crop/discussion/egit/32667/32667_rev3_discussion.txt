Robin, thanks for the hint. While making modifications you described I /accidentally/ refactored part of the GitLabelProvider. Maybe I went a little too far with the scope of these changes. I'll rollback them and try less destructive approach or move them into separate commit if necessary.

the decoration looks good and consistent now :-)

please move the refactoring moving label creation into a new class into a separate change

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitLabels.java -> as you moved that code from another class you should list the original author(s) here
