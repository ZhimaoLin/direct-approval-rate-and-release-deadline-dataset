There's a difference between repo and staging view: http://i.imgur.com/sVXLTwF.png

In that case, I actually like the staging view variant better. To use the same format, I'd recommend this:

* repo view uses GitLabelProvider.getStyledTextFor. Change that to match the format of the staging view in the above image
* extract the part that does "repo [branch - status]" into its own method and use that from the staging view (call getString on its result)
