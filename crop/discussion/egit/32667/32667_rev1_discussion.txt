Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

such decorations are shown in different places though not using a consistent format:

* decorator on e.g. package explorer shows "[<repo name>|<state> <branch>"
* decoration on repository in repositories view shows "<repo name> [<branch> - <state>]
* your new decoration in staging view shows "<repo name> [<branch>]|<state>

I think the decoration should be the same at least for repositories view and staging view, I would suggest to use the format currently used in repositories view also in the staging view.

Thanks for feedback, Matthias. Maybe it worth updating "project explorer" decorator to use "repository view" format too?

Regarding project explorer decoration:

The whole decoration there is inside a pair of "[]" already, so I wouldn't add another pair of "[]" inside that.

Moving the repository state to the end would be an option, although we would need to change the format for that, see Preferences > Team > Git > Label Decorations > Text Decorations, where "{repository}" also includes the state.

So, +1 to Matthias' suggestion. Regarding project explorer, we should look at it in another change/bug.
