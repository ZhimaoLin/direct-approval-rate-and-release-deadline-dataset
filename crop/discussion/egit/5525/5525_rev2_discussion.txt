DESCRIPTION

Close Synchronize View after each synchronize test

We frequently observe failing synchronize tests timing out when looking
for some widget, typically re-running the failed test separately without
repeating all the tests in the test suite succeeds. Closing the
synchronize view between tests seems to reduce the chance of
interferences between synchronize tests when they are all run in one
test run.
