Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I think this change can be made much smaller by doing the logic as in my inline comment.

Line:151, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> I think we should simply check if the branch is checked out here in this class instead of changing the wizard and wizard page. Repository.getBranch().equals(newRefName)  should actually do the job.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I guess this is for bug 338660, please add it.
