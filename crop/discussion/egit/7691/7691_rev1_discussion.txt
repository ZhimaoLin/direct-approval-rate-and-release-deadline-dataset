Line:130, README.md -> Done.

I wonder though if it would not be better to have this information in the wiki, where it is maybe less likely to become outdated.

Don't we have a green/red/orange table of Git feature coverage somewhere? I couldn't find it in the wiki.

Line:130, README.md -> that's true, the table so far was only available in release docuware as part of the release review document

If you think this would be useful I can upload it to the wiki. I first tried to maintain it as a shared Google document but the table formatting didn't really work so I maintain this in a local powerpoint :( Still it's a manually maintained coarse table which doesn't rely on technical checks. There was a GSoC project to improve this but the student failed to create any useful results :(

Line:130, README.md -> It would be a good thing to have I think, to point people to. It doesn't have to be in a table, if the markup for that is hard to edit, a colored bullet list or something like that would also work. And when it's in the wiki, everybody can keep it up-to-date.
