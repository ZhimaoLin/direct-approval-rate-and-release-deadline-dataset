MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Apologies if my first comment wasn't clear, but the first line of the commit message should be a concise summary of the changes made.

If you were fixing a freeze you wouldn't describe your fix as "EGit must not must freeze".  Instead you would write something like "Remove deadlock during clones of multiple repositories".

I'm really not trying to be picky about this, it is just about a general level of consistency and readability when other developers and users are looking at the changes being made.

I do appreciate you contributing this change and I believe that the fix you submitted should be applied.
