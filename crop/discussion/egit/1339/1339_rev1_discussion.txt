DESCRIPTION

Fix for NPE while opening CompareView for oldes commit in ChangeSet

We were here to strongly relay on JGti API and it caching. According to
Shawn's mail[1] JGit disposes commit body when we 'thinks' that it isn't
usable any more. Therefore we should always re-parse RevCommit objects
before we want to obtain data from them.
