DESCRIPTION

Test stability: really shut down repositories

Otherwise, repositories from previous tests may remain registered, and
may at some later point found to have gone and a new refresh of the
repo view may be scheduled.

As a result, we may have asynchronous refreshes that occur during SWT
bot tests, and tree nodes disappear at unpredictable moments.
