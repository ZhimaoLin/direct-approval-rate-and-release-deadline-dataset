DESCRIPTION

Test stability: really shut down repositories

Otherwise, repositories from previous tests may remain registered, and
may at some later point found to have gone and a new refresh of the
repo view may be scheduled.

As a result, we may have asynchronous refreshes that occur during SWT
bot tests, and tree nodes disappear at unpredictable moments.

Also: in commitNonWSChangesTest, repo view is opened after a commit and
thus must also wait until the repo view refresh is over before trying to
find tree nodes.
