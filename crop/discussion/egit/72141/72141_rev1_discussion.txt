Patch Set 1:

Supposed to fix https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/8520/testReport/junit/org.eclipse.egit.ui.view.repositories/GitRepositoriesViewTest/testImportWizard/ . Though I must admit I don't fully see what had happened there. The test selects a node in the repositories view, then opens a dialog, does some things there,and the closes the dialog. I don't quite see why this would cause a repo view refresh.
