DESCRIPTION

Action Reactoring (AbstractOperationAction)

AbstractOperationAction currently executes operations in ModalContext.
Furthermore the createOperation method has an untyped parameter
which resulted in operations with untyped parameter.
AbstractOperationAction and AbstractRevObjectAction were replaced by
AbstractResourceOperationAction and AbstractRevCommitOperationAction.
These new action base classes provide type safe operation creation and 
execute the operation using a Job.

Patch Set 1:

Scheduling rules makes me happy.

Line:28, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/IEGitOperation.java -> Spec that 'null' is a valid return value.

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/AddToIndexAction.java -> Avoid using Display.getDefault() where possible. It can cause problems on win32. Use StatusManager or ask the workbench for the display (PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay()). Generally I'd frown upon getting the display that way but it's better than Display.getDefault().
