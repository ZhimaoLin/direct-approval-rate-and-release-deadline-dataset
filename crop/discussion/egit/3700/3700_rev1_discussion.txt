DESCRIPTION

Minor changes to site.xml for easier local build.

Each time I build the update site locally using the editor for site.xml
that file gets changed. These changes are minor or cosmetic and do not
break or change anything. Putting these changes in master will make building
the update site locally easier because it will not dirty the working dir
(since other generated files are ignored).
