I have some concerns about new LocationPage class header

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/LocationPage.java -> IMHO you should preserve authorship for previous company ... but I could be wrong ...

Line:10, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/LocationPage.java -> IMHO you should also mention that this was extracted from GitCreatePatchWizard
