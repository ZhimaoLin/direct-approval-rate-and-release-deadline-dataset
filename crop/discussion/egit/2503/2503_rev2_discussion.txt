DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Implement a "Switch to..." action

This adds a dynamic "Switch to..." sub-menu to the team menu that
allows to switch directly to any local branch or (with a "Other...")
button allows to open the current "Branch..." dialog to select a tag
or remote tracking branch.

The number of dynamically created items is limited to 20, but the user
can still open the "Other..." sub-menu to switch to a local branch
that is not in the list.

Another action "New Branch..." opens the CreateBranch wizard so that
the user can create and check out a new branch directly.

Patch Set 2:

As for the remarks in the last review:

1. We can not check out selectively for the selected projects, so I think letting the user select only a single project would be less confusing (we have many actions like this already in the team menu, so I believe people are getting used to that over time).

2. Branch names are sorted now.

Can you verify the changes in uitext.properties - there seems to be a lot of messages added which aren't part of this change set?

Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> This could be a configurable value in the future - some people have bigger screens than others

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Why is Reference capitalised and branch and tag are not?

Line:798, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> What's the significance of the hashes in this message?

Line:974, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Why do we have commit messages in here if we are implementing  'switch to'?

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> Is this an eGit convention? I'd have used  baseref == null ? null : baseref.getName()  to avoid the negation.

Line:117, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> This doc has changed, but no code diffs. Is there any code which has a dependency on it?
