DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Implement a "Switch to..." action

This adds a dynamic "Switch to..." sub-menu to the team menu that
allows to switch directly to any local branch or (with a "Other...")
button allows to open the current "Branch..." dialog to select a tag
or remote tracking branch.

The number of dynamically created items is limited to 20, but the user
can still open the "Other..." sub-menu to switch to a local branch
that is not in the list.

Another action "New Branch..." opens the CreateBranch wizard so that
the user can create and check out a new branch directly.

Looks good, but I'm not sure whether the 'create branch page/wizard' document changes are supposed to be part of this changeset?

Line:46, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchWizard.java -> Is this comment change supposed to be part of this changeset?

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> I'd personally rather see an == null rather than a != null and then flip the branches mentally, which was the original thought (rather than using an in-line tertiary if operator vs an if statement), in other words:

if(baseref==null)
  this.mybaseref = null
else
  this.mybaseref = baseref.getName()

or

this.mybaseref = (baseref==null ? null : baseref.getName())

I'm fine with the ? operator though

Patch Set 4:

Regarding documentation: out documenation is not checked into the respository, but maintained in the wiki and copied from there when a new version is released. Normally, we do an update of the wiki shortly before the next version is released thus avoiding too much discrepancies between the current release and the wiki.
So yes, we should update the documentation, but not just yet.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I'm looking forward for having this feature in EGit it is more useful then "Checkout" dialog.
