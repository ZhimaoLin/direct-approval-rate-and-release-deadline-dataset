DESCRIPTION

Implement a "Switch to..." action

This adds a dynamic "Switch to..." sub-menu to the team menu that
allows to switch directly to any local branch or (with an "Other...")
button allows to open the current "Branch..." dialog to select a tag
or remote tracking branch.

The number of dynamically created items is limited to 20, but the user
can still open the "Other..." sub-menu to switch to a local branch
that is not in the list or to a tag etc.

Another action "New Branch..." opens the CreateBranch wizard so that
the user can create and check out a new branch directly.

Line:2401, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> White space style nit

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> I think that in feature this should be configurable via preferences.

Patch Set 7:

I suggest to add the preferences separately, as it requires some more changes: we have to add this to a Git Preference page so that users can change this.
