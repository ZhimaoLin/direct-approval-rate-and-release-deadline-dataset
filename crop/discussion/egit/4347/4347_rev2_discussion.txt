DESCRIPTION

Implement DiscardChangesOperation in an efficient way

DiscardChangesOperation was very slow because it executed one
CheckoutCommand per resource. Now it executes one CheckoutCommand per
repository.

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> What's the purpose of this loop ? 

I suspect it is no longer needed as you map resources to repositories using the new ResourceUtil class called from discardChanges().

If this is correct also method getRepository(IResource resource) can be removed.

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> The purpose of this loop is checking for files that do not belong to a Git repository. The later called code ignores such files.
