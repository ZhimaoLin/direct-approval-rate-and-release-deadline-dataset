DESCRIPTION

Silently skip EFS resources

Exclude projects located on an EFS from EGit's auto-sharing.

Also, it makes no sense to log an error in RepositoryFinder when
getLocation() == null. That doesn't necessarily mean the resource
didn't exist; it could be provided through an EFS. This is true for
projects as well other resources (the RepositoryFinder might consider
linked resources, and those might be linked through an EFS.)

EGit, like other team providers, cannot really deal with EFSs.
