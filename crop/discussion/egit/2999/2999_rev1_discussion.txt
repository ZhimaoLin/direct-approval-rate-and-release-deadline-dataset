DESCRIPTION

[sync] Enable Workspace model by default

According to discussion we had in bug 326767 I've decided to activate
Workspace model by default instead of Git Change Set model.

This commit also fixes an issue in
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.members method with was causing
misleading results in Workspace model.

Additionally this change includes also UI tests cases for both
Workspace and Git Change Set models. Common parts was moved into
AbstractSynchronizeViewTest.
