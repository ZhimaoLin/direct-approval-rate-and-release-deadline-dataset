Patch Set 1: No score; No score



Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitMessageViewer.java -> I would prefer COLOR_DARK_GREEN since GREEN is very light and hard to read on white background. 

Maybe colors could be also made configurable in another step via preferences. Think about red-green color blind users.
