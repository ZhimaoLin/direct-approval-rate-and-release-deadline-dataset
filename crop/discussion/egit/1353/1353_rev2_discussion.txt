DESCRIPTION

Compare editors opened from 'Synchronize' view has incorrect tooltip

GitModelCommit currently returns 'null' for its getFullPath() method
which means that user sees 'null' when hovering over the compare
editor's tab. The user should be able to check which folder the
compared file is in from that tooltip.
