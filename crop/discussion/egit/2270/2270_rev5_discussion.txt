DESCRIPTION

Unified commit message creation

Commit message is now only calculated in method
calculateCommitMessage, amending and merging states are handled there.
If someone presses the Amend-button, then the commit message is
replaced with the previous message, not expanded with the previous
message.
Prevent returning null when no EGit-Mylyn-Bridge is installed.
