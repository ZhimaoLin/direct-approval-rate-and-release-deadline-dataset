DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary runtime dependency on wikitext for doc bundle

We don't actually benefit from having wikitext present at runtime, so
drop the require-bundle directives and instead pull wikitext in as a
purely build-time dependency of the antrun plugin.

Also regenerate documentation with the new wikitext version.

Line:181, org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/Git_For_Eclipse_Users/Git-For-Eclipse-Users.html -> This is a bug in Mylyn wikitext; it gets confused by '''''Note''': more text'', which should render as

  <i><b>Note</b>: more text</i>

and which _is_ rendered as such on-wiki (though perhaps only because MediaWiki usually runs tidy over its HTML output to fix most errors).

Line:27, org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/New_and_Noteworthy/4.8/4.8.html -> Compared to base, there is one line removed. "This release has not yet been created". I just checked, and the org.eclipse.egit.doc_4.8.0.201706111038-r bundle indeed claims the 4.8 release had not yet been created ;-)

I think that bit should be fixed for 4.8.1, too. Not the refactoring of the toolchain, but maybe just regenerate the doc before releasing 4.8.1.

Line:703, org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/User_Guide/Reference.html -> I've fixed this on-wiki; should be ''' in wikitext and render as

  <b>Commit</b> or <b>Commit and Push</b> button.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:27, org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/EGit/New_and_Noteworthy/4.8/4.8.html -> I know, I noticed this shortly after I released 4.8 and fixed it in the wiki
