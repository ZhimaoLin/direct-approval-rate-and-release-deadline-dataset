DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary runtime dependency on wikitext for doc bundle

We don't actually benefit from having wikitext present at runtime, so
drop the require-bundle directives and instead pull wikitext in as a
purely build-time dependency of the antrun plugin.

Also regenerate documentation with the new wikitext version.

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.doc/pom.xml -> I think it was needed until now because wikitext was in the target platform (as opposed to being a maven dependency). But with this change, it should no longer be necessary.
