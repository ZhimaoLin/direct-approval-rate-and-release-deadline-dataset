DESCRIPTION

Dispose two leaked images in SwitchToMenu

Image instances that are explicitly created need to be disposed
of or else SWT will eventually run out of handles and not be
able to create new widgets and resources. The images should be
disposed of when the contribution item itself is disposed.
