DESCRIPTION

Improvements and fixes for clone wizard

- Allow repository search result to be passed to AbstractGitCloneWizard
and GitCloneWizard. The repository location page is skipped in this
case. If the search result provides a WizardPage, then it's shown,
otherwise the result is directly evaluated.
- As a side effect, this restores URI paste support in repositories view
- Skip repository location page if there's only one clone source
provider with a fixed location
