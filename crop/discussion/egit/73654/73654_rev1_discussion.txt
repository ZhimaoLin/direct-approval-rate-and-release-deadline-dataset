DESCRIPTION

Test stability: wait for index diff cache update

Apparently the DisconnectConnectTest.testDecorations() not always waits
long enough for the decorations to appear. Decorations are triggered by
an index diff cache update, so let's wait for that first, and only then
for the decoration job.

Patch Set 1:

Hudson is super-flaky currently. A Java core dump yesterday[1], and now super-strange failures and super-slow tests.

I wonder about two things:
* what's the memory usage on the machine our HIPP runs on?
* are we running out of disk space?

I notice that HIPP seems to be quite a bit over its disk space limit:

> From:    xxx@xxx.xxx
> Subject: [cross-project-issues-dev] Disk usage report for Hudson/Build
>
> -> Usage exceeding 1GB for: /shared (1000G capacity) (2016-05-25T10:00)
> 1210.1G hipp

That would be about 20% over the capacity?? Either this report is meaningless, or something's definitely wrong with the infrastructure.

It used to be fairly stable around 400-500G until February 3, 2016, jumped to about 880G by February 24, and has since then been in the range 975 to 1075G.
