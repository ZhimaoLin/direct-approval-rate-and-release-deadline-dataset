DESCRIPTION

Test stability: wait for index diff cache update

Apparently the DisconnectConnectTest.testDecorations() not always waits
long enough for the decorations to appear. Decorations are triggered by
an index diff cache update, so let's wait for that first, and only then
for the decoration job.

I restarted Hudson, it seems this improved the situation. You can restart it from HIPP control in https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php
