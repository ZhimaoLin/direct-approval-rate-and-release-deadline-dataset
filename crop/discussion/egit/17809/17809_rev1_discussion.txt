DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Add Show In > History to file diff pane

This is useful for showing the history of a deleted file. Note that this
depends on the fix for bug 418275 in Platform UI, which will be
available in Eclipse 4.4. For older versions, the commit can be opened
in the commit viewer, where Show In > History is available.
