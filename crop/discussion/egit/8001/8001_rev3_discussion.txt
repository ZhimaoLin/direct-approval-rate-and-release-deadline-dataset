DESCRIPTION

Hard wrap should insert line breaks after user finishes editing

In the old implementation, hard-wrapping interfered with the user's
typing. This fix uses a segment listener on the StyledText to give a
preview of the final wrapping, and it only inserts the additional line
delimiters when the user commits the message.
