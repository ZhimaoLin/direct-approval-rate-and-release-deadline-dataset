DESCRIPTION

[sync] Move partial change from HEAD to index

Allow to replace partial change in staged file version with version from
HEAD. Such behavior is available for file versions in '<staged changes>'
node in the 'Git Commits' model.

This change covers the following use case: imagine the situation that
you staged a whole file where you changed two or more lines. Then you
would like to replace one of those lines with the version in HEAD.

As a side effect users can also move around changes when Compare editor
was launched from 'Compare With > Git Index with HEAD'
