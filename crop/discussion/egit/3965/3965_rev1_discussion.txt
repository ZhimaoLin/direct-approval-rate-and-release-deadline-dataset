DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Add preference for showing file names first

This option shows the file name followed by the folder
that the file is in using the qualifier style.

This mode is similar to how libraries/dependencies are
shown for projects in the Package Explorer view.

This option can be toggled from the Staging view toolbar
dropdown menu.
