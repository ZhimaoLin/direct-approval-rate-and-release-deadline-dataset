DESCRIPTION

Enable global actions in CommitEditorPage

The global actions for "copy" and "select all" in the
CommitFileDiffViewers in the CommitEditorPage and StashEditorPage were
not enabled, and thus the accelerators for these actions didn't work.

Use the new GlobalActionHandler to enable them and broker between the
viewers.
