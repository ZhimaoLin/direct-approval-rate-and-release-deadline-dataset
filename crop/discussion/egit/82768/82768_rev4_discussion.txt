DESCRIPTION

Enable global actions in CommitEditorPage

The global actions for "copy" and "select all" in the
CommitFileDiffViewers in the CommitEditorPage and StashEditorPage were
not enabled, and thus the accelerators for these actions didn't work.

Use the new GlobalActionHandler to enable them and broker between the
viewers.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-2

Not good enough. Works nicely in one editor, but not when there are several. Looks like this needs a somewhat different mechanism and an IEditorActionBarContributor after all.

Abandoned

Wrong idea. Superseded.
