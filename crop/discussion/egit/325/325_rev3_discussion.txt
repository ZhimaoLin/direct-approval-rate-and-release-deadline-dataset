DESCRIPTION

Implement Team->Add to Index action

An initial implementation for the Team->Add to Index action is 
provided. GitIndex is used in the implementation (similar to Add 
To Index in CommitDialog).
The action does not modify the index if the index contains staged 
content. Later GitIndex should be replaced by using DirCache.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

I hesitate to submit the change because I would prefer a dialog when the repo is in state conflict and "add to index" it not yet supported.
