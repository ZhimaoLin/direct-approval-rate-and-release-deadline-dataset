DESCRIPTION

Implement Team->Add to Index action

An initial implementation for the Team->Add to Index action is provided.
GitIndex is used in the implementation (similar to Add To Index in CommitDialog).
The action does not modify the index if the index contains staged content.
Later GitIndex should be replaced by using DirCache.
