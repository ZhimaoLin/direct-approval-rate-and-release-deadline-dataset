DESCRIPTION

Implement Team->Add to Index action

An initial implementation for the Team->Add to Index action is 
provided. GitIndex is used in the implementation (similar to Add 
To Index in CommitDialog).
The action does not modify the index if the index contains staged 
content. Later GitIndex should be replaced by using DirCache.
