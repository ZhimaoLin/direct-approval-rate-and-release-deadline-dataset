DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Make "Delete Repository..." more explicit

It now requires the user to explicitly check that the .git dir should be
deleted before the dialog can be confirmed. It also displays a warning
that the deletion is permanent and changes some labels for clarity.

The paths are now shown below the checkbox for better alignment and to
make them selectable (see "Delete Project" where this is also done).

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

It's odd that the first checkbox "Delete Git repository data and history" can be deselected, in this case the ok button is disabled, also the warning in the header doesn't apply if this option isn't selected.

When the repository contains only 1 project the grammar of the last option's text is wrong, it should be singular s/Remove 1 projects that belong/Remove 1 project that belongs/

Patch Set 1:

The idea is that deleting .git has to be a conscious action from the user (by selecting the checkbox). When it's not selected, the action can not be executed at all (because nothing would be done). Do you think we should only allow the user to select it, but not deselect it?

About the grammar of the message, it was like this before this change, but I can change it too.
