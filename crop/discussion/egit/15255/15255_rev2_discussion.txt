DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Make "Delete Repository..." more explicit

It now requires the user to explicitly check that the .git dir should be
deleted before the dialog can be confirmed. It also displays a warning
that the deletion is permanent and changes some labels for clarity.

The paths are now shown below the checkbox for better alignment and to
make them selectable (see "Delete Project" where this is also done).

Patch Set 2:

Maybe we could reverse the order of questions

- Remove repository from view
- Delete working directory (cannot completely be undone if there are uncommitted changes)
- Delete Git repository (cannot be undone)

and enable the OK button if any of these is checked, this way this dialog would provide all possible permutations and we could also consider to remove the context menu entry "Remove repository from view".  Also it wouldn't be necessary to make the 3rd option read-only after checking it. What do you think ?

Patch Set 2:

"Remove repository from view" can currently be executed with selection of more than one element (e.g. select all > remove). We would have to lose this or make the "Delete" also work for multiple repos, but that would complicate the dialog even more.

I currently like that the non-dangerous option (remove from view) is clearly separated from the dangerous delete options.

In the suggested dialog, I'm not sure "Delete working directory" alone would be a useful option. And when selecting "Delete Git repository", "Remove repository from view" would also need to be checked. Also, "Remove projects ..." option is missing, it would be 4 checkboxes in total.

I'll push another variant which addresses some earlier comments.
