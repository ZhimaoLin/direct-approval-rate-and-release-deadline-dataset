DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Make "Delete Repository..." more explicit

It now requires the user to explicitly check that the .git dir should be
deleted before the dialog can be confirmed. It also displays a warning
that the deletion is permanent and changes some labels for clarity.

The paths are now shown below the checkbox for better alignment and to
make them selectable (see "Delete Project" where this is also done).

Ok, this one makes it clear that "Delete Git repository" has to be selected first by disabling the others (they depend on it being selected). Also, the warning about "no undo" is only shown after it has been selected. Better?

Patch Set 3:

I think there should be less coupling between these 3 choices, all 3 options make sense independently:
- I could want to just remove projects from the workspace
- I could want to delete the working tree without deleting the repository
- I could want to delete the repository without touching working tree and imported projects

So why is the ok button disabled if the first option isn't checked ?

Patch Set 3:

> - I could want to just remove projects from the workspace

That is what "Remove from view" is for, it asks whether to also remove the projects. I don't know why anyone would search for this functionality in a command named "Delete Repository...". It would have to be renamed to "Delete Repository or Maybe Not" ;).

> - I could want to delete the working tree without deleting the repository

I really don't see the point of doing that. You would end up with a repository that has all its files marked for deletion (if the deletions are automatically staged like they are when deleting files e.g. from the navigator). Could you make an example where this would be useful?

> - I could want to delete the repository without touching working tree and imported projects

That's possible in the original dialog and the proposed modification.

I guess my main gripe with enabling it when anything is selected is that the action may no longer really be a "Delete Repository". I would be pretty hesitant to click on the "OK" button of a dialog titled "Delete Repository" when I'm not expecting it to delete anything.
