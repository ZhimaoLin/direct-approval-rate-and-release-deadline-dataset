DESCRIPTION

Remove extra line for the repository information in the Git staging view

The current placement of the repository information takes to much space.
During normal work, the developer knows which repo he is working on and
the place for the repository becomes wasted space.
This information fits well into the first section, as this reads as a
header for the whole UI.

I work with different repos, how should I know what I'm committing?

earlier the view title used a larger font than the pane titles, now they all use the bigger one which looks ugly and makes it harder to spot the view title

Isn't there a way to move the title one line up into the toolbar area where we have plenty of empty space, see http://imgur.com/0WcQPcm ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> misleading commit message title, you didn't remove the title but moved it somewhere else
