(5 inline comments)

rename branch: 
- should preselect currently checked out branch and auto-expand the tree to reduce number of clicks required to use the dialog

delete branch: 
- tree should be auto-expanded

advanced menu:
- use same icons as in repo view for delete, rename branch
- separate branch actions and tag action by separator

assume unchanged, no assume unchanged: 
- hitting stack overflow when called
