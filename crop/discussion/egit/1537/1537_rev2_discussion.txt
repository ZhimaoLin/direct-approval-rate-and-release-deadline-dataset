DESCRIPTION

History View: fix view menu

Eclipse UI Guidelines mandate that all toolbar actions should also appear
in either the toolbar menu or a context menu.
This adds the toolbar items to the view menu where possible and also
adds specific menu label texts with mnemonics instead of the lengthy
tooltips currently re-used in the menu.
