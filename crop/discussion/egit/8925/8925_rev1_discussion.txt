DESCRIPTION

Simplify Eclipse setup for EGit developers

In order to install dependencies and plugins typically used by EGit
developers click "Import... > Install > Install Software Items from
File" and select this p2f file, then select the bundles you want to
install and click OK.

This works for Eclipse Juno SR1 and Kepler M3.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

What's wrong with org.eclipse.egit.target/ project? On of the goals of using TP is to install required bundles but without mixing them with your runtime development environment.

While some features are usefull for developer (like Mylyn Reviews Connector: Gerrit), I'm not sure about org.apache.log4j and org.kohsuke.args4j - why do developer need them?

Patch Set 1:

This is an alternative and not a replacement for using a target platform. I use both approaches depending on the task at hand, when testing platform compatibility or differences clearly using a target platform is the better choice on the other hand installed dependencies provide better performance since when using a target platform PDE often tries to contact remote p2 repositories which eats time.

This file contains installation instructions for all current jgit and egit dependencies, needed test tools and test dependencies, nightly version of egit and gerrit connector (assuming that contributors tend to use a bleeding edge version to feel the current state) plus findbugs and emma for code coverage. Contributors can still choose which of these plugins they want to install but they don't need to copy URLs from the contributor guide to setup these installations manually.
