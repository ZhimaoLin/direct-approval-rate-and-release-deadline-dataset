DESCRIPTION

Simplify Eclipse setup for EGit developers

This provides a quick way to install the tools typically used by
JGit/EGit contributors. In addition it provides an alternative to using
a target platform for provisioning 3rd party dependencies required to
compile and test JGit and EGit. Using a target platform is more accurate
as it allows to separate the dependencies of the workbench used for
development from the one used for testing. But using a target platform
is typically slower since PDE tries to communicate with p2 repositories
listed in the target platform.

In order to install dependencies and plugins typically used by EGit
developers click "Import... > Install > Install Software Items from
File" and select this p2f file, then select the bundles you want to
install and click OK.

Patch Set 3:

This significantly simplifies the initial contributor setup, so I'm +1 on this. (Target platform is ok, but it's not enough  because e.g. execution environment descriptions and SWTBot still have to be installed manually.)

EGit and JGit are disabled here with the following text:

(Disabled because a higher version is already installed)

Anyone else seeing this?

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- maybe you installed a local build earlier ?
- I need to add apache.commons.compress which was added to the target platform recently
