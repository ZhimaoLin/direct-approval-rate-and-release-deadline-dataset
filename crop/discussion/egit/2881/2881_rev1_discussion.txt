DESCRIPTION

Put preferences for showing confirmations and errors on own page

All preferences for configuration whether certain dialogs are to be
shown are collected on a separate preferences page.

This reduces clutter on the Git Preference root page and allows the
user to easily reset all these settings at once.

Line:254, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> which option is about an error dialog ? Looks like these are all confirmation dialogs

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/DialogsPreferencePage.java -> I propose to change this page to only have one group named "Show confirmation dialogs" and all options provided as checkboxes. I would order the list as follows:

"Show confirmation dialogs"
- Initial configuration
- Home directory warning (Windows only)
- Rebase confirmation
- Detached Head warning

I think this would be easier to understand
