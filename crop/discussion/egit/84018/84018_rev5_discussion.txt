Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2

I've tested the current state with 4 repositories. Put breakpoint into the PullOperation line 220 (finally block). After each repository the monitor shows now expected process state (25, 50, 75%) and I can see the description from which repository we are pulling right now.

I don't think there is a need for further improvement.
