Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Line:234, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> Should be changed to totalProgress.newChild(1) -- or anything passed to SubMonitor.convert(). Sorry for my previous comment stating that giving a number of ticks was unnecessary; there is no static factory with taskName but no ticks argument... Thus, you shall call newChild here.

Line:234, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> I didn't get it. We've just created totalProgress monitor via convert() method, and this is the first place where we use it. Why do we need to create *another* child of it?

convert does not allocate nor consume any ticks. See it more like setWorkRemaining, basically a noop until newChild is called.

org.eclipse.core.runtime.SubMonitor.convert(IProgressMonitor, String, int) javadoc says that it allocates given number of ticks. So I still do not see why should we create a child from newly created monitor.
