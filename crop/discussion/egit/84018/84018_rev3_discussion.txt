Line:163, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> not needed. You never create child or use any tick from the submonitor, so you don't need to affect an arbitrary number of ticks. If you really want to do this, you need to call the runnable like this:

ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().run(action, getSchedulingRule(),
				IWorkspace.AVOID_UPDATE, totalProgress.newChild(100));

Line:225, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> this will advance the progress bar while doing nothing. I would suggest to use #setWorkRemaining here to better use the remaining space in next loop iteration:

 progress.setWorkRemaining((repositories.length - i)*2)

Line:163, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> I've reverted this change, "1" does the job fine.

Line:225, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> It turned out, that proposal causes the progress to show less work as it was done. So instead of shwing 50% it was 37% etc, and the reporting "finished" too early. So I've reverted this to the worked(1) which just consumes the second from two planned ticks.
