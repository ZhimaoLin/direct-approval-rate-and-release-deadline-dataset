DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Load commit body lazily

The body of loaded objects is now thrown away in the walker after it has
parsed the information necessary to render the history graph. It is
reloaded when content of the body is needed in the HistoryView.

For large repositories this saves a lot of memory, e.g. about 110 MB for
linux kernel.
