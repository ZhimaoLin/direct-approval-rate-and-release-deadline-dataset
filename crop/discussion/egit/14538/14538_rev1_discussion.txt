DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Follow renames by default

With incremental loading of history and showing the renames in file
diffs, I don't know why we shouldn't turn this on by default. I haven't
had a problem with it.

If it really is bad for performance for some users, they can still turn
it off. But the default should be nice.
