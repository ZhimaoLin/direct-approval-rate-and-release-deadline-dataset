DESCRIPTION

SpellcheckableMessageArea: remove platform specific line endings

SpellcheckableMessageArea.getCommitMessage called
getTextWidget().getLineDelimiter() to determine the platform line
ending. This was wrong because getLineDelimiter() returns the first
line delimiter found in the text control.
The new implementation of SpellcheckableMessageArea.getCommitMessage
guarantees that the returned string only contains \n line endings.
