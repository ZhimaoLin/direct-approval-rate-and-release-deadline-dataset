DESCRIPTION

Fix image resource leak in SwitchToMenu

Somehow dispose() never got called, and thus the images created in the
constructor never got disposed of.

Let's allocate these three images globally; re-creating them every time
this menu is invoked doesn't look right anyway. Give the plugin a
global LocalResourceManager and make sure the images are obtained from
there. Also pre-create a composite image descriptor for the checked-out
branch image.
