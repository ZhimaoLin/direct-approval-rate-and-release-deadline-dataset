Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

could you instead render the shortened SHA-1 in the decoration of the submodule tree node and append the commit message header of the commit we are pointing to with the submodule ? Similar to what we show for branches in repositories view.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> the 'I' is missing in front of the SHA-1 hence it's not rendered as a hyperlink
