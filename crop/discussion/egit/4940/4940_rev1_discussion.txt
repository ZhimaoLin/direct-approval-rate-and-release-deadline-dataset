DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Add preferences for max branch and tag length

This controls how branch and tag labels in the table are
truncated with an ellipsis when the specified length is exceeded.

This breaks the "Views" preference page into two separate pages,
one for the History view and one for the Synchronize view.

The initial default for both preferences is 15 which is
larger than the previous internal value of 12.

Aside from the bug reference tbis is good.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> 356120 seems irrelevant
