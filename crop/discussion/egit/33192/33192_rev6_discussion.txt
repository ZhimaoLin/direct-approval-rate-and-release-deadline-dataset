DESCRIPTION

Introduce context menu "import changed projects"

The context menu action "import changed projects" analyzes the files of
the commit and is importing the matching projects. This is a handy
feature for very large repositories with lots of projects where it is
impossible to import all projects. Import only the relevant projects
needed for the selected change/commit.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why not auto-import new projects? Sure someone might want to turn such a feature off, but the natural thing would be to normally keep all projects available
