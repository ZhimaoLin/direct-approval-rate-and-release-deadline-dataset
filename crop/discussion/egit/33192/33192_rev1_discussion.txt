DESCRIPTION

Introduce context menu "import changed projects"

The context menu action "import changed projects" analyzes the files of
the commit and is importing the matching projects. This is a handy
feature for very large repositories with lots of projects where it is
impossible to import all projects. Import only the relevant projects
needed for the selected change/commit.

We just want to have this temporarily on 3.4 so that we can build a Luna EGit version internally.  Once everything works we are going to cherry-pick this to master.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I think this whole file seems to have been merged from master badly.  Just replace it with origin/stable-3.4 and apply your changes manually.

Line:100, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/HistoryViewCommands.java -> Superfluous

Line:847, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTable.java -> Superfluous diff

Line:186, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportRelevantProjectsCommand.java -> f.isFile() is better since it checks if .project isn't a directory accidentally.

Line:198, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportRelevantProjectsCommand.java -> Wrap this whole loop in workspace runnable or, even better, in a WorkspaceJob to do the import in the background.
