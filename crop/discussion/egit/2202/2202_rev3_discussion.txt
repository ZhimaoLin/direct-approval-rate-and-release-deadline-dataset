DESCRIPTION

Implement a revert command

This is almost reverted cherry-pick, and the implementation is
almost identical. It orders the input to merge differently to get
the effect and produces a different commit message with the
default author, rather than the original author.

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/RevertHandler.java -> this is a misleading variable name, how about "revert" ?
