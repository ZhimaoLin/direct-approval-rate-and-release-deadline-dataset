DESCRIPTION

Allow filtering of Gitflow feature branches in checkout and track dialog

Working with a larger number of feature branches can be tedious, if
there is no way of organizing them. A quick way of finding, known,
well-named branches, can be a simple text filter.

- replaced lists with filtered trees
- extended UI test
