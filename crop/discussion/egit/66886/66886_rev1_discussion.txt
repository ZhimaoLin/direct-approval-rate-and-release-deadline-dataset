DESCRIPTION

Allow filtering of Gitflow feature branches in checkout and track dialog

Working with a larger number of feature branches can be tedious, if
there is no way of organizing them. A quick way of finding, known,
well-named branches, can be a simple text filter.

- replaced lists with filtered trees
- extended UI test

Line:16, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FlatBranchesListContentProvider.java -> BranchListContentProvider ? I think lists are usually flat

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/gitflow/AbstractFeatureFinishHandlerTest.java -> 5 minutes is a long time to wait for a test in case this fails

Line:101, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FilteredBranchesWidget.java -> add blank line at the top of the anonymous class

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FinishFeatureDialog.java -> you didn't touch this file in 2016, why do you change the year ?

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> Select Git Flow feature branches

Line:30, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> style nit: unnecessary empty line

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> it should be possible to select an entry using the keyboard only without using the mouse. Other filtered dialogs (e.g. Import... wizard in the package explorer) enable that by selecting the first list entry as soon as a filter string has been entered which yields at least one entry in the filtered list. Then focus can be moved to the list by clicking "tab" and an entry can be selected using the arrow keys. We should fix this also in other filter dialogs we already have, e.g. "Add Git Repositories" dialog in repositories view.

Currently this dialog only checks for matches starting from the left. This means if I have 2 branches "featureX" and "featureZ" I have to type the complete string until its differentiating.
I think we better check the entered filter string for matches anywhere in the branch name, in this example I could then pick the branch "featureX" by typing "x"

Line:44, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> refs ?

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> we put an empty line as the first line of an anonymous class to make the fact this is an anonymous class more visible:

 new ISelectionChangedListener() {


   xxx@xxx.xxx
    public void selectionChanged(SelectionChangedEvent event) {
       ...
    }
 }

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> style nit: add blank line at the top of the anonymous class

Line:16, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FlatBranchesListContentProvider.java -> Done

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/gitflow/AbstractFeatureFinishHandlerTest.java -> Not sure I understand. This should be 300ms. That's what seems to be the delay for the filter in the FilteredTree to hit.

Line:101, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FilteredBranchesWidget.java -> Done

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FinishFeatureDialog.java -> I guess I accidentally switched to the wrong tab (and did not check my commit properly before pushing).

Done

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/dialogs/FeatureBranchSelectionDialog.java -> If this is solved with the quick selection mode I use here, the same is possible with the FilteredCheckboxTree used in the "Add Git Repositories" dialog. However, I don't think it is necessary there because that viewer also needs the checkboxes to be checked anyway. Adding a  repository can be done by <type filter>->tab->space->enter.
