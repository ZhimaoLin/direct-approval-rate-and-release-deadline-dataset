DESCRIPTION

Make RemoveFromIndexOperation work for multiple repositories

RemoveFromIndexActionHandler is enabled when resources from different
repositories are selected. But before this change it would not actually
work because it passed the repository to the operation and the operation
would use that to calculate the paths.

Patch Set 1:

Is RemoveFromIndexOperation API? In case it is, we need to keep the constructor with Repository (and mark it deprecated).
