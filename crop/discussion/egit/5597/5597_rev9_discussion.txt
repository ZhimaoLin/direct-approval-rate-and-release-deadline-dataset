DESCRIPTION

Update tycho version to 0.14.1

Tycho 0.14.1 enforces that artifactId and feature/bundle SymbolicName
must match, hence follow recommended migration practice and change
groupId of feature projects in order not to change the feature names as
this would require a feature migration.

Also migrate the p2 repository build from the deprecated packaging type
eclipse-update-site to packaging type eclipse-repository.

The explicit reference to the egit p2 repository to define the runtime
platform for the egit ui tests isn't necessary any longer.
