This one is still based on the old(?) swtbot, but that is the only one stable version I've had.

We need to make it work with org.eclipse SWTBot, including either JUnit 3 or 4 in such a way that it is possible to re-Run single tests.

Line:148, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/GitCloneWizardTest.java -> Here's what's happening:

All operations in swtbot are async.

Which means that the clicks on the Next button (above) has still not changed the page. when this line is executed. As a result swtbot finds the table on the previous page. This table has 0 rows, as a result the uncheck does not happen and the assert after this loop fails.
