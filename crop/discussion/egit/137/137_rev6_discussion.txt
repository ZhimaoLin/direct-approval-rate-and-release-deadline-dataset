I get the same problem using eclipse.swtbot too. Therefore I think net.sf.swtbot is a good choice. Part of the reason may be that the net.sf.swtbot represents a newer version than the one that comes with out current Eclipse 3.4 baseline.

No one else has input on this?

Doing anything else while executing the test will most likely cause failures since swtbot fails to get the current shell if it isn't active. 

This makes debugging SWTBot debugging quite tricky too.

I did some more testing and found that my laptop needs a bit more patience, by increasing the timing parameters a bit I get consistent results:

-Dorg.eclipse.swtbot.playback.poll.delay=500 -Dorg.eclipse.swtbot.playback.delay=400

The last 2 tests consistently fail since EGit doesn't behave in the way these tests expect (verified that manually).

If you want I may upload my changes squashed to your patch.

Setting sleeps like you suggest probably only works on your machine, Sleep, dfirectly ir indirectly is a rteceipe for fragile code. Something else is wrong here.

I am running my tests on Eclipse 3.4 if that's relevant.

Yeah, I also don't feel comfortable tweaking timing parameters (default for poll.delay seems to be non zero:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/FAQ#Can_I_change_the_poll_delay_for_evaluating_conditions_in_SWTBot_tests.3F).
I sent a mail to the SWTBot list to see if they can help here.

I am on 3.5.1 and will try on 3.6 M4 soon.
