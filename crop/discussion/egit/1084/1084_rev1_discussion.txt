Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Copy-n-pasting? I don't like this idea. Should we wait for response from platform team [1]?

Patch Set 1:

The chance of Team doing anything for 3.7 is low... for now... and if they did anything... it was force us to depend on 3.7 as a minimum requirement (which we don't want to do at the moment). So for 0.9, I think this is the right approach for now.

If you're going to copy paste, please use the original copyright instead of tagging it as SAP.

Patch Set 1: Unclean IP, do not check in

Bad copyright is un-clean IP, I think (see Remy's comments)

Patch Set 1:

An alternate approach would be to try to get these API's to be public and possible continue to use the internal API's until 0.9.
