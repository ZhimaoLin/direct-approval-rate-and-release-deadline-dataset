Looks ok, logic could be simplified.

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewLabelProvider.java -> Couldn't we move this logic up with branchName == null?

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewLabelProvider.java -> Almost. But when we are on a local branch, we don't need to resolve.
