Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

this is not fully consistent with the menu entries in "Compare With":
- s/File in Git Index/Git Index/, I think we should use the same (shorter) text
- in "compare with" "Branch, Tag or Reference..." comes before "Commit..." in replace with menu the order is reversed

Thanks, fixed in newest patch set. We should also shorten the label in the staging view context menu then.
