DESCRIPTION

Remove repository from ListRemoteOperation

LsRemoteCommand can run ls-remote without a repository hence remove the
unnecessary repository from ListRemoteOperation. SourceBranchPage
created an unnecessary temporary repository in /tmp in order to run
ls-remote before cloning a repository. This may fail if the user does
not have write permissions in this folder.

Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ListRemoteOperation.java -> That change actually was not good.

If we ignore the repository, we'll also ignore settings in the repo config (and in fact because TransportHttp(URIish) will create a HttpConfig based on an empty new Config(), even the user config).

Which means for HTTP we'll completely ignore any http.* settings the user may have done, and we'll run the ls-remote with the default settings.

Instead we'll have to make the command work with or without repo, and use this new way only if no repo was given. (The bit about using the user config when there's no repo would be fixed by https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/103993/ .)

Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ListRemoteOperation.java -> See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/104059/ : reverts the removal of repository, but adds this new constructor and keeps its uses in SourceBranchPage and LocalRepositoryTestCase.
