DESCRIPTION

CloneOperation not implements IRunnableWithProgress

Break dependency on org.eclipse.jface from
org.eclipse.egit.core.op.CloneOperation and get rid of implementing
IRunnableWithProgress by providing the run method.

GitCloneWizard already wraps CloneOperation as a Job. Wrap it to an
IRunnableWithProgress when required.
