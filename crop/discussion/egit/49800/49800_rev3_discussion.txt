I have open questions ;)

Line:21, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> What happens if there are multiple stratey extensions registered? Should there be a priority attribute of type double to determine who wins?

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> Where is this actually used? I cannot see it maybe I am blind ;).

Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Log error or warning? here and below.

Line:111, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> 2015

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/SynchronizePreferencePage.java -> Missed to update copyright

Line:111, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/PreferredMergeStrategyTest.java -> Shouldn't this be called test...WhenModelEnabled...()? Because we set GitCorePreferences.core_enableLogicalModel to true (and we have a test for disabled model with valid preference already).

Thanks for your comments!

Line:21, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> The user must choose which strategy they want to use among all the registered ones.
If they choose a strategy and later uninstall it, a warning is logged and the default strategy is used, they must go back to the preferences to choose again.

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> This is used in the plugin.xml editor, to warn implementors that they must provide a class that extends ThreeWayMergeStrategy.

Line:111, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> Done

Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Well... Don't know what to answer exactly!
I preferred to log an error since I think warnings are easily ignored by users.

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/SynchronizePreferencePage.java -> Done

Line:111, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/PreferredMergeStrategyTest.java -> Nice catch, you're right!
Also need to change the comments in the middle of the code that are wrong...

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> My question was misleading. Which class reads in these extensions for actual use? I can only see that it is being used to initialize the you in the SyncPrefPage class. I expected a code location where the strategy is instantiated and used for Merging. I have the feeling I am not understanding something here ;).

Line:111, org.eclipse.egit.core/schema/modelMergeStrategy.exsd -> Done
