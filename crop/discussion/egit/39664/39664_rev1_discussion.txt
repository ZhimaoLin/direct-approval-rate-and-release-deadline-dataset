DESCRIPTION

[stagingview] "Updating index" should indicate that view is "busy"

If we are linked, each time IndexDiffUpdateJob starts, indicate that the
view is busy (e.g. reload() will trigger this job in background!).

This is not the best solution if one has many repositories: on Eclipse
startup the view could be shown busy even if the right repository is
already updated, but practically it works fine. 

Usually one has not really many *huge* repositories in the same Eclipse
workspace which can delay startup for long time, and after startup is
done, index refresh usually happens for the current repository only
because index diff updates are started only on repositories where user
makes some changes or selects elements.

Line:909, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> reactOnSelection is only checked when constructing the view, this means when reactOnSelection changes value we don't reconfigure busy indication

Line:913, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> where should I see the busy indication ? I can't find any visual difference compared to master. Tried with linux kernel repository imported as a general project

Line:909, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Unfortunately one can't disconnect if one starts to listen via showBusyForFamily() API (or I haven't found a trick). So until view is reopened we are either connected (if we were linked) or not.

Line:913, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> You should see view title font changed to "italics" and mouse cursor over view will change to "half-busy". Put breakpoint into the IndexDiffUpdateJob run method, you will see (hopefully) what I mean. At least on RHEL 5.8 it works fine with Eclipse 3.8. Haven't tested on newer Eclipses.

Line:909, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> ok, what's the reason not to show this if reactOnSelection is false ?

Line:913, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> can't see any busy indication when breakpoint in IndexDiffUpdateJob's run method is reached using Mars M4 on Mac OS X 10.10.1 (Yosemite)

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: trailing whitespace

Line:909, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> in this case user changed the default not to follow the selection => most likely he don't want to change the repository focus. This mean, any other "visual" changes will most likely disturb him too.

This is the weakest point - we can't disconnect and we can't use "family by repository".

Line:913, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I'm sorry :-) Just tried on Fedora 21 + Eclipse 4.5 - it works here fine, but the cursor doesn't change (haven't checked yet if this is my desctop configuration or bug in SWT).
