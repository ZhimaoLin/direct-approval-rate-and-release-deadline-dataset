Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

(5 inline comments)

I have added some inline comments to consider for upcoming refactorings, but for the moment it looks good enough.

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> We should have some debug trace instrumentation here to help us with supportability.

Line:110, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> These variables are currently only used if commitAll is true, so perhaps this could use some refactoring.

Line:141, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> We should probably add support for cancellation, especially within the loop calling AddToIndexOperation (including roll-back).

Line:173, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> We should have progress monitoring and cancellation here.

Line:263, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CommitOperation.java -> Progress monitoring and cancellation.
