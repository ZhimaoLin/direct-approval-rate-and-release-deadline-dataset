DESCRIPTION

CommitMessageViewer: use Job to update Commit Message

A Job was used instead of busyCursorWhile to get a real asynchronous
UI update. Usage of busyCursorWhile caused the issue that right clicks
in the package explorer were lost.
The logic that builds the commit info was moved to a new class
CommitInfoBuilder.
