Line:78, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/RemoveFromIndexOperation.java -> just use ResetCommand?

Line:78, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/RemoveFromIndexOperation.java -> because currently ResetCommand does not work on folders (it only works for files).

Line:78, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/RemoveFromIndexOperation.java -> but then we should fix the resetcommand instead of writing a fixed version into egit. This is a functionality is needed by other jgit users
also and we should offer it in jgit.

Line:78, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/RemoveFromIndexOperation.java -> You are right Chis, I've already push a change I441db34f226be36548c61cef77958995971498de that adds support for dir reset. But in time when I was extracting this code from StageView class I didn't really think about fixing jgit
