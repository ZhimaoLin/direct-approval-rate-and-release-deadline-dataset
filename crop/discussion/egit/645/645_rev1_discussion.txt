DESCRIPTION

Make clear that "Delete branch..." will delete forcefully

The current implementation doesn't check if commits on the branch
to be deleted have been merged to the currently checked out branch.
Since this may lead to data loss if the user isn't aware of this
the dialog text should state that explicitly.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

We may need to have a special delete dialog that gives you some options on how to delete the branch. We can open a bug for this.
