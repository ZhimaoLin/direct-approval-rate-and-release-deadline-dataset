To replace a previously uploaded patchset with a new commit you better amend the previous commit (keeping its changeid unchanged) then you don't end up with a new change depending on an abandoned change (this is explained in more detail in [1]). This way you also don't cut the review history by replacing one change by another one instead you add another patchset to the original change.

To fix this do the following:
- restore change If5dfa57e2934de5d73b2721b9c8d5586ed10bddb by clicking "Restore Change" in Gerrit web UI
- amend this change, add the missing commit message header and replace the Change-Id you used here by the one used in the old change (Change-Id: If5dfa57e2934de5d73b2721b9c8d5586ed10bddb) and push to refs/for/master again
- this should yield a new patchset for change If5dfa57e2934de5d73b2721b9c8d5586ed10bddb
- abandon this change here

Line:6, /COMMIT_MSG -> The commit message should always have a header explaining what this change is all about, e.g.:

 [repoView] Enable pasting remote git URLs
