DESCRIPTION

Improve order of menu entries in "Replace With" and "Compare With"

This changes the order by reordering the existing actions. Note that the
order in plugin.xml has to be the reverse of what is desired in the
popup menu. It also changes "Replace With > File in Git Index" to be
consistent with "Compare With > Git Index".

The previous changes for this also converted the menu from being defined
via the deprecated org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus extension point to
org.eclipse.ui.menus, but that caused bug 422907 (a bug in Platform UI).

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I found the following differences compared to the current layout:

* "Compare with > Each other" moved from the bottom to the top
* missing separator before "Compare with > Branch, tag or reference"
* missing separator before "Replace with > Branch, tag or reference"

otherwise this looks good and works from the editor's team menu :-)
