DESCRIPTION

[wip] Make it possible to choose merge strategy before merges

This commit makes it possible to optionally select a specific merge
strategy before merge, cherry-pick and rebase operations, if they are
called from a menu that already displayed a dialog.
To make it as little intrusive as possible, the list of available merge
strategies is not displayed by default.
