DESCRIPTION

[wip] Make it possible to choose merge strategy before merges

This commit makes it possible to optionally select a specific merge
strategy before merge, cherry-pick and rebase operations, if they are
called from a menu that already displayed a dialog.
To make it as little intrusive as possible, the list of available merge
strategies is not displayed by default.

Looks good! I tested the functionality and can confirm it works well. Thanks!

I only have a few suggestions for UI:

* "Override preference with a specific merge strategy"

I'd rather put: "Use specific merge strategy..."

Most people will probably not be aware of the fact that there is a preference, so they'd ask themselves, which preference is overwritten.

I'd put ... behind the label, to indicate that this will open more settings.

* "Short Name"

Why not just use "Name" instead? "Short Name" only makes sense if there is a normal name as well.

* Provided by

I'm not sure if it is a good idea to put that in this dialog. Most people will not be interested in that information and it uses a lot of space. I think it would rather make sense to put this information in the preference page only.

* It would be great, if we could resize the dialog, if the checkbox is enabled to make more room for the table, especially with the Merge... dialog.

* Maybe this is just on Linux with GTK2, but the scrollbar of the table is partially hidden.

Thank you for your review Philip!
I fixed most of your UI comments. However, I don't want to spend time on layouting the table because SWT makes that ridiculously difficult. I'd have to introduce a lot of code for very little added-value I think and I don't want anybody would want to maintain this. So I leave it like that for now and wait for other reviewers feedback to see if I really must do something.
I didn't want to use a table in the 1st place because then the text would not wrap and also it's not possible to set help context id on table items.

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/MergeTargetSelectionDialog.java -> Done

Line:3, org.eclipse.egit.doc/contexts.xml -> Done

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/MergingOperation.java -> You're right, it no longer brings any added value, it's a remainder of previous iterations. I remove it.

Line:280, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/AbstractBranchSelectionDialog.java -> Done
