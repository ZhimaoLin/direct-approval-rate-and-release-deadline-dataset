DESCRIPTION

Provide a way to configure RepositoryChangeScanner interval

RepositoryChangeScanner was triggered every 10 seconds if the UI was
active. This is an overkill and causes unneeded CPU load by idling
Eclipse. This change increases the interval to 5 minutes, adds new
"Refresh interval" preference to the root Git preference page and
changes the job in the way that it listens to the preference change. If
the preference is set to 0, the job stops automatic repositories change
check.

Line:596, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/Activator.java -> private -- is not used outside of RepositoryChangeScanner anymore.

The class itself could also be made private.
