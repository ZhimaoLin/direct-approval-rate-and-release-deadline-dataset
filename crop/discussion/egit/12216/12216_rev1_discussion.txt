DESCRIPTION

Fix order of projects as returned by ResourceMapping

When executing a pull on a working set, WorkingSetResourceMapping
returns the projects in unpredictable order. This makes the listed
repositories in the result dialog look messy.

So sort the projects by name so that it corresponds to the navigator
sort order.
