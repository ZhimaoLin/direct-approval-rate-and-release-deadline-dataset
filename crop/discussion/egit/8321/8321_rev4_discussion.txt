DESCRIPTION

Propagate project text label decoration up to working set

This introduces a different type for resource mappings so that the
configured project text decoration is used for working sets instead of
the default container/folder decoration. It also collects repository
name and branch info to allow those decorations for working sets.

Patch Set 4: (2 inline comments)

See inline comments. Otherwise looks good now.

Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> Please also add the following here to reduce unnecessary calculation:

    if (branches.size() > 1)
        break;

(Then you could also set the capacity of the set to 2.)

Line:118, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> Style nit: We don't use braces ({}) for simple single-line blocks.
