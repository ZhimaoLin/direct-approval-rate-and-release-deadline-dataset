DESCRIPTION

Propagate project text label decoration up to working set

This introduced a different type for resource mappings so that the
configured project text decoration is used for working sets instead of
the default container/folder decoration. It also collects repository
name and branch info to allow those decorations for working sets.

I get an empty "[ ]" as decoration for working sets where not all projects come from the same repository. We could prevent that e.g. by returning 0 from getType() when repositoryName is null.

Also see inline comments.

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> Is there a reason for this particular number?

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> The lastBranch and lastBranchStatus should only be done once as they can be costly.

There is some discussion at bug 369969. One proposal was "[ ]" for different repos in a working set. There is also the case where different repos are in a working set but all pointing to the same branch. Should that be visualized too?

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> No, not at all. Just tried to avoid any conflicts with IResource. Technically, type is a bit mask but the decorator just uses a switch so anything can be used.

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceMapping.java -> Good to know, thanks. I'll wrap it into an if so that's only calculated once.
