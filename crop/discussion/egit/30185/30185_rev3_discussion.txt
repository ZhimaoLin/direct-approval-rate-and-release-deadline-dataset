DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Provide visual feedback while commit is in progress

Staging view uses now IWorkbenchSiteProgressService to indicate "work in
progress" state for pending commit job. Additionally the staged/unstaged
changes areas are disabled to prevent any user interaction while commit
job is still working.
