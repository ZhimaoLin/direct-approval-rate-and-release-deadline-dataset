DESCRIPTION

Staging view: provide visual feedback while commit is in progress

Staging view uses now IWorkbenchSiteProgressService to indicate "work in
progress" state for pending commit job. Additionally the staged/unstaged
changes areas are disabled to prevent any user interaction while commit
job is still working.

Line:2406, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Could you move these two lines up before `commitJob.addJobChangeListener`? I know it doesn't make a difference, but I feel it's clearer when the order in which these steps happen (disable, then later enable again) are reflected in the code.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We use "tags" like this: "[stagingView] Provide ..."
