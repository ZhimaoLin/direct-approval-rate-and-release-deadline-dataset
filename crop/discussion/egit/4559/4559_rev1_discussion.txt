Line:88, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> text needs to be externalized

Line:255, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> this is one level too high, searching the parent of the working tree might also find projects not located in the working tree of the newly cloned repository, also this may run a long time if this parent directory is big

also the text displayed by the progress monitor is still "Cloning ..." instead of "Searching projects to auto-import"

Line:88, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> Done

Line:255, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> I updated the directory being searched.

The import is done in a subtask of the Clone progress monitor so it should show the project being imported in the Progress view.

It could be done as a separate job as well that runs after the clone completes, is that what you are suggesting?
