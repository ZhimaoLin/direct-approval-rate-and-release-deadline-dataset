DESCRIPTION

Delete unused org.eclipse.egit.core.internal.merge

These classes duplicate functionality in org.eclipse.core.synchronize.
They were added in an abandoned attempt to move some functionality
from EMF Compare into EGit, but they were never used, not even by
EMF Compare. This attempt was later superseded by the "mergeStrategy"
extension point.
