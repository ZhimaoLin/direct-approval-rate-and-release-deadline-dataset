DESCRIPTION

[blame] Add a preference to ignore whitespace changes

This adds a git preference that controls if whitespace changes are to
be ignored when calculating blame annotations from the context menu.

If checked, use the WS_IGNORE_ALL text comparator instead of the default
one when constructing the BlameCommand.
