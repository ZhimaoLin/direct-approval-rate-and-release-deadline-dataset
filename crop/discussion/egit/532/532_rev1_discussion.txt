DESCRIPTION

BranchOperation: check for HEAD is too late

Unfortunately, BranchOperation does the
check for the degenerate checkout of HEAD
too late (in updateHeadRef during RefUpdate.link()), 
after some Repository operations have  already been 
performed. This leaves the repository in an 
inconsistent state.
The check should instead be done right in
the beginning

Bug: 286743
