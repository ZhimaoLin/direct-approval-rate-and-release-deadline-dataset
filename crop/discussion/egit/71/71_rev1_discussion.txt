Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Similar to the issue with the trailing whitespace, only more so, I really don't like my code being modified by the editor.

Does this strip unnecessary blocks when there are comments?  E.g. I often do this:

  if (some_condition) {
     // We are here because the frobinator isn't going
     // fast enough to keep up with us.  So, wait a bit
     // and see if it can frob faster.
     doTheWait();
     //
  } else {
     // Yay, we are slower than the frobinator.  Stupid
     // Java and its virtual machine environment.  Well,
     // at least we can continue on!
     //
     noWaitRightNow();
  }

To the compiler, these braces aren't necessary, but to a human, they really help the scope because of those really long multi-line comments wedged in the blocks.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

I think the current list consensus is we don't want to be performing this sort of code modification on the fly during file save.  So I'm abandoning this change, but we can always resurrect it in the future if the consensus changes.
