DESCRIPTION

[historyView] More space-efficient labels on commit with multiple tags

When a commit has more than one tag, show a "..." instead of the rest of
the tags. The user can still view the additional tags by hovering over
the "...".

This way, any branches and the message of the commit may have space to
be shown instead of being hidden.
