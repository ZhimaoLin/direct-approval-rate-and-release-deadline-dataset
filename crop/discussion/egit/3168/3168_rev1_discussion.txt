shouldn't the factory class be registered with the platform extension "org.eclipse.ui.elementFactories" ?

IElementFactory says:

"Clients should implement this interface and  include the name of their class in an extension to the platform extension point named "org.eclipse.ui.elementFactories".

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorInputFactory.java -> style nit: we don't use author tags

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/commit/CommitEditorInputFactoryTest.java -> style nits: trailing whitespace and we don't use author tags
