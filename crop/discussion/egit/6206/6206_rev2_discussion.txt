DESCRIPTION

Use correct path when comparing with previous revision

Previously a RenameCallback was registered on the FollowFilter
to find the previous path of the file being compared.  This
led to incorrect behavior since the callback fires for all
renames, not just for the commits processed through directly
calling RevWalk.next().

Now a RenameDetector is directly used after computing the
diffs between the head commit and the previous commit.
The path is only updated if the rename detector detects
that the current path was renamed between the two commits.

Line:622, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryActionHandler.java -> we need a recursive tree walk otherwise this will only work for renames in the root of the repository, if the rename happens e.g. from "a/x" to "a/y" or "a/x" to "b/y" a non-recursive tree walk doesn't look at the rename.
