DESCRIPTION

Inspect selection state in radio button selection listeners part II

Some radio button selection listeners did not check the selection
state of the radio button. This caused problems in SWTBot tests
because clicking on a radio button with SWTBot sends unselection
events to the other radio buttons of the radio button group.
