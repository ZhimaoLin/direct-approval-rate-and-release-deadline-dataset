DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Prompt to delete lock when operation fails

This begins the work to prompt the user to delete the .lock
file left over by a crashed process that was holding it.

A new LockOperation is added that wraps an IEGitOperation
and prompts the user to delete the lock failure being reported
in a wrapped CoreException.

This commit only currently modified ResetCommand but if this
approach  works then other commands can begin wrapping
core operations in a LockOperation.
