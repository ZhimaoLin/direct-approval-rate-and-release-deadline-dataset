DESCRIPTION

Diff node should notify listeners when the input changes

The text merge viewers need to be notified when changes to a
compare input are saved. The text viewer can be notified of
changes from the diff node. Hence, when the compare input itself
has been notified that its been changed, this change event must
be forwarded to the diff node so that the text viewer can be
updated and reflect the differences of the newly changed compare
input.

Line:16, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/NotifiableDiffNode.java -> This is a new class,doing exactly the same thing as the superclass. Why?

Line:16, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/NotifiableDiffNode.java -> The fireChange() method is protected and cannot be accessed from our GitCompareFileRevisionEditorInput. By extending the class and overriding the protected method, the method is now exposed to other classes of the same package.
