DESCRIPTION

RepositoryCache: do not prematurely remove submodules

Basically we have no way of knowing when we no longer reference a
repository. In our code alone, there may be RepositoryMappings and
RepositoryNodes directly referencing a Repository, but some views may
also have direct references to Repository instances. We therefore cannot
explicitly remove repositories from the RepositoryCache, since we have
no efficient and 100% reliable way to determine whether a Repository is
still in use somewhere. Therefore the RepositoryCache relies on weak
reference semantics.

Before https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/62066/ , this whole mechanism was
broken anyway because the IndexDiffCache had no way to remove an
IndexDiffCacheEntry instance, and those instances had hard references to
the Repository. So once there was an IndexDiffCacheEntry for a
repository, that Repository instance would be kept forever.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/62066/  itself was a wrong approach
because it neglected that some repositories might never be
"configured" repositories visible in the Repositories view. Such
repositories would be removed from the RepositoryCache while still in
use. Submodules and nested repositories are affected by this, but so
can top-level repositories.

The approach taken in this change here fixes this. First, we go back to
relying solely on the weak reference semantics of the RepositoryCache.
Note that doing so does not give any guarantee about when exactly a no
longer used and only weakly reachable Repository instance will actually
be removed from the cache.

Then we at least make sure that we don't keep any hard references
around. That's more difficult than it may seem:

* Replaced all hard references to Repository in IndexDiffCacheEntry. We
  now only use the repository's git directory, and use that to get the
  repository from the RepositoryCache, if it still is there.
* The oldIndex DirCache in an IndexDiffCacheEntry also had a hard
  reference to the Repository. Use a DirCache.read() variant that
  doesn't set that link -- it's used only for writing a DirCache, which
  we don't do. Note that this is a bit fragile as it relies on an
  implementation detail of JGit, but for now I see no other way.
* Even worse, some Eclipse internals do keep around hard references to
  some "last selection"s. Those may contain no longer used
  RepositoryNodes from the repository view, which still reference the
  Repository instance through a hard reference. We have no real way to
  reliably ensure that these Eclipse internals forget those nodes.
  Therefore we have to ensure in RemoveCommand that we actually do null
  out these Repository references once we're sure we have removed the
  node from our view. (The two places I found where Eclipse holds on
  to such defunct nodes are WorkbenchSourceProvider.lastShowInSelection,
  set when the "Shown In..." context menu was last filled, and the
  CommonViewer, which also remembers the last selection.)
* Our own RepositorySourceProvider had a private field referencing the
  last selected Repository. The RepositorySourceProvider is a singleton
  that is instantiated very early and then kept around forever. That
  was resolved by using a weak reference for the repository.
* The EclipseContext also managed to (indirectly) hold on to a hard
  reference to a Repository instance through the context variable we
  provided. That was solved by not passing the Repository directly as
  the context variable defined by RepositorySourceProvider but again
  only the git directory.
* RebaseInteractivePlan has a static global cache of plans and each plan
  had a hard reference to a repository. A plan is computed when the view
  is opened, even if never executed. That accumulated hard references to
  repositories. Solved by using a weak reference.
* The Eclipse resource tree's DataTreeLookup has a static cache of
  instances that are re-used but not cleared after use. Those may keep
  references to our RepositoryMapping session properties for some time
  after the IResource to with the property was attached has gone. The
  test explicitly accounts for this.

In the full test run in maven, more problems showed up in a heap dump
taken just before we test for no cached repositories in
GitRepositoriesViewRepoDeletionTest: numerous FileRepository instances
from earlier tests were still referenced.

* The EclipseContext retains some handler activations of ActionHamdlers
  of anonymous Action subclasses of SpellcheckableMessageArea, which
  reference the area through this$0, which itself keeps a reference to
  the CommitDialog through this$0, which means we keep the
  CommitMessageComponent, which has a hard reference to the Repository.
  Solved by using static subclasses that reference only the
  SourceViewer.
* The Eclipse NavigationHistory keeps around references to some
  CommitEditorInputs, which also have a hard reference to a repository.
* The synchronize view references a repository through its
  GitSynchronizeData. Resolved in test by keeping the synchronize
  view closed.
* The FileRepository from testCompareWithPreviousWithMerge was still
  referenced from the job from CompareWithPreviousActionHandler even
  though no such job was running anymore. Referenced in the
  ProgressMonitorFocusJobDialog, which was still kept around through
  its fontChangeListener (an inner non-static class in the ultimate
  ancestor class Window), which apparently somehow was still
  registered.. Unclear why or what happened there. Not resolved.
* Same thing with testRevertFailure; referenced from
  RevertCommitOperation from the job in RevertHandler from
  ProgressMonitorFocusJobDialog. Unresolved.
* Anonymous actions in SwitchToMenu still reference a long gone
  repository from test method selectionWithProj1. Unclear why and
  unresolved.
* Some repositories from earlier tests were still referenced through
  long defunct RepositoryNode instances. Unresolved.
* RepositoryPropertySourceProvider has a hard reference to
  its lastObject, and the RepositoryPropertySource has hard references
  to the configs, which may have hard references to the Repository.
  Resolved in test by closing the property sheet; unresolved in general.

Because we can't explicitly remove items from the RepositoryCache, we
also cannot explicitly remove IndexDiffCache entries. The only thing we
can do is to ensure we remove IndexDiffCacheEntries when we detect that
a repository in the cache no longer exists (has been garbage collected,
or its git directory no longer exists.)

Additionally, the resource change listener of an IndexDiffCacheEntry
unregisters itself when it finds its repository has gone.

I cannot really claim that this still fixes bug 483664 because there is
absolutely no way to ensure that repositories vanish from the
RepositoryCache in a timely manner. But it's a best-effort attempt to
at least try, and at the same time not to evict repositories from
the cache prematurely.

The test explicitly invokes System.gc() in an attempt to make the JVM
actually reclaim weakly reachable objects. This is not guaranteed, but
appears to work in practice: the test thus only shows that the obvious
places where we kept hard references are indeed resolved, and the
repository does indeed vanish eventually. But see the "unresolved" items
above: there's no guarantee that some view or action handler or Eclipse
internal class doesn't somehow still manages to keep a hard reference
and thus prevent reclamation.

Finally, testing for an empty RepositoryCache must ensure that the
RepositoryChangeScanner does not interfere; otherwise that may
temporarily hold hard references to repositories. Solved using a
scheduling rule.

All right. After three successful builds in a row I hereby boldly declare this test to be stable at last. :-) I hope Hudson doesn't prove me wrong at the next opportunity. PS 9 already made sure the test didn't run concurrently with the RepositoryChangeScanner, but that wasn't good enough yet: that repo change scanner could have triggered events that could cause jobs to be scheduled. So the test has to wait for such jobs inside its own validation job to be sure nothing interferes.

My earlier comment still stands, though: relying on weak reference semantics for cache maintenance is fragile.

I am wondering why we need another RepositoryCache in egit.core ?
We already have org.eclipse.jgit.lib.RepositoryCache couldn't we just use that ?

I had thought about that, too. The cache in JGit is a real cache, using soft references. It is designed to keep repository instances in the cache as long as possible (memory and the garbage collector permitting), even if no longer referenced from outside.

The EGit "cache" is not really a cache. It is a _registry_ of currently used repository instances, and it should forget instances once they're no longer referenced from outside.
