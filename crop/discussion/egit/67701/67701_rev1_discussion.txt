DESCRIPTION

RepositoryCache: do not prematurely remove submodules

RepositoryCache cleanup must make sure not to remove submodules and
nested modules prematurely. Since those are not registered as
"configured repositories", which would cause trouble when a repo was
deleted from the Repositories view anyway, we must make sure to remove
them only if no configured repository contains them.

This requires that the RepositoryCache keeps track of repository
nesting. To avoid duplicating code, the IndexDiffCache cleanup when a
configured repository is removed is now triggered from the
RepositoryCache.

I've decided to split up https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67638/ .

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/submodules/SubmoduleFolderTest.java -> This is expected to fail in PS 1; just to illustrate the problem. Here we add a completely unrelated repository, but the submodule from parentRepository get evicted from the cache.
