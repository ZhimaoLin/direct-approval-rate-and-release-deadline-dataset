DESCRIPTION

Don't delete projects on disk unless the user said so

If the user chooses not to delete the working tree when deleting a
repository the projects from that repository must not be deleted but
only removed from the workspace if the "Remove projects from workspace"
option is checked.

(Backport of commit 0c7c118.)
