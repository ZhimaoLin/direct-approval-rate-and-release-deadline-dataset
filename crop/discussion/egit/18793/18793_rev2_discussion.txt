Works well, but please see my comments.

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/MergeToolActionHandler.java -> This only returns repos only if there is an entry in RepositoryMapping, and RepositoryMapping.getMapping(IPath path) only returns a repo if path is below a project.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Merge tool still doesn't work  for a repository where no eclipse project exists. Please either explain this in the commit message, or implement this also.

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/MergeToolActionHandler.java -> Maybe in ResourceUtil.splitPathsByRepository we should not use RepositoryMapping at all but rather RepositoryUtil.getConfiguredRepositories() together with RepositoryCache.lookupRepository(gitDir) like the RepositoriesView does,

but I only quickly looked into this.

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/MergeToolActionHandler.java -> No, it also returns a mapping if the path is only below the working directory, not necessarily the project. But you are right, it didn't work when not even a single project of the repository was imported.

Fixed here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/19478 (not sure if we really want this in 3.2 though, or if it's too risky)
