DESCRIPTION

Show progress icon for egit jobs

This registers a default icon (the repository icon) for all jobs of
egit. That icon is shown on the left hand side of the progress bar in
the progress window (you probably have seen the "locked" icon of
workspace refresh jobs there already).

Some often used jobs use a more specific icon (e.g. push, pull, commit,
...).

Feel free to suggest a better default icon than the repository icon or
to discuss which jobs shall or shall not use their own specific icon.
