DESCRIPTION

[sync] Add drag-n-drop (un)staging for Git Change Set model

Adds support for staging/unstaging changes by drag-and-drop from
'<working tree>' node into '<staged changes>' node and vice versa.

Also changes the behavior of showing '<working node>' and '<staged
changes>' node. Now both nodes will be shown whenever one of them
contains data.
