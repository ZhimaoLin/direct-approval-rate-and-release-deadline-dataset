DESCRIPTION

[sync] Add drag-n-drop (un)staging into Git Change Set model

Adds support for staging/unstaging changes by drag-and-drop them from
'<working tree>' node into '<staged changes>' node and other way around.

Also changes the behavior of showing '<working node>' and '<staged
changes>' node. Now both nodes will be shown when ever one of contains
data.

@Stefan, this seams like a strange race condition. When "Next difference" is hit immediately after dropping A into "<staged changes>" node this issue will occur, but when you give some time to refresh action to finish this will never hapend. I'll try to hunt down this issue but it doens't look to be a simple task.

Patch Set 5:

It seems that the issue occurs when after the dnd-operation a folder or the whole tree should not be shown anymore.

Could you please check how the "Next Difference" action handles the case when a folder or the whole tree is not available anymore after a dnd-operation?
