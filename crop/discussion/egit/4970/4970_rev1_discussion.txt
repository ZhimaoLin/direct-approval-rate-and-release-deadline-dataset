DESCRIPTION

Implement decoration for working sets

This splits the current decorate() method in two seperate ones. One for
what was done already (decorate resources), and one for decorating "the
rest" (i.e. ResourceMapping's).

Nice improvement :-)

This seems to always propagate the ? decorator on the working set node when IndexDiff isn't yet available or still being computed. Instead it should not propagate any git decoration until the IndexDiff data is available in order not to confuse the user.

If you want to show that some operation is ongoing you may consider to render the node's text with an italic font until the index diff computation is ready.

ok, have improved it a little :) not sure if there is a better way to check for indexDiff calculation beeing complete, but i'm happy with how it's done now, as it does exactly what i wanted anyway :)

Line:214, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> don't know. actually 99% percent of this methods code are just extracted/moved from the original decorate(), so i can re-use from the new mapping decoration code.
