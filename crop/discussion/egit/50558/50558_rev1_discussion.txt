Line:65, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureRebaseHandler.java -> maybe it would be better to first open the interactive rebase view and then show the warning so that the user can see both to understand what happened

Line:67, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureRebaseHandler.java -> in order to determine the active page use

HandlerUtil.getActiveWorkbenchWindowChecked(event).getActivePage()

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureFinishHandler.java -> it looks like createMergeConflictInfo() always shows the warning, then  adding the warning should be an implementation detail of createMergeConflictInfor() and the mergeResult needs to be passed to it as a parameter

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> it looks like these are independent changes, if that's true split this change 

small changes doing one logical improvement are easier to review and can be individually reverted or cherry-picked

Line:67, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureRebaseHandler.java -> Done

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureFinishHandler.java -> Done

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I see. I think in this case it would be too much overhead to split them.
One is a variable rename and UIText change, the other is a minor refactoring to remove a redundancy that would only be introduced by the rest of the patch-set.
