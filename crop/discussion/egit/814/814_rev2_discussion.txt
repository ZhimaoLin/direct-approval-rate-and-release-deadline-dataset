DESCRIPTION

Wrong warning message in SourceBranchPage

Symptom:
In the clone wizard (Git Repositories -> Import Git repository) paste a
local folder which does not contain a repo and press next. Now there is a
message "Source Git Repository is empty".
Now go back, correct the path and press next again. The message is still
there.

Bug: 314616
