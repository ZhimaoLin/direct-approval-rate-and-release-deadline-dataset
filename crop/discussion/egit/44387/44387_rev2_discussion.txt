Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

please avoid inconsistent patch series like this one. This change depends on another change which has a newer patchset than the one this change is depending on. Same problem in the other direction, this change has a successor change depending on it but there's a newer patchset of this change than the one pointing to this change.

If changes don't depend on each other then best don't push them as a series but instead push each change based on origin/master. Iff you anyway want to push it as a series then the series should be consistent otherwise reviewers have to take extra steps to review and accept such changes which is annoying.

I would immediately accept this change if it wouldn't depend on a non-current patchset of change Ib70dcb109468e8aa6d8dae7fbcf41ee67a050064
