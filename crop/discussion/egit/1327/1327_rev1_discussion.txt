DESCRIPTION

Fix for out of sync exception

Synchronization seams to throw 'ResourceException: out of sync' while
synchronizing not resources that are not in sync. I've added additional
condition checking that resource is up to date, if not it will be
refreshed.

Looks good. I'm worried a bit regarding potential performance implications but we'll have to investigate later...
