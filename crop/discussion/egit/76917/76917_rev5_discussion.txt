Line:874, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> would it make more sense to out the overwritten message in the commit history?

Line:3108, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> could this end up being "" or something equally meaningless? then the history would end up with a unwanted entry when the overwritten commit message is put in the set.

I really like Matthias's idea of using the content assist to cache the user's message. That way we don't need to decide whether to overwrite the message, we just do it on every task activation (which provides an easy way to regenerate) and the user can always get back what was there before if they want to.

Line:874, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I was thinking that if you did a lot of task switching, there would be a lot of extra commits in your commit history that you might not want to see.

Line:3108, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I think that can only happen if the user manually deletes the commit message and then switches tasks.

Line:874, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> hm I see, but wouldn't this have the problem where if I wrote a custom message, then switched tasks twice the custom message would be lost? That could even happen if I wrote the custom message on Task A, then switched to B then back to A, wouldn't I lose my custom message I intended for Task A?

Line:3108, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I think we should turn "" or pure whitespace to null.
