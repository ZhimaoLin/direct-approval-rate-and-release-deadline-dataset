DESCRIPTION

Enable the text editor toolbar items for DiffEditorPage

A TextEditor provides a couple of items in an action set in the global
Eclipse toolbar: buttons for block selection, word wrap, showing
whitespace, and navigation between annotations. As the DiffEditorPage
is a real TextEditor now, enable those.

* Add an "action set part association" in plugin.xml to get those
  buttons at all when the CommitEditor is active.
* Propagate the global action contributions from the nested editor's
  SubActionBars to those of the CommitEditor.
