DESCRIPTION

Detect assume-valid-bit changes in refresh

Only existence and SHA-1 was checked when looking for changes in the
index. We should also check the assume-valid bit since that affect
IndexDiff and decorations. If the bit is changed, decorations should be
updated too.

A new filter is used, which is s

- how about some tests for InterIndexDiffFilter ?
- if we would decorate the skip-worktree bit the InterIndexDiffFilter would also need to check if this bit changed, correct ?

Patch Set 1:

Corrected and moved filter to JGit.
