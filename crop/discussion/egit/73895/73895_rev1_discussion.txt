DESCRIPTION

Test stability: wait for specific child node after expansion

The first test in GlobalConfigurationPageTest frequently fails on Hudson
because it doesn't find the child node "Configuration". It appears that
child nodes in the preference page's tree are added one after another,
so waiting until there is any child is not good enough: "Configuration"
is the second child and might not have appeared yet.
