DESCRIPTION

Decrease job startup delay for IndexDiffCache updates

The fix for bug 417597 (https://git.eclipse.org/r/30261) can cause
performance problems for slow workspaces where *lot* of changes were
reported but the incremental index update is not fast enough.

Because the changes are collected until the previous job is done, if the
number of changes exceeds RESOURCE_LIST_UPDATE_LIMIT (1000) the full
index update will be triggered which costs even more time.

The proposed fix is to decrease the IndexDiffUpdateJob start delay from
400 to 10 ms, with the hope that this will help slow workspaces to
perform updates faster.
