DESCRIPTION

Remove references to internal types in ShareSingleProjectCommand

There is no reason to use ConfigureProjectWizard because all the
methods it calls is actually public API. One minor discrepancy
introduced here is that we no longer go through Team's
ResizeWizardDialog inner class. However, the WizardDialog class
actually already sets a shell style with SWT.RESIZE so the
ResizeWizardDialog actually gives us nothing of value.
