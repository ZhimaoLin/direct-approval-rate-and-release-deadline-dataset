Line:365, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> Hm. We're in PushBranchPage here. We could add yet another UI text PushBranchPage_NormalizeNameTooltip, but this is getting tedious.

I suggest instead to move that tooltip into the BranchNameNormalizer. Add a second constructor

  public BranchNameNormalizer(Text text) {
    this(text, UIText.BranchNameNormalizer_Tooltip);
  }

add that new UI text, and use the new constructor.

In a follow-up change we can then change the other instantiations of BranchNameNormalizer and remove the duplicate and then unused UI texts for CreateBranchPage_NormalizeNameTooltip and BranchRenameDialog_NormalizeNameTooltip. Or if you want, you could do that in this change, too.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Helena Henry is rather finicky and wants a blank after the colon.

Line:365, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> Actually, that's not quite it either. There is already a content proposal adapter on this text field (it gets a list of existing branches in the remote repo). Interestingly, the two work well together since the existing one will never return anything if the name is invalid, and the new one only then provides any suggestions, and vice versa. So the two give results only under mutually exclusive conditions.

However, if we set a tooltip here, both tooltips will be show one over the other. Therefore, this second proposal adapter must not have a tooltip.
