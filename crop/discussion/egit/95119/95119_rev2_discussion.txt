DESCRIPTION

Add a BranchNameNormalizer to the PushBranchPage

Don't give it a tooltip; it would conflict with the tooltip used for
the other content proposal adapter on that text field that proposes
existing upstream branches.

The two content proposal adapters work otherwise well together since
they return proposals only under mutually exclusive conditions.
