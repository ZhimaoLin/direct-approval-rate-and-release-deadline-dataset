Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- this change removes the submenu "Team > Advanced > Synchronize" when called from the Java Package Explorer, AFAIK the package explorer exposes different interfaces for Java resources, so you probably have to adapt to these interfaces as well
- when called from Navigator or from Synchronize Wizard it seems the synchronize result isn't restricted to the selected package

Patch Set 3:

I've fixed fist issue, but the second one seams to be more complicated because we need to obtain selection from Navigator or Package vies and associate them with proper synchronize configuration form wizard.
