Patch Set 1:

- this needs a rebase
- tried with org.eclipse.cdt repository and ran synchronize workspace on a small folder which contained a single modification in working tree. The result looks good but a lot of time is spent in updating a lot of files (will send the screenshot) which are not under the selected folder. I am wondering if this is necessary.
