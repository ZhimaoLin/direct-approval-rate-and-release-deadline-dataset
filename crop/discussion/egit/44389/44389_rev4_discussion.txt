Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

yes, the problem with the disappearing content of the result list is caused by this change, without this change it works ok

we also reproduced this problem on Ubuntu and Windows 8 so it doesn't seem to be a Mac problem

Patch Set 4:

I found what's the problem here, the filter field initially contains the string "type filter text" which is prepended with '*' by this fix and becomes

 "*type filter text"

this typicall doesn't match any repository in the selected folder hence nothing is shown initially. When start typing in the filter field the text "type filter text" is deleted since it was automatically selected on initialization. Hence now filtering works as expected. I couldn't yet find the code which sets the text "type filter text"

Patch Set 4:

GitProjectsImportPage filteredTree.setInitialText(UIText.WizardProjectsImportPage_filterText); in line 205 I think does that.

Patch Set 4:

yes, but with your change this has the effect that this initial filter hides all repositories available in the selected directory

Line:128, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/FilteredCheckboxTree.java -> search for references to FilteredTree.initialText then you'll see that some inner classes of FilteredTree have special treatment for the case that the filter field contains the initialText

changing this to

 		if (!filterText.getText().equals(initialText)
				&& filterString.indexOf("*") != 0 //$NON-NLS-1$
				&& filterString.indexOf("?") != 0 //$NON-NLS-1$
				&& filterString.indexOf(".") != 0) {//$NON-NLS-1$

fixes the problem that while initialText is displayed no result list is shown.
