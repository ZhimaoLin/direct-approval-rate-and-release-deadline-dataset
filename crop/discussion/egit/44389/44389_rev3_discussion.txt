nice feature, I like it :-)

there's one small problem:

when I open the "Add Git Repositories" dialog and browse to a folder containing many git repositories the search result list shortly shows the list of repositories in the selected folder and then the result list disappears. I have to click into the filter input field in order to make the result list visible again. Looks like some event is causing this. Tried this on Mac.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: remove trailing whitespace in the commit message

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/Bug/Bug:/
