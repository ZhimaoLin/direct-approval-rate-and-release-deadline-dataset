Patch Set 2:

Steven, have you tried your changes with 1000 - 10000 files in index? Can you please provide some data?

I will come later to the actual review (I hope).

Patch Set 2:

Andrey,I was waiting for a response for "is there a better way to get the index timestamp".

It seems the fastest way would be to open the index file, parse it, and pull the stamps out manually (although the object passed into the LabelProvider does not have a method to get the hash id).

I honestly have no idea, but *if* there will be no performance issues we don't need another solution - therefore I would like to see some real data.

Patch Set 2:

I loaded the egit.ui repo and soft-reset to first commit.  (4311 commits in stage):
4 seconds to load.

Then I removed the call in question and returned a fixed date instead:
Almost instant.

So yes, there are performance issues.  Can an EGit commiter please offer some guidance in obtaining this information?

Please ask on bug 469385 and/or on the egit/jgit mailing list if nobody answers - not all developers are monitoring all comments on gerrit :-)
