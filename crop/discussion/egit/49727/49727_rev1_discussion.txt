Please check the comments.
My major concerns are performance and too less space for the file paths left due the fixed 250 pixel column size for paths.

Line:74, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/storage/IndexFileRevision.java -> errors should be properly logged, and not just printed to the system error.

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/storage/IndexFileRevision.java -> I'm concerned regarding performance of this (I have not tried it yet). Can you please try how this code performs if you have 1000 - 10000 files in the index?

Line:1448, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Shouldn't be here refreshViewersPreservingExpandedElements(); instead of two calls above?

Line:1581, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Why is this not externalized? And the next one too?

Line:1587, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Is there a way to compute staging view size relative width or automatically size it to the available space? I have files with very long paths in the repo and this change would be a major issue for me since it will cut off lot of content on a 1900 width monitor.

Line:72, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewLabelProvider.java -> This should not be static, because SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe.

Line:247, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewLabelProvider.java -> can you please use {} brackets around single line if/else too?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We put "Bug: 469385" on a new line before change-id, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Trailing space

Fastest review ever!

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/storage/IndexFileRevision.java -> locateBlobObjectId, if already called, will have already cached the object.

Please suggest a faster way to get the timestamp from the index.  Is there an object that tracks the index file and allows access from the StagingItem passed into the LabelProvider?

Line:1448, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Yes, that is much better!

Line:1587, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I now resize the name column to take all available space, with a fixed minimum.

Line:72, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewLabelProvider.java -> I saw that error from the Hudson build.  

We should really take the 'string', making it static, and refactor it into a common class.  It is used in 4 places.

Line:247, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewLabelProvider.java -> This code is copied from the same project.  Do you want me to change the source as well?
