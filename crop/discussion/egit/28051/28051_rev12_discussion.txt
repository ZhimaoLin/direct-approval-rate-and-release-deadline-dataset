this looks great for the team menu and also the wizard now looks good :-)

though the corresponding menu entry in the repositories view is now broken, we should also use the dynamic menu there

Line:283, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> this is still used by Repositories View, so the menu entry there is now %PushBranchAction.label

We should also implement the dynamic Push menu in the repositories view

Line:445, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchWizard.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:1815, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> I'd prefer "Push HEAD..." since "Push HEAD Commit..." sounds like only the commit HEAD is pointing at would be pushed which isn't true in general

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/PushCommitHandler.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PushMenu.java -> style nit: we don't use author tags

Line:72, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PushMenu.java -> this could be shortened to a single line

 /** */

Line:91, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PushMenu.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:158, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PushMenu.java -> this TODO needs to be fixed

Line:175, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PushMenu.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks
