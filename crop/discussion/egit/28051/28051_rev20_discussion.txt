Thanks! Some more things:

* Push Commit... doesn't have a mnemonic
* If the first line of the commit message is very long (I've seen some bad commit messages), will the label be ellipsized? Or do we have to crop it if it's too long?

Patch Set 20:

Did the "Push Commit..." already have a mnemonic before that change? Doesn't seem so. What mnemonic would you suggest for that? Maybe it's easier if you suggest this improvement in another change?

I believe the very long line will be shown entirely and may make the wizard very large. Do you already have a util method to shorten commit messages?
