DESCRIPTION

Bug 436669: Improve simple push dialog

This dialog now shows which commit, from which branch is about to be
pushed.
It fits both usecases of pushing HEAD from resource, or pushing a single
branch.
On the content menu "Push Branch..." was replaced by just "Push..."

Patch Set 2:

the dialog looks a bit cluttered, maybe this could be improved by putting frames around local and remote information

 -- From local ------------------------------------
 |   Commit:  deadbeef commit message                          |
 |   Branch:    master                                                        |
 ------------------------------------------------

 -- To remote ------------------------------------
 |   Repository:  origin: <url>                                           |      New Remote...
 |   Branch:        master                                                    |

Line:709, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> why not simpler: "Push HEAD to remote" ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: we put the bug link to the commit message footer in the line immediately before the Change-Id

I'll make another shot of the wizard using Groups/Frames.

Line:709, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> This dialog takes as Input any Ref. So it can be used to push any single ref. It can be used for example from history. So I tried to find something more generic for the dialog description.
