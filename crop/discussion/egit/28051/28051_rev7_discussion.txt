DESCRIPTION

Improve simple push dialog

This dialog now shows which commit, from which branch is about to be
pushed.
It fits both use cases of pushing HEAD from resource, or pushing a single
branch.
On the context menu "Push Branch..." was replaced by just "Push..."

I replaced the wizard in History by the same one as the one in resources.
However, I couldn't reproduce the issue about commit message. Can you please give more details about how to reproduce it.

Patch Set 7:

I'm not sure the test failures are related to the suggested change. However, I tried to build locally and got many test failures, different from the one on Hudson.
Can you please re-trigger the build to check whether this is determistically failing, because of the suggest patch?

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

- "Push..." is disabled if we have a detached HEAD, though you claim the command could be used to push (detached) HEAD
- with this we end up with two menus called "Push..." which looks confusing (second one in "Advanced" submenu), we could fix that by dynamically naming the menu entry : "Push HEAD..." if we have a detached HEAD, otherwise "Push branch <branch name>" if a local branch is checked out
- maybe we could present the local branch and commit on a single line similar to how we show branches with commit info in repositories view, this would make the dialog a bit more compact
