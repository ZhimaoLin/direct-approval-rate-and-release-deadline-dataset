DESCRIPTION

Bug 436669: Improve simple push dialog

This dialog now shows which commit, from which branch is about to be
pushed.
It fits both usecases of pushing HEAD from resource, or pushing a single
branch.
On the content menu "Push Branch..." was replaced by just "Push..."

if "Push..." is clicked on a repository in the repositories view the commit message header is shown with the local commit ID, if it's clicked from a resource's team menu the commit message header is missing. We should it in both cases.

Looks like we could also use this simplified push dialog for "Push Commit..." in the history view.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: we don't reference bug in header but in footer

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/usecases/use cases/

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/On the content/In the context/

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> just give the bug number :
