DESCRIPTION

Improve simple push dialog

This dialog now shows which commit, from which branch is about to be
pushed.
It fits both use cases of pushing HEAD from resource, or pushing a
single
branch.
On the context menu "Push Branch..." was replaced by just "Push..."

Patch Set 8:

This new patch set enables ability to push a detached HEAD (and fixes multiple bugs of previous patch set regarding pushing a single commit from history).
I replaced "Push..." by "Push HEAD..." since I'm not sure how to do dynamic labels properly.
I also kept the current layout of the wizard for further discussions. I have the impression I like to have commit and branch separated.

now I can push detached HEAD from the team menu but not yet from the repositories view, I think this should also be possible

Line:43, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> I think this should remain "Push..." since with the advanced wizard you can also create complex push refspecs and can e.g. push multiple branches in one go

Line:283, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> I think this action should be named "Push HEAD..." or "Push Branch..." following Robin's suggestion on the bug

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PushBranchActionHandler.java -> why should the action be enabled if there is no associated repository ?

Line:60, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchWizard.java -> unnecessary blank comment line

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchWizard.java -> we usually don't add javadoc for private methods

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchWizard.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:197, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/PushCommitHandler.java -> maybe better: localBranch

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/PushCommitHandler.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:43, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/PushCommitHandler.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> lineSeparator() is not available on Java 5

I answered to a few comments inline.
I'll immediately submit a new patch set with the most consensual changes, but the question on this patch set 8 are still relevant.

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> Do you want to keep Java 5 compatibility or are you OK with updating bundle to Java 6 as BREE?

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/PushCommitHandler.java -> Really? I'm surprised, not using braces around single line blocks has historically caused a few bugs.
Is this something that I need to change or are you OK with keeping them?
