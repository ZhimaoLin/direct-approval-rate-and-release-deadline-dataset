Build failure doesn't seem related to that change. Can someone please re-trigger the build?

Patch Set 18:

can you hide the upstream configuration when pushing HEAD (if ref==null) ?

Patch Set 18:

Yes, it's possible to hide it. It's actually what I prefer, but Robin suggested we disable it instead.
I'll make a new patch set that doesn't show this part when on detached HEAD.

Patch Set 18:

I think you misunderstood Robin, on patchset 17 he wrote "I would go with "make it unchecked and hidden when we are on a detached HEAD"." So it looks like he also wants it hidden, of course the upstream configuration shouldn't be modified in that case
