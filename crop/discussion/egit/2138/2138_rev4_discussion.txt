Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Quite nice. Just two remarks:

The link to Help in section "Destination Git Repository" is wrong: it points to "Repository Selection" under chapter "Cloning Remote Repositories" which does not have the dropdown mentioned in the text. Instead it should point to chapter "Push URI" under chapter "Push Wizard".

Under "Push Confirmation", we should probably link to the corresponding help (Push Wizard -> Push Confirmation) to see the screenshot and explain how to get more detailed information by hovering over the status (perhaps we need to replace the current screenshot with an example where something goes wrong to make this more useful).
