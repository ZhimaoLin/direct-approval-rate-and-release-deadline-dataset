DESCRIPTION

Don't show expand indicator for files in ChangeSet

Method hasChildren() from SynchronizationContentProvider was returning
true for GitBlobMapping files becouse they contains TresourceTraversal
instance. This cannot be changed because when empty traversal array is
returned then none of files are shown in synchronize view. Therefore
I've decided to overwrite hasChildren() method in
GitChangeSetContentProvider.
