DESCRIPTION

Fix RepositoriesViewLabelProvider

If there are two branches with the same shortened name (e. g. a local 
and a remote "master" branch), the current implementation wrongly 
marks both of them as "checked out" if one of them is checked out.

The fix looks for the full branch name instead of the shortened name
in order to determine whether the icon should be decorated.
