Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryStatisticsPage.java -> I think we should instead use GarbageCollectCommand which exposes statistics as properties

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryStatisticsPage.java -> Sounds like a good idea, but I guess we don't want to run gc each time when opening the page, which is what the command would do before returning the stats. Having a flag for not running the gc doesn't make much sense either. That leads me to a conclusion that a new command should be added for listing the stats, or did I miss anything?

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryStatisticsPage.java -> I think you can get GarbageCollectCommand and call getStatistics() without running the gc command itself by calling call()
