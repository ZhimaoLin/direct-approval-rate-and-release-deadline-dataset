Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:7, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceAdapter.java -> this shouldn't have been changed

Patch Set 1:

Looks like this apparent diff in copyright statement is an artefact caused by Gerrit, filed http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=514 for that.
When I download the patch and view it in Eclipse the copyright statement in line 7 is untouched.
