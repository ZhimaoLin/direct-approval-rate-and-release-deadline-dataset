DESCRIPTION

Allow to use the repository name in Git Label Decorations

Currently, the Git (text-) label decorations include variables for dirty,
staged, and branch. Since there are many repositories with the same "master"
branch, we should have a "repository name" variable. This should be the name
of the repository's directory. While not necessarily unique, this helps in
identifying the repository in the project explorer.
