DESCRIPTION

Workaround to enable linking multiple resources to HistoryView

When given a selection the GenericHistoryView only considers the first
element and adapts it to an IResource before passing it on as input. To
work around this behavior the GitHistoryPage now looks at the current
selection itself and uses it as input if preferable.
