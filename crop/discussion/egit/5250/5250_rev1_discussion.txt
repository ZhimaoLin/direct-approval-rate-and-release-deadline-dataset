DESCRIPTION

Ensure commit list is disposed when graph is disposed

Previous attempts to clean up color resources help by
SWTCommitList still left code paths in which colors could
be leaked.

This change takes a direct approach and binds each SWTCommitList
to a dispose callback registered on the main graph Control.
