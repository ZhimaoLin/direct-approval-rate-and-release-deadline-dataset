DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Ensure commit list colors are always disposed

Previous attempts to clean up color resources held by
SWTCommitList still left code paths in which colors could
be leaked after the History view was closed.

This change takes a direct approach and binds each SWTCommitList
to a dispose callback registered on the main a Control.
