DESCRIPTION

Simplify enabling of add to index/remove from index handlers

1. pom.xml uses the ResourceStatePropertyTester, which enforces the
   condition that all selected resources belong to the same repository
   anyway.
2. We most probably do not want this to apply recursively for
   submodules, too. Therefore the (inadvertently introduced)
   restriction that all items in the selection belong to the same
   repository even appears needed. (Or otherwise we'd need a much more
   complicated test that would exclude submodules, but allow multiple
   root repositories. But if projects from submodules are imported, that
   gives an inconsistent UI -- on project level, all repositories look
   the same to the user, so why is the action sometimes enabled and
   sometimes not when such a project is part of the selection?)
3. Nobody complained so far that add to index/remove from index works
   only for one single repository at a time. Working on multiple
   repositories at once doesn't seem to be used often...
4. AddToIndexOperation is written to be able to work with several
   repositories. But if adding to one repository fails, none of the
   remaining add commands are run. This would need much more work to
   give a consistent user experience without surprises for the user.
   ("Ok, it failed on repo X. But it did do the work on repo A, but not
   on Z. What's up?").
   
For all these reasons, change the enablement to match the property
tester and require a single repository.
