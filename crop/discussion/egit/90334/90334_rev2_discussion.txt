DESCRIPTION

Remove the default handler for the checkout command in CommitEditor

Provide a dedicated handler with an appropriate activeWhen clause
instead. Somehow handler activation expressions are not properly
re-evaluated for these CommitEditor commands; seems to have
something to do with them being used in the header of a
SharedHeaderFormEditor. Add a PartListener to the CommitEditor that
forces an update of the toolbar on activations.
