I like the idea, but I think the current appearance grabs too much attention.

What do you think about replacing the unused help button with an "Advanced Push" link with a tooltip that explains what will happen when clicking on it? See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=441795 for how this can be implemented.

Also, should there be a link from the Advanced wizard back to the simple one?

I like your suggestion. I'll implement it in a similar way in a next patch set.
I don't know if a link from advanced to simple is necessary. Maybe we can have this discussion on the bugzilla entry to get more opinions?

Ok, let's keep it simple and just add the one link for now.
