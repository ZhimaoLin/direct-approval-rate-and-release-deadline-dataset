DESCRIPTION

Disable the Commit and push button when there are no remotes.

In case there are no remotes for the selected repository, the Commit and
Push button from the staging view should be disabled, as there's nowhere
to push to.
Additionally fixed button enabling, as first each button has been set as
enabled/disabled manually, then all the commit components have been
enabled, overwriting the disabled state on buttons in some cases.

missing event handling:

When initially no remote was configured and then a remote is configured the button should be enabled. Vice versa if the last configured remote is deleted the button should be disabled again.
