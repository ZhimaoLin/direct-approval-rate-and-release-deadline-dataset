DESCRIPTION

Disable the "Commit and push" button if there are no remotes

In case there are no remotes for the selected repository, the "Commit
and Push" button in the staging view should be disabled, as there's no
destination repository configured.

Additionally fixed button enabling, as first each button was set as
enabled/disabled manually, then all the commit components were
enabled, overwriting the disabled state on buttons in some cases.
