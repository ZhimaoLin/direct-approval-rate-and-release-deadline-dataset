DESCRIPTION

Revert "Use CompareUtils.compareHeadWithWorkspace"

This reverts commit 19f2cf44d7868aa2d4b5faa811af5dbbc9600a12. This
commit changed the behavior so that it opens a new top level window when
you select the 'Compare with->HEAD Revision' menu.  It used to create a
new editor.  This change in behavior is a regression since the top-level
window is disruptive to a standard multi editor workspace.  It also
means standard functions like search and editing are no longer
available. Reverting this commit fixes this regression.

Sorry about that, didn't notice the change. The encoding problem is still fixed, because CompareUtils.getFileRevisionTypedElement does the right thing with Ie26b68355d53456c1000afb51f15f12f5098e6be.
