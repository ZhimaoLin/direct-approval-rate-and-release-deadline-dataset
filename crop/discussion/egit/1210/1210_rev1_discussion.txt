DESCRIPTION

Add some keyboard shortcuts to the Team context menu.

M1+M3+U ("update") should be added once we have "pull" support.
M1+M3+P ("create patch") should be added after the context menu of the history view was changed 
to use command contribution items instead of action contribution items.

Line:1621, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Why do we use E here and not M?

Looks good, share the same sentiments as Stefan regarding shortcut choice.

E was used in the shortcut to be the same as in SVS (see the screenshot attached to bug 314096). I personally wouldn't mind to use M.

Line:1621, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> E is used by SVN
