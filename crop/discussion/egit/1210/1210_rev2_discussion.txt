DESCRIPTION

Add some keyboard shortcuts to the Team context menu.

M1+M3+U ("update") should be added once we have "pull" support.
M1+M3+P ("create patch") should be added after the context menu of the history view was changed
to use command contribution items instead of action contribution items.
