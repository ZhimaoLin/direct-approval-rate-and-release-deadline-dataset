DESCRIPTION

RFC (rebased) [historyView] Track renamed paths and provide to actions

Several History view actions currently fail when the view is
set to follow renames since they derive the path used from
the current repository path and do not take into account
older paths that the resource was known as.

This commit creates a simple RenameTracker class that tracks
which commits introduced renames allowing the GitHistoryPage
to provide the previous paths for a specific commit given the
initial path.

At the moment, rename tracking only works when "Show all changes of
selected resource and its children" is checked, because JGit currently
does not allow combining a FollowFilter with e.g. a PathFilter.

The commit also makes the commit viewer's "Compare with Previous
Version" honour renames.

Caveat: This change unfortunately undoes some of the work in
I4ae8abfc4dbe7ed772749afa80743278247585ee and my manual test coverage is
pretty low (IFile and IResource only)

Patch Set 6:

Stefan, please see the discussion on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374722, especially https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374722#c19

Combining "Follow renames" with the different "Show all changes..." options is not feasible at the moment, nor would it help very much, because it would be limited to comparing the single selected file in the entire history.

Patch Set 6:

More useful would be being able to compare two arbitrary files in two arbitrary commits. That would solve the general problem, but is irrelevant to rename detection.

I agree that we should submit this change although it only works if "Show all changes of selected resource and its children" is checked.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think the change is quite mature now and the RFC can be removed

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please remove this
