DESCRIPTION

RFC (rebased) [historyView] Track renamed paths and provide to actions

Several History view actions currently fail when the view is
set to follow renames since they derive the path used from
the current repository path and do not take into account
older paths that the resource was known as.

This commit creates a simple RenameTracker class that tracks
which commits introduced renames allowing the GitHistoryPage
to provide the previous paths for a specific commit given the
initial path.

Caveat: This change unfortunately undoes some of the work in
I4ae8abfc4dbe7ed772749afa80743278247585ee and my manual test coverage is
pretty low (IFile and IResource only)

See my comment on patch set 4.

The follow filter is only set in GitHistoryPage's createFileWalker method if there is a filter set to file paths. Only then the rename tracker is reset to a path.

To make this change work if the filter is set to the whole repository , project or folder I think the follow filter also has to be set for these cases in order to fill the rename tracker.
