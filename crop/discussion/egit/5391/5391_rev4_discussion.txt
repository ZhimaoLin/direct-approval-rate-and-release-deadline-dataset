DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Track renamed paths and provide to actions

Several History view actions currently fail when the view is
set to follow renames since they derive the path used from
the current repository path and do not take into account
older paths that the resource was known as.

This commit creates a simple RenameTracker class that tracks
which commits introduced renames allowing the GitHistoryPage
to provide the previous paths for a specific commit given the
initial path.

Works well, but only after the filter is once set to "Show all changes to selected resources and its children".

The reason is that the method createFollowFilterFor() of GitHistoryPage is only called from createFileWalker if all filter paths are file paths.
