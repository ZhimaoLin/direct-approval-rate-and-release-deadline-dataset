DESCRIPTION

Performance Enhacement of Synchronize View

The results of GitResourceVariantTree.fetchVariant() seams to be unused
by Team Synchronization framework therefore it can return null.

This change adds huge performance benefit for synchronization since we
don't travel on all trees searching for changed variants.
