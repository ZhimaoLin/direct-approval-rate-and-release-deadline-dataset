DESCRIPTION

Fix painting of checkboxes in table on GTK

Before, there was just a black/white area instead of a checkbox.

How to verify:

* Open Team > Remote > Push...
* Click Next
* Click "Add All Branches Spec"
* "Force Update" checkbox should be rendered correctly and toggleable

Adding an explicit call to composite.print(gc) and drawing to an image
fixes it. Maybe the changes in SWT bug 354978 broke what apparently
worked before.

Also make sure that there is no margin/spacing between the drawn
buttons, otherwise borders end up in the cut up images.
