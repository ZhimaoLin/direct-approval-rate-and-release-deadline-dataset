DESCRIPTION

Fix painting of checkboxes in table on GTK

Before, there was just a black/white area instead of a checkbox.

Adding an explicit call to composite.print(gc) and drawing to an image
fixes it. Maybe the changes in SWT bug 354978 broke what apparently
worked before.

Also make sure that there is no margin/spacing between the drawn
buttons, otherwise borders end up in the cut up images.
