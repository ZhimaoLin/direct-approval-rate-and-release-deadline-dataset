Line:176, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> Why that? If any were null here, we'd already have gotten an exception in line 164 above. In fact, even much earlier in line 98. And I don't see deleteRepositoryContent changing the nodes.

Line:180, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> I kind of prefer my listening solution -- our "model" here is RepositoryUtil, plus RepositoryCache, plus IndexDiffCache. Once we tell that model to remove a repo, the two caches should just update themselves.

However, what I like here is the repository.close() -- that is indeed needed. Except that now repositories are closed twice if delete == true. And we know (change I66aadc9) that can be problematic.

Line:625, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Yepp. Those two are missing in I8c20d4e8.
