Patch Set 2:

I'm not sure if we should really do this. This action is already available in Repositories View. We get more and more duplicated functionality.

Patch Set 2:

@Jens, yes this is some how duplicated functionality with repositories view. But personally I would prefer delete branch from branch selection dialog because for me it is more natural and straight forward way to done it. To reduce the code duplication I use same action (RemoveBranchCommand) as it is used in repositories view to reduce duplication.
