DESCRIPTION

Depend on org.eclipse.core.runtime >= 3.7

Since If7a0d7bfb4dd98d2373531eee63f042376cce228, we depend on 3.7 for
the INSTANCE fields of InstanceScope/DefaultScope.

Without this change, it's still possible to install EGit into Eclipse
3.5/3.6, but running it will cause errors because of the missing fields.
