DESCRIPTION

Fix in Git Repositories View update

That view was updated on any preference change in the plugin's
preferences. That's actually unnecessary, all this view cares about is
changes to the list of configured repositories.

Line:204, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> This may or may not also have a beneficial effect on the UI tests for this view. Those tests produce _two_ updates to the preferences, one for the legacy key RepositoryUtil.PREFS_DIRECTORIES  and a second one for
RepositoryUtil.PREFS_DIRECTORIES_REL. If those two updates resulted in two view refreshes, it might be possible that the tests waited only for the first, and the second one then would interfere with the test (re-setting the tree viewer's input while the test was operating to the tree nodes).

I'm not entirely sure that's the cause of the frequent failures in these UI tests, but it does seem not impossible. We'll see...
