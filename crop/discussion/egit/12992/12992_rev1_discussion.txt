DESCRIPTION

Enable stash in repositories view whenever commit is allowd

Perhaps the state SAFE is a misnomer. This patch also implements
the declared canCommit and canAmmend in the RepositoryViewPropertyTester
and adds a new canStash.

Line:1673, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Changing this felt logical, BUT where is it used? Is anyone  of these handlers used? The effective change is at line 2757

See inline comments, looks good otherwise.

Line:1673, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Maybe that is the one being checked when you invoke "Stash Changes" via quick access (Ctrl+3)? I'm not sure though.

Line:128, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoriesViewPropertyTester.java -> I thought the above should already be covered by the reflection magic in ResourcePropertyTester.testRepositoryState? See change I5c72f66ceac7678a03c85794251304a3db82d196 (by you :)).

Line:128, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoriesViewPropertyTester.java -> My memory is good, but it's a bit short.
