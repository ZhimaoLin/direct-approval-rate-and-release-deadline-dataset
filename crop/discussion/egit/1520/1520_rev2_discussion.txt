DESCRIPTION

Fix UI tests on Mac

GlobalConfigurationPageTest is not working on Mac because
the preferences dialog is triggered via Eclipse->settings on Mac.
Now the preferences dialog is opened programmatically.
Remove usage of mnemonics to select radio buttons since
mnemonics are not supported on Mac.
