DESCRIPTION

Provide an option to fetch from Gerrit without checking out the branch

Sometimes one wants to fetch a change from gerrit to perform a code
review at a future time.  In that case, it is nice to not checkout the
newly created branch, not only to save time, but also to avoid having to
commit any un-committed changes to the users's current working branch.

By default, this new option will be enabled (perform checkout) to behave
as before.

The Noteworthy page for the next EGit release 3.4 is at https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/New_and_Noteworthy/3.4. As far as I know, it is usually populated by Douglas Trujillo, who also does the release, but it would be kind to add a short description and a screenshot.

Ok, Changed my mind. 

Can you make the branch name edit field one line only? It's too high. Make it a new patch since it's not caused by this change

Sorry I don't understand what you mean.  Before this patch, the different fields to create a new branch in the Fetch from Gerrit dialog were on one line; with this patch I introduce a second line.  I thought you may be asking to keep it one line, but then you said it wasn't caused by this change so I'm confused :)  Could you clarify?

Patch Set 2:

I propose to move the new checkout checkbox up so that it's located above the branch name field, this way we would need one line less:

 * Create local branch         v Checkout new branch 
   Branch name                   <branch name field>                  Edit branches...
