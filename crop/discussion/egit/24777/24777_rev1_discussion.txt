DESCRIPTION

Provide an option to fetch from Gerrit without checking out the branch

Sometimes one wants to fetch a change from gerrit to perform a code
review at a future time.  In that case, it is nice to not checkout the
newly created branch, not only to save time, but also to avoid having to
commit any un-committed changes to the users's current working branch.

By default, this new option will on (checkout) to behave as before.

Minor wording suggestions, looks good otherwise.

Line:541, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Maybe doNewBranchCheckout -> doCheckoutNewBranch

Line:607, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Maybe doNewBranchCheckout -> doCheckoutNewBranch

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> "will on" -> "will be on" or "will be enabled"

Thanks for the view!
BTW, if this is accepted, is there a New&Noteworthy where such a change should be documented?
