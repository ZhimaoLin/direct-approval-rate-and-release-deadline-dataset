DESCRIPTION

Provide an option to fetch from Gerrit without checking out the branch

Sometimes one wants to fetch a change from gerrit to perform a code
review at a future time.  In that case, it is nice to not checkout the
newly created branch, not only to save time, but also to avoid having to
commit any un-committed changes to the users's current working branch.

By default, this new option will be enabled (perform checkout) to behave
as before.

Patch Set 3:

I like Matthias suggestion.  It looks good and saves space.  I took the liberty to right-align the "checkout new branch" button, which is not exactly what was suggested.

I can change it if you don't like it.
