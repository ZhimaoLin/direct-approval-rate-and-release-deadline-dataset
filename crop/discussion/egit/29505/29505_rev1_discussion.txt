DESCRIPTION

Clean up getSelection in RepositoryActionHandler

* Split up convertSelection. There were two ways this was called, and
  either one or the other argument was always null.
* Remove the duplication between the ExecutionEvent and
  IEvaluationContext variants.
* Mark non-instance methods final.
