Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

when rebasing e.g. a local branch onto a remote tracking branch the target is always displayed as

 <missing argument>

this seems wrong, instead I would like to see the name of the remote tracking branch

Patch Set 1:

For me, the job title looks like this:

 Rebasing Branch master on refs/remotes/origin/master
 
No doubt that "refs/remotes/" should not be there, but I see no sign of "<missing argument>".

Patch Set 1:

it works properly in the repositories view, but when rebasing from the history view i see the <missing argument>
