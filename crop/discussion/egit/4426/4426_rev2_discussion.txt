The Hudson build failure is once again unrelated. It's
Bug 352559: Build is failing due to several red tests

If one uses Hudson to judge contributions, then the tests used for that should be stable.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful; IP review completed

I'm ready to accept this as the default, but I don't mind a consistent override for all of EGit (or eclipse) for that matter after this.

Patch Set 2:

From the discussion in bug 356052 I was assuming that we abandon this bug here in favor of honoring the EGit date format preference in all EGit.

> I think something went wrong: the fix is not in.
OK, it looks like the fix went in but then replaced by http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,4439.

I guess it would be more obvious if this change here would not have 'Merged' but rather 'Abandoned'.

Having said that, all looks good now in 1.3.0.201201151914.
