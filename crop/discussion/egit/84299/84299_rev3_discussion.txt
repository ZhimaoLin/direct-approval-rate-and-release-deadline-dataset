DESCRIPTION

Handle MultiPageEditorParts in BlameOperation

In commit c72723a some calls to
RevisionAnnotationController.openEditor() were replaced because they
created the wrong kind of FileRevisionEditorInput.

Turns out that the replacement wasn't good; IDE.openEditor returns the
MultiPageEditorPart, not the nested AbstractDecoratedTextEditor.

Re-introduce RevisionAnnotationController for the IFile case, use our
own utils only for the IFileRevision case, and do handle multi-page
editors explicitly in that case.
