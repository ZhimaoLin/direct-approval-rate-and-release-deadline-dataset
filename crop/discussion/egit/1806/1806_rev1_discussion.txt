DESCRIPTION

Fix RepositoriesViewLabelProvider

With 82ad8027cc039abe7de878110b562ca6ee97e2c9, a bug was
introduced that results in the commit-ID being shown for each
branch in the Repositories View.
This fixes that bug and also optimizes performance for the label provider
somewhat by avoiding unnecessary calls to getSimpleText().
