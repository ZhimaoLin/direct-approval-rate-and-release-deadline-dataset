Patch Set 1:

IMHO instead of disabling it we should fix them, I'll work on fixing it this later today.

Patch Set 1:

Agreed. I'll be glad to help out with that (we should really try to get a build soon). Let me know if this makes sense and where to look for (I was guessing that one would have to switch to "File system mode" in the synch view or something).

Patch Set 1:

Change I85af6f964f11be4f3bdb6e3c44c85da97d15ec49 should also fix those tests, at least if fixes it on my machine.
