DESCRIPTION

Update documentation for 1.2

Since some contributor refactored the User Guide in the wiki which broke
the documentation build and a large number of hyperlinks this time the
documentation generation was done against a hand-crafted copy of the
split new pages in order to defer fixing the regressions introduced by
splitting the wiki page until 1.2 release is ready.
