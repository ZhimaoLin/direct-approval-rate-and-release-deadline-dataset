DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] Add Clean to the Advanced Menu

This needs work.

[mduft] i have added some meat to the menu item :) i'm absolutely sure
it's not yet what is wanted/required, but at least this is now able to
clean out files (simple tests worked for me). What would definitely be
missing is cleaning out directories, but i found no easy way to do it.
