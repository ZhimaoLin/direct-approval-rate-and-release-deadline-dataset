DESCRIPTION

Add "Clean..." option for git managed projects

This implements a fully working version if a "Clean..." menu. I'm not
quite sure whether this is good enough already, but at least it does
something ;)

This adds:
 * a dialog which allows configuration of the action to be taken
   (dry-run, clean directories)
 * a result dialog which displays what happened (or would have happened
   in dry-run mode).

This change relies on a change with the same ID in jgit!
