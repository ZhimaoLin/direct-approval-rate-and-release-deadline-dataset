DESCRIPTION

[wip] Allow other plugins contribute to Staging view context menus

1) Propagate File adapter for StagingEntries
2) Allow platform extent context menus

TODO
1) The selection provider is hardcoded to the unstaged viewer. This
confuses contributions to the staged area menu. We must not allow
simultaneous selection in both staged and unstaged areas and set common
selection provider.
2) Now after contributions are allowed we see meaningless entries for
the staged/unstaged entries. We should make them more clever or hide
them.

> any hints which menu contributions you envision ?

The idea is to provide file-related menu contributions (similar what I've described in http://javaclipse.blogspot.com/2015/11/anyedit-260-for-beta-testers.html).

Actually it would make sense to show most of the file related Team actions too, at least in the unstaged area. If it looks like a file, it should behave like a file :-)
