DESCRIPTION

Minor Cleanup

This is about cleaning up the anti-pattern
of constructing an Exception in a utility
method and throwing it in the code. This
will result in wrong stack traces (found
both in EGit Core and EGit UI).

Furthermore, a couple of methods were
placed in the classes that need them instead
of having them in the plug-in activator (only in
EGit UI).

A few places were marked as TODO where
an error status is created but neither logged
nor thrown as CoreException.

Codewise this looks fine, but please separate the different kinds of changes into separate commits
