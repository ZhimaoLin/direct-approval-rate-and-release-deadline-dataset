Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The TODOs related to wrong exception handling in the original code should be done in a separate change.

Line:80, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitQuickDiffProvider.java -> I think the trow was just forgotten here and could be added (surrounding method throws CoreExecption).
