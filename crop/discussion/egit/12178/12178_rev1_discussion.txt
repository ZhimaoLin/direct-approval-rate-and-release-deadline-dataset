Patch Set 1:

The new icon is the same as in the Properties view toolbar for "Show Advanced Properties", right?

It's less used than "Link with Editor", but wouldn't it be better to have a new icon that is not used anywhere else already?

It's just a question of the tool tip (show more vs. filter something). The icon I use is the official "filter" icon. You can also see the icon in other views like the Package Explorer, Search, Navigator etc. (in the view menu).
