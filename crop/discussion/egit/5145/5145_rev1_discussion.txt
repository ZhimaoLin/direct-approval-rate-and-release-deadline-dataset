Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

My bad, I could have prevented this by providing a test for "file system" option in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5052/ but wanted to keep number of lines below 250 (no CQ needed). It bit me back sooner than I expected.

Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)



Line:178, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitCreatePatchWizard.java -> style nit: this line is too wide, use the jgit format coming in ./tools/eclipse-JGit-Format.xml

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> missing colon: s/Bug/Bug:/
