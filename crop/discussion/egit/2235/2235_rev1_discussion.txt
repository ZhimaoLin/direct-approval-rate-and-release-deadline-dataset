DESCRIPTION

Handle simple tags in repositoryutilu

The decorators try to find tags for the branch label, but fail
with an IncorrectObjectTypeException if a tag is a simple
non-annotated tag. For those and annotated tags without a time
stamp, pick the committer time as reference for selecting the
right one.
