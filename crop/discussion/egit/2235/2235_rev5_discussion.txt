DESCRIPTION

Handle simple tags in RepositoryUtils

The decorators try to find tags for the branch label, but fail
with an IncorrectObjectTypeException if a tag is a simple
non-annotated tag. For those and annotated tags without a time
stamp, pick the committer time as reference for selecting the
right one.

For simple tags or tags without a timestamp, use the committer
time stamp for sorting.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Yes, we need support for the lightweight tags eventually, but I'm afraid if we only show them in the project label, we'll confuse our users. Before we show the tag in the label, we should first include them in the tag dialog (see bug 323607) and if at all possible in the history view (I'm not aware of a bug for this one...).

Patch Set 5:

Simple tags already show up in the history view, so we actually have some support for them.

The problem is that the existence of a simple tags cause problems for annotated tags too, since there is an exception that aborts processing altogether.

Patch Set 5: (1 inline comment)

Ok, I see the point now (I think...). So perhaps we should simply not fill the tagMap for the time being (see comment in code).

Line:148, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryUtil.java -> At the moment, we don't see such tags anywhere else in Egit, so I guess we should not fill the tagMap here (perhaps we should add a TODO to consider these once we have tags in the tag dialog and history view).

Patch Set 5: No score

Ok, since we see the lightweight tags in the history, I guess this is ok. Will test this tomorrow (unless someone else wants to take this).
