DESCRIPTION

Handle simple tags in RepositoryUtils

The decorators try to find tags for the branch label, but fail
with an IncorrectObjectTypeException if a tag is a simple
non-annotated tag. For those and annotated tags without a time
stamp, pick the committer time as reference for selecting the
right one.i

This caused all or some refs to be missing in the history view.
