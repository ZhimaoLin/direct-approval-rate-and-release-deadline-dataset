DESCRIPTION

Git Repositories View: Bare Repositoy Support

The following actions are disabled for a "bare"
Repository:

- browsing the working directory
- import of projects

The "bare"-ness of a Repository is visualized in the "Working Directoy" node
which displays "This is  a bare Repository" instead of the working directory.
