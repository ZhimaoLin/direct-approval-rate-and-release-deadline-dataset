Line:400, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/ReflogView.java -> no, don't resolve the symbolic link here otherwise you get the reflog for the branch HEAD is pointing at, instead I would like to see the extra reflog maintained for HEAD which follows all updates of HEAD including branch switches with is not the case for git reflog for a branch.

Use just 

 refName = Constants.HEAD 

instead of 

 refName = ref.getTarget().getName() 

then you'll see the difference, select master to see the difference. 

Also the branch selection dialog of the reflog view needs to show HEAD otherwise this cannot be selected explicitly.
