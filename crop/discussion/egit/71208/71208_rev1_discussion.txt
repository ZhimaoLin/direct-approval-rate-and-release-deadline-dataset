DESCRIPTION

Refactor code: simplification, and avoid findbugs warning

* activePage can be a local variable; no need for it to be a member. As
  a member, it would have been possible to use it before it was set.
* Filter for the project directly while collecting editor references
  instead of first collecting all references and then filtering.
