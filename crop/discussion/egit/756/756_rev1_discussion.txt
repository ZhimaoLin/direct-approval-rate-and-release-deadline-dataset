DESCRIPTION

Fix SWTBot test: Use ceiling directory

The SharingWizardTest did not work in the maven build.
The test assumes that no git repository is found above
the test project. When the junit-workspace was located
inside a git repository this condition was not fulfilled.

This is fixed using a MockSystemReader and a
ceiling directory.
