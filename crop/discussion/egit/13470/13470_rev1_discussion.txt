DESCRIPTION

Consider URLs without user name when importing project sets

Project set files usually do not contain user names, but remote URLs
in repo configs often do.  The opposite case might also happen, though
more rarely: repo remote URL is anonymous, but project is not.
Still consider these URLs (and thus the repos) the same.
