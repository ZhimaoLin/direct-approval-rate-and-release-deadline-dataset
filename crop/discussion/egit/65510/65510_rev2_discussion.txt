DESCRIPTION

Improve performance of SelectionUtils.getRepository()

Instead of converting selected elements to an IPath location always
and then using RepositoryMapping.getRepository(IPath), try to keep as
much info as needed and as possible: if the selection contains
IResources, use their projects and the much more efficient
RepositoryMApping.getRepository(IProject).

In my tests on a test workspace with 46 open projects and the git
toolbar and global menu enabled, this results in a speedup of the
SelectionUtils.getRepository(IStructuredSelection) operation by a
factor of 10 to 20 in most cases.
