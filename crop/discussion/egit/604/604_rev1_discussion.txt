DESCRIPTION

BranchSelectionDialog fixes

Currently, hitting "Rename" on a tag
will do some renaming inappropriately: the result
is a new local branch.
The same goes when renaming a remote
branch using this dialog: the result is a local
branch.
This fix will disable renaming of tags
altogether and use the appropriate prefixes
when renaming branches.
In addition, the different buttons will be
enabled/disabled depending on the selection
of the tag/branch.
