DESCRIPTION

Add "quick" compare and use it in history view by default

When clicking "Compare with each other" after selecting exactly two
commits while showing a project, folder, or repository in the history
view, we open a "quick" compare (using the Eclipse compare
infrastructure) to show the structural differences instead of the
Git Tree Compare view. A new menu action is added to allow to open the
Tree Compare.
