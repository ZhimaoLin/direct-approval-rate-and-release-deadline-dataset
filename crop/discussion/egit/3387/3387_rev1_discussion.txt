Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CompareIndexWithHeadActionHandler.java -> style nit: we use no braces around single line blocks

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CompareIndexWithHeadAction.java -> shouldn't that be your own Copyright ?
