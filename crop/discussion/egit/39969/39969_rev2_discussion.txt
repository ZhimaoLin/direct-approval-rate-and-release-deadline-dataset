DESCRIPTION

Transparent icons in push branch dialog

setBackgroundImage() has problems with transparency on some platforms
(seen on Windows7). Therefore the 2 icons in that dialog have solid
white and black background. Fixed by using setImage() as in all other
dialogs.

Tested on Windows 7 and Ubuntu/GTK.
