DESCRIPTION

Respect push URL's port configuration in Gerrit configuration

If the push URI already is ssh, it most likely already has a port,
and if the user cloned the repo from Gerrit, it will even be correct.
Replacing that by Gerrit's default ssh port of 29418 is most confusing
if that Gerrit runs its sshd on a non-standard port.
