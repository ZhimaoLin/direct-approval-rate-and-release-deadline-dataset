DESCRIPTION

Bug 475740 - Respect port in Gerrit configuration.

If the push URI already is ssh, it most likely already has a port,
and if the user cloned the repo from Gerrit, it will even be correct.
Replacing that by Gerrit's default ssh port of 29418 is most confusing
if that Gerrit runs its sshd on a non-standard port.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: we link to the bug in the commit message footer not in the header, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> See the initial patch set. Somebody should change the Helena Henry to pick up bug numbers also in the footer so that the Gerrit changes get linked from the Bugzilla entry. What's the Eclipse component to file a feature request for Eclipse Genie? :-)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The convention to link to bugs in the footer is much older than Genie's ability to auto-link from Bugzilla ...

Auto-linking links in the footer was implemented some weeks ago and works fine, see bug 465045

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok. It was the missing colon after "Bug" in the initial commit message's footer entry.
