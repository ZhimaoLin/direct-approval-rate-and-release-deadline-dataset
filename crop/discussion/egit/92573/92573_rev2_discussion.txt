* fetch result dialog should be enhanced to also show commits fetched for submodules updated by recursive fetch
* "Fetch from upstream" should also respect the option "fetch.recurseSubmodules" configured for the selected repository

Line:152, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefSpecPage.java -> When the fetch refspec page is opened none of the radio buttons is selected initially. Instead you should extend revalidateImpl() to select the recurse option configured for the selected repository. Similar to what it does for selecting configured autofollow option.

Ack.  This is still WiP; I will address these comments in later patch sets.

Currently struggling to get the egit project to build in Eclipse again after rebasing :(
