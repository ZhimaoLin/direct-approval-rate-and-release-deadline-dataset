DESCRIPTION

Don't let ignored resources cause index update jobs.

Changes to ignored resources cause deltas fired by eclipse. These deltas
will cause index update jobs even though there is nothing to do. In the
worst case, a lot of resources are changed, and even though nothing
happened to tracked files, a full re-index is done because the changed
resource count threshold was reached.
