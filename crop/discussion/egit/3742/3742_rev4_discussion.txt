DESCRIPTION

Introduce FilterPath class for following renames

Introduced a FilterPath class that holds a path
and the information whether the path is a
regular file or a directory.

This will be useful to implement the 'Follow Renames'
feature that needs to be effective only if filtered
path denotes a file.
