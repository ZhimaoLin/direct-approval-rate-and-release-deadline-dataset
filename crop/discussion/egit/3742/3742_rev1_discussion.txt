DESCRIPTION

Introduced a FilterPath class that holds a path
and the information whether the path is a
regular file or a directory.

This will be useful to implement the 'Follow Renames'
feature that needs to be effective only if filtered
path are actually one single regular file.

Line:444, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> This method is never used. Please remove it and add it in the next commit, or add a test case that calls the method. In eclipse that does not even compile (org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedPrivateMember=error in org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs)

Line:453, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Please also override hashCode (see e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27581/overriding-equals-and-hashcode-in-java)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> The commit message header should fit on one line (please see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines)

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please add the Change-Id line to the commit message before you push a second patch set (http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#To_update_an_existing_change_with_a_new_commit). The Change-Id can be found in the Gerrit header. In this case it is I2270ec8b68886b3715f2e07099d96486e5dcb504. It is best practice to include the Change-Id already in the first commit when working with Gerrit.
