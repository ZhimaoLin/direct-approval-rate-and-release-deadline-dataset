DESCRIPTION

Introduce FilterPath class for following renames

Introduced a FilterPath class that holds a path
and the information whether the path is a
regular file or a directory.

This will be useful to implement the 'Follow Renames'
feature that needs to be effective only if filtered
path are actually one single regular file.

Patch Set 3: (5 inline comments)

Mostly good stuff, but why can't we follow more than one path? I know C git log --follow doesn't but that seems like an arbitrary limitation.  You might not actually need to implement it, if there is just a good reason.

Line:457, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Shouldn't we call this methods isRegularFileOrDirectory then? I read this literally as "@return whether the file is a regular file or a directory", but my guess is it would be clearer without the parentheses. It would also be clearer if you state what is the meaning a "true" return value (by implication everything else is false). xxx@xxx.xxx true if the file is a regular file.

Did you consider how gitlinks and symbolic links affect this method in the future? I assume this method would return false for directories and gitlinks, but how about symblic links?
