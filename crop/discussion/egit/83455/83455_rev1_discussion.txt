DESCRIPTION

Fix recursive adaptation

The typo fix done in commit ddb2f97e uncovered an endless recursion
problem. Remove that adapter definition completely for now. It was
introduced as part of a change that made the history view react on
working set selections, but for that, the adapter definition for
IWorkingSet is sufficient.

I'll have to re-visit this later to see more precisely if there's a
simple way to have this adapter definition without running into an
endless recursion.
