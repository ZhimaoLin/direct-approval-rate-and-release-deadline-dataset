DESCRIPTION

Fix incomplete null analysis configuration

JGit annotations were configured in the projects properties, but the
dependency was unresolvable in the IDE. Hence null analysis was
effectively disabled.

Also fix potential null access that was revealed after the null analysis
configuration has been fixed.
