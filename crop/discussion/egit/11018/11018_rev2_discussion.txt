DESCRIPTION

Fix rebase pulldown in toolbar not being accessible during rebase

During rebase, the rebase pulldown menu in the toolbar was always
disabled, resulting in no way to do a "abort" or other actions through
the toolbar.

The problem is that the enabled state of the action handler for the main
action also determines whether the pulldown menu can be opened (the
little arrow besides the icon). So instead of disabling it when rebase
is not possible, also enable it during rebase, and check state again
when executing.

In addition to the above, this fixes RebaseActionHandler's enabled state
to behave the same way as RebaseCurrentRefCommand, in that it's also
enabled with a detached HEAD.
