DESCRIPTION

Fix rebase pulldown in toolbar not being accessible during rebase

During rebase, the rebase pulldown menu in the toolbar was always
disabled, resulting in no way to do a "abort" or other actions through
the toolbar.

The problem is that the enabled state of the action handler for the main
action also determines whether the pulldown menu can be opened (the
little arrow besides the icon). So instead of disabling it when rebase
is not possible, also enable it during rebase, and check state again
when executing.

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RebaseActionHandler.java -> This enables rebase when on a detached head? If so that
ss good, because it's a common use case when grabbing stuff from Gerrit

Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RebaseAction.java -> We might want to actually make isRebasing() a method in RepositoryState.

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RebaseActionHandler.java -> Yeah, I thought the check before was strange, for the reason you say. Looking at RebaseCurrentRefCommand, I now think we should reuse its logic (it also checks if HEAD exists), will update the change.

Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RebaseAction.java -> Ok, I can do that.
