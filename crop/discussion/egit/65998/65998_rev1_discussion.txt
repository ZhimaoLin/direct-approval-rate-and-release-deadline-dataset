DESCRIPTION

Fix logic for detecting whether there are unstaged changes

Didn't account for conflicts. Add a new hasUnstagedChanges() to
IResourceState to have the calculation in (preferrably) one place. (Ok,
StagingEntry must re-implement it.)

Add assertions in the existing tests in DecoratableResourceAdapterTest
for the new operation.
