DESCRIPTION

Only trim leading segment of remote references

The proposed target branch names in the create branch wizard
will now follow the following conventions

refs/remotes/origin/branches/a -> branches/a
refs/remote/origin/r1 -> r1
refs/tags/v1 -> v1

Previously only the last segment of the reference was used
which would cause inconsistencies when the selected source
branch name contained a '/' character.

Line:300, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> Does it make sense to extract all these if-else AKA shortening logic) into separate class and unit test it?
