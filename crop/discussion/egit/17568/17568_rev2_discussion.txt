DESCRIPTION

Fix StagingViewTest not finding toolbar items

Also make sure that configured repositories are cleaned up.

Has been broken since the buttons were moved from the view toolbar to
the commit message section toolbar.

This was not detected because the test was not actually run on Hudson,
see change about test suites.
