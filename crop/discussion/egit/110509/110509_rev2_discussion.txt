Thanks for the fixes! It seems to be an older version of the patch, before I did actually test it... Sorry for adding you work and thanks for fixing!

SWTbot tests need to be adapted. Probably they're still looking for Next and Finish buttons.

Line:63, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/PushCommand.java -> What happened to setHelpAvailable()? Looks like somebody had once started with help pages, and set the help contexts on the PushWizard pages. But that work appears to be incomplete, and the wizard hasn't isHelpAvailable set...

But removing the setHelpAvailable() is a step backwards. If somebody wants to pick up this incomplete help work, he'll have to undo these changes here again.
