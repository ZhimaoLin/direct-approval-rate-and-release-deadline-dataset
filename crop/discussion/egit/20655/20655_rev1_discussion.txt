DESCRIPTION

Pull with rebase: show dialog if there are uncommitted changes

This is already implemented for rebase.

In case of a pull from multiple repositories there are now several
dialogs in case of uncommitted changes. This could be improved.

Line:140, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullOperationUI.java -> As you said in the commit message this may open multiple dialogs.

I tried the change with three repositories: one having uncommited changes and two that either pull cleanly or abort due to other reasons.

After starting to pull, the CleanupUncomittedChangesDialog and a pull result dialog for the other two repositories popped up. The result dialog appeared in the foreground, but clicking its OK button did not close it. Only after closing the CleanupUncomittedChangesDialog (which was behind the result dialog) I could click OK on the result dialog.
