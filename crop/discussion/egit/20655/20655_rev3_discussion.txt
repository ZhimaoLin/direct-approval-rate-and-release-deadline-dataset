DESCRIPTION

Pull with rebase: show dialog if there are uncommitted changes

This is already implemented for rebase.

In case of a pull from multiple repositories there are now several
dialogs in case of uncommitted changes. This could be improved.

Just two comments left, after that it's good to go IMO.

Line:153, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullOperationUI.java -> This should also be a LinkedHashMap, so that the order in which the uncommitted changes dialogs appear is predictable.

Line:199, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullOperationUI.java -> While trying this out, I noticed that neither the title nor the description mentions the repository name. In this case, I think it should be in the title. It should also be in "Title Case".
