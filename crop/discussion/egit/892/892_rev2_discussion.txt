Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- rebased to current master
- added missing license headers
- fixed typo

If many configuration parameters are defined the edit fields and buttons are only reachable after scrolling down. Only the parameter list should scroll and the edit area should be always visible. Also some tests could be added. 

Would be nice to have a list of standard parameters at hand, maybe we could add value help and/or context sensitive help in another subsequent change.
