DESCRIPTION

Make auto-staging of files being moved configurable

- by default auto-stage files being moved. This simplifies reverting a
move using hard reset. If moved files aren't auto-staged hard reset does
not fully revert the move since the new unstaged file isn't tracked by
git
- add an option to disable auto-staging of files being moved
