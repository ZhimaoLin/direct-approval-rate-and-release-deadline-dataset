DESCRIPTION

Remove GitIndex from CommitDialog

CommitDialog no longer uses GitIndex. The status of the files to
be committed is now calculated by reusing the IndexDiff that is
already calculated in CommitActionHandler.

Line:329, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CommitActionHandler.java -> is anybody removing these indexDiffs from the cache? If this RepositoryActionHandler is some longliving instance we might consume more memory then needed. After the commitdialog is gone we don't need that cache anymore, or? Forget this comment if the CommitActionHandler is instantiated newly for every event.
