DESCRIPTION

[reflogView] Remove 'Committer' column

After using this column for several weeks it seems to
be largely redundant since a local repository rarely has
more than one committer.

Also, in the case of changing your e-mail address, you will
no longer see 'me' presented in the column even though it was
still you who was the committer.
