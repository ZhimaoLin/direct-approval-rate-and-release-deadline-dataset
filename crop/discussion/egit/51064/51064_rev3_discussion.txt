DESCRIPTION

Test stability fixes related to job scheduling/resource changes etc

Trying to fix instabilities in recently failed unstable tests:
Job.join() can immediately return if expected job is not yet scheduled.
So let TestUtil.joinJobs() wait before joining.

Many git operations may trigger resource changes, resource changes can
trigger jobs via listeners, so make sure we proceed eventually triggered
jobs after such events.
