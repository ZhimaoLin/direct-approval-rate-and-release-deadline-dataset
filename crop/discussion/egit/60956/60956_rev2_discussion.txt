DESCRIPTION

Harmonize menus a little

* Remove the restriction on a single-element selection from some
  action handlers. There's no reason for it, and it's confusing for
  the user. The important thing here is for many commands that all
  elements in the selection belong to the same repository.
* Enable actions also for working sets. The property tester makes sure
  that actions applicable only to one repository are only enabled if
  the working set contains only projects belonging to one repository.
  (Previously, Push to Upstream, Fetch from Upstream, Pull, and Reset
  were disabled on working sets.)
* Enable Team->Repository->Pull when IFolders or IFiles are selected.
