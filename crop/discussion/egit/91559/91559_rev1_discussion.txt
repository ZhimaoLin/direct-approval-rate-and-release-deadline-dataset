Better, but still has problems. I'm also not sure about that image-only button.

It's OK with me if you want to pursue this attempt and polish it. For comparison, I have whipped together code for my other idea: use content assist instead of a button. It's at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/91579/ . What do you think?

Line:2621, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIText.java -> Typo, missing e: NormalizeName

Line:237, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> Somehow this text field suddenly appears much larger (height) on my Mac, and text is displayed at the top border instead of centered.

Line:267, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> This image-only button looks a bit strange. Rather non-standard.

Line:272, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> What's with this code?

Line:311, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> Could use a Java 8 lambda here.

Line:317, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> Should enable/disable the button depending on whether the ref is syntactically correct.

I think the icon for the normalizer button looks strange and doesn't really reveal what it's good for. Only when hovering over the button I get a tooltip explaining that I can use it to normalize the branch name

I think I prefer Thomas' alternative proposal using content assist
