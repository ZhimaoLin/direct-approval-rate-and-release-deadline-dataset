Looks good to me. I'm unsure about the two copyright entries. Therefore I don't score..

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/coretext.properties -> Is it required to change 2012 to 2013?

Line:3, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/CoreText.java -> Is it required to insert 2013 there for removements?
