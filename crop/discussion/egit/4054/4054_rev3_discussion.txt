DESCRIPTION

[RFC][sync] Add cache provider for Git Change Set model

Base commit for improving Git Change Set model performance and reducing
memory footprint. It simply reduces number of created TreeWalks and
instead of keeping full JGit objects it contains only basic data needed
by synchronize view.

This implementation can change over time. It is possible that during
further refactoring of current Git Change Set implementation more data
will be needed in cache in such case I'll amend this commit.

Patch Set 3: No score

This patch looks good now for me. The only issue I've discovered is descried here: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01233.html (don't know why all kernel commits aren't retrieved from repository).

I'll remove 'RFC' tag later today
