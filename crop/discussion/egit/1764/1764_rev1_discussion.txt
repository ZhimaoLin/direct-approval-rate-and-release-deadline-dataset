DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Refactoring third part

Add a command to allow "Show in History" for multi-selection in the
Repositories View. Adjust all handlers to work with a list of Files as well
as a list of IFiles. Show an error message instead of a wrong history
when the user selects a file that is in the GIT directory.
