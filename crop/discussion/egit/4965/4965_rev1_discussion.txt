DESCRIPTION

Don't drop last character when parsing change id

Previously when the commit message did not end with a newline
the last character was dropped when attempting to parse a change
id SHA-1 which would fail since the input string would be 39
characters.

Now the change id SHA-1 is assumed to be from the end of the
prefix to the end of the commit message

Change-Id: I610659af0bf21344cb06599634f4ddd874ec09b0
