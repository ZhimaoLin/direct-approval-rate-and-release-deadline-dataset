Patch Set 1:

current situation looks like a mess

- we should not depend on SNAPSHOT versions, why are there 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT and 2.4-SNAPSHOT but no released version in that range ?
- the codehaus repo we reference has the 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT version [1] 
but the build on hudson fails over and over again complaining that this doesn't exist

Patch Set 1:

If29cacd5 should fix this. For some reason Hudson tries to resolve released versions against this snapshot repository.

Patch Set 1:

these build problems were caused by a failed download of the findbugs-maven-plugin, by default Maven will not retry the download. This can be fixed by either wiping the workspace (means .m2 repository) or by using the -U command line parameter which will enforce retrying the download on the next build. I reconfigure the egit build to use this -U option.

Now we run into test problems since the egit.core tests seem not to be able to find the mockito jars, I am currently investigating why.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think we don't need this change as using maven command line option -U does fix the download problem
