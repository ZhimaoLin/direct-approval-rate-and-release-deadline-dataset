DESCRIPTION

Update of GitSynchronizeData API

In Git synchronization we always operate on commit level changes
therefore source and destination points should be always RevCommit
objects. In case of synchronizing tags we should map given tag with
proper RevCommit object. Instead of doing this multiple times on
different levels I've add this resolution to GitSynchronizeData
constructor.
