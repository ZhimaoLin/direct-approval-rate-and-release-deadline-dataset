DESCRIPTION

Branch Selection Dialog UI improvements

The dialog shown for Team->Branch... and Team->Reset To... was
reworked to re-use the same tree as the Git Repositories view.
Also, double-click is now supported to perform the
"Ok"-Action.
Furthermore, we found a problem with checking out remote
branches: HEAD is pointed to the remote branch instead
of to the underlying commit; for the time being, we deactivate
check-out of remote branches

Where are these 3 changes this one has been split into ? It looks like the 3 changes are still squashed into this change, also the commit message still lists all 3.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

creating a local branch starting from a remote branch isn't possible anymore:

- Team > Branch...
- select branch origin/master
- click new branch and enter mynewmaster
-> this creates the branch refs/remotes/mynewmaster

with the old implementation I get instead branch
refs/heads/mynewmaster

Patch Set 4:

Ok, good point... Can we always assume that we want to create a local branch or do we have to let the user decide whether a local or a remote branch schould be created?

Patch Set 4:

on command line remote tracking branches are created with
- $ git remote add <name> <url>   [1]
- $ git branch --track <branch> <remote-branch> [2]
  create a tracking branch. Will push/pull changes to/from another repository.
  Example: git branch --track experimental origin/experimental
- when branch.autosetupmerge=true git branch and git checkout will create remote tracking branches when the source for the operation is a branch in a remote repository

Hence to me it looks like the "create new branch" in this dialog should always create a local branch. Depending on 
configuration a remote tracking branch should be implicitly created.
