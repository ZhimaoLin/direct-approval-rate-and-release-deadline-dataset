I got the feeling that this is spinning out of control, so I reverted to master and re-applied only the changes needed to replace the tree and fix the "New Branch" issue.
Fortunately enough, in conjunction with change 680, check-out of remote branches is working now.

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

This an improvement :)

The dialog still needs some more work. In the future, we should probably consider using a FilteredTree to make it easier to filter for items in the tree.

Patch Set 5:

FYI, another thing we can consider doing is created a "block" class that contains the tree for the branches so we duplicate less code...
