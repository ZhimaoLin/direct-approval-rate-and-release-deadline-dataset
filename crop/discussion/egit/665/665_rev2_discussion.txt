DESCRIPTION

Branch Selection Dialog UI improvements

The dialog shown for Team->Branch... and Team->Reset To... was
reworked to re-use the same tree as the Git Repositories view.
Also, double-click is now supported to perform the
"Ok"-Action.
Also, we found a problem with checking out remote
branches: HEAD is pointed to the remote branch instead
of to the underlying commit; for the time being, we deactivate
check-out of remote branches
