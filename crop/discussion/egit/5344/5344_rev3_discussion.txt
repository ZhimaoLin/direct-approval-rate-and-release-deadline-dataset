- when looking at test coverage it's irrelevant if the new methods are public or not, most implementation classes are not public but should be covered by unit tests. I know that test coverage in egit could be better but the only way to improve this is to write tests :-)
- I pushed change Ie2d1518f5f6a72a0d409285d553e378379456223 to add missing unit tests for ProjectUtil
- please also add unit tests for the new methods
