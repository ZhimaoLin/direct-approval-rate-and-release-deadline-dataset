Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Intorducing a new public method w/o any test coverage is not good.

Patch Set 2:

hm.. i'm not sure if i understand you;

 *) the code is not public (it's in an internal package)
 *) none of the ProjectUtil methods has dedicated tests
 *) this is because the code is implicitly tested through all tests that do something with projects (nearly all?)
 *) in this particular case, the functionality is required by BranchOperation (ch If43a04410492ee6976f00d18d99c7b0a935c0689)
and the CleanRepositoryPage (ch I5136afd3333c6710b0c67c49618df6217e0d1fcf)
