DESCRIPTION

Introduce a method to find projects containing paths

The code searches for IContainer's containing a certain path, by
comparing all IProject's and the IWorkspaceRoot location with the given
filename. This is much cheaper than calling
IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI().

This is required by multiple changes
