DESCRIPTION

Introduce a method to find projects containing paths

The code searches for IContainer's containing a certain path, by
comparing all IProject's and the IWorkspaceRoot location with the given
filename. This is much cheaper than calling
IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI().

This is required by multiple changes

Patch Set 15: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

As already noted, I don't think this works correctly in all cases yet. For nested projects (both /path/to/root/.project and /path/to/root/sub/.project exist), it should return the "deepest" project.

Agree with nibor here

Line:312, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> Just equals is enough

Patch Set 15:

This code incorrectly mixes resources names with file names. 

e.g. Project1/file is not necessarily workspace + "/project" + "/file".

Projects may be located anywhere, not just in the workspace
and the name of the directory is not necessarily that of the project.
