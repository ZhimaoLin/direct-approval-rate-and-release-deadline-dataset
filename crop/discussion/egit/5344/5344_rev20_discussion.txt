DESCRIPTION

Introduce a method to find projects containing paths

The code searches for IContainer's containing a certain path, by
comparing all IProject's and the IWorkspaceRoot location with the given
filename. This is much cheaper than calling
IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI().

This is required by multiple changes

Line:295, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> Could we rename this to make it clear that this only returns projects and workspace root? In contrast to findContainersForLocationURI, it does not return folders.

Do we even need to return the workspace root? If not, it could just be called findProject.

Line:307, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> How about doing the getProjects() and sorting only once in the getProjectsContaining case instead of for each file?

Line:307, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ProjectUtil.java -> For the sake of the IP review of the downstream commits, I think it'd better to do that as a followup. For very large number of files we could definitely see a huge performance boost there.
