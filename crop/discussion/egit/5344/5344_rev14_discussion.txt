DESCRIPTION

Introduce a method to find projects containing paths

The code searches for IContainer's containing a certain path, by
comparing all IProject's and the IWorkspaceRoot location with the given
filename. This is much cheaper than calling
IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI().

This is required by multiple changes

Patch Set 14:

By the way, will this work for a nested/hierarchical project structure (e.g. /path/to/root/.project and /path/to/root/sub/.project)?
