Patch Set 1: No score; No score



Line:372, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> I think we should in addition remove the explanation:
"refs/heads/ will be prepended to the name you type" or move it to the online help since that's more an implementation detail than really important to the user, or am I missing something here ?
