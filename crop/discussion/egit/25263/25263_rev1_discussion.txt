DESCRIPTION

replace "can not" by "cannot" everywhere

In English, there seems to be a subtle difference in the meaning of "can
not" and "cannot", where "cannot" indicates an absolute impossibility,
while "can not <verb>" implies the possibility of actively chosing not
to do <verb>. In egit we therefore always want to use the "cannot"
variant in all comments and user interface texts.
