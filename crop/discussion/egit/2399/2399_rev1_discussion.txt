DESCRIPTION

Simplify Fetch and Push fourth part: update action set

The Git action set should expose the new "Simple" fetch and push
actions instead of the wizards; if the current branch is configured
correctly, users should be able to do Pull-Commit-Push cycles with
these buttons without the need to go through the fetch and push
wizards over and over again.
