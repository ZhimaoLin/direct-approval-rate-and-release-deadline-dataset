DESCRIPTION

Adds a config option for specifying the default source ref when
branching:
  [workflow]
        defbranchstartpoint = refs/remotes/origin/master

This change is needed to enable the automatic creation and
checkout of branches based on the active task.

Looks great overall.

Please have a look at my inline comments.

Line:125, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> When sourceRef is just the branch name (e.g. origin/master or master) without refs/remotes/ or refs/heads/ the behaviour is strange. In CreateBranchWizard's constructor the startpoint is set to the commit where the branch points to:

   // the page only knows some special Refs
  RevCommit commit = new RevWalk(repository)
     .parseCommit(repository.resolve(base + "^{commit}"));

If you directly resolve the branch here with 
  
  BranchOperationUI.createWithRef(repository,
	repository.getRef(sourceRef).getName()).start();

then "origin/master" is expanded to "refs/remotes/origin/master" and "master" is expanded to refs/heads/master.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> The header line is too long. Please have a look at https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines

I did the small improvements in order to include the change in the next release, as the IP-log will be prepared soon.

Line:125, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> Done here and in BranchSelectionAndEditDialog

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
