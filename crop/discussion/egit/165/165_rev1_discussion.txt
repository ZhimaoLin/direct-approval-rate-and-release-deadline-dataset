DESCRIPTION

On a project with source directory links,
ConnectProvider.findActualRepository() was failing.  Added a test case and
changed the code to avoid using Paths, since they would collapse
"src/../.git" into ".git", which is incorrect when "src" is a link.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please make the first comment line a short summary (~<70 characters) and provide a longer explaination below. Including something about the reason for changing how we create the projects.

Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/T0001_ConnectProviderOperationTest.java -> Due to the way Windows works, I'd rather see us doing something close to what the JGit tests does, which includes delaying the cleanup of temporary directories so the GC has a better change of reclaiming unused file descriptors and memory mappins (if used).

Maybe I should refactor that do avoid a CQ, so you do not need to fix that for this patch.

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/T0001_ConnectProviderOperationTest.java -> The baseclass contains rmrf(). Use it instead
