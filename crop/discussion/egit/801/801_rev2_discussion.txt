DESCRIPTION

Use informational icon for 'hidden repositories'

When one or more git repositories have been added in the Git Repositories view,
a warning message is shown in the dialog area with 'n directories are hidden as
they have already been added'.

This shouldn't be a warning message with a warning icon; it should be
informational, at best.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

rebased to current HEAD

We put bug ids in the footer.

We prefer to have the reasoning of why a change is necessary in the commit message so that understanding commits doesn't need a lookup of bugzilla entries.
