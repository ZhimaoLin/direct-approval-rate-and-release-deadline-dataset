DESCRIPTION

[releng] Update Mylyn Wikitext update site URL

Since March 2017, it is distributed via a separate update site that
doesn't have a "latest" version. C.f. bug 513498.

Two notes:
* The Mars target (egit-4.5) is broken as of today: easymport.tpd
  no longer works; the bundle is no longer in the e4 snapshot update
  site. I don't know where we might get it from.
* Wikitext is used only to generate org.eclipse.egit.doc. It's a
  build-time dependency only; it should not be in the target at all.
  However, trying to refactor this along the lines shown in [1]
  will be done later (and not in a maintenance branch). One problem
  with such a conversion might be that the latest version available
  in the maven repository is wikitext 2.9.0-SNAPSHOT.

you are right, we could try to add this in Maven pom.xml only since this only run from Maven

I don't care as long as the selected version works to download and convert our wiki pages to doc consumable format

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> That description appears to be outdated. Mylyn wikitext 3.0.9 is available on maven central: https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.mylyn.docs%22 So we should be able to use that?

Nice examples of how to do it are at https://github.com/greensopinion/wikitext-examples .
