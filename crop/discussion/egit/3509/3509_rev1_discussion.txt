DESCRIPTION

Use <user_home>/git as default-default repository path

This is better than the currently used <user_home>, as this is very
likely to result in Repositories being created directly under
<user_home>. We should instead support creation of the Repositories
under their own folder.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I like the proposal

When opening Preferences "Team > Git" to check the default setting I get a warning "Value must be an existing directory" so it looks like we should create the directory as soon as it is required. I also tried to clone a repo and found that the repository path defaults to the Eclipse workspace ??
