DESCRIPTION

Added error handling for InvalidConfigurationException,
TransportException, and CoreException when fetching or pulling.

This prevents Eclipse from giving a standard error message with a stack
trace and guides the user on how to fix their configurations for proper
use. These errors came up during a fetch/pull when their remote
configuration wasn't proper (no remotes, or non-fetch remote).

Patch Set 1:

I dislike having to examine the specific message of the exception since it puts a reliance on the core library not changing that message, but I couldn't find a way around it since the guidance is specific to that error.

Since there are no test cases specific for FetchOperationUI or PullOperationUI, I assume I don't need to add tests for this new functionality?

thanks for working on improving error handling

Line:271, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/pull/PullOperationUI.java -> DRY: extract this to a method instead of repeating this comparison

Line:128, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchOperationUI.java -> style nit: since 3.7 we use braces around single line blocks, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Braces_for_one-line_statements

Line:165, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchOperationUI.java -> - Are you sure all git servers respond exactly with this message when no new commits are available ? 
- What happens if the message looks slightly different ?

Line:174, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchOperationUI.java -> I'd say fetch succeeded in this case but there was no update available

Line:713, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> s/being pulled against/you pull from/

Line:713, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> s/they have the fetch/fetch is configured for each of these remotes/

Line:925, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> same as PullOperationUI_NothingToFetch

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: commit message header is way too long, it should fit on a single line shorter than 70 characters, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this isn't your name but an abbreviation, please fix your git configuration and set user.name to your real name
