DESCRIPTION

Test stability: one "widget disposed" message is enough

If a widget is disposed while we're waiting on its expansion, we would
get umpteen log entries until the waiting timed out. Let's stop waiting
instead, and then fail test test.

Also, it appears that GitRepositoriesViewTest.testImportWizard() gets
a repo view refresh at an inopportune moment. I don't quite see yet
where this is coming from, but let's wait for refresh jobs after having
closed the dialog the first time.

Patch Set 1:

This is supposed to clean up ugly logs such as the one at https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit/4193/testReport/junit/org.eclipse.egit.ui.view.repositories/GitRepositoriesViewTest/testImportWizard/

The change in testImportWizard() is supposed to work around that failure.
