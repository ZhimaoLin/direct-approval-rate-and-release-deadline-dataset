DESCRIPTION

Test stability: one "widget disposed" message is enough

If a widget is disposed while we're waiting on its expansion, we would
get umpteen log entries until the waiting timed out. Let's stop waiting
instead, and then fail test test.

Also, it appears that GitRepositoriesViewTest.testImportWizard() gets
a repo view refresh at an inopportune moment. I don't quite see yet
where this is coming from, but let's wait for refresh jobs after having
closed the dialog the first time.

Finally, FeatureFinishSquashHandlerTest expects a dialog to be opened
and wants to enter text there, but didn't wait for that dialog to
appear: another source of spurious test failures.
