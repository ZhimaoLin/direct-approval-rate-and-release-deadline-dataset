DESCRIPTION

ContextMenuHelper: add method contextMenuItemExists

contextMenuItemExists is introduced to check the existence of a context
menu item. In the past a failing call to clickContextMenu was performed
to do this check. GitRepositoriesViewBranchHandlingTest was adapted to
use the new method.
