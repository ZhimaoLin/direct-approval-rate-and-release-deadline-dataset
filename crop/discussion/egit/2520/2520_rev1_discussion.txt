DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Performance second part

This limits the number of commits to show in the history page to ten
thousand. This is a UI Preference available on the Git Preference
page. The user can set this to zero in order to see all commits.

The second thing is to hide the "tag sequence" by default. This is
very time and memory-consuming on big repositories. This is changeable
by another Git Preference.

In combination, this makes browsing the Linux 2.6 repository work
without too much waiting and memory overflow.
