DESCRIPTION

When creating branch, set current branch as suggested source branch

This is the second part of the solution for bug 315167. If the currently
checked-out branch is a remote branch, the combo will be pre-selected
with this branch when creating a new branch from the "Branches" node
of the Git Repositories view.
As additional convenience, if a remote brach is the suggested source,
the last part of that branch name will be suggested as name for the
local branch.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- clone jgit repository with all branches
- select remote branch stable-0.7
- "Create Branch"
- all fields of the dialog get good values (new local branch has by default the name "stable-0.7"
- but the finish button is not enabled
- when checking and unchecking the "Checkout" checkbox the finish button gets enabled
