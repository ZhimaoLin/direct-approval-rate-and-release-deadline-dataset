DESCRIPTION

Use standard undo icon for revert commit icon

The previous icon was a red square decoration decorating the
commit icon.  The red square seems to be usually used for the
stop action.  The undo icon seems more appropriate since
reverting is similar to an undo operation.

Patch Set 1:

Tomasz, let me know what you think about this, it is just an idea.

My current concern is that the red icon currently stands out a bit much and I was looking for something more recognizable that didn't require decorating the commit icon.
