DESCRIPTION

Use standard undo icon for revert commit icon

The previous icon was a red square decoration decorating the
commit icon.  The red square seems to be usually used for the
stop action.  The undo icon seems more appropriate since
reverting a commit is similar to an undo operation.

Patch Set 2:

I don't have any strong feelings about the previous icon, but I'm not sure if the undo icon is the best choice. You don't make the commit disappear, so connotation with the undo action may be too strong.

Would using the undo icon as an overlay on the commit be any better? In other words, replacing the red square with the undo arrow. They are both yellowish (commit and arrow), maybe the arrow should be painted red?

I can prepare both versions, so you can let me know what you think about them when you see them. How does this sound?
