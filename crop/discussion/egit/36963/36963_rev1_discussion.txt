Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/pom.xml -> this configuration never had any effect

Line:81, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui.test/pom.xml -> this has never worked (configuration option does not exist).

Looks good, except for the syntax errors (see comments)

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/pom.xml -> It is interesting that you specified this - but this didn't have an effect. Good that the new syntax fixed this - it only has one ID.

Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/pom.xml -> I don't think that this will work. There should only be one extraRequirements child of dependency-resolution

Line:80, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui.test/pom.xml -> Again, remove the two lines above.

Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/pom.xml -> thanks for spotting this :-) 

shouldn't Tycho throw an error if the syntax is invalid ?

Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/pom.xml -> In general, additional/unknown configuration tags are ignored in Maven.

Here, however Tycho and/or Maven could detect that the structure doesn't make sense. Debug output would also help: "Using extra requirements org.eclipse.jgit." Then you could have seen that the other ones are ignored.

If you want, open a bug for this.
