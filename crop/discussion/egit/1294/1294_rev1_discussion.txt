Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I would prefer GitModelSynchronize to be a static class... with a static accessor method to run the participant... it has no state...

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitModelSynchronize.java -> It looks like everything here should just be static methods.

How about a static final class with a synchronize method with the arguments currently in the constructor?
