DESCRIPTION

Show the diff to previous version in history view

The content is filtered by the same filter as the list of files in the
CommitFileDiffViewer (the table on the lower right of the view).

The diff is only shown for the case of one parent, i.e. merge commits
are still omitted.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Removed a bug for delete mode, rebased to master.

Now that the diff feature in jgit is merged to master we would like to show the diff in the UI.

Patch Set 3:

Since the underlying JGit change was cleared, should we now merge this cq-diff branch into EGit master and make it more widely available?
