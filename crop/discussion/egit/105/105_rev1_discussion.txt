DESCRIPTION

Show the diff to previous version in history view

The content is filtered by the same filter as the list of files in the
CommitFileDiffViewer (the table on the lower right of the view).

The diff is only shown for the case of one parent, i.e. merge commits
are still omitted.

Patch Set 1: No score; IP review completed

This change depends on jgit branch cq-diff. 

Pushing this change to Gerrit to ease review.

I tested Stefan's patch successfully (see bug) but I am 
not sure if it is ok to not show any diff for the first 
commit in a repository (gitk behaves in the same way). 
To me this looks inconsistent.
