DESCRIPTION

RepositoriesViewLabelProvider: mark dirty submodules

Prepend the dirty indicator "> " to the text label if the submodule
has changes.

Requires that the RepositoryCache ensures that all repositories are
registered under their normalized git directory file name (normalized
meaning not containing . or .. components). The
RepositoriesViewContentProvider uses a SubmoduleWalk, and that returns
non-normalized paths, while the RepositoryMappings always use normalized
ones. That results in two different repository instances for the same
git repository; listening for index diff changes on one won't trigger on
the other one, and thus labels in the repositories view wouldn't update.

Line:97, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitLabels.java -> for dirty decorator in package explorer the text decoration can be configured in Preference > Team > Git > Label Decorations > Text Decorations, maybe the repository/submodule level dirty decorator should then also be configurable ?

Line:669, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryUtil.java -> changes

Line:375, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewLabelProvider.java -> should the text decoration be configurable ?

Line:97, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/GitLabels.java -> I had noticed that, too. But it wasn't configurable before, and it isn't configurable now. Making it configurable is a separate issue.

It's a bit of work. I have not found a way to configure the dirty decorator separately. What can be configured is a whole format for various kinds of nodes visible in different viewers, and as part of such a format I can say {dirty:+} to override the default '>'. So one would need either to make the default for these variables be configurable separately, or add a new label format for repo nodes in the repositories view.

I suggest we open a bug for this and handle it separately.

Line:669, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryUtil.java -> Done

Line:375, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewLabelProvider.java -> Yes, but IMO that's a separate issue.
