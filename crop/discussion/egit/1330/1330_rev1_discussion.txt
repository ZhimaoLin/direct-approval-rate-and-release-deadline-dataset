DESCRIPTION

Pass WorkingTreeOptions to JGit's iterators

JGit recently learned to pass a WorkingTreeOptions to its iterators
to control how CRLF conversion should be performed when computing
the ObjectId for a file entry.  Pass the default instance for now
just to fix the compile errors, but we should come back and change
these to honor the underlying Git repository's configuration.
