DESCRIPTION

Extract public class RepositoryCache from GitProjectData

GitProjectData contains a cache for Repository instances.
This cache is used for Reposiotry instances related to
projects. Since there are also Repository instances with no
related project (e.g. in RepositoriesView) the cache was moved
to a public class RepositoryCache to enable sharing Repository
instances even if there is no related project.

Great idea. However, we should get rid of static methods. Instead, the cache class should be obtained from the plug-in activator and only have non-static methods and members.
The constructor should be hidden, for example by putting the
class into the org.eclipse.egit.ui package and making the
constructor package-private.
