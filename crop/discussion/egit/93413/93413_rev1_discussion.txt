Line:3879, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> That might hide a bug. A Job _always_ must return an IStatus, so we should never have null here. Besides, we don't really know whether commitJob or commitJob.getResult() was null -- both would be equally puzzling.

We should know what's in the Eclipse log of the user's Eclipse who sent this AERI report. I suspect there was an earlier exception somewhere.

It might be safer not to use commitJob.getResult() but event.getResult() instead. commitJob then also doesn't need to be final.
