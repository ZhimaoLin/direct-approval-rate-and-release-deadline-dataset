DESCRIPTION

Fix dragStart selection checking in staging view

The selection was queried from the wrong view. When dragging from the
unstaged changes view, the selection should be queried from the unstaged
changes view. The staged changes view had the same problem.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Discovered the same fix this evening!  I also have WIP changes that correctly stage and unstage in all cases.
