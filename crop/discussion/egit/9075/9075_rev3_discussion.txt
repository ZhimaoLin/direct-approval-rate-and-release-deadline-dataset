Is there any chance for a unit test for this? It would extremely helpful for an ignorant like me to understand what the change is about ;)

Patch Set 3:

I think that unit test won't tell you anything, notice that is just simple delegation:
* PushOperation -> PushOperationUI
* PushOperationUI -> PushCommand

But what that change is actually about:
JGit class PushCommand provide to specify 'git receive-pack' parameter [1].
Both EGit classes (that are wrappers for PushCommand): PushOperation and PushOperationUI hides this "feature".
In order to push changes to gerrit and set list of initial reviewers you have to use 'git receive-pack' [2].

Is my explanation somehow helpful ?

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> According to org.eclipse.jgit.api.PushCommand.setReceivePack(String) this can be null and used only when explicitly set.

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> It's definitely not going to make it for 2.2. Bump to 2.3.

Line:223, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> Unrelated change.

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> I just add this line to get rid of Eclipse warning. Will be fixed.

Line:223, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> I'm using Eclipse's build in formater (due to [1]) which is responsibile for this change. It means that whether I am doing it wrong or this file has been wrong formatted earlier.

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> You are right. My investigation how this parameter is handled was to shallow.
