See my inline comments. Also, please rebase the change, I noticed PushOperation has been modified in master.

Line:172, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushOperationUI.java -> You check for null here, but don't do it in PushOperation. Is null a valid parameter?

Line:56, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> Typo.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> I don't see any other refs to git man in EGit. Maybe a link to JGit would be enough.

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> I would not document  a private field in the first place. Save the effort for public getters and setters.

Line:111, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> Same as above.

Line:212, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> receivePack can be null here, is that ok?

Line:172, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushOperationUI.java -> I forgot about this. I've create this if-statement because I didn't know that null can be set to PushCommand.
It will be fixed. Null value is valid here.

Line:56, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> I definitely need to check whether "e" key is working properly on my keyboard :D

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> Do you mean link to JGit's documentation or some JGit's class/Javadoc ?

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> Ok.

Line:212, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> Due to my recent (deep) code incestigation - yes, it can.
Here is invocation chain for this option:
PushOperation -> PushCommand -> org.eclipse.jgit.transport.Transport (only if not null)

Default value of optionReceivePack in Transport is RemoteConfig.DEFAULT_RECEIVE_PACK.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PushOperation.java -> JGit contains quite a number of references to git man pages, so I think it's ok.
