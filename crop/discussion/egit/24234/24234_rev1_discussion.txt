DESCRIPTION

Unregister RebaseInteractiveView from plan on view disposal

The view registers as a RebaseInteractivePlanChangeListener with the
plan, but it never unregistered. After closing the view on a running
interactive rebase and reopening it, it would notify the already
disposed old view, too. This resulted in a "Widget disposed" exception,
e.g. when using the buttons to move commits up or down in the rebase
view.

Also unregisters when another plan is shown.

Patch Set 1:

shouldn't the listener also be unregistered if the rebase is aborted ?

Patch Set 1:

Aborting the rebase calls finishRebaseInteractive() in the anonymous JobChangeAdapter class in AbstractRebaseCommandHandler.startRebaseJob(..). This code disposes the plan, which among other things clears its listener list.
