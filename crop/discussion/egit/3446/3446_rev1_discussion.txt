- nice that we get automation for this
- does this also handle pack200 packing ?
- is there a way to test this locally ?
- should we always sign all our builds when build was successful ? This would remove the need to flip parameters and would avoid nasty "unsigned" warning for all users of nightlies

Line:86, org.eclipse.egit-updatesite/pom.xml -> plugin version shouldn't be specified here but in pluginManagement section in parent pom

with some additional properties we could parametrize this in a way so that this configuration could go into a common shared eclipse-tycho-parent pom so that projects using that would just have to use that parent and define some properties to configure it.

Line:144, org.eclipse.egit-updatesite/pom.xml -> this path should be injected by a property (which could default to nightly path) so that we can use it for both nightly and release builds without changing the pom.xml

Line:149, org.eclipse.egit-updatesite/pom.xml -> should be replaced by same property as above
