Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> yes, the egit target platform shouldn't include dependencies of the github connector, but the other way round, so instead extend egit-github's target platform definition, unfortunately I don't know a way how a target platform could include another one so the only way to achieve that seems to be copy&paste which is tedious and error prone :-(

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We could try to use Tycho's 0.17.0 support for multiple targets in target-platform-configuration, I264b8526912181c8f249b03455454e2f90ab932d.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Tycho 0.17 isn't yet released, also this doesn't help for PDE, other than that this looks promising
