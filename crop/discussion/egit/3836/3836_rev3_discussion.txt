DESCRIPTION

Fix wrong destination ref proposal in PushWizard

When the user entered "tags/myTag" into the source field the PushWizard
proposed "tags/myTag" in the destination field. This is then expanded to
"refs/tags/tags/myTag" by JGit. The analogous behavior was there if the
user entered heads/myBranch.

This commit fixes the bug; now only the name after "tags/" resp.
"heads/" is proposed in the destination field.
