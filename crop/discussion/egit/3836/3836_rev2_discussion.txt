DESCRIPTION

Fix wrong destination ref proposal in PushWizard

When the user entered "tags/myTag" into the source field the PushWizard
proposed "tags/myTag" in the destination field. This is then expanded to
"refs/tags/tags/myTag" by JGit. The analogous behavior was there if the
user entered heads/myBranch.

This commit fixes the bug; now only the name after "tags/" resp.
"heads/" is proposed in the destination field.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(3 inline comments)

Looks good to me, only some minor things in formatting that I would do differently (see inline comments). Please feel free to ignore them.

Line:1386, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefSpecPanel.java -> [optional] This variable is actually not really needed.

Line:1388, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefSpecPanel.java -> [optional] this could be: 
 ref.startsWith(prefix)

Line:1390, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefSpecPanel.java -> [optional] this could be:
 return ref.substring(prefix.length());
