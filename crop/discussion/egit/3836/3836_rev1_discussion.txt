DESCRIPTION

Fix wrong destination ref proposal in PushWizard

When the user entered "tags/myTag" into the source field the PushWizard
proposed "tags/myTag" in the destination field. This is then expanded to
"refs/tags/tags/myTag" by JGit. The analogous behavior was there if the
user entered heads/myBranch.

This commit fixes the bug; now the only the name after "tags/" resp.
"heads/" is proposed in the destination field.

some minor issues

Line:1386, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefSpecPanel.java -> [optional] my preference would be to inline this

Line:1400, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefSpecPanel.java -> Both the methods 'deleteTagPrefix(String newDst)' and 'deleteHeadsPrefix(String newDst)' are very similar. I think it would be better to just have one method for that: 'deletePrefix(String prefix, String newDst)'. Even better would be if this method could remove several prefixes at once: 'deletePrefix(String prefix..., String newDst)'

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/now the only the name/now only the name
