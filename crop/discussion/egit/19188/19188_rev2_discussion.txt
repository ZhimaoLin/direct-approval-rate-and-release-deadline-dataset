DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Store IFile/IContainer for entries

Instead of calculating the resource on each access, calculate them once
and store them in a field. With 4000 unstaged changes in a test
repository, this brought down the time to expand all elements from 3
seconds to 500-800 ms.

Maybe getting the resources could be made faster by not using
findFilesForLocationURI/findContainersForLocationURI, but instead going
through the projects of the repository and using getFile/getFolder and
only falling back to the above in case nothing is found.
