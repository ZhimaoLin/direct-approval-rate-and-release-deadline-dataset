Line:46, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryStatisticsPage.java -> this looks pretty ugly and is hard to read, can we display this in a properly formatted 3 column table instead ?

 Description                   |  Loose          |   Packed                     |
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Number of objects                 345                 345k     (345.123)
 Size of objects                   34,5k               123M (123.541.123)
 Number of storage files           345                   5

Line:69, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryStatisticsPage.java -> I'd like to see better rounding with a consistent number of significant digits. E.g. 345,3 MB is displayed as 345 MB (that's fine) but 3,456MB is displayed as 3MB which is unnecessarily reducing the accuracy, instead this should be displayed as 3,45MB. 

Maybe it would make sense to also show the precise numbers in brackets like what file system explorers typically display.
