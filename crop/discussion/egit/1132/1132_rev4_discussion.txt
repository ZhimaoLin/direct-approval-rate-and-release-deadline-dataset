DESCRIPTION

TeamMenuTests

Add some UI tests for the following Team-> menu actions:

BranchAction
CommitAction
PushAction
FetchAction
MergeAction
TagAction
DisconnectAction
ShareProjectAction

and for the history view

Also added memory settings for extended PermGen to 
both existing launch configurations in order to make
Synchronize tests work and removed redundant third
lauch configuration.

A minor fix on CreateTagDialog was needed to make it
testable.
