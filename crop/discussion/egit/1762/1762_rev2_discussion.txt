DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Refactoring first part

Refactor ResourceList from egit core into HistoryPageInput in egit ui
and move the GitHistoryPageSource into the history package.
Add a Repository parameter to the HistoryPageInput constructor to
simplify Repository handling in case of multi-selection. Also change
GitHistoryPageSource so that it does not set the input anymore.
