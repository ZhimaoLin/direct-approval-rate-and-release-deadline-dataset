DESCRIPTION

Fix ClassCastException in LinkWithSelectionCommand

Use command framework to manage state of the toggle menu item [1].
Reacting to the state of an SWT item in a command handler is a bad idea
since if the command would be ever shown in 2 places (a toolbar and a
menu, for example) the state will get out of sync. 

In addition this patch ensures that the toggle state is persisted across
platform restarts.
