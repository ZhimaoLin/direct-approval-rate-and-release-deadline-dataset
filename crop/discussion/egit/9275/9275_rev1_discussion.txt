Patch Set 1:

tried this with a merge failing due to a checkout conflict situation and found that a TeamException is thrown in MergeOperation line 126 already before your change is reached hence a different error dialog is shown

not sure which type of merge failure you are treating here

Patch Set 1:

I tested with a dirty worktree, which the user should
get some more information about than just "Failed", which
is btw not seen by users so they think it's ok, but then
they don't seen any result of the pull.

Patch Set 1:

I tried a merge of 2 local branches with a dirty worktree on a file modified in these 2 branches and started the merge from the history view. In this case I don't reach your new error handling since MergeOperation already throws a TeamException on line 126 providing only a generic error message not showing the root cause of the failure. So it seems your patch doesn't cover this case. 

Which exact use case did you test ?

I did a pull. Could that be different?

Patch Set 1:

I tried and found it's different: 
- when hitting checkout conflict during pull your new error dialog comes up providing the details
- when hitting checkout conflict during merge the other error dialog I mentioned earlier is shown which doesn't explain the root cause of the merge failure

Patch Set 1:

It's not a "new" dialog. I just modified the existing one. I think it's the same you get from merge when there are no conflicts.

Patch Set 1:

Seems either Pull or Merge should change here with respect to the dialogs.

Patch Set 1:

Pushed a new change to the merge operation to treat failed
conflicts in a more sane way.

Maybe we should offer the merge tool, like rebase does too, but that's another issue.
