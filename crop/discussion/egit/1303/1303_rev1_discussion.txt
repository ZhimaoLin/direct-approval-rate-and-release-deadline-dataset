DESCRIPTION

Use DiffEntry inside FileDiff

Make use of the jgit class DiffEntry  to calculate diff properties from
a tree walk and to format the diff.

Unfortunately the DiffFormatter cannot yet be used for the eclipse
patch. The eclipse patch format does not show any source or 
destination prefix,  and the paths are calculated relative to the eclipse
project.
