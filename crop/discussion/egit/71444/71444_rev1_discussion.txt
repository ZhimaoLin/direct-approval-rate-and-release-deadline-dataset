Wow, that was a cool bug :-)

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/ShowHistoryActionHandler.java -> Shouldn't we check first if there are resources at all and do return in case there is nothing?

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/ShowHistoryActionHandler.java -> We do check above that all selected resources map to a single repo. If there were no resources at all, we'd never get here.

Patch Set 1:

Test failures are due to https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/SWTBot_Workarounds#Tree_Item_Expansion_Failure . expand() is asynchronous! I'll fix that in all our tests in a later change (unless somebody else gets to it first).

Nope, it wasn't. In fact,it failed gruesomely. Display already in use, later GTK: "no more handles", buildreported in the log as FAILED multiple times, yet at the end it's marked as SUCCESS.

Plonk. Hudson can't be trusted. I only noticed it because the build was suspiciously fast.
