DESCRIPTION

[Importer] More direct re-use of EasymportWizard

This changes reuses the EasymportWizard and its operations
instead of re-using finer-grained operations and classes that
may change in the future.
With this change, all changes in the EasymportWizard will be
cascaded to EasymportGitWizard without any integration, reducing
maintenance effort and ensuring a better consistency.

- looks good except change in manifest
- we are using 0.1.0 from http://download.eclipse.org/e4/snapshots/org.eclipse.e4.ui, is that still the version to go ?

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> in order to keep testing effort managable we don't support combinations of jgit and egit which don't have the same minor version

hence don't relax this constraint

Yes, it's still 0.1.0, this change doesn't use any new API.
About relaxing the constraint, here is mine ;) We do want to include this change in JBoss Tools 4.3.0, which is to be released within a few weeks, against Eclipse Mars. What would be a way to push the change upstream in EGit (instead of having a dedicated plugin in our code base) and be able to consume it in Eclipse Mars/JBoss Tools 4.3.0 ?

ok, this is a valid reason, I am ok to accept this to allow your use case.

The other option would be you push this change for stable-4.0 and you
consume 4.0.2 which I will tag somewhen this week.

Thanks for understanding the reason.
I'm not against fixing it on stable instead. If you prefer that, I can arrange that patch.

then I'd prefer you push this patch to stable-4.0, I will merge this branch to master before tagging 4.1
