DESCRIPTION

Update index diff cache after replace with head in staging view

The IndexDiffCache relies on IResourceChangeEvents to update itself
on unstaged changes. However, when "Replace With HEAD" is invoked in
the staging view on an unstaged file that doesn't belong to an open
project, there are no IResourceChangeEvents, and since the file is
unstaged, there is no IndexChangeEvent either. So we need to trigger
one explicitly.

Moved two methods that were used only inside ReplaceAction into that
inner class, added computation of files not accessible through the
workspace, and trigger an explicit IndexDiffCache update for those.

What's up with the tests? Build failure is due to the same issue as in bug 476011: repository finder looks in the wrong directory.
