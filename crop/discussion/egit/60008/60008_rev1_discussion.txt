DESCRIPTION

Update index diff cache after replace with head in staging view

The IndexDiffCache relies on IResourceChangeEvents to update itself
on unstaged changes. However, when "Replace With HEAD" is invoked in
the staging view on an unstaged file that doesn't belong to an open
project, there are no IResourceChangeEvents, and since the file is
unstaged, there is no IndexChangeEvent either. So we need to trigger
one explicitly.

(1 comment)

Line:2174, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> A completely different question is why this StagingView re-implements its own variant of DiscardChangesAction instead of using that. But I don't want to change that now.
