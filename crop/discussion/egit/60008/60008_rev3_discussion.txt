DESCRIPTION

Update index diff cache after replace with head in staging view

The IndexDiffCache relies on IResourceChangeEvents to update itself
on unstaged changes. However, when "Replace With HEAD" is invoked in
the staging view on an unstaged file that doesn't belong to an open
project, there are no IResourceChangeEvents, and since the file is
unstaged, there is no IndexChangeEvent either. So we need to trigger
one explicitly.

I also wonder if we can avoid calling refresh if we know that all resources are from the projects...

Line:2164, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> replaceWith() currently doesn't report if it did something at all. We should make it "return boolean" and do only something if it returns OK.

Better, the entire code would go there after checkoutCommand.call();
