Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewContentProvider.java -> I would prefer having an input class over having an array with different object types inside it with both the view and the content provider having to know which indices are which.

Then you can have:

if (newInput instanceof StagingViewInput) {

StagingViewInput sInput = (StagingViewInput)newInput;

Repository repository = sInput.getRepository();

...

}
