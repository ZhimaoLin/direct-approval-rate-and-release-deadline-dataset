Patch Set 1:

It is strictly impossibly that this change causes these test failures. So they must come from somewhere else. The culprit is our using SWTbot snapshot. It was rebuilt today, and includes https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/87761/ which changes tree item selection.

The CommandEnablementTest fails reproducibly also locally with SWTBot Snapshot 2.6.0.201704211332. It succeeds if run with 2.5.0.201609021837.
