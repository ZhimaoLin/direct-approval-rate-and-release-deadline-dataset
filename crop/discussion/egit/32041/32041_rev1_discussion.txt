DESCRIPTION

Tags containing numbers are sorted in natural order. 
In such an order the tag "v1.2" is before the tag "v1.12" instead of the
other way round as with ASCII order.

+1 for the change in behavior.

That said, we already have a natural String comparator, see CommonUtils (a bit of a bad class name).

But it would be good to compare the two and see if there's an improvement that we can take from yours. From looking at it your version looks more efficient. This is a good micro-benchmark tool if you want to compare: https://code.google.com/p/caliper/
