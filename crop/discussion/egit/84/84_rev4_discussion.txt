DESCRIPTION

ConnectProviderOperation uses git repositories selected by user

ConnectProviderOperation tried to connect only projects provided
by getProjects() method in ExistingOrNewPage. This method returned
only a list of projects, and the mapping between the project and
its git repository directory is never used and lost.

ConnectProviderOperation tried to find repository itself using
RepositoryFinder's method find(IProgressMonitor).  The logic of this
method was fixed and it returns more then one RepositoryMapping
for a project nested into other git repository. But this isn't
expected by ConnectProviderOperation and it wouldn't even try to
connect such project.

Now:

- method getProjects() in ExistingOrNewPage now returns a pairing,
  Map<IProject, File> instead of IProject[]. It provides information
  about git repositories which has been selected by user for each
  project. If a git repository path is absolute (it was just created)
  it will make it relative to the project's root.

- ConnectProviderOperation uses Map<IProject, File> instead of
  IProject[] and will connect project to git repository only if
  it has been founded in repository mappings provided by method
  find(IProgressMonitor) for a given project.

- default value '../.git' provided for just introduced field
  GitProjectsImportPage.ProjectRecord.repository

- path to a test repository in unit tests

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

I agree with Mykola, we should fix this now with this patch, and work with the other issues in a different bug, and a different change.  Basically this whole share wizard stuff has a horrible UI and is broken in a bunch of ways.  But this change is at least a step in the right direction by trying to keep track of the project<->repository mapping data.
