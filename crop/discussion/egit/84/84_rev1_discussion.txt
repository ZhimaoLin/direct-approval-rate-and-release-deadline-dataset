DESCRIPTION

ConnectProviderOperation uses git repositories which has been selected by
user

ConnectProviderOperation tries to connect only projects provided by
getProjects() method in ExistingOrNewPage. This method returns a list of
projects. But a mapping between project and git repository directory is
never used and lost.

Then it tries to find repository by himself using RepositoryFinder's
method find(IProgressMonitor). Logic of this method was fixed and it
returns more then one RepositoryMapping for a project nested into other
git repository. But this isn't expected by ConnectProviderOperation and
it wouldn't even try to connect such project.

Now it's fixed:
- method getProjects() in ExistingOrNewPage returns Map<IProject, File>
  instead of IProject[]. It provides information about git repositories
  which has been selected by user for each project. If a git repository
  path is absolute (it was just created) it will make it relative to the
  project's root.
- ConnectProviderOperation uses Map<IProject, File> instead of IProject[]
  and will connect project to git repository only if it has been founded
  in repository mappings provided by method find(IProgressMonitor) for a
  given project.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This is still 'work in progress' and was made available for review to figure out the right way in which this issue may be fixed (use Map<IProject, File> instead of IProject[] in ExistingOrNewPage and ConnectProviderOperation).
