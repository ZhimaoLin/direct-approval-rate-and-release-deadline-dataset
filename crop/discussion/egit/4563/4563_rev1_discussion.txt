Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Found two minor style issues. I'll fix them and push new change set

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/command/AbstractReflogCommandHandler.java -> personally I would prefer to have an empty line between class definition and first member/method

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/command/AbstractReflogCommandHandler.java -> style-nit: remove curly brackets around single line block
