DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Performance regression fix: don't apply styles on mouse
hover

Bug 427811 describes performance degradation due the by permanent text
widget style recomputation while hovering with the mouse over the diff
area in the history view. This widget style recalculation is not needed
because each time style ranges are recomputed, they are also applied to
the widget in addDoneListenerToFormatJob().

This commit simply removes unneeded setStyle() calls from mouse hover
listener and also private styleRanges field used to keep styles.

Matthias, in my patch I've additionally removed the unneeded field, so the patch can/should be be merged to keep the code clean... but how I can push this again to gerrit after merging with latest head? Selecting the commit and "push commit" in history view doesn't work (forbidden). Or can you re-merge it?
