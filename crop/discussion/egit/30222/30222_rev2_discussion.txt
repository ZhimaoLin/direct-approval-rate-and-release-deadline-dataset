DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Performance regression fix: don't apply styles on mouse
hover

Bug 427811 describes performance degradation due the by permanent text
widget style recomputation while hovering with the mouse over the diff
area in the history view. This widget style recalculation is not needed
because each time style ranges are recomputed, they are also applied to
the widget in addDoneListenerToFormatJob().

This commit simply removes unneeded setStyle() calls from mouse hover
listener and also private styleRanges field used to keep styles.

Ignore my last comment, I've used "Push to gerrit" from repository view. For some reason this works in opposite to the history view.

The commit message needs to be adjusted, it no longer matches what the change does.
