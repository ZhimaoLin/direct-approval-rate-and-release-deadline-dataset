DESCRIPTION

bug 347073 - clarify difference btw. remove and delete repository

The context menu of the repository view has the menu items "Remove
Repository" and "Delete Repository". "Remove Repository" removes a
repository from the repository view whereas "Delete Repository" deletes
a local [clone of a] repository from disk.

The difference btw. these two is not obvious enough. It was suggested to
adda tooltip to the context menu items but this appears not to be
technically possible. 

The patch proposes to rename the context menu item "Remove Repository"
to "Remove Repository from View".

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Don't put the bug id in the header instead add a footer in the last paragraph as a separate line:

Bug: 347073

this will ensure that gerrit renders a link

Also start the commit message header with an uppercase letter

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is obvious from the diff so you don't need to mention this again in the commit message.

This is a lot of text to read for a small improvement, I think the commit message header is sufficient to explain the intention of this change.
