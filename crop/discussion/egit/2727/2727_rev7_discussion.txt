DESCRIPTION

Implement project rename and move for some cases

We can now move and rename projects within a repository for a number
of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
Eclipse actually destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 307140). Since it is resolved in 3.7, check the version
number and only forbid this case for platforms e earlier than 3.7.

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent so the current behavior may not be the final
behavior.

We cannot move projects with repositories inside them in this
version and so we forbid it. Disconnect and share manually
to accomplish this.
