DESCRIPTION

Implement project rename and move for some cases

We can now move and rename projects within a repository for a number
of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
Eclipse actually destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 339814).

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent so the current behavior may not be the final
behavior.

We cannot move projects with repositories inside them in this
version and so we forbid it. Disconnect and share manually
to accomplish this.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

I tried this with a clone of jgit repo and when moving one of the projects one level down, e.g. org.eclipse.jgit to x/org.eclipse.jgit
this seems to work at first glance, but when committing this change only the additions for the new location will be committed, but the removal of the old resources is missing. Looks like these removals have to be staged in the move delete hook.

Line:69, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> what's the reason for this commented out code ?

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> I think we should add a TODO here

Line:278, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> typo: s|YEY</em<|YET </em>|

Line:239, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHook.java -> can we remove this commented-out code ?

Patch Set 4:

The problem lies in the commit dialog that only sees changes within projects and therefore not removed files in the old location of the projects. The move/delete hook updates the
index as it should, but the commit dialog does not follow
the standard Git process for committing. That has to be
addressed separately.
