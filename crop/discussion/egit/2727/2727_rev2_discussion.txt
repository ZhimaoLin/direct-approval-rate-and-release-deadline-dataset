DESCRIPTION

Implement project rename and move for some cases

We can now move and renme projects within a repository for a number
of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
Eclipse actauly destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 339814).

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent so the current behavior may not be the final behavior.

We cannot move projects with repositories inside them in this version and
so we forbid it. Disconnect and share manually to accomplish this.

didn't expect that project handling in Eclipse looks that messy, kudos for trying to work around that mess

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> missing license header

Line:161, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> is that correct behavior ?

Line:170, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHook.java -> do we need these pure formatting changes ?

Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHook.java -> style nit: this line looks a bit wide ...

Line:266, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHook.java -> pure formatting change

I didn't expect that either. I cannot really see why I should have to go guessing where projects are located, rather than just use such a convenient looking method like getLocationURI. Maybe I'm missing some nice utility method.

Line:161, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> This just documents the behavior. I actually think its wrong, hence my comment. Otoh that is probably best taken care of as a follow-up patch.

Line:192, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHook.java -> source already is a project, thus calling getProject() is not necessary

Line:202, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHook.java -> formatting: move bracket to new line

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> spelling: rename

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> spelling: actually

Line:161, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitMoveDeleteHookTest.java -> yeah, this makes sense
