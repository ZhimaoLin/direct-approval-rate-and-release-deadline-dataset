DESCRIPTION

Implement project rename and move for some cases and add tests

We can now move and rename projects within a repository for a number
of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
Eclipse actually destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 307140). The bug is only worked around in Eclipse 3.7,
i.e. forbidden in the UI.

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent with respect to how we handle the index, i.e.
sometime we update the index to reflect the change and sometimes we do
not, so the current behavior may not be the final behavior.

This version of the patch does not try to evade bug 307140
