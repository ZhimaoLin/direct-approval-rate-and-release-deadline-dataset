DESCRIPTION

Implement project rename and move for some cases

We can now move and renme projects within a repository for a number
of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
Eclipse actauly destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 339814).

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent so the current behavior may not be the final behavior.

We cannot move projects with repositories inside them in this version and
so we forbid it. Disconnect and share manually to accomplish this.
