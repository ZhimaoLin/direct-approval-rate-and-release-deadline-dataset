Patch Set 2:

Seems like our UI tests are even more unstable with icewm than with metacity. In build 9194, I'm missing the line "IceWM: using /home/hudson/genie.egit/.icewm for private configuration files" at the beginning: looks like it was started only halfway (didn't fail with "no handles", but then things went awry in the tests).

It also appears that there are disk-related problems, and I still do wonder if that has something to do with the super-full disk the genie reports every week on the cross-project-issues-dev mailing list and that everybody seems to ignore:

-> Usage exceeding 1GB for: /shared (1000G capacity) (2016-10-12T10:00)
1597.3G hipp

I still don't understand this. 1T capacity, but we're at 1.5T? (Tendency rising. Used to be much lower a year ago.)
