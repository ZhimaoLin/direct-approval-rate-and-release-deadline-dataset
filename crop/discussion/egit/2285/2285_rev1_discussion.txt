DESCRIPTION

Speed up the CommitDialog for large file sets

Use hash sets instead of lists and tell SWT to index the file table
in the commit dialog. With this 100k changes files can be handled
comfortably. What happens after you press the commit button still
needs work to match this performance boost.
