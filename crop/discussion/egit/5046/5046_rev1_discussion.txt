Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

See my inline comments, I will need to have a closer look at the paths adjustment logic.

Line:317, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CreatePatchOperation.java -> I don't think we actually need to compile all the patterns in front

Line:322, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CreatePatchOperation.java -> The patterns won't work for additions and deletions ie /dev/null !
