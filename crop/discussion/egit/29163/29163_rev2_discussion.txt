DESCRIPTION

Add "Stashes" menu to Team context menu and toolbar

Provides a way to stash changes as well as viewing the existing stashes.

The toolbar icon is for stashing changes (when clicking on the icon),
and shows the menu with the existing stashes when using the pull down.

The existing menu item in the repo view was also replaced by this
submenu.

Looks like this when there are no stashes yet:

* Stashes
  * Stash Changes...
  * -
  * (no stashed changes)

And like this with stashes:

* Stashes
  * Stash Changes...
  * -
  * 0: work on foo
  * 1: try fixing bar

Patch Set 2:

Fixed. The problem with the editor was that I only looked at IStructuredSelection. Now I reuse the logic from RepositoryActionHandler to also handle text selections. See also new parent change.
