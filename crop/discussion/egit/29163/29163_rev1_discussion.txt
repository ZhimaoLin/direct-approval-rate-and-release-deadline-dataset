DESCRIPTION

Add "Stashes" menu to Team context menu and toolbar

Provides a way to stash changes as well as viewing the existing stashes.

The toolbar icon is for stashing changes (when clicking on the icon),
and shows the menu with the existing stashes when using the pull down.

The existing menu item in the repo view was also replaced by this
submenu.

Looks like this when there are no stashes yet:

* Stashes
  * Stash Changes...
  * -
  * (no stashed changes)

And like this with stashes:

* Stashes
  * Stash Changes...
  * -
  * 0: work on foo
  * 1: try fixing bar

- I like this change, abandoned my simple patch in favor of this one
- "Stash Changes..." should be disabled if the working tree is clean
- modify a file and save that, click the stash changes button in the toolbar, click again in the editor open for the same file, then open the stash drop down in the toolbar -> list of stashes is empty. When clicking any resource in the project the drop down gets populated again
