DESCRIPTION

Don't show actions that don't apply to read-only mode

Quick assist, redo, undo, cut, and paste were being shown
in the context menu even though they are not applicable when
the message are is not editable.

This would cause handler conflicts to be logged when multiple
commit editors were opened.
