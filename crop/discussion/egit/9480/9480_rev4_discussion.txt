DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable GitRepositoriesViewTest.testImportWizardGeneralProject

It recently failed here:

https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/egit.gerrit/3925/

It's probably better to delete the .project after the project has been
removed from Eclipse, not before.

Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

I noticed messages like this when executing sync view UI tests:

!MESSAGE The project description file (.project) for 'ProjectWithoutDotProject' was missing.  This file contains important information about the project.  A new project description file has been created, but some information about the project may have been lost.

With this change, these messages are gone. Submitted change as it is probably good.
