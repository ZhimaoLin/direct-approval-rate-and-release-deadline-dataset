DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable GitRepositoriesViewTest.testImportWizardGeneralProject

It recently failed here:

https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/egit.gerrit/3925/

It's probably better to delete the .project after the project has been
removed from Eclipse, not before.

Patch Set 3:

Snjezana gave the hint [1] that the problem might be caused by jobs running concurrently with the tests and pointed out a solution they use for jboss tooling. Instead of their solution (reuse would require a CQ and is based on polling) we could try to delete test projects using a job with a workspace lock to ensure that no other jobs are running. I'll discuss this idea with Jens who is an expert in Eclipse job framework.

Hm, ok. But deleting the .project after removing the project from Eclipse (instead of before) should be a good change anyway, no?
