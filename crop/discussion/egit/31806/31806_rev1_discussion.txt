DESCRIPTION

Reverse changesets order in the interactive rebase view

History view sorts changesets by the age in the ascending order, while
rebase view sorts in the descending order. Now rebase view orders
changesets in the ascending order too.

Normally we read top-down. Git also used top-down in the rebase editor. We're used to that. We're not used to tortoise.

The reason the history is shown in reverse is that you are usually interested in the newest changes.

I also prefer it the way it is without this change: history sorts in ascending age (youngest first) and rebase-interactive planning sorts descending age (oldest first). Thats also how native git works. Inspect "git log" versus "git rebase --interactive HEAD~3".

Patch Set 1:

"Growing up" with EGit and the History view, both a colleague of mine and I would find it easier if the rebase plan was presented in the same order as the history.

Maybe we should have a preference in the view menu of the Rebase Interactive view to accomodate for both mental models.
