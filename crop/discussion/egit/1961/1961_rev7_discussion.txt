DESCRIPTION

Implementation of basic authentification with user and password.

secure store. A credentials provider was implemented that fetches
credentials from the secure store and asks the user if credentials are
not available.

Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, approved

- rebased to current master

I think this change is ready for submission.

Since Edwin substantially participated in this change and he is not a committer I think we need PMC approval according to figure 2 of the Eclipse legal process poster.

@ Chris | Gunnar: could you PMC approve this change and set the IP Clean flag ?

Patch Set 7:

Jens is already a committer so there is no need for a PMC IP approval. Or is it because of Akira Shields?

Patch Set 7: IP review completed

Ok, so maybe the 'IP Clean' is mis-leading. What is really necessary here is a 'Under Supervision of the PMC'. So yes, the code is in line with the project goals. :)

Patch Set 7:

FWIW, http://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf  and follow Figure 1 (page 1).

Patch Set 7:

I asked for PMC supervision since I was not sure if figure 2 would apply for changes created by a committer pair-programming with a non-committer (therefore Edwin is also mentioned in the copyright statements). And this change is well beyond 250 LOC.

Patch Set 7:

Ok, thanks for clarifying. So in the case of pair-programming I think it's a mixture of figure 1 and figure 2. Both take the same path so they can be assumed similar. The 250 lines of code limitation doesn't apply in this path.
