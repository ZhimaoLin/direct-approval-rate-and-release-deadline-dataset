DESCRIPTION

Implement basic authentification

Implementation of basic authentification with user and password.
User and password entered in the clone wizard are put in the Eclipse
secure store. A credentials provider was implemented that fetches
credentials from the secure store and asks the user if credentials are
not available.

Patch Set 5:

- rebased to current master
- fixed minor style nits and fixed formatting according to project rules

LGTM

I wonder if we should flush the secure store when the credentials have been put in order to prevent loss of credentials in case Eclipse crashes later.
