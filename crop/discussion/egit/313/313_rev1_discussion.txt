Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Two patches, please. One to fix the bug and the other to use the LocalResorceManager, as I think these two are unrelated.

Patch Set 1:

alternatively rephrase the commit message such that it is clear that you fix two things. Sometimes we use the word "also" to indicate other loosely related fixes that may be hard to separate after the fact.
