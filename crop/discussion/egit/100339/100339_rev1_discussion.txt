DESCRIPTION

FetchGerritChangePage: auto-supply highest patch set number

If the change field contains only a change number but no patch set
number, automatically fill in the highest patch set number obtained
from Gerrit once we have the results of the ls-remote. If the field
is the focus control and its contents have changed since we started
the content assist, the user might be typing: don't interfere and do
not auto-update the field.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

try the following using a jgit clone:
* copy a change URL to the clipboard e.g. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/99874/
* click "Fetch from Gerrit"
* wait until highest patch set number is auto-supplied
* now try to edit the patch set number in the change edit field by hitting the delete key and try to enter 2
* the highest patch set number is supplied again so the edit is lost

when playing with this change I discovered that it seems we lost a feature in this wizard: AFAIR the popup shown when the change field is populated with a patch set used to show the commit message of the selected patch set but currently it's always empty so this popup is pretty useless

Hmmm. Will have a look.

You mean the popup on the content assist dropdown? That always has said only "Patch set X of change Y". ("Always" meaning "for as long as I can remember" :-) ) We do not have the commit message. The dialog does a ls-remote; that doesn't return the commits. If we wanted to get more info, we would need to use an ssh or http REST endpoint to get info about open changes.
