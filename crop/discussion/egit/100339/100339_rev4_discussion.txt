DESCRIPTION

FetchGerritChangePage: auto-supply highest patch set number

If the change field contains only a change number but no patch set
number, automatically fill in the highest patch set number obtained
from Gerrit once we have the results of the ls-remote. If the field
is the focus control and its contents have changed since we started
the content assist, the user might be typing: don't interfere and do
not auto-update the field.
