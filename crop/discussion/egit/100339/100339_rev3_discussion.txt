DESCRIPTION

FetchGerritChangePage: auto-supply highest patch set number

If the change field contains only a change number but no patch set
number, automatically fill in the highest patch set number obtained
from Gerrit once we have the results of the ls-remote. If the field
is the focus control and its contents have changed since we started
the content assist, the user might be typing: don't interfere and do
not auto-update the field.

Line:828, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> This fixes the issue with the number being auto-supplied continually when the user edited the text while the content proposals were active. The first call to getRefsForContentAssist() occurs before the popup is open, but once open, the content assist adapter recalculates the proposals whenever the text changes, and in that case we must not auto-supply a possibly missing change number.
