DESCRIPTION

Optimize auto-ignore resource change listener

EGit's resource change listener handling auto-ignoring of derived
resources did fully traverse non-derived changed resources not shared
with the Git team provider. Skip traversing such changed resources in
order to stop wasting time in this listener.
