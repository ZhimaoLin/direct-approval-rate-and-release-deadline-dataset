I doubt if this fixes the bugs concerning .ignore files in unshared projects. Could you please provide a reproducible example?

Line:360, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> It seems reasonable to stop visiting children if the project is not shared.

However, I don't know if this change fixes the bugs. The fact if the project is shared with git is also checked inside the method RepositoryUtil.isIgnored used below.
