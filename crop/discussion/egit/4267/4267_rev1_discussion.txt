DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Place branch decorator before repository path.

Previous pattern:  repo - /home/repos/repo/.git [master]

New pattern:  repo [master] - /home/repos/repo/.git

The current branch and state is more important than the
path and so it should be made more visible in more narrow
layouts by being placed earlier in the label text.
