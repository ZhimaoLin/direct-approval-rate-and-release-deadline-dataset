DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Don't show e-mail addresses in table by default

The information is not that important to be shown directly in the table.
When it is needed, it's one click away in the Revision Details.

Removing the e-mail addresses gives some more space to other columns
like the column containing the graph, refs and message.
