Line:146, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> don't put this into a comment instead split this change into two changes, each one fixing a single bug

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit message header should give a short description of the change, the body should explain why this change is needed. Also see [1].
