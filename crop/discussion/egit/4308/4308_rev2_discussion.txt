DESCRIPTION

Perform project creation within a workspace operation.

Originally, when using a GIT Team Project Set to setup a new workspace
(which would eventually contain many projects) if auto-build was
enabled, Eclipse would start building too early when the workspace is
not yet complete, leading to annoying build errors. Now the execution
within a workspace operation ensures that the build is
not started before all projects are created/imported.
