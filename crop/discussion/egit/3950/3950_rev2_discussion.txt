DESCRIPTION

MultiPullResultDialog: Fix overall status column

It would always say "OK" even when the rebase or merge failed. It now
displays "Failed" when the status is not successful.

Also, the logic for rebase was inverted, leading to the image indicating
failure when the rebase was successful.

Depends on JGit change Icfc9a9c76763f8a777087a1262c8d6ad251a9068 for
isSuccessful.

Patch Set 2:

Gah, sorry about the style issue, the "always use braces" style is just too ingrained for me to notice.

The build seems to not have picked up the new jgit yet.
