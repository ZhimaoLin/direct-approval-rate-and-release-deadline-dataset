DESCRIPTION

Fix CherryPickOperation in case of single commit cherry-picks

In case of cherry-picking on top of a merge commit there was a severe
bug leading to wrong results. This should be fixed by better support for
multi-commit cherry-pick in jgit. This commit introduces a fix which
solves the problem for single-commit cherry-picks (most of the people
only do that) and still supports to do multi-commit cherry-picks on
non-merge heads.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

this doesn't work in case cherry-picking a single commit leads to  conflicts, in this case a checkout conflict is reported which is completely misleading

I think to fix this we should go back and revert the multi-cherry-pick implementation based on rebase since it doesn't behave like a multi-cherry-pick in git-core does. It leads to wrong results in some cases (see bug 447115), behaves different in conflict handling and doesn't record status in the files git-core uses to track multi-cherry-pick.

Patch Set 1:

Yes, I agree. Let's abandon this one and revert the changess which made cherry-pick use rebase.
Afterwards we should implement the multi-commit cherry-pick and jgit level (in cherrypickcommand) and let egit make use of this feature.
