DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Show In support for resources

Also convert other Show In commands (for repository, remote, fetch node,
push node, ref) to the platform Show In support.

To only list "Reflog" when a repository is selected, IShowInTargetList
is used.

To continue to support showing multiple files in the history view, or
files outside of the workspace, we also pass a HistoryPageInput to the
ShowInContext if possible.

Because the view does not use the standard navigator groups for menu
items, the Show In menu now appears at the top.

Patch Set 5:

Changed the context menu to be provided by an action provider. I don't know if changing <triggerPoints> to <enablement> is ok there.

And yes, the Show In now shows up at the top. I'm not sure that's bad, the Package Explorer also shows it in the top part. The right way to fix this would be to add <popupMenu>  and <insertionPoint> to the viewer extension and then separately attach menu contributions to the groups, right?

It looks like the failure in GitRepositoriesViewTest/testShowProperties is caused by the changes.

For the context menu on the repository node it looks a bit ugly when 'Show In' is at the top. I think we should try to put it at the same location as it is now. I guess this can be done the way you mentioned. See also bug 388208.

Otherwise the changes look OK to me.
