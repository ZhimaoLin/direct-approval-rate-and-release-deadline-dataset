DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Show In support for resources

The existing Show In commands for the repository node (History, Reflog,
Properties) are kept as is, as we don't want e.g. the Reflog view to
appear in the Show In menus everywhere.

So this only adds the platform Show In support for the existing
resources in the working dir tree nodes.

To continue to support showing multiple files in the history view, or
files outside of the workspace, we also pass a HistoryPageInput to the
ShowInContext if possible.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

For RepositoriesView node types other than File oder Folder this now shows an entry "Show In > <No Applicable Views>". This should be removed

Patch Set 1:

:(. I tested with 3.7 as target platform, it works there. When switching to 4.2, it doesn't (Show In appears everywhere). See bug for more information and the platform ui bug which is causing this.
