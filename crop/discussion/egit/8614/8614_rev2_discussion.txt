DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add Show In support for resources

The existing Show In commands for the repository node (History, Reflog,
Properties) are kept as is, as we don't want e.g. the Reflog view to
appear in the Show In menus everywhere.

So this only adds the platform Show In support for the existing
resources in the working dir tree nodes.

To continue to support showing multiple files in the history view, or
files outside of the workspace, we also pass a HistoryPageInput to the
ShowInContext if possible.

Also note that due to bug 383815 in platform UI, <visibleWhen> for
<dynamic> is broken in 4.2. To work around this, the new Show In is
defined in a separate <menu> so that <visibleWhen> can be moved there,
so it is evaluated for the menu. This does not result in two Show In
menus as the conditions don't overlap.

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

The correct approach is to get rid of the custom 'Show In' menu at all and use the built-in support, so that we do not get different menus when using the context menu and Navigate > Show In (Alt+Shift+W).

If this can't be fixed via 'plugin.xml' contribution, then we should simply contribute the menu like we do it for all the other views, i.e. in the code.

Patch Set 2:

Hm, ok. I'll experiment with IShowInTargetList to see if we can use that so that the "Git Reflog" entry only appears when the selection is a repository. If that doesn't work the other option would be to just show "Git Reflog" in all Show In menus, but I would prefer the first option.

That will do the trick.
