DESCRIPTION

Delete internal class RIRefresh

Job RIRefresh only works if the workspace preference
General->Workspace->refresh automatically is enabled.
But in this case Eclipse refreshes changed resources 
anyway (RefreshJob triggered by file system change).
The functionally of RIRefresh is redundant.

Not so fast! I admin this code is so ugly, it should probably be deleted for that reason, but there is difference
from what the general refresh does and that is that this code reacts to changes in the index and triggers a refresh earlier than the standard workspace refresh, which the reason Egit reacts quickly when you do something to the repo outside of Eclipse. Without this you have to refresh manually all the time which you (read: I) will forget all the time. It is the RCS job that triggers then index change refresh.

A possible cleanup action would be to kick the standard workspace Job, if possible when the index changes. When I wrote this code it was not accessible.

Hi Robin,

Some comments on this:

1. RCS detects changes in the index. Decorator reacts to these changes (e.g. staged, conflict).

2. RCS also triggers RIRefresh to refresh Eclipse resources.
You mention this happens faster than when it's done by the standard Eclipse mechanism. Is this the right approach?
Shoudn't all external changes to files be handled in the same way (reaction time) regardless wheter the files relate to resources in a Git repository or not?
With the current implementation you have the following effect if Workspace auto refresh is enabled:

  1. change a file in a project shared with Git using Notepad => immediate refresh of the Eclipse resource
  2. change a file in a project NOT shared with Git using Notepad => refresh of the Eclipse resource after some delay.

Patch Set 1:

The first version was independent of the workspace refresh job, but upon request I changed it. If you have automatic refresh you probably want it always be refreshed, but scanning all the time affects performance too much, so Eclipse scans with an interval.

Ideally we should have a separate option for this and it should also interact with or replace the standard job so we don?t have two of them).
