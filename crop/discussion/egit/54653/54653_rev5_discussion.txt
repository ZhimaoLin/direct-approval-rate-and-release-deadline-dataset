DESCRIPTION

Auto-configure Gerrit after ssh clone

ConfigureGerritAfterCloneTask.isGerrit() only worked for HTTP(S)
cloning in general; for ssh cloning it worked only for git.eclipse.org.

Use the same approach as for HTTP also for SSH: invoke Gerrit's
"gerrit version" SSH endpoint and see what we get.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2

the build failure was caused by a reboot of build.eclipse.org taking down the signing service for a while, see https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg12241.html, I will retrigger it in a few minutes
