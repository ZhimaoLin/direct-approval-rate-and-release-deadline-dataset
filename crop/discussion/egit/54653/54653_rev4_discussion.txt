DESCRIPTION

Auto-configure Gerrit after ssh clone

ConfigureGerritAfterCloneTask.isGerrit() only worked for HTTP(S)
cloning in general; for ssh cloning it worked only for git.eclipse.org.

Use the same approach as for HTTP also for SSH: invoke Gerrit's
"gerrit version" SSH endpoint and see what we get.

I was wrong, in Eclipse Web UIs always the registered email address is used as the user name, I granted you permissions to retrigger builds, you should now also be able to manually trigger a build using https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/gerrit_manual_trigger/
