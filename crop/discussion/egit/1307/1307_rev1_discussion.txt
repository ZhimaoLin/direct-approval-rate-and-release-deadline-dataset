DESCRIPTION

Exclude repository node on single repo synchronization

This is a usability improvement. When synchronization is performed on
single repository, the 'repository node' in 'Git Change Set' is omitted.
In case of synchronization multiple repositories at once 'repository
node' will be included for each repository that is synchronized.
