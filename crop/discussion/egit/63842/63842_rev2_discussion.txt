Seems like this other failure isn't related to that change neither. I'm not very lucky today.

Line:272, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> For consistency, use PullWithOptions.name.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Shouldn't the "Pull..." menu entry also be available in the context menu in the Repositories view?

Line:790, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Should have a tooltip.

Line:945, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Shouldn't this be %PullWithOptions? (Or %PullWithOptions.name, see comment in plugin.properties).

Line:1210, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Unless I misread, the PullWizard works only for one repository. So this should be resourcesSingleRepository, and for the RepositoryTreeNode, a similar check would be needed.

Line:3905, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Ditto here: projectsSingleRepository.

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Using the same icon for two different commands (even if they're kin of related) looks very strange in the toolbar if the Git toolbar is enabled.

Line:23, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/PullWithOptionsAction.java -> I get

  !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2016-01-11 20:56:17.129

Also needs a UI test. The build finally succeeded, but when I run this locally (in Mars.1, JDK 8), I get a fatal error logged.

Thanks Thomas. New patch set should fix all the suggested issue, except the icon one for which one I don't have anything better to propose at the moment.

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Do you have another icon to suggest?

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I'm not an icon designer, so I don't know what would work. Maybe the pull icon with a question mark overlay (small, maybe top right corner)? (Question mark as in "this pull operation will ask you questions".)

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> What would you think about trying to overlay a target like http://previews.123rf.com/images/speedfighter/speedfighter1002/speedfighter100200132/6520395-Red-gun-sight-cross-hairs-isolated-on-white-background--Stock-Photo.jpg on the top-right of the Pull icon?

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Ah, isn't bikeshed painting fun :-) !

A gun sight has the connotation of "target". But one actually specifies the source to pull from in the Wizard in the first place.

Note that the image you proposed is not freely licensed.

Maybe the solution is to change the icon for org.eclipse.egit.ui.team.Pull: make it have two clouds (same size, one behind the other, offset by a few pixels) since that operation can pull from several repositories? The downside of this is that we'd change an icon users have become accustomed to already. So if at all possible, I'd prefer to leave existing icons and come up with something new for the new operation.

As I said, I'm not an icon designer. Can we look at other git tools for inspiration? For instance, does TortoiseGit have a "pull with dialog" and a "pull without dialog"? If so, do they use icons and if so, what do they look like? (I don't have Windows, so I can't check myself.)

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I don't have Windows neither. I'll send a note to our team to ask for help.
Do you think this icon is a blocker for merging this patch?

How about UI tests?

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I do think we should have a different icon. Need not be perfect, and maybe we change it later. But if we don't do it now, I fear we never will, since it'll drop below the radar.

I see you already asked Daniel Azarov for help; let's hope he can do something. Otherwise I have cobbled together a pull-with-question-mark 16x16 icon and have attached it to bug 485124 as https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=259123 .

Line:5177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Fine by me. The confusion about the icon is mostly in the toolbar (the actionSet above at line 782ff); in the menus, the different labels differentiate the two operations already. So maybe it's an option to use the new icon only for the actionSet...

Or make that action in the actionSet have a drop-down menu like the rebase action, and not add a new toolbar button at all. That solution might not even need a new icon, just a drop-down menu with two entries "Pull from Upstream" and "Pull..."; a click on the button itself would always execute the "Pull from Upstream" (current behavior), but the user could invoke the "Pull..." via the drop-down.

Either way is fine by me.
