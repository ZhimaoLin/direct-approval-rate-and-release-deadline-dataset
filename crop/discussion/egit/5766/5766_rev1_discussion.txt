DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources.

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, decorators, commands, and operations.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

you pushed this to refs/for/stable-1.3 hence you got a new change, push it again to refs/for/master then it should end up as a new patchset for the original change, then abandon this new change
