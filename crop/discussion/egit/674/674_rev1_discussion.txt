DESCRIPTION

Replace org.apache.log4j package import by bundle dependency

Tycho picks some org.slf4j bundles to satisfy our package dependency
to org.apache.log4j needed to run swtbot tests. This caused a
NoClassDefFoundError due to some additional dependencies slf4j has.
Switching to a bundle dependency fixes this problem.
