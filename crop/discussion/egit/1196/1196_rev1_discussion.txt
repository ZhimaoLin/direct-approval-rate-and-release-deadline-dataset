DESCRIPTION

Remove menu items "Track" and "Refresh"

Now the add command also adds new files to the repository.
Additionally it takes into account .gitignore. Therefore
there is no need anymore of the "Track" and "Refresh"
menu items.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks good... it's nice to clean up our menus. I'm considering moving Untrack and some other menu entries to a Staging view once we have it... this would simplify the menua bit for newcomers.
