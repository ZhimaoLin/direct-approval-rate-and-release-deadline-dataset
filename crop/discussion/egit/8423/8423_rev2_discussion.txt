Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Moved the field into the method so that we only need to check the commitId in there and when actually needed.

Submitting to avoid further test failures and NPEs in the next EGit build.

Patch Set 2:

You were faster :). authorIdent was a field because the Javadoc mentions that computing it is expensive and I don't know how many times getContentIdentifier is called. But it's probably ok.

Patch Set 2:

Regarding the field: my approach is much better because the sync view creates the remote resource objects for all the entries (deep down to the leaf elements), but #getContentIdentifier() is only called when a compare editor gets opened.
