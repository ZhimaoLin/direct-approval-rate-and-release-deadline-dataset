Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This fix doesn't seem right. As soon as someone calls #getContentIdentifier() it will again blow up.

GitRemoteFolder#members(IProgressMonitor) definitely needs some work: calling #getCommitId() in the constructor will always be 'null.

Patch Set 1:

Ok, we also need to guard against commitId being null in getContentIdentifier (was already a problem before). Apparently it is allowed to be null, otherwise this would make no sense:

	boolean exists() {
		return commitId != null;
	}

I'm not following what the problem is with members, it just passes on its own commitId to its children.

OK, makes sense.

Can you attach a new patch set that fixes the other NPE and also adjust the copyright date?
