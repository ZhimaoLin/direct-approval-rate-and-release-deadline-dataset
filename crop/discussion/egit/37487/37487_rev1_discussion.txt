DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Enhance IndexDiffData to support submodules

By enhancing IndexDiffData to support submodules like we did earlier for
symlinks (see ceee3050) we can avoid a SubmoduleWalk otherwise needed to
decorate modified submodules in the staging view. With this submodule
entries in staging view are now also updated incrementally based on
resource change events.
