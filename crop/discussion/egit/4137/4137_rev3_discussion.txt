DESCRIPTION

Start the switch-to menu with recently used branch names first

This assures that you rarely need to use the Other... menu item.
Branch names are still ordered alphabetically. If only a few
recently used branch names exist, more entries are added as
before this change.

Line:143, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> Why do we need the condition

itemCount > 0 && sortedRefs.size() > 0

here?

I have created a new repo, made one commit and created a new branch "b", but did not check it out. When I now open "Team -> Switch To" I do not see branch "b".
