DESCRIPTION

Start the switch-to menu with recently used branch names first

This assures that you rarely need to use the Other... menu item.
Branch names are still ordered alphabetically. If only a few
recently used branch names exist, more entries are added as
before this change.

Depend on JGit change I91c7e08c4afd2562df2226887a933d93c78a0371

nice idea

Line:116, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> you already ensured this protection in lines 123 and 127 so this comment should be moved up or removed

Line:123, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> should be < instead of <= otherwise you end up with 21 menu entries

Line:127, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> should be < instead of <= otherwise you end up with 21 menu entries
