Append commit id at the end of the changeset

should be at the end of the changesets name and in a lighter color then
the rest of the text.

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitChangeSetLabelProvider.java -> would be better to use AbbreviatedObjectId which can ensure that abbreviated IDs are unique within the repo

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/mapping/GitChangeSetLabelProvider.java -> Done, even though using AbbreviatedObjectId is a little more expensive as we need to acquire a ObjectReader for every commit. We can't cache it as the labelprovider is used for several repositories in the sync view.
