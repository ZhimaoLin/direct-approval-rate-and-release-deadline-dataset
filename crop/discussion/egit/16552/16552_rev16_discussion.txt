DESCRIPTION

Add class that represents the rebase-todo and rebase-done files

The RebaseInteractivePlan provides a list that joins both the todo and
done file. Elements can be reordered and changed. Any changes to the
todo-elements are immediately written to the todo-file to avoid any
difference between todo-elements in the RebaseInteractivePlan and the
rebase-todo-file.

The RebaseInteractivePlan is registered as IndexDiffChangeListener and
as RefsChangeListener. This guarantees that the plan is notified on all
relevant actions of the interactive rebase and can refresh itself from the
file system.
