DESCRIPTION

Add class that represents the rebase-todo and rebase-done files

The RebaseInteractivePlan provides a list that joins both the todo and
done file. Elements can be reordered and changed. Any changes to the
todo-elements are immediately written to the todo-file to avoid any
difference between todo-elements in the RebaseInteractivePlan and the
rebase-todo-file.

The RebaseInteractivePlan is registered as IndexDiffChangeListener.
This guarantees that the plan is notified on all relevant actions of the
interactive rebase and can refresh itself from the file system.
