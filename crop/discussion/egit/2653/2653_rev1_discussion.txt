Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I do not like the way the sharing dialog looks with this. The Repository Path the dialog (almost always) gets truncated.

I do agree with the idea of making the directory absolute in code, since its awkward to get the logic right when it isn't.

It is not just awkward, it is necessary to get it right and to support git repositories which are not under the container path.

As for the GUI view, there must be better ways to handle the truncation. One suggestion is to consider presenting a container relative path for cases where possible and the full path where not.

Patch Set 1:

We could represent the .git-dir path just like we did, but compute
the string in the gui.
