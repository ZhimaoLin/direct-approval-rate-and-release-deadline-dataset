DESCRIPTION

Ensure that the http(s) clipboard selections aren't greedy

When capturing http:// or https:// from the clipboard, additionally
look for the tell-tale sign '.git' in the URL, which if present, will be
a giveaway that it's a Git URL. Otherwise, assume it's a webpage
and don't pre-fill the dialog automatically.
