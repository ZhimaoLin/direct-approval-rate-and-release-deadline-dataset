DESCRIPTION

IndexDiffCacheEntry: wait for workspace lock using begin/end rule

IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock is used to synchronize
IndexDiff calculations with workspace changes. IndexDiff calculation is
started when the workspace can be locked.
The old implementation performed an empty Workspace.run to achieve this.
This could result in the state that Workspace.run acquires scheduling
rule workspace root and waits for OrderedLock because another thread is
broadcasting changes.
To avoid this blocking of workspace root waitForWorkspaceLock now avoids
calling Workspace.run. Instead JobManager().beginRule is used to wait.
