DESCRIPTION

Don't eagerly prompt the user with an error message when creating
or renaming a branch.

It is bad form to prompt the user with an error message before
they have actually entered any data. The input validator for
the branch naming text field is too aggressive with its warning.
It should only prompt when the user has actually entered data
into the text field.
