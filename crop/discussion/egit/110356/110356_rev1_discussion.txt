DESCRIPTION

Use newer trash icon on Eclipse Photon or newer

Copy the SVG and PNGs from the eclipse.platform.images git repository
and rename them from "trash.*" to "trash_flat.*".

Add a version check for the first version of the "org.eclipse.ui"
bundle that uses the new icon to decide which one to use in EGit.
EGit UI has a hard (non-optional) dependency on org.eclipse.ui anyway,
so this version check is acceptable.

This ensures that EGit uses a trash icon visually identical to the
one used by the platform on which EGit runs, and thus the user is
presented with a consistent UI.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Change itself looks good but I see no differences in the popup icon on the repository. AFAICS the png is still hard-code via the plugin.xml 

<image
            commandId="org.eclipse.egit.ui.team.GarbageCollect"
            icon="icons/elcl16/trash.png">
      </image>

Missed that one. Making this one dynamic depending on the org.eclipse.ui version will require a new property tester, and using it in the menu contribution.

Pfff... 

The others (that are changed by this implementation) are visible for instance in the general "Push..." dialog, table at the bottom where the push refspecs are listed, rightmost column.

I think it is OK to use the nicer looking item always without property tester. Seems like a bit of to much effort for this little thing.

"Nicer looking" is subjective. I do believe inconsistent UIs.
