DESCRIPTION

Checkout: display checkout conflicts in a user-friendly way

Also, if some files could not be deleted during checkout, these files
are displayed to the user so that they have a chance to retry the
deletion.

Depends on JGit change

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,2161

which exposes the list of conflicts and not deleted files during
checkout.

Line:176, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/BranchAndResetActionTest.java -> this fails on filesystems which don't block file deletion when FileInputStream is open since the delete() call above already succeeds
