DESCRIPTION

Fix commit amend to show full commit when clicking "amend" option

In the Git Staging view, when editing an existing commit, it should be
possible to re-edit all details of a commit. This includes not only the
commit message, but also all file additions, modifications and
deletions. Therefore, the "Staged Changes" file list should list the
changes that happened in the commit that is being edited.

This introduces two new test failures:
org.eclipse.egit.ui.test.stagview.StagingViewTest.testAmend
org.eclipse.egit.ui.test.stagview.StagingViewTest.testMergeConflict

Patch Set 3:

I debugged org.eclipse.egit.ui.test.stagview.StagingViewTest.testAmend assuming that only the test needs adjustment but it looks to me that the implementation "looses" the direct successor commit. 

A->B-C and if you amend C you end up with A->C'. 

@Matthias, I think you need to review the implementation again.
