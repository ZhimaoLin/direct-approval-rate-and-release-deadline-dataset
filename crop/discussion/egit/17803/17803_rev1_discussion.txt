DESCRIPTION

Fix ReplaceActionsTest instability caused by commit time stamps

It failed when the time between the two commits happened to not be in
the same second (Git commit time stamp has second resolution).

To fix it, make sure the time stamps are always different and change the
order in the dialog to correspond to the order in the history (show
newer commits first).

Line:708, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryActionHandler.java -> do we also need RevSort.BOUNDARY ?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> commit time resolution depends on the platform you run git on, some filesystems have 1 second resolution, others have higher resolution

Line:708, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryActionHandler.java -> I'm not sure, I added it for completeness in the next patch set.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> But does Git actually store timestamps with a higher resolution than 1 second in commit objects? The way I read this is that it stores seconds: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#_date_formats

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> you are right, the higher precision is only used in the index if available from the filesystem
