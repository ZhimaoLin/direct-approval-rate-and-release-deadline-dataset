DESCRIPTION

Fix UI tests looping on Mac OS X

The UI tests loop on Mac OS X showing tons of
"*** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool():" on the console when
running them from Maven. This is caused by Cocoa
requiring the UI event loop to run on thread 0.
Fix this problem by setting JVM parameter
-XstartOnFirstThread on Mac. This is also done by
Eclipse when defining a SWTBot run configuration.
