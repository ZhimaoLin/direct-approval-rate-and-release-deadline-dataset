DESCRIPTION

CompareIndexWithHeadAction: avoid unnecessary IndexDiff calculation

CompareIndexWithHeadActionHandler blocked the UI when calculating an
IndexDiff on a big folder in its enabled method.
Since the action is only working on files and the calculation result on
folders is always false the calculation on folders can be removed.
