DESCRIPTION

Do not set focus on the unstaged items when auto-staging is enabled
*and* there is at least one item staged. Instead, prefer the commit
message.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Currently you evaluate the number of staged items before auto-staging happened so if there are no staged but some unstaged entries focus will go to staged changes after auto-staging the unstaged items.

I think we should also give focus to the commit message if there is at least one unstaged item since, when auto-staging is on, this entry will be auto-staged ;-)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Will fix it. Sorry about that. My Mylyn was not properly applying the template.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Shall I rework to *always* give focus to the commit message then when auto-staging is enabled?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it would make sense to give focus to the commit message when auto-staging is on and there is at least one item in unstaged or staged changes
