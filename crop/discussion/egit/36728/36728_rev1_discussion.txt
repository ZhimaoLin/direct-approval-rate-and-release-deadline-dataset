DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Show date columns in local time zone, original on hover

The local time zone makes sense to the user as they can compare the
different commit dates much easier, and it is what is shown in other
places of the UI as well.

On hover, the full date in original time zone is shown in ISO format.

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTableHoverManager.java -> I think we should use Format.LOCALE here otherwise the hover looks really strange if the current Locale isn't English since ISO is always using Locale.US and Format.LOCALLOCAL will use the current Locale

e.g. with German locale the timestamp in the table looks like
10.11.2014  16:34:54
and the hover
2014-11-10 16:34:54 +0100
-> here the dates are formatted inconsistently

with English locale and 24 hour time format configured in the OS the timestamp in the table is
Nov 10, 2014 4:34:54 PM
and the hover
2014-11-10 16:34:54 +0100
-> here times are shown in 24h / 12h format which again looks inconsistent

if we use Format.LOCALE here with German locale the table entry looks like
10.11.2014  16:34:54
and the hover
10.11.2014  16:34:54 +0100

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTableHoverManager.java -> ISO looks the same regardless of the locale, so it isn't really US.

I explicitly picked ISO because it is unambiguous and frequently used for showing international times, and most if not all developers should be familiar with it.

Using the locale-specific date format but for different time zones somehow feels strange to me. But hey, maybe that's just me. I added a comment on the bug report, maybe the others have a preference.
