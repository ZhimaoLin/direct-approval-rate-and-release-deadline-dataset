working with an external tool.

Patch Set 1:

I think this change is going to collide with Robin's change?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Yes, it will collide with
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,1279
I'll wait until 1279 is in and then reduce the scope of this to use the dedicated trace location.
