DESCRIPTION

ContainerTreeIterator: remove caching of file length

Caching of file length was introduced with commit
c03562f2202231d55e84eb761bb1462fd69a584a. Outdated cache entries are
removed in a resource change listener. It can happen that the resource
change listener is not called (see bug 338667, CompareActionsTest
broken on Ubuntu). Thus the caching mechanism was removed.
