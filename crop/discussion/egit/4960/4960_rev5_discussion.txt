DESCRIPTION

Fix rebase > continue when nothing left to commit.

If after resolving all conflicts nothing is left to commit, behave like
cgit, and display a nice message informing the user.

Currently, EGit displays a "HEAD advanced fast forward" message, which
is absolutely not helpful at all.

This depends on a change with the same ID in jgit!
