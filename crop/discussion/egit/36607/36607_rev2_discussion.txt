Looks good, maybe retarget to 3.5?

I don't plan to release another 3.5 service release for such a minor issue

Patch Set 2:

I wasn't suggesting that, only that if we would need a 3.5 for another reason, it would be good to have it included. But we could always cherry-pick it if that happens.

Are you planning on merging master into stable-3.6 some time before the 3.6 release? Or does everything for 3.6 need to target stable-3.6?

Patch Set 2:

don't use stable-3.6 for now, I only created it to be able to release 3.6-m1 without disturbing those working on master, I should have announced that on the mailing list
