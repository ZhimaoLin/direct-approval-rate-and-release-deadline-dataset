DESCRIPTION

Disable Git quick diff provider if the resource is not versioned

The quick diff provider coming from EGit should only enable
itself if the resource in question is under a project that's
shared with Git through EGit. If it isn't, the provider needs to
be disabled as changes in the given resource has no Git history
to diff itself against.
