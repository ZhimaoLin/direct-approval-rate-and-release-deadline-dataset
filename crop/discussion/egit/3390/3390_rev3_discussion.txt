Patch Set 3:

that's a very useful enhancement !

some remarks after playing a bit (not thoroughly tested yet):
- results should be grouped by repository
- search hits should be highlighted in commit viewer, so that I can see where my search term has been found
- is there a way to display which branches contain a given commit returned in the result list? 
- the result list header could list a short summary of the search criteria
- there should be an option (which should be on by default) to reuse the commit viewer views so that after having navigated a long list of results I don't end up with zillions of open commit views

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Why did you remove all xxx@xxx.xxx javadocs? It it is necessary for some reasons this should be done in separate change or at least mentioned in commit message.

Also I think that 'Expand All' and 'Collapse All' buttons should be disabled (if it is possible) because there is thing to be collapsed/expanded in search result.

Apart from that, this is a very good idea to have search commit option! I like it ;)

Patch Set 3:

I removed the @see tag that were introduced in previous commits pertaining to this same bug since I got feedback on JGit patches that @see tags are not used when overriding methods.  xxx@xxx.xxx tags used in EGit when overriding methods?

Patch Set 3:

I don't know does we have any policy for xxx@xxx.xxx tags this is IMHO depends on developer.

From my point of view if those comments are already in repository they shouldn't be removed without any information in commit message ... IMHO

@see tags are just minors, don't bother them ;)
