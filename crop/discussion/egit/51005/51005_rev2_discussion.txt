DESCRIPTION

ConnectProviderOperation should respect core_autoIgnoreDerivedResources

If the project is connected to git, ConnectProviderOperation always
tried to add derived resources to the .gitignore file, independently
which value was set via "core_autoIgnoreDerivedResources" property.

The patch makes sure that if user set "core_autoIgnoreDerivedResources"
property to "false", connecting projects to git will not alter
.gitignore file.
