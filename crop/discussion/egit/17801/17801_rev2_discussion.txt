DESCRIPTION

Remove unstable assertion from LinkedResourcesTest

The problematic file is sometimes reported with a resource change event,
sometimes not. As a core test failure fails the whole build, don't test
this problematic file. The other assertions still show that the
resources are reported against the correct repository.
