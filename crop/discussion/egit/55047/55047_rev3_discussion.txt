DESCRIPTION

Fix sorting of nodes in repositories view

RepositoriesViewSorter re-implemented sorting of nodes in a naÃ¯ve way
which is already implemented in RepositoryTreeNode. Instead delegate the
comparison to RepositoryNode.compare().

Also improve RepositoryNode.compare() using CommonUtil comparators which
ensure that sorting is case-insensitive and sort names containing
numbers in natural order. This ensures all objects shown in the
repositories view are sorted accordingly.

This also fixes the problem that since b9dad5fa the order of repository
nodes flipped when its status became dirty/clean. This was caused by
RepositoriesViewSorter which compared the node label texts which changes
when the dirty decorator "> " is added or removed.

Looks good,

I tested the behaviour before and after the commit.

Only the comment between your new lines (not inserted by this commit), can fixed. See gerrit comments.

Line:305, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> // if the name is unique, let's look at the whole path

Line:305, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> no, I think this is correct: if there is more than one entry with the same file name e.g. "x" then compare the complete file path e.g. /a/x and /b/x which is guaranteed to be unique by the file system
