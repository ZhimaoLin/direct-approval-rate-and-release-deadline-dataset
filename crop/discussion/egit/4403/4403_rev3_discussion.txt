Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContext.java -> The original code didn't use resource mappings. What does this buy us?

Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContext.java -> I hope this will reduce number of traversals hat wee need to visit during refresh process

Dariusz, if you plan to fix the breakpoint problem in this change set, please document this in the commit message.

With the old code, making changes to a file and saving it will cause it to be shown in the 'Synchronize' view. This would stop working very quickly afterwards (in the sense that it would no longer refresh properly). With the new code, this feature won't even work once.

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContext.java -> Please update the copyright header.

Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContext.java -> How can I test and verify that this is making a difference? If we are not sure this code change is gaining us anything then I don't think we should do anything.

I discovered that events caused by breakpoints have delta flags value set to 0, other events (like save event) non zero value, so from my point of view simple if (event.getFlags() == 0) continue will fix breakpoint problem. This will also remove  problems with refreshing sync result list that you mention in previous comment.

I'll update commit message and push another patch set

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContext.java -> Done

Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContext.java -> I can agree with this approach and will revert this change in new patch set
