DESCRIPTION

Fix Tag dialog: Catch exception when parsing a lightweight tag

Currently the Tag dialog only works with annotated tags. It gets them
from the method getRevTags(). This method uses repo.getTags()
which returns also lightweight tags. With this commit the expected
exception is just caught.
