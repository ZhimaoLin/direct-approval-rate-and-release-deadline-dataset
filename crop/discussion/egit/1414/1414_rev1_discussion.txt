DESCRIPTION

Catch expected exception when parsing a lightweight tag 

Currently the Tag dialog only works with annotated tags. It gets it
input from the method getRevTags(). This method uses repo.getTags()
which returns also lightweight tags. With this commit the expected
exception is just caught.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

We need the same fix in CreateTagCommand. Much better would be to move that logic into the dialog where it belongs (let's follow up on this in  bug 323607).
