DESCRIPTION

Redo "Use ViewerComparator instead of deprecated ViewerSorter"

Same as commit e338800, but excluding the classes that are used
in the navigatorContent extension point: the <commonSorter>
element cannot handle ViewerComparators; see bug 484248.

These classes are RepositoriesViewSorter and GitChangeSetSorter.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add suppression of the deprecation warnings?

I've done it in a separate change; as a non-committer on this project I'm not able to upload a new patch set to this change.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I thought about it. It's OK with me if you want to suppress them; OTOH, leaving them in will serve as a reminder to fix these two classes once our baseline is Oxygen (or whenever 484248 will be fixed).
