DESCRIPTION

Enforce UTF8 encoding of workspace

The oomph setup doesn't set a workspace encoding, therefore using the
platform default for all projects without explicit project setting (like
the github connector project).

Since the POM files use utf8 encoding as Maven arguments it seems
reasonable to have the complete workspace use this encoding.

The change includes a relative move of another existing workspace
preference. This is because of using the oomph preference capturing and
will not occur anymore for further captured preferences.
