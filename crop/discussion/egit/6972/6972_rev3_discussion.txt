DESCRIPTION

Show problem decorations in staging view and commit dialog

This makes errors/warnings on the files visible while committing.
Before, these could only be noticed in other places before committing
(e.g. the package explorer).

In an earlier version of this change, IDecoratorManager was used. The
problem with that was that it could be turned off in the preferences and
that updating behavior was not correct.

So in this version, a plain ILabelDecorator is used and the decorations
are updated using a IResourceChangeListener.

Thanks, I've now looked at ResourceModelLabelProvider from org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.mapping and reworked the change.

Also checked the clean + build problem and it works now with the new approach.
