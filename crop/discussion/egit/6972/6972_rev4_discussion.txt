DESCRIPTION

Show problem decorations in staging view and commit dialog

This makes errors/warnings on the files visible while committing.
Before, these could only be noticed in other places before committing
(e.g. the package explorer).

In an earlier version of this change, IDecoratorManager was used. The
problem with that was that it could be turned off in the preferences and
that updating behavior was not correct.

So in this version, a plain ILabelDecorator is used and the decorations
are updated using a IResourceChangeListener.

Maybe we could extend this and provide an option which blocks the commit command if there are any problem markers on files to be committed. Though this needs to be optional as sometimes you may want to commit a draft in order to switch to another task.

There's already an open bug report about something similar, I added a comment there:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=373067

In any case, this should be done in separate changes.

The patch looks good and works fine. There are two very minor issues which can be fixed later:

- copyright (date) is not updated everywhere
- ProblemLabelDecorator(StructuredViewer) should not allow to 
  pass null

Forget that comment. 'null' is OK.
