DESCRIPTION

Show problem decorations in staging view and commit dialog

This makes errors/warnings on the files visible while committing.
Before, these could only be noticed in other places before committing
(e.g. the package explorer).

In an early draft of this change, the decoration was done directly in
StagingViewLabelProvider (without using IDecoratorManager). The problem
with that approach was that the decorations didn't get updated after
editing a file.

With the extension point and IDecoratorManager, updating the decoration
works. And, except for having to exclude GitLightweightDecorator via
IDecorationContext, it feels cleaner.

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

Take a look at how the Synchronize view shows the problem decorator.

Note, that besides the things I already mentioned, your patch also does not always work correctly (e.g. clean + build does not bring back the decorators, one has to touch a file).
