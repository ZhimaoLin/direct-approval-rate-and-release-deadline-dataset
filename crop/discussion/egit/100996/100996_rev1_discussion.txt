DESCRIPTION

Reflog view: serialize asynchronous loading jobs

Per bug 226343 the DeferredTreeContentManager has some problems.
Avoid most of them by serializing jobs asynchronously loading the
reflog, and once we have the reflog, don't re-load it but return
it directly.

Fix auto-updates of the view by re-setting the input on ref changes.
Just calling refresh() doesn't work anymore if the reflog is loaded
asynchronously.
