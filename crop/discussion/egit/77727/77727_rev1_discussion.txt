Patch Set 1:

I think this is obsoleted by https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/74954/ (done to avoid UI deadlocks when that dreaded dialog comes up and there are already modal dialogs -- for some reason I cannot fathom, using the ModalShellProvider apparently wasn't good enough), and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76477/ (which removes that show method altogether).
