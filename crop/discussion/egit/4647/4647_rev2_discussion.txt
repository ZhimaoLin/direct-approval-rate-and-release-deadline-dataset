DESCRIPTION

Handle deleted resources in AddToIndexOperation

This operation can now handle run a RmCommand on and
selected resources that do not exist.

view when running the 'Add to Git Index' menu action on
deleted resources in the Unstaged changes' section

Patch Set 2:

I am not sure if this is the right approach.
Perhaps we should replace the "Add to Git index" action by a "Stage" action.
This action could then reuse the logic in StagingView.stage (works also for non workspace files).
Same could apply for the "Remove from Git Index" action and StagingView.unstage.

Patch Set 2:

I proposed change http://egit.eclipse.org/r/4663 which allows staging deletions for both resources and non-workspace files. I did not rename the actions (this could be an additional change).
