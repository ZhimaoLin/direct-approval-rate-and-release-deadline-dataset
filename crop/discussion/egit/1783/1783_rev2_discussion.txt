Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We have 4 projects with .java sources:
- org.eclipse.egit.core
- org.eclipse.egit.core.test
- org.eclipse.egit.ui
- org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

Proposed solution brings nothing at least for org.eclipse.egit.ui module where the same configuration should be copy-n-pasted.

I think this should be moved to org.eclipse.egit.egit-parent, which is common for both org.eclipse.egit.core and org.eclipse.egit.ui

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.core/pom.xml -> This one is a white-space-only change, right?
