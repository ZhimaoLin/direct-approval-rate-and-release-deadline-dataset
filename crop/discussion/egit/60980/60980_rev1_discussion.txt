Line:4451, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> handlers above and commands here are repeating same conditions if I've got it right.

Why do we need extra handler definitions at all? We can just specify default handlers for command and keep only conditions on commands.

Line:4459, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Honestly speaking I don't know if this "or" must be specified  here at all?

Line:4461, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> why do we want restrict the command to IResource elements only? What about external files in the repo view?
I would assume that the call to hasUnstagedChanges could decide if the given object is of supported type?

Line:4451, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:4459, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> The default is "and". The selection may contain more than one element. I think the command should be available if there is at least one resource in the selection for which the command makes sense.

Line:4461, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Had misunderstood what you meant here. Guess I was just over-cautious. Yes, the test for IResource is not really needed, the property tester decides that. Will push a new patch set.
