DESCRIPTION

[sync] Remove never used classes

We always use GitModelSynchronizeParticipant instead of
GitSubscriberParticipant therefore this class can be permanently
removed. Same situation is with GitSubscriberParticipant, it
functionality is replaced by GitModelSubscriberParticipant.

GitSynchronize is now replaced by GitModelSynchronize.

CommitAction and CommitOperation was used in old implementation of
context menu support in Synchronize view, now we have a new
implementation with does no use those classes any more.

GitSynchronizeWizard were updated to use GitModelSynchronize instead of
GitSynchronize.
