DESCRIPTION

Stabilize SynchronizeViewTests

Removes a few seemingly unneeded calls to methods that grab focus
aggressively.

This makes the whole test class behave much more stable, as the window
in which the tests are running is not jumping to the front (at least
not on my Windows 7 installation).
