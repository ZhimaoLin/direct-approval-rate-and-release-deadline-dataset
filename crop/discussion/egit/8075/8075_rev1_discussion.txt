DESCRIPTION

Enable "Link with Editor" for compare editor from Tree Compare

The reactOnOpen method of CompareTreeView uses a FileEditableRevision to
show the left side in case of an IFile. So implement IResourceProvider
to enable the linking.

By the way, does anyone know why CompareTreeView#reactOnOpen doesn't use the following on line 243?:

    left = SaveableCompareEditorInput.createFileElement(res);
