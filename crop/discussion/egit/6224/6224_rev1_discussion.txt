DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Fix tooltip position on Ref hover

With the fix in I8fe269af7a73274ee6cbca96778ba7be0754d6bb, the positions
would have been right. But because it has been fixed by 3ee1488 in a
different way, we now have to adjust the position in this place.

Patch Set 1:

Apologies for making you rework this one, I wasn't sure your and Juliet Cantu's changes were initially related since they were fixing hover issues in different classes.
