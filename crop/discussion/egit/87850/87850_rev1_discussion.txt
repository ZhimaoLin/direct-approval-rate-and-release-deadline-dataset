DESCRIPTION

Fix context menu on old/new line number ruler in DiffEditorPage

The ruler context menu would not appear on the line number ruler in
the DiffEditorPage. The menu is set on the outer CompositeRuler
containing all left columns, but none is set on our own nested
CompositeRuler, and a CompositeRuler's control only forwards typed
event listeners but not SWT-level event listeners.

Work around this by adding our own SWT.MenuDetect listener to the
nested columns that checks the correct control's menu.
