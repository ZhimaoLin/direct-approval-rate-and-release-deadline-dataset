DESCRIPTION

Move SWTBot screenshots to target/screenshots

Hudson jobs should be adjusted: archive */target/screenshots/*.jpg as
artifacts to avoid they get removed/overwritten by subsequent builds.

Once this is merged, the old srceenshots directories can be removed on
Hudson.

Running UI tests interactively will still produce shreenshots in the
current location at ${project.basedir}/screenshots. Maven will use the
new location, and will clear out old screenshots first.

Patch Set 1:

Oops. Build 8098 started to run in parallel with build 8097 (which Hudson sorted somewhere in the middle of its job list). Looks like Hudson got confused by the duplicate build numbers existing due to the repeated upgrade/downgrade between 3.3.2 and 3.0.1-b2.
