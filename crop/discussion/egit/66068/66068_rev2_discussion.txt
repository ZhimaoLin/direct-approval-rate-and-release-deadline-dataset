DESCRIPTION

Move SWTBot screenshots to target/screenshots

Hudson jobs should be adjusted: archive */target/screenshots/*.jpg as
artifacts to avoid they get removed/overwritten by subsequent builds.

Once this is merged, the old srceenshots directories can be removed on
Hudson.

Running UI tests interactively will still produce shreenshots in the
current location at ${project.basedir}/screenshots. Maven will use the
new location, and will clear out old screenshots first.

Patch Set 2:

Now at least the Hudson job egit.gerrit really should archive screenshots as artifacts, otherwise they get lost on subsequent builds.

Files to archive should now be set to

  org.eclipse.egit.repository/target/repository/**, */target/screenshots/*

(I think. At least that's how it works in Jenkins ;-). )

I added this configuration to all egit hudson jobs and wiped their hudson workspaces to get rid of the old snapshot directories
