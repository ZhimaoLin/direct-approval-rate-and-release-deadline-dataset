DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Branch deletion dialog

When branches are deleted using the Repositories View, the deletion
will now be tried without force (and without dialog). Only if there are 
branches that can not be deleted due to unmerged commits, the
user will get a dialog asking if the branches should be deleted
anyway.
