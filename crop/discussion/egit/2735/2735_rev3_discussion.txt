DESCRIPTION

Allow variables for default clone destination

This change allows to use variables to set the default clone
destination in the preferences. With this, it's now possible to
configure it to always clone into workspace, using ${workspace_loc}.

The org.eclipse.debug.ui bundle is needed for showing the available
variables through the StringVariableSelectionDialog.
