DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Allow variables for default clone destination

Using the user's home directory as the default clone destination of
repositories is a confusing choice in Eclipse. The CVS and Subclipse
plugins use the workspace location, and the new project wizard also
defaults to the workspace.

This change allows to use variables to set the default clone
destination in the preferences. It also changes the default setting
to ${workspace_loc}.

Patch Set 1:

IMO the configuration isn't even necessary. It should just default to the workspace location in the clone wizard and allow choosing another directory there.

Patch Set 1:

- supporting variables here is a good idea
- there was a reason to move the default out of the workspace see [1] and [2]. Other than CVS or SVN not just the working tree is affected but also the cloned repository, if you decide to throw away the Eclipse workspace also your repository is gone. Hence I prefer to leave the default outside the eclipse workspace.

Patch Set 1:

I have read the bug report, but don't see what the problem is. Of course there are name conflicts if you try to create a new project in the workspace with the same directory as the repository (duh). When the project is named the same as the repository, it's even now not possible to have another project named the same (Eclipse limitation). And the second point sounds like a bug in M2Eclipse. It seems to me the reporter didn't understand the difference between the workspace directory structure and projects. And all these points also apply to CVS and SVN.

If you delete the workspace, all directories within are also deleted, that should also obvious and is no different than when you have uncommitted changes in CVS or SVN checkouts. Also, if you delete the project in Eclipse including project contents on disk, you also lost your repo.

All I'm trying to say is this: Please reconsider the decision for the default. We are migrating from CVS to Git in our company and this behaviour irritated all people without exception as I was showing them how to use EGit. It will also irritate other as EGit adoption grows.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Matthias, I interpret your comment like you approve of this
change, though I suspect it need to be rebased.

Patch Set 1:

Git repository is something different then simple CVS/SVN checkout. In case of git, apart from your working directory, yours local can keep not only yours changes, but also changes of yours team members, also it can have some specific configuration that can be hard to recover after you remove workspace by mistake.

Some people have strange way of dealing with eclipse errors, they just throw away workspace and starts from scrach. With such approach they will loose all changes that wasn't pushed somewhere (also repository specific configuration will be lost).

There is no ideal approach, but IMO having repository clone out of the workspace is the best we can come with. It is simple and easy to understood.
