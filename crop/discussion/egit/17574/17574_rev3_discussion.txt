DESCRIPTION

Change test execution to find all tests instead of using suites

There are multiple problems with using suites:

* They need to be kept up-to-date manually. There were some test classes
  which were not referenced by suites and therefore never executed in
  the Maven build. See parent changes for some examples. Before this
  change, the output said "Tests run: 266", after: "Tests run: 311".
* When executing tests in Eclipse by selecting a project or package,
  tests in suites are executed twice. In case of hierarchical
  suites, it's even more than twice.
