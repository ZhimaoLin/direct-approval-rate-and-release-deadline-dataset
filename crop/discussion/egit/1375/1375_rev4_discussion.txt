DESCRIPTION

Support Repository Creation

Repository creation is supported either by calling a "New Wizard"
(CTRL-N), then Git -> Git Repository or by using a new action in the
Git Repositories View.
The dialog asks for a directory in the local file system and whether
the repository is to be bare. The repository is added to the Git
Repositories View automatically.
In the course of this, the toolbar and view menu of the Repositories View
was also cleaned up.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

On bug 315015, I specified a layout issue I was having. Once that is fixed, I believe this is safe to go.
