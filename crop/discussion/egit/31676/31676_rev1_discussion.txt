That's pretty handy.

What I'm a bit worried about is that it will only find the visible branches/tags, so the user must be aware that they have to use "Show All Branches and Tags". But I think as all the search options work this way, it's ok.

The next step for improving the history view would be to have a dropdown where one can select the branch(es) that the history view should start walking at, as opposed to just current/all.

Line:163, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FindToolbar.java -> Hm, this is the icon we use for the "References" in Git Repositories view, right? Not sure I like it here, because it's so generic. Maybe rather use the one which is shown on "Branches"?

Line:410, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FindToolbar.java -> The last argument here is wrong, it should be swapped with the "..._changeto_all" of above. It's the tooltip that is shown when hovering over the icon and tells the user what the *next* thing will be when clicking on it.

Line:220, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FindToolbarThread.java -> This is the full name of the ref, e.g. "refs/heads/master", so searching for "refs" or "head" will find all branches. Not sure if that's intended, it could be either a feature or bug :).

But I think when the user is looking for a specific branch, they don't enter the full name, so I'd probably use the refname after calling Repository.shortenRefName on it.

Line:222, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FindToolbarThread.java -> This excludes finding in remote-tracking branches (e.g. "refs/remotes/origin/master"), is there a reason for this?

I think we should search in all refs, also the ones like HEAD, so just removing the if.

Line:220, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FindToolbarThread.java -> I wasn't sure whether it could be useful to search for the full reference name. The user probably doesn't expect such a search mode. So I agree with shortening the ref names.

Line:222, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FindToolbarThread.java -> I didn't consider that but I agree.
