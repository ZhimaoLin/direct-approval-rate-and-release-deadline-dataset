DESCRIPTION

Fix ContainerTreeIterator to return on-disk size of a folder

A ContainerTreeIterator always returned 0 as length of a directory. This
was inconsistent with JGits FileTreeIterator which asked the filesystem
object about the length. At least on unix filesystems the file-system
size of the directory was returned which was different from 0. On
Windows 0 was returned by java.io.File.
Because of this inconsistency folders containing submodules often have
been marked as dirty by mistake. The index was filled with data coming
from a FileTreeIterator (length!=0) while the ContainerTreeIterator
returned length==0.

This has been fixed by forcing ContainerTreeIterator to ask the
filesystem for the length of a folder.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

Thanks for finding the problem in test teardown. I still haven't found out where the real problem is. See the comment from Oct 7, 10:58 from Hudson. Hudson was able to tear down without the explicit deletion of projects. It sometimes works, sometimes not. Maybe some parallel execution of tests (or only their teardown phases).
Anyhow +2
