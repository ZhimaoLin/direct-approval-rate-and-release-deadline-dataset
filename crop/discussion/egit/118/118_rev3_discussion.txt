DESCRIPTION

Import a project set file

Very simple implementation:
- checks out 'master' branch (hard-coded)
- creates a local repository with o.e.e.core.op.CloneOperation in
  <workspaceroot>/<humanish-git-url> (hard-coded) for every unique
  repository from the project's reference.
- connects checked out projects with
  o.e.e.core.op.ConnectProviderOperation

No UI interaction had been implemented yet.
