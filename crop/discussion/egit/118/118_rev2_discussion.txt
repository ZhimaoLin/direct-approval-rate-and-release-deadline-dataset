DESCRIPTION

Import a project set file

Very simple implementation:
- checks out 'master' branch (hard-coded)
- creates a local repository with o.e.e.core.op.CloneOperation in
  <workspaceroot>/<humanish-git-url> (hard-coded) for every unique
  repository from the project's reference.
- connects checked out projects with
  o.e.e.core.op.ConnectProviderOperation

No UI interaction had been implemented yet.

Due to the bug 244313 it depends on
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility layer.

and, now Shawn removed the eclipse project files so the provide psf isn't usable even if the URLs get fixed.

Could we get the import to run mvn eclipse:eclipse in a clean fashion? That would be useful in other settings than Git. We could drop that psf file from the patch and it would almost be useful if it weren't because we hsve not
decent way of creating project set files. This patch enables PSF export, but it doesn't work (no project serializer).

Line:113, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> Either add a message or check that at least some errors here make sense and drop This comment (next TODO too)

Line:145, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> We have not abandoned 3.4 just yet. makeRelativePath requires 3,5.

Line:170, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitProjectSetCapability.java -> drop TODO comment

Line:4, egit.psf -> This one needs updating to the latest projects and URLs

Robin, could you provide more info because this patch has a fix for 'no project serializer' issue caused by the bug #244313. And it works, how to use an archived update site (which has this patchset) is available on http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide/Project_Set_File

The absolute dependency on the runtime bundle should not be pushed through. We should, if we're working around the bug, make it an optional requirement so that if present, it's available, but if not, we don't need it. IIRC the only thing that will fail is the export of the PSF if this dependency isn't satisfied, and that can be fixed upstream.

Line:11, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We shouldn't need this, and especially shouldn't mandate it. We can make it an optional dependency, using ;resolution:=optional on the line. Ideally this bug should be fixed upstream such that we don't need it, but I see no reason to demand it and prevent everything else from working if it's not present.
