Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I don't see why we need this as we already support Team Project Sets.

If you want to clone multiple repositories using a file as input you may use "Import... > Team > Team Project Set" instead. This functionality was added recently. Team Project Set files can be created using "Export... > Team > Team Project Set".

In order to prevent such surprises it maybe a good idea to first file an enhancement bug and discuss your idea with the community.

This proposal looks unfinished when looking at the source code. Think twice before pushing code which isn't ready for review as this wastes the time of reviewers. If you really think you need feedback on work in progress then mark it with [RFC] in the commit header.

Patch Set 1: No score

Sorry, I was too harsh here, I was looking at this late in the night. I'll try out this change again and come back with more constructive feedback.
