DESCRIPTION

tools/version.sh: Use backup files on Win32

Copied from corresponding change in jgit repository.
Windows doesn't permit us to edit a file in-place with Perl.
So create backup files when we perform the edit, and remove them
when we are done.  This is a tad slower on POSIX systems, but is
much more portable.
