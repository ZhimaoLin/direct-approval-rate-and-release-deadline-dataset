Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/CommitActionTest.java -> these are pure formatting changes, do we need that ?

Line:72, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/CommitActionTest.java -> same here

Line:157, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/CommitActionTest.java -> typo in method name :

s/testLauched/testLaunched/

Line:195, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/CommitActionTest.java -> test is failing on Mac as some parts use \n and other rely on Text.DELIMITER as line ending, instead always use the latter one like in CommitMessageComponent
