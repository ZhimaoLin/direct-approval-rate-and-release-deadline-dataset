DESCRIPTION

CommitOperation: make commit method private and implement getCommit

StagingView derived from CommitOperation to get access to the newly
created commit for opening the commit in the commit editor.
Now the new commit can be accessed via getCommit. The logic to open the
commit editor was moved to class CommitUI.
