DESCRIPTION

Refactoring Branch operations first part: simplify Branch operations

This exposes static methods to create the BranchOperationUI instead of
specific constructors which should make usage for the consumers
easier.

Both BranchOperation and BranchOperationUI take String as argument
which is to be used for Ref name and Commit ID as well (JGit takes
care of the rest).
