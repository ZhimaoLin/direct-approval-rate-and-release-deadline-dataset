Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ImportProjectsCommand.java -> EGit is supposed to work with Eclipse 3.8. I don't that class exists there, and I would expect a class loader error there in that case.

I also think we should not use org.eclipse.ui.internal packages/classes.

There is a fragment org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport; org.eclipse.egit.ui must not depend on it, but the wiring here should be general enough such that the smart import fragment can override it. Extension point, and turn that fragment into a bundle?

AFAIK class loading in Java is lazy, so if the isSmartImportWizardAvailable method works correct, we should not see classloader exceptions. 

@Tobias, can you download Eclipse 3.8 and test this change in 3.8?

We'll see. Nevertheless: I don't like using internal classes, and since we do have that smartimport fragment/bundle, I do believe this should go there, and main org.eclipse.egit.ui should be made extensible in that regard so that that smartimport bundle can override which import wizard is used. Doing this here -- hard-wired (even with a check whether it's available) -- just doesn't look right.

I hope that long term the EGit import wizard can be retired and only the platform import wizard is used. The need for custom import wizard should be removed with our new SmartImport Wizard. Not sure if it is worth to design an extensible solution for that.

FYI - opened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=498330 for the request to add API to open the SmartImportWizard.
