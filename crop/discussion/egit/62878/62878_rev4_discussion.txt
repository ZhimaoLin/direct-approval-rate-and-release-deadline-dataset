DESCRIPTION

Enable console logging for org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer.tests

Make pom.xml consistent with egit.ui.test:

* Add the not-mac profile. This enables console logging by virtue of
  the ${test.vmparams}. At a later point, we should see if we
  can perhaps move these profiles into the global pom?
* specify an application in the tycho-surefire config.
* Add org.eclipse.equinox.event as a dependency in the tycho-surefire
  config. That gets rid of all the "Event Admin not available" log
  messages.

Patch Set 4:

Previous build failures were expected. Console log from PS 2 shows the Event Admin not available messages; log from PS 3 shows those gone and only the (expected) NPE being shown. As of PS 4, I expect the build to succeed.
