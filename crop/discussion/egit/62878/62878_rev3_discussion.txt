DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Test infrastructure

Two goals:

* enable console logging for all tests
* (later) see if I can get screenshots for failing UI tests

I'm not in the mood to set up a local infrastructure
to test this all on my machine. So I'll test directly
on the EGit Hudson instance.

Builds are expected to fail. EasymportWizardTest will
throw an NPE.
