Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

useful stuff, it's a bit difficult to switch it on/off, would be nice if the option could be toggled without leaving commit dialog / staging view e.g. using a toggle button or menu option

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> move these unrelated formatting fixes into a separate change

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> this also works in staging view :-)

Patch Set 1: (3 inline comments)

The action has been already added to the context menu. Please check my inline comment to see where it happens.

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> I haven't done it on purpose. It's the result of clean up action triggered on save. They have added by Robin in f95c105980fc8dc1c356665bb796f256d62bf1ca. I'm fine with removing them now, but I think you should consider reformating all the source code. Otherwise, this kind of situation will happen each time a contributor edits a file where a formatting change could be applied.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Cool, so I'm killing two birds with one stone :)

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> I wasn't aware that Robin introduced a clean up action to fix this nasty nit. Under this condition I would say you don't need to remove these unrelated formatting changes. I'll have a look how big a complete reformatting change would be. It may happen that it creates a mess for all changes currently in flight.
