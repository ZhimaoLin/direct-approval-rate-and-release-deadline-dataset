DESCRIPTION

Check FS.supportsExecute() before resolving file from resource

The performance of building a list of ResourceEntries is improved by
checking the file system's support for executable files before
checking the actual file as this requires resolving the file first -
which seems to be expensive when many resources exist. This only
affects platforms that do not support executable files, e.g. Windows.
See bug 325393 for performance results.

Reminds me that we should perhaps have an EclipseFS, but this makes things a little better.  See the isse for more an performance. This is micro-optimization where "macro"-optimization is feasible.
