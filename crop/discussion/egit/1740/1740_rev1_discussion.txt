DESCRIPTION

Renaming "Remote Branches" to "Remote Tracking Branches"

This makes Git Repositories view easier to understand for Git beginners.  I
have seen many of them thinking that branches under the "Remote Branches" node
are branches from a remote repository. Changing the name to "Remote Tracking
Branches" will help and will be also consistent with the standard Git
terminology.

Patch Set 1:

Hrmmm... I don't mind this but it seems like a lot of extra text for something that is obvious to me. What else do people think they are?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

I have no reservations, except that all our screenshots in the documentation will become outdated...
Let's get a third opinion -> Matthias?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I propose we omit the redundant "Branches" in "Local Branches" and "Remote Tracking Branches", so we would end up with:

Branches
- Local
-- master
- Remote Tracking
-- origin/master
