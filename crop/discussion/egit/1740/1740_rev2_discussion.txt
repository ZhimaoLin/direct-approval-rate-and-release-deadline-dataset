DESCRIPTION

Making branch nodes' names more consistent.

Renaming "Remote Branches" to "Remote Tracking" and "Local Branches" to
"Local".  This makes Git Repositories view easier to understand for Git
beginners.  I have seen many of them thinking that branches under the "Remote
Branches" node are branches from a remote repository. Changing the name to
"Remote Tracking" will help and will be also consistent with the standard Git
terminology.  Removing the " Branches" suffix makes UI look better.
