defbranchstartpoint is the standard git option or it is introduced by this patch ?

Patch Set 7:

It's a new option. Git itself doesn't have such a configuration.

Patch Set 7:

So, I would rather say that such configuration such stay EGit specific and stored in Eclipse preferences rather than in .git/config

Patch Set 7:

The JGit change is already submitted. Another thing that was pointed out at the EGit hackathon was, that this configuration should be possible to be specific to a repository, because in one repository the branch structure can be different than in another.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

What's the reason that when creating a branch from the git toolbar command "Checkout branch, tag or reference" > "New branch" doesn't respect this configuration ?

Line:77, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/CreateBranchCommand.java -> I think you should not resolve the commit since then the user doesn't see anymore that he is basing the new branch on a certain remote tracking branch, also setup of tracking relationship (used by pull) can't work with that. So instead use the remote tracking branch's ref
