Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> I would expect different error handling. Why do you expect starting BranchOperationUI again would work here if it failed earlier ?

Line:310, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> style nit: unmotivated whitespace change in an unrelated class

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit:   s/Create branch dialog/"Create Branch" dialog/

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/"Switch" to/"Switch to"/

Line:114, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> Because the IOException would be thrown by repository.getRef(sourceRef). So when there is an error, the operation would have the current behaviour.

There is still another case where the new config parameter is not taken into account: If you Select "Create Branch..." in the "Branches"-Node or the "Branches/Local"-Node of the Repository View the currently checked out branch is taken.

The code is in CreateBranchCommand, line 64.
