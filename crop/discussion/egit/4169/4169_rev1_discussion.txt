DESCRIPTION

Read default source ref configuration

Read the config constant "defaultsourceref", when the Create branch
dialog wasn't called from a branch in the repositories view (like if you
called the Switch to new branch command on a project node).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Please see my inline comments

I see two additional issues:

- If I open the Create Branch... dialog on the context menu of the currently checked out branch I would like to keep this branch as source.

- When I open the Create Branch... dialog on the context menu of a remote branch or a tag I get a proposal for the new branch name. I do not get it now for the branch which is determined from the config constant "defaultsourceref".

Line:312, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> Please check for null. myBaseRef is null if I create a new branch on a commit in history view.In that case myBaseCommit is different from null.

Line:322, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> whitespace error
