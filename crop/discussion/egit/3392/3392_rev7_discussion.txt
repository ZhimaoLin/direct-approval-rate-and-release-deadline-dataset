Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

* Finish button is now enabled even when focus isn't moved (good). But when clicking finish without moving the focus the synchronize result is always empty. So it seems the selected destination is ignored.
* when selecting destination for multiple repos and clicking finish, only result for the repo which was selected first is computed, result for all other repos seems to be always empty
* dialog label could be improved from "Select the resources to be synchronized" to "Select destination for repositories to be synchronized"
