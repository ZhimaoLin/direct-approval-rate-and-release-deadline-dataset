Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- when I select 3 projects out of 20 in package explorer and then open
  the synchronize wizard still all 20 projects are preselected (checkbox
  checked), shouldn't that be filtered with the selection ?
- I would like to see a simple way to (de-)select a complete repo in case
   I don't want to filter on projects, maybe there could be another column
   before the project column, so we would end up with a tree instead of
   a flat list, so that selecting the repo would select all projects underneath.
- what's the use case why it should be possible to be able to select
   a different destination for different projects which are in the same
   repo ? I would find it easier to understand if the destination can only
   be defined on repo level. In addition I am not sure which git 
   operations can be done on the result of a heterogeneous 
   synchronize where different destinations have been selected for
   different projects in the same repo.
- currently I have to select all the projects I want to synchronize one
   by one and also I have to select the destination for each of them
   individually, this sums up to a lot of clicks, if trying that e.g. on
   egit repo
- I also need to make these two types of selections consistent
   otherwise the finish button won't be enabled
- I think there should be also a reasonable default for the destination
   instead of showing a blank destination in the beginning
- if I have only git managed projects/repos in my workspace/selection
   why do I still have to select the synchronize type on the first
   wizard page ?

Patch Set 2:

* AFAIK the synchronize wizard isn't connected with package explorer, therefore when it is launched from synchronize view page the selections from package explorer doesn't apply
* to be honest I'm not sure about adding an repository level. maybe we can automatically select/deselect all project from same repository when one of them get selected/deselected
* actually this is a side effect of having project-level presentation in sync-wizard. maybe we should also select the same destination in all repo projects when one of them got destination configured by user
* no, you don't need to select all projects in repository. you need to select at least one and configure a destination for it, and you are done, you can launch synchronization
* as I mentioned before you don't need to select all projects in repository, but jest the destination configuration should be consistent in one repository
* good point, I think we should check the 'include local' check box and set detault destination to HEAD same as it is done in sync-dialog
* this is how the standard synchronization works in team framework in eclipse. I doubt that we can do something about this

Additionally, maybe we should rollback to repository-based sync-view and do not display any projects, since we currently don't support folder level configuration.
