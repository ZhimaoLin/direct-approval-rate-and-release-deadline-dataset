rebased.

IMHO loading previous configuration into sync-wizard should be done in separate change. I'll provide such change in a day or two

this looks much better :-)

though there is still room for some improvements:
- list of repositories should be sorted
- when selecting destination using mouse the "Finish" button is only
 activated when moving the focus away from the combo I just used to
 select the destination. Hence I either have to click another combo which
will set another destination I might not want or I have to click the
checkbox twice or hit "Tab" key. I think instead "Finish" button should
be enabled when at least one destination combo has a selected ref.
- I couldn't find a way to set the destination without using the mouse
this should be also possible using keyboard

Patch Set 6:

* I've fixed repository ordering issue
* this seams to be an issue in jface implementation of used widget. Currently I see only two workarounds for this issue, first is to extend org.eclipse.jface.viewers.AbstractComboBoxCellEditor and copy all source code from org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ComboBoxCellEditor and then add required functionality. Or we could extend org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ComboBoxCellEditor and using reflection obtain instance of package comboBox field and then add required implementation
* I don't have any idea how we could solve this issue since jface/swt doesn't solves it for us.
