DESCRIPTION

Improve sorting of FileDiffs

Change FileDiff.PATH_COMPARATOR to group files by directory. Give the
CommitFileDiffViewer a ViewerComparator using PATH_COMPARATOR.

As a result, FileDiffs are grouped by directory, and the order of
diffs in the DifFEditorPage agrees with the order in the
DifFEditorOutlinePage.
