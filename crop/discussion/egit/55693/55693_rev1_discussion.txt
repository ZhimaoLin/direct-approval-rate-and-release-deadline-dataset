DESCRIPTION

Obey configured modifier keys in editable SpellcheckableMessageArea

Only open hyperlinks on direct click in read-only views; in editable
views, this is too confusing and too often opens the hyperlink when the
user just wants to set the caret.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

when the master switch "Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > Hyperlinking" is off hyperlinks should be disabled e.g. in the staging view, but they stay active

I recognized this since I read the discussion in bug 411809 and then tested your fix, if you want you can of course do that in a separate change, I wasn't sure if you left out a fix for this part of the problem by intention
