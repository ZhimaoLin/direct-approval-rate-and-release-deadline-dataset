DESCRIPTION

Fix warning in ui.test's Eclipse class

WorkbenchContentsFinder is xxx@xxx.xxx which results in a
warning by the PDE tooling. The change just inlines the code of
activeWorkbenchWindow, and only executes syncExec once.

Is that in Kepler?. In 4.2.2 there is no warning.

Patch Set 2:

Currently using 3.7 for that workspace. The warning comes from the API tooling. You can also manually go to the source of WorkbenchContentsFinder and see that the class Javadoc xxx@xxx.xxx which is also used in other Eclipse API and means that it should not be created via new, hence the warning.
