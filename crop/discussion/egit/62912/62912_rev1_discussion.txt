DESCRIPTION

Staging view: show progress while refresh and diff are running

Show busy cursor in the staging view as long as the *both* refresh and
index diff jobs are running. Previously only the refresh of resources
was shown, but not the diff which takes much more time.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Takes a large repo to even see that progress bar. On eclipse.platform.ui, I can see it very briefly with this change.
