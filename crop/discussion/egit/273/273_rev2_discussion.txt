DESCRIPTION

Update manifests to use versioned Import-Package or Require-Bundle

Rather than taking anything at random, take the >= 3.4 but less
than 4.0 versions for any Eclipse package, and JGit 0.6.0,0.7.0.
This documents the assumption we are making about targeting the
3.4 API platform for Eclipse, but hopefully working on a forward
release up until 4.0.
