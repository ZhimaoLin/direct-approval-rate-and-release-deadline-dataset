DESCRIPTION

Update manifests to use versioned Import-Package or Require-Bundle

Rather than taking anything at random, take the >= 3.4 but less
than 4.0 versions for any Eclipse package, and JGit 0.6.0,0.7.0.
This documents the assumption we are making about targeting the
3.4 API platform for Eclipse, but hopefully working on a forward
release up until 4.0.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Chris, same deal as in JGit, right?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good, only a couple of nit picks

Line:14, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Does this really need to be 3.8.2? Why not 3.8.0?

Line:9, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this trailing whitespace I see? It's not red, but it looks like it highlighted a trailing space too.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this



Line:14, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Hmm.  Probably doesn't need to be .2.  But its mostly pointless I think.  When we merge SWTBot based tests we have to change this line anyway to [4.0.0,5.0.0) I guess.  Right now our CQ 3589 declared 3.8.2 reuse, so that is what I was sticking with.

Line:9, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Yup.  Its a bug in Gerrit Johnathan Pham.  I've logged it as http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=445
