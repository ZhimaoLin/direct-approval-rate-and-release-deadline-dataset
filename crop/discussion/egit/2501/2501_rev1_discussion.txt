Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

Straight-forward.

Maybe later on we could think about offering to synchronize with an arbitrary commit, like Compare With -> Commit...
But I'm not sure if that is a common use-case.

Patch Set 1:

Synchronizing against particular commits would be a nice feature, but it will require some "paging" or sth. to avoid reading and putting into drop down list of all commits in repository.
