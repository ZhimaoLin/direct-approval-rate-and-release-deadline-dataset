DESCRIPTION

Only show Gerrit menu entries when Gerrit is configured

"Gerrit Configuration..." on a remote node in the repo view is the only
Gerrit menu that's shown when a repo is not configured for Gerrit.

To test whether Gerrit is configured, the following is used:

* Is "gerrit.createchangeid" set to true in Git config?
* Are there any remotes with a push refspec where the destination starts
  with "refs/for/"?
