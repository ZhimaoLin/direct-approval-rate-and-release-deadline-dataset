DESCRIPTION

Rebase: Show dialog in case there are uncommitted changes

JGit now checks if there are uncommitted changes before the rebase is
started. In such a case the user can now choose from a dialog how to
handle this situation.
In a further change we could offer the feature to automatically re-apply
the stashed change after finishing or aborting the rebase.
