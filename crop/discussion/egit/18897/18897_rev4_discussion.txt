DESCRIPTION

Rebase: Show dialog in case there are uncommitted changes

JGit now checks if there are uncommitted changes before the rebase is
started. In such a case the user can now choose from a dialog how to
handle this situation.
In a further change we could offer the feature to automatically re-apply
the stashed change after finishing or aborting the rebase.

Depends on JGit's I1e0b59b2a4d80a686b67a6729e441924362b1236

Patch Set 4:

> The simplest idea I can think of it that we use a fix stash commit message.

That wouldn't work in some special cases, e.g. the following:

1. User starts a rebase from EGit, it saves the uncommitted changes and the rebase stops because of conflicts
2. User aborts the rebase using native Git.
3. Some time passes.
4. User starts another unrelated rebase in EGit, it finishes and the previous stash is applied.

Maybe we would also have to compare whether the stash was against ORIG_HEAD and put the upstream in the commit message or something like that.
