DESCRIPTION

Do not allow rebase if there are uncommitted changes

With this change egit checks for uncommitted changes before a rebase is
started. The user can choose from a dialog how to handle this situation.
In a further change we could offer the feature to automatically re-apply
the stashed change after finishing or aborting the rebase.

Note that this change is done in EGit. Therefore the Pull operation is
not affected.

Line:87, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/AbstractRebaseCommandHandler.java -> I think we should instead better use the IndexDiff which is updated incrementally to feed the staging view, so I think there is no need to recompute this information
