DESCRIPTION

Rebase: Show dialog in case there are uncommitted changes

JGit now checks if there are uncommitted changes before the rebase is
started. In such a case the user can now choose from a dialog how to
handle this situation.
In a further change we could offer the feature to automatically re-apply
the stashed change after finishing or aborting the rebase.

Depends on JGit's I1e0b59b2a4d80a686b67a6729e441924362b1236

Regarding automatically stashing:

Git introduced --[no-]autostash with git 1.8.4 [1]. We should implement this feature in jgit. I'll open a bug for that.
