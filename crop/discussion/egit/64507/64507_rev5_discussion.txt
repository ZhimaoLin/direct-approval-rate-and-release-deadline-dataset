Patch Set 5:

What's up now? The build succeeded, but Hudson didn't report back here, and didn't send an e-mail either. That seems unrelated to this change.

Patch Set 5:

The build failure on PS 4[1] shows that the prefs are indeed taken into account now (unused import is an error and ails the build).

The build success on PS 5[2] shows that warnings are indeed suppressed. (See console log)

The console log of PS 2[3] shows all these warnings.

So this does what I had intended.

Patch Set 5:

To clarify: for me, having the warnings in the console output would also be OK. It's just that there are a lot of spurious ones, like "... new Git(...)" leading to a resource leak warning, or warnings due to null-annotations. Until JDT can properly deal with multiple null-annotations from different sources, we probably can't get a zero-warnings build.
