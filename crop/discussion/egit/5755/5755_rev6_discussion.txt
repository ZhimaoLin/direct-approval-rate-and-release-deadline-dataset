DESCRIPTION

[sync] Use IndexDiffFilter instead of ANY_DIFF

ANY_DIFF filter used in WorkingTreeChangeCache doesn't consider
core.filemode option which leads to different results comparing to
native git status command. Replacing it with IndexDiffFilter solves
this issue

@Matthias,
After change file mode or or core.filemode setting you need to rerun synchronization. I've test this now and before and it should work, at least under linux
