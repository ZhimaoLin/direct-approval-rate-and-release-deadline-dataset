DESCRIPTION

Use all available space in RebaseInteractiveView

This resolves a TODO in RebaseInteractiveView: if the dynamic columns
need less space than available horizontally, there will be be a large
unused empty space at the right. Can happen if the view is wide, or
commit messages are short, or for instance also in the view is opened
without input (just open it via the quick access).

The solution is to redistribute all available space after pack() using
a TreeColumnLayout with ColumnWeightData and the sizes obtained after
packing.

As a result, the table uses at least all the available horizontal space
and may (as before) use more if the columns don't fit (which then gives
a horizontal scroll bar, also as before).

Not quite ready for submit yet; can be still improved a little.

Line:493, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/RebaseInteractiveView.java -> Note to self: double-check whether this is the right place for this listener. Shouldn't this be on rebasePlanSection instead?

Line:989, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/RebaseInteractiveView.java -> This needs to be factored out into a separate method so that the resize listener can refresh only the planTreeViewer's column layout.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add an implementation note explaining why the resize listener is needed.

Line:493, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/RebaseInteractiveView.java -> Done: turns out this listener isn't needed at all.

Line:989, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/rebase/RebaseInteractiveView.java -> Nope. Not necessary since the resize listener isn't needed at all.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done: turns out it isn't needed at all.
