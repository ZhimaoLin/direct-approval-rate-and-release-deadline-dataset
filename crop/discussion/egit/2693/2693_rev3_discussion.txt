DESCRIPTION

Add OpenWorkingFileAction to context menu of synchronize view

This modifies GitActionContributor to add a OpenWorkingFileAction
to the context menu for an element that also has a compare input
available (i.e. only works on files).  OpenWorkingFileAction
will open Workspace files as normal IFiles but will fallback to
use IFileStore for non-workspace files.
