Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

To be honest I would prefer to have only commit message in change set label, therefore in my opinion this should be configured somewhere (eg. egit preferences) same as date formatting.

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/model/GitModelObjectContainer.java -> I would prefer to have this formatting taken from configuration or at least from locales instead of hard-coding it.
