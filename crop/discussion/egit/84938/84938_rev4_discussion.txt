DESCRIPTION

Be more careful with synchronization in RepositoryCache

Ensure that EGit doesn't use nested locking of the RepositoryCache and
the IndexDiffCache. Otherwise deadlocks can occur between a new
IndexDiffCacheEntry being created and pruning or clearing the
RepositoryCache (lock inversion).

Also ensure that stopping the bundle shuts down in the inverse order
things were started. Stop listeners and cancel and wait for jobs before
shutting down global caches, then shut down down the caches in the
inverse order they were started.
