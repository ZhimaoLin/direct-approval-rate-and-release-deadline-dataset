DESCRIPTION

Add Compare with ours/theirs actions for conflicts

The action's labels change depending on whether it's a merge,
cherry-pick or rebase conflict to provide better labels than the generic
"ours" and "theirs" (which is confusing especially during rebase).

The actions are only available in the Staging view yet, see bug 347835
for the problems with the Compare with/Replace with menus.

I think this would deserve some tests when the implementation is settled

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> I think this should be 2005-2013 I am pretty sure that we touched some texts every year ;-)

Line:526, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CompareUtils.java -> maybe we could throw an IllegalStateException when used with stage 0 ?

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> 2011-2013

Line:719, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> this is called HEAD revision in other menus, we should not use different terms for the same thing in different menus

Line:722, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> these labels are pretty confusing, e.g. when doing a rebase with conflicts I get "Compare with Rebase Version".

what is a current, rebase, cherry-pick, merge version ??? I think we would better give branch name and commit id of the respective commit similar to what we show in the merge tool editor. I think this would be easier to understand

Agreed about the tests.

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> As noted on other change, please see {DATE} here: http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php

Line:719, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Does "ours" always correspond to HEAD? I'm not sure, e.g. during rebase or after applying stash.

Line:722, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Let's discuss this on bug 391856, ok?

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> ok, I wasn't aware that ',' is used to denote a range, very weird

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I learnt that 2011, 2013 means the range

Line:722, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> ok

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

As mentioned in the commit message, the menu entries only appear in the staging view yet. This needs to be reworked, see comments in bug 391856. Abandoning for now to not consume review resources (will keep on working on it though).
