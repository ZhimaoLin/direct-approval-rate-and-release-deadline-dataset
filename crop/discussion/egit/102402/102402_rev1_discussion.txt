As I think only using "Cancel" as button label is misleading, I used "Cancel Commit" for now. Currently, the dialog is only used with a cancel-commit-message, but it may be used with some other message. Maybe we should use a more general button label? "Cancel Operation"?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Now we have two buttons "No" and "Cancel Commit". I find that highly confusing. Either leave at "No"/"Yes", or change both to use verbs. "Proceed with Commit" instead of "No"?

Patch Set 1:

As I already mentioned above, I think it may happen that this dialog is used with an other message. Currently it is only used to cancel a commit, but the java doc of the method indicates, that it can also be used for other operations. To be save, what do you think about button labels "Cancel" and "Proceed"?

Patch Set 1:

This whole dialog is confusing as soon as a button labeled "Cancel" is used. What does that mean?

1. "Cancel the dialog and continue with the operation"
2. "Confirm the dialog and cancel the operation"

Even if it's "Cancel"/"Proceed", it's still unclear. What does "Proceed" mean?

1. "Proceed with the operation"
2. "Proceed with the suggestion", i.e., cancel the operation and let me amend the commit.

Maybe "Yes"/"No" isn't that bad after all...
