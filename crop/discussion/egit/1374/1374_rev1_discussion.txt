DESCRIPTION

Update index when Project is moved

Do the same as was done before when a folder is moved:
Move the index content to the new location. The index then has no
obsolete entries. All moved resources known to the index are marked
as added afterwards and can easily be committed.

There is still an issue that the deletion of the old resources cannot be
committed from egit (bug 302349). This applies also to the deletion of
projects and is not fixed by this commit.
