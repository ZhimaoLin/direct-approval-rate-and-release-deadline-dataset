DESCRIPTION

New Extension Point in CommitDialog

With this new Extension Point, any other plugin can extend EGit and
provide a commit message, that will be inserted in the commit message
textfield in the CommitDialog. If there are multiple extensions, the
commit messages are stringed together, separated with a newline.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

While this is a basic functional patch, there is still some work to do: Since i am new to EGit contributing and coding, i am not sure, how to handle exceptions correctly, so i would appreciate your feedback about this.

This is the step in the right direction. We may want to consider making this a bit more advance... involving hooks that allow people to modify the commit message... and do something after a commit...

Patch Set 1:

I think extensions shouldn't be able to break the commit dialog, hence if they throw exceptions we should fallback to the un-extended commit dialog to ensure that this important dialog also works if buggy extensions are hooked on.

Yeah we should also provide hooks, but I feel this should somehow involve jgit, since we may also want to have the ability to install hooks on jgit level if jgit is used in a different context than EGit.

I also agree with Matthias that possible JGit hooks and EGit built-in-extensions like the commit-id handling, should be included.

An extensive example may be needed to work out the interfaces.

Line:464, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> 1) I think the extension should be able to manipulate the message in any way, not just append to it.

2) Do not append a line separator if one is already present.

3) At this level we might want the platform neutral line separator. We want that in the final commit message, so do not assume we know anything about how the dialog represents the message internally, My suspision is that extensions are likely to get this wrong if we require the use of the platform line separator.
