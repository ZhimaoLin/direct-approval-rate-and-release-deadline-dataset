DESCRIPTION

Clean up titles used in compare views

Some were showing the 40 character hash, some were showing "1a2b3c4...".
Change it to show just "1a2b3c4" as in other places. The title isn't a
good place to show the full hash because there's no way to copy it.

Also remove unnecessary "'" around hashes, it's just noise.
