Line:107, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DeleteBranchOperation.java -> StringBuffer is so 1900-ish. and adding the ", " is I think
cleaner if you add it conditionally

The JVM doesn't choose to use StringBuilder(not StringBuffer). It is the 
compiler that add StringBuilder for common (non-loop) String concatenations.

The JVM could possibly do it (since it is allowed to any optimization as long as we cannot tell), but as far as I know, it still doesn't.

StringBuilder was intriduced in Java5

Line:107, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DeleteBranchOperation.java -> StringBuilder is preferable over StringBuffer
