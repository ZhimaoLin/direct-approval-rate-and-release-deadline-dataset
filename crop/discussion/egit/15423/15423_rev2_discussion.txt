easier.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

- I'd prefer to keep the "Fetch from Gerrit..." and "Push to Gerrit..." actions on the top level of the repositories view's context menu since I use them really often. The team menu in the package explorer has more entries since it also has all the actions relating to the selected project that's why we pushed some more actions one level down. We could decide to only show the Gerrit menu entries if the selected repository is configured for Gerrit (gerrit.createchangeid = true or a push refspec containing "refs/for" are good indicators) using "Gerrit configuration..."
- in contrast I never use "Pull" (but others maybe use it often ;-)
- I feel that "Clean..." could go in the same section with "Garbage collection", "Remove repository", "Delete repository" since all of them do something about cleanup

Patch Set 2:

Ok, see parent changes, they hide the Gerrit menu entries if it's not configured.

I often use pull, but from the toolbar.

> I feel that "Clean..." could go in the same section with "Garbage collection", "Remove repository", "Delete repository" since all of them do something about cleanup

Yes, that would make the menu smaller. I didn't do it in this change series as it's already painful enough to rebase (conflicts plugin.xml).

By the way, do you know what the problem with Hudson is (again)?
