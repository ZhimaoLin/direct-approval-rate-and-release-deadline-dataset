DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Move additional push/fetch menu items to "Remote" submenu

In the team menu, these entries are also in a "Remote" submenu. The
menus should be organized in a similar way to make finding things
easier.

The Gerrit menu items stay where they are as they may be frequently used
and due to change Ie1f1d5df9a3989b32a1b892c6275615e1ddfb01b, they are
only shown when Gerrit is configured.
