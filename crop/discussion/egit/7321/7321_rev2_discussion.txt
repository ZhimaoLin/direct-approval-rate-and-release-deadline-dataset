DESCRIPTION

Continue checkout after removal of uncommitted changes

When a checkout conflict occurs a dialog is presented to the user. From
here different actions can be triggered to remove the uncommitted
changes: commit, stash and reset.

With this commit the checkout is triggered again after one of the
operations above have been performed successfully.
