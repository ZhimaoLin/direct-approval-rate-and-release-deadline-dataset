DESCRIPTION

[sync] Make synchronization 14 times faster

Speedups workspace model performance by getting information about
change type from git instead of computing it in default SyncInfo
implementation.

Now comparing Linux kernel sources (2.6.38-rc2 against 2.6.36) takes (on
my machine) less then 10s (usually about 7s), comparing to 1m 40s from
EGit 1.0 this change gives 14x boost to synchronize view.

Also fixes some issues in UI tests.
