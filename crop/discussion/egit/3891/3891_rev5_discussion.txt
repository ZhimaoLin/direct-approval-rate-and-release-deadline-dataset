DESCRIPTION

[sync] Make synchronization 14 times faster

Speedups workspace model performance by getting information about
change type from git instead of computing it in default SyncInfo
implementation.

Now comparing Linux kernel sources (2.6.38-rc2 against 2.6.36) takes (on
my machine) less then 10s (usually about 7s), comparing to 1m 40s from
EGit 1.0 this change gives 14x boost to synchronize view.

Also fixes some issues in UI tests.

Line:27, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/ThreeWayDiffEntry.java -> would it make sense to use null instead to save a couple of 40 byte SHA1 objects in memory (with large repos you'll create many ThreeWayDiffEntries). I analyzed a heap dump taken after running the example you described. I found that the ThreeWayDiffEntries weigh around 500 byte, many seem to have only one ID really set and two set to A_ZERO which eats 80 byte for every entry.
