and/or commits by multiple authors. The new columns and the commit
message column are automatically resized now to match their contents'
widths.

nice improvement :)

I propose to
- show relative dates (easier to read and needs less space) or add an option to switch the format like done in the history view
- either show both author and committer information or show commit date instead of author date since that gives the time when this commit was last updated which IMO is more interesting than the authoring date

Line:749, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIText.java -> style nit: trailing whitespace
