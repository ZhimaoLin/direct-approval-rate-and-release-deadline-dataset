DESCRIPTION

GitFileHistory should return the full history of its target.

When using GitFileHistoryProvider.getFileHistoryFor(IResource,...), a
user expects the full history of the target resource to be returned,
except if the SINGLE_REVISION or SINGLE_LINE_OF_DESCENT flags are
positionned.

The SINGLE_REVISION flag is properly handled, however when no flags are
set, EGit previously returned only the commits descending from HEAD,
without considering the history that exists on other branches or
references.

This adds specific tests to make sure of the behavior when either no
flag or the SINGLE_REVISION flag are set.

The SINGLE_LINE_OF_DESCENT flag remains to be handled.

Patch Set 4:

There is absolutely no change between patch set 4 and patch set 3... this push was not intended. Sorry about that. But since I am at it: any news about this change? I don't think there were more missing actions from my side here (other than extracting methods for JGit... but I believe this will be another change?)
