There is some coding in jgit for determining the remote tracking branch. Please check if it can be used here.

Line:37, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/MergeTargetSelectionDialog.java -> Could we maybe reuse jgit's BranchConfig.getRemoteTrackingBranch() here?

Line:37, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/MergeTargetSelectionDialog.java -> I don't think so since it currently doesn't handle getting the upstream branch when it is another local branch which is the case when the remote config is "."

Line:37, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/MergeTargetSelectionDialog.java -> Ah, I see; and in the use-case where BranchConfig.getRemoteTrackingBranch() is used (show branch status) we behave like native git - only show branch status relative to remote branches.
