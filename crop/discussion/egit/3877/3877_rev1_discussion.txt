MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:78, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/model/GitModelObjectContainer.java -> Btw.: By using the parent here in the case of a change in the index the compare editor will show HEAD~1 on the right hand side instead of HEAD. I'll reopen Bug 326674 which had addressed this issue.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Are you sure that the NullPointer is related to the fact that a file is deleted? I also get it in other cases.
