DESCRIPTION

Warn user if Git's system wide settings cannot be found

A Git user may have important settings in the system wide configuration
file. That file is located relative to Git's installation directory.
Egit
tries to find that file automatically by looking for the git executable.
If Git cannot be found then EGit also cannot find the system wide
settings.

In order to stay compatible with Git, in particulary on Windows, where
Git
may not appear in %PATH%, it is important that the user gets notified
that
there may be a problem. The most important setting is typically
core.autocrlf.
