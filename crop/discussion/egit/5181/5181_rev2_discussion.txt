DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Dispose SWTCommitList when replaced or discarded

GitHistoryPage and CommitGraphTable now both call dispose
on the generated SWTCommitList when it is either set as the
input or unused when the job completes after the view has
already been disposed.

The SWTCommitList holds 20-30 colors which would be leaked on
each input update without these new calls to dispose.
