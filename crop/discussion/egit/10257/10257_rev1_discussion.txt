Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)

works nicely, I think the method names could be improved

apart from this improvement the vertical margins around the checkbox when called from "Import Projects" in the repositories view could be distributed more evenly

Line:529, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> maybe better s/restoreWidgetValues/restoreWidgetSettings/

Line:538, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> maybe better s/saveWidgetValues/saveWidgetSettings/

See inline comments.

For the margins: I agree, but don't know how to fix it, see bug 400202. Also, it's probably better to do this in a separate commit.

Line:529, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> The names are the sames as in WizardProjectsImportPage (from org.eclipse.ui.ide), where most of the code of this class was copied from. What do you think, keep them or change them?

Line:538, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> Same as above.
