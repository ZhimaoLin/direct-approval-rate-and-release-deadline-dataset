DESCRIPTION

Use fast ProjectUtil.findContainer:w instead of slow Eclipse call

The IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI call is dead slow, so
rather use code that calculates containers based on patch comparison,
which is way faster.

Patch Set 7: Do not submit

findContainer does not find folders, so this does not work
