DESCRIPTION

Use ProjectUtil.findContainerFast instead of slow Eclipse call

The IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI call is dead slow, so
rather use code that calculates containers based on patch comparison,
which is way faster.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

argh.... i'm slightly out of ideas. this one destroys a lot of unit tests now.

everything i tried to make it faster failed - maybe some of you have another idea i could try?
