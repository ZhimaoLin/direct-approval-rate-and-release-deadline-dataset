DESCRIPTION

Only calculate containing resources for directories with .project

It should be save to do expensive checks on whether the given directory
belongs to a shared project only in the root of a project (determined by
looking for .project).

If it is, the iterator will be converted, if not, the expensive checks
will not be done for each subdirectory.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

need a better idea for this; it breaks the AddOperationTest (and the test is right ;))
