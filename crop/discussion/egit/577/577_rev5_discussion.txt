DESCRIPTION

Add preliminary synchronization support within Eclipse for branches.

Implements synchronization participants and resource variants for
allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronization can be launched for project's context menu by 'Team ->
Synchronize with...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context
menu.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I tried the following:
- created fresh clone of jgit repo using git repositories view
- import all jgit projects
- select Synchronize with... from a jgit project's context menu

- the dialog talks about selecting source and destination, but there is only one row which looks like remote and branch selection. Is this source or destination ? Where can I select the other one ?

- select origin (left combo) and master (right combo)
- pressing ok has no effect

- changed some files in this jgit project and save them to disk
- try again select origin master, again pressing ok has no effect

- commit these changes and try again, again no effect

- trying with origin stable-0.7 seems to work

- didn't we agree on having just one menu entry "Synchronize..." for now ? I think if the synchronize dialog remembers the settings from the last run this is completely sufficient.

- settings in synchronize dialog marked with checkbox "default" are not remembered when reopening the dialog

It seems I do not fully understand how to use the dialog, could you provide some hints about its usage ...

Line:713, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> better:
Select which branch or tag to use as source and which one as destination.

Misleading in dialog message is caused because I've forgot to change it after I decide to resign for letting select source branch/tag. Right now I've updated the message and it should be more suitable for current situation.

> - select origin (left combo) and master (right combo)

Fixed.

Changed.

> - settings in synchronize dialog marked with checkbox "default" are not remembered when reopening the dialog

To be honest I don't know where and how can I save that information. Could you please refer me to some documentation or HOWOT's how (and where) that data should be saved.

> It seems I do not fully understand how to use the dialog, could you provide some hints about its usage ...

Apart from that issue with 'master' branch, using 'synchronize dialog' should be very simple, just select repository name and ref name which one you want to synchronize and click 'OK'.

btw. There is also an option to launch synchronization form 'Repositories view'. In this case you should select 'Synchronize' from context menu for branch. This option is only available when there is existing project in workspace that is associated with that particular repository.
