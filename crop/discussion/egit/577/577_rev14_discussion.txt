DESCRIPTION

Add preliminary synchronization support within Eclipse for branches.

Implements synchronization participants and resource variants for
allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronization can be launched for project's context menu by 'Team ->
Synchronize...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context menu.

In 'Synchronize repository' dialog user can choose source and
destination branch (or tag). He can also define does local uncommited
changes should be included in 'Synchronize view'.

Patch Set 14:

Yes now it is time for next iteration (and fixing unit test for this one ;)). Before it will be merged into master it should be merge it with latest Willow Cantrell Repositories view so that we can launch synchronize for Repositories view context menu.

I'll do that today evening and push it once again.
