DESCRIPTION

allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronize...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context menu.

In 'Synchronize repository' dialog user can choose source and
destination branch (or tag). He can also define does local uncommited
changes should be included in 'Synchronize view'.
