DESCRIPTION

Add preliminary synchronization support within Eclipse for branches.

Implements synchronization participants and resource variants for
allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronization can be launched for project's context menu by 'Team ->
Synchronize...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context menu.

In 'Synchronize repository' dialog user can choose source and
destination branch (or tag). He can also define does local uncommited
changes should be included in 'Synchronize view'.

IMHO this should be transformed into a patch series:
- refactoring of existing swtbot tests
- synchronize view implementation
- new swtbot test for synchronize view

Otherwise this change is getting larger and larger and afterwards it will be hard to understand the history.

Let me know if you need help to split this up into a patch series.

Patch Set 8:

Right now for me I'll prefer to keep this together because it will be easier to maintain changes in both area (synchronization view implementation and utnit test case). But then when sync-view will be ready for integration I can split it into 3 patch sets.
Is this approach also fine by you ?

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/wizards/synchronize/SynchronizeViewTest.java -> Yes, it is a copy-paste issue ...
