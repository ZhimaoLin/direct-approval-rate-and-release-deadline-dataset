Sorry, couldn't get the commit-msg hook working (it didn't want to take my password for whatever reason). I'll correct the commit message next time.

See bug 309582 for details about the patch.

Good job!

Doing 'Compare With > Git Index' for each particular file was also for me very annoying. Because that I've proposed this as a part of my GSoC project. Right now the situation is slightly different, thanks to you, there is basic support for "Synchronization view", but there are also thing that could be improved! Maybe we can work together on that improvements ?

Right now, from a quick overview, I've noticed that there is no support for actions like:
* Update
* Overwrite and Update
* Mark as merged

in right-click menu of "Synchronization view". That actions are very usable in day to day development, specially in Git where you must merge changes locally on your own.

I've noticed that you mentioned in bugzilla bug report that you haven't bothered with right-click menu option to call synchronize action. IMHO this is huge disadvantage because it takes me some time to find out how this awesome new feature can used. If I didn't have source code (especially plugin.xml file) I'll never figure out where it is localizated. So this is quite huge disadvantage right now.

One more thing, commit dialog. When I choose "Commit" in "Synchronization view" on a single file, commit action want to commit all changed files. But this rather know bug (304131).

Anyway it is nice to have this feature! Maybe we can slit up some task and work in parallel?

Dariusz, could you put your comment on the bug directly instead of here on Gerrit? There are parties CC'd on the bug that I think may have some input into this feature. I'd prefer keeping the discussions on this particular Gerrit change purely technical.

Good progress, a couple things that help...

1) missing Change-Id: in commit...
2) missing Bug: in commit...

Let's focus on small steps instead of a gigantic patch. We can always iterate.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

1. I open the Synchronize Wizard.
2. Select synchronize. Then Git.
3. I get a dialog with two repos for Egit and Jgit and their projects. The branches column is empty.

No combination of selection of repository/project enables Next or Finish

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

IndexOutOfBoundException when I try to delete an entry in the branch column. Afterwards the dialog is not functionable anymore.

The precondition for enabling "Finish" that the same number of branches must be selected as repositories is not very usable. There could be the default "HEAD" for the selected repos.

What should I do about this change? Should I just abandon it? As Dariusz has been accepted into Google's Summer of Code program, I see no reason for me to work on this. >:)

I would prefer to get some minimum level of functionality in with the work you have done already and then have Dariusz continue hacking on it.

Patch Set 1:

Well, Dariusz can either a) continue from where I left off, perhaps by fixing/investigating the bug Stefan hit and evaluating the usability issues of the wizard for starters, or b) rewrite it all from scratch, using my code as a reference (or not).

I'll let Dariusz and Matthis S decide what to do here.

Frankly, I don't really care what happens to this code. My main goal was to quickly hack together something and try to understand what the 'Synchronize' view means in the context of Git and to get people thinking about this feature. I'm happy with the resulting discussions we've been having (and hopefully will continue to have) on bug 309582 so far so I've fulfilled my own objectives for submitting this change set as far as I'm concerned. :)

Patch Set 1:

My concern was to simply have a synchronize view that is as functional as possible for 0.8.0 in June.

Patch Set 1:

I'm agree with Chris, we should get 'Synchronization View' support as soon as it is possible. I'll prefer move on with Remy's changes when I finish working on tagging support. IMHO there is no need to rewrite this right now especially when we want to have this feature in 0.8.0.

Patch Set 1:

Great.

Two observations:
Wouldn't we rather use two-way compare for synchronizing with HEAD?

When we compare with another branch (or tag, or commit), I would suppose that we use the common ancestor commit as base and do also a comparison of the contents of the blobs.

Line:508, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> This seems to be the wrong class, it should be GitBranchSubscriberParticipant.

Interestingly enough this works now with any String for this attribute. Do you know when this would be used?

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitBranchResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java -> When I compare against another branch or commit, shouldn't that point to the common ancestor commit?

Patch Set 1:

Stefan, when I did a two-way compare for HEAD, I couldn't get the decorations working as well as I would've liked.

As to your second comment, you're right, that does sound like the right way to do it. I'm not sure why that didn't occur to me but oh well. :o

Patch Set 1:

Sorry Stefan, I didn't realize you had left comments. I've inlined a response to your plugin.xml comment.

Line:508, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I believe this is for "regenerating" the subscriber upon startup. You can see below at the moment I have set the 'persistent' value to 'false'. If it was 'true', then it would be possible for a user to synchronize without going through the wizard. In that case, the framework would have to instantiate the class spec'd here manually through reflection I believe.

Dariusz, now that tagging is done are you going to look at this?

Patch Set 1:

To be hones, before I'll move to this task I want to implement some unit test for tagging and after that I'll continue Remy's work.

I think that before next Monday I'll send patches with test for tagging and then I'll move to this one.

But if this patch set has higher priority than junits I can change my plans.

Patch Set 1:

If you're referring to ui tests for tagging, I'd vote this feature having a higher priority than those tests.

-------------------------------------

Patch Set 1:

Not only UI tests but also junits for TagOperation.

But, yest it seams more reasonable to have both features (tagging and synchronization view  without test) in 0.8.0 than have only tagging support with unit tests

Patch Set 1:

I'm generally pragmatic with this and think the features outweigh the tests in this case. Hell, I'd even write the tests s you can focus on the synchronize view :)

Patch Set 1:

OK, I've hope that my mentor has same attitude for this case as you ;)

So I'm switching to this task ;> first of all I'll merge it with current head, add Bug id and Change-Id to commit message and work on mentioned IndexOutOfBoundException
