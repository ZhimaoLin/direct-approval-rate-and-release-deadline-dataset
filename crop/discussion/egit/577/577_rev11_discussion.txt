DESCRIPTION

Add preliminary synchronization support within Eclipse for branches.

Implements synchronization participants and resource variants for
allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronization can be launched for project's context menu by 'Team ->
Synchronize...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context menu.

In 'Synchronize repository' dialog user can choose source and
destination branch (or tag). He can also define does local uncommited
changes should be included in 'Synchronize view'.

Patch Set 11: No score

Integration with Synchronize view isn't fully useful. There are some features that should be implemented (eg. comparing proper files in Compare view, grouping changes by commit etc.), but IMHO we can stat IP process for this patch set, because in other case it will be growing in infinite.
