One question to ask is when do we want to do the initial CQ for this? I think it's easier to get what we have when it reaches an acceptable level and then just iterate in <250 line patches to avoid the CQ switch.

What do people think?

Line:531, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Strange indentation here

Line:43, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitFolderResourceVariant.java -> No need for the *31 here.

Line:257, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTree.java -> // TODO or actually nothing "to do" here

Line:65, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitResourceVariantComparator.java -> I think you should close the stream, both for the normal case, as well as for errors (finally)

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

It's not yet clear to me what I can do with this change. I didn't find a way to get finish or next button enabled (seems Robin has the same question).

Remy: any specific reason why you don't want to put your name under contributor but IBM instead ? If I remember correctly the legal team explained that the contributor section in the license header is meant to give credits to the developers which did all the hard work.

Line:90, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitBlobResourceVariant.java -> what is this commented out code good for ? Is this a TODO ?

Matthias, this is the way all my coworkers sign our source code. IBM owns the copyright to the code, not me. I've never been told to put my own name in it. Just look at any random Eclipse source file and you will find IBM at the top.

Remy: ok, I understand, IBM is doing it this way
that's just lack of experience from my side ;-)

Patch Set 3:

I wouldn't call it that. :) Personally, I've seen files with people's name and files with company names. It's caught my eye but I've never bothered to ask anyone about it. This is the first time I've been personally asked about my source code. ;)

Done with comments.

I'll push new patch set when we agree on context menu action for invoking 'synchronization view' (see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=309582#c18" target="_blank">309582#18</a>)

Line:90, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitBlobResourceVariant.java -> When we return getResource().getFullPath() 'Compare editor' opens without our changes (it means that file that we want to review i owerwritten with base one).

I've removed that comments.
