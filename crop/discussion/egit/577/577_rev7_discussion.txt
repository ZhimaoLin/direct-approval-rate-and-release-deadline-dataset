DESCRIPTION

Add preliminary synchronization support within Eclipse for branches.

Implements synchronization participants and resource variants for
allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronization can be launched for project's context menu by 'Team ->
Synchronize...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context menu.

In 'Synchronize repository' dialog user can choose source and
destination branch (or tag). He can also define does local uncommited
changes should be included in 'Synchronize view'.

Patch Set 7: No score

This patch set contains fixes for synchronization with tags and minor fixes in localizations.
It also contains two new features:
* user can select with branch should be treat as source and with one as destination
* using 'synchronize with' dialog user can define does local uncommited/unstaged changes should be shown in synchronization view or not. Local changes are always hidden when synchronization is launched from 'repositories view' or 'synchronize wizard'

Things that I've plan to include in next patch set:
* I've notice that for some reasons in synchronize view are included files that doesn't differs, this needs to be investigated and fixed.
* add grouping changes in commits in synchronization view so that we can merge changes on commit level.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I did a first quick try (will do more testing tomorrow) with a test copy of jgit, 
added some local commits to it and then ran synchronize to compare
local/HEAD against origin/master, 
that hit the following NPE:

org.eclipse.team.core.TeamException: An internal error occurred processing subscriber events.

Some tests would be helpful. It's hard for others that find a bug to do any form of regression test it since it is hard to know what to test.

Patch Set 7:

@Matthias:
This NPE is one of issues that 'should never happen' ;) I've already fix it. Should I push this small change to gerrit ?

@Robin:
Good point! This is quite huge change and we can have many strange issues and regressions. I'll start working on test coverage for this part today.
