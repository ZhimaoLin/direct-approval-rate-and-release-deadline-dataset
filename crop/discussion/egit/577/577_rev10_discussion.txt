DESCRIPTION

Add preliminary synchronization support within Eclipse for branches.

Implements synchronization participants and resource variants for
allowing clients to synchronize Eclipse resources against the Git
index and a given branch.

Synchronization can be launched for project's context menu by 'Team ->
Synchronize...' and from 'Repositories View' from branch context menu.

In 'Synchronize repository' dialog user can choose source and
destination branch (or tag). He can also define does local uncommited
changes should be included in 'Synchronize view'.

Patch Set 10: No score

This patch set contains JUnits for GitSyncInfo.calculateKind() and GitResourceVariantComparator.compare().

I've test it and synchronize view should proper decorate changes that are incoming, outgoing, addition, deletion and conflicts. But there are no changes in compare view (when we exclude local changes), this is because compare view takes local file to compare instead of taking one from Git. This should be fixed ... but for now I don't know how to do it, any suggestions ?

Tomorrow I'll try to split up this change into at least two patch sets. First will contain refactored UI tests, second will contain rest of changes ... maybe I'll split it into next two patch set one with synchronization view feature and one with test cases for previous feature. Then I think I'll "fight" ;) with compare view ...
