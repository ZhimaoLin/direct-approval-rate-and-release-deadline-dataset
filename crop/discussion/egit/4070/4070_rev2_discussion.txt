DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Remove mnemonic definitions

Having mnemonics defined for controls inside a part means that
the user cannot use accelerators to access the menu items in
the window's main menu bar. The 'History' view's controls should
not define mnemonics as they may conflict with any definitions
defined in the main menu bar.
