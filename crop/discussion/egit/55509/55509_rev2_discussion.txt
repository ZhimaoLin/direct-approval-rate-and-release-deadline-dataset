DESCRIPTION

Rewrite CommitMessageViewer to use JFace

The goal is to get the commit message viewer in the git history view to
use the same (configurable) hyperlink colors and other hyperlink
infrastructure as the SpellcheckableMessageArea. This is complicated by
two things:

* custom hyperlinks to commits with custom opening, and
* no clear model-view separation; getting the data from git,
  formatting, and coloring were all lumped together.

Therefore, improve the model-view separation:

* Get rid of hand-crafted SWT text range coloring. CommitInfoBuilder is
  restricted to getting the data from the repo, formatting, and
  returning semantic information (hyperlinks, header and footer
  ranges). It doesn't do syntax-coloring anymore.
* CommitMessageViewer uses a partitioning on its document to split it
  logically into header, body, and footer. It also gets a custom
  hyperlink detector to deal with the custom commit hyperlinks.
* GitHistoryPage uses a presentation reconciler with damager/repairers
  that know how to syntax-color each partition (and hyperlinks).
* Made the HyperlinkTokenScanner a bit more flexible to rebuild the
  italicizing of Signed-off-by footer lines. Fixed a bug along the way
  (if "fill paragraphs" was on, it would put footer lines onto one
  line).

Visually, there are no changes except the colors of hyperlinks, which
now follow SpellcheckableMessageArea and are configurable.
