DESCRIPTION

Update visibility of Staging View rebase section after rebase command
runs

When one of the Staging View rebase buttons is clicked and the operation
completes, automatically update the visibility of the rebase section so
it is not necessary to click Refresh to make it go away.

I could not reproduce your problem here (aborting a conflicting rebase refreshed the view automatically). Could you describe how to reproduce this?

Interesting.  Are you testing with HEAD (after the 7a6dcb4 - "Refactoring to reuse rebase commands" commit)?  I see the problem when I do this:

1.  Show repository in Staging View.
2.  From command line start an interactive rebase and leave it in progress.
3.  Click Refresh in Staging View, making rebase section visible.
4.  Click Abort in Staging View.  The rebase section remains visible after.
5.  Click Refresh again.  Now the rebase section is no longer visible.

The instructions are still not clear to me. Here's what I tried:

* on egit master (abe2822), start a rebase: git rebase -i "HEAD^"
* in the editor, change "pick" to "edit", so rebase will stop
* in Eclipse, make sure the staging view is refreshed
* click "Abort"

After the last step, EGit shows a message "Rebase was aborted" and the staging view buttons are no longer visible (as expected).

Try doing the same thing, except once in the editor just close your Git Bash window without saving or quitting the editor.  When I do this, clicking Abort from Staging View will clean it up, but will not refresh the rebase section visibility.  I guess this is more of an edge case than I'd realized and can probably just be closed.

Patch Set 1:

I see, the problem is that the rebase hasn't even been started yet, and therefore aborting it only changes the repository state, but not the index diff nor refs.

Hm, I'm not sure what to do. I don't like firing refschanged for all commands, as it results in unnecessary work in IndexDiffCacheEntry.
