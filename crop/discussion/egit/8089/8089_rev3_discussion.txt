Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

1) The dialogs are gone but there are still preferences that refer to dialogs and which are checked by the current code. Either those must also go away or be renamed and moved elsewhere (and then mentioned in the log message). If they are removed, then we need another way to make sure that I don't get those warnings on every startup.

2) The warnings are still cryptic to me. For example one says: "EGit does not require Git to function, but there may be important settings". How should I know whether this applies? Shouldn't EGit know what it needs? The message should more explicitly say what's going wrong if I ignore that. I run EGit for over a year now and could not detect any problems. See also bug 390888 where another user reports a problem with that message.

3) The following constant needs to be removed as it is no longer used (logs a warning):
ConfigurationChecker_checkHomeDirectory
