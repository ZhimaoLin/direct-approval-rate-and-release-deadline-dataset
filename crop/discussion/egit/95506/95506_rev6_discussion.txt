Patch Set 6:

shouldn't the p2.inf be added to build.properties? You can check the resulting p2 metadata in target after build to see whether the p2.inf directives were processed.

Line:5, org.eclipse.egit-feature/p2.inf -> I thought this should go into the p2.inf of the smartimport bundle, not here in the feature!

If p2 doesn't go look for optional bundles that were not explicitly selected by the user, might it work if the smartimport bundle was included as a sub-feature?

Line:5, org.eclipse.egit-feature/p2.inf -> All right; tried a number of things:

* with/without metaRequirements: no difference.
* only the requires here: egit.ui.smartimport bundle wasn't even in the update site
* with a separate fragment for smartimport, included in egit-feature and marked as optional: bundle is in the updatesite, but doesn't get installed. Feature is also there, but not show in categories.

I have no idea how to get this to work.
