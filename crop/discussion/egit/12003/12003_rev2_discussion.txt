DESCRIPTION

Local files should remain editable when synchronizing.

We can't wrap WorkspaceFileRevisions within FileRevisionTypedElements
since those are not editable.

Sure thing.

* I am the author of 100% of the code I am contributing,
* I own the copyright on the code I am contributing,
* I have the right to contibute this content to Eclipse under the terms of the EPL.

As mentionned, removing any mention of ResourceDiffCompareInput seems impractical. We would pretty much need a copy paste of that class only to get access to one of its setters. An easier solution might be to ask for this class to be made public.
