Patch Set 1:

Well, it was an attempt. At least it gets rid of some warnings at the start of the build.

The build fails because that SWTBot test in EasymportWizardTest fails.
Also doesn't run locally for me.

Line:60, org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer.tests/pom.xml -> the version should be pinned in the parent pom.xml's pluginManagement section, some of the other test modules pin the version in the module's pom.xml, this should be removed and replaced by pinning the version in the parent pom.xml. This will ensure that we use the same version across all modules consistently

this swtbot test seems to be instable, for me it succeeded in the builds I did while releasing 4.0.2

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> That's what I then discovered, too. Anyway, in build 7609 maven loudly warns about this missing version at the beginning of the log. That's fixed by this change. I can rephrase the commit message, if you want.

In some other comment here you mentioned that the version actually should be removed from some other test bundles' poms. I suspect maven will then complain again. It's unclear to me what the way forward should be:

1. abandon this change. (I'm not going to fiddle with other poms.)
2. the change is basically right but needs rephrasing of the commit message.

Please advise.

That SWTBot tests can be unstable is well known to me -- we've fought years against that. It's a major nuisance, and it's not easy to write stable SWTbot tests. Which is why I avoid them like the plague and try to test as much as I can in other ways.
