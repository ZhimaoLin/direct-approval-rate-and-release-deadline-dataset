DESCRIPTION

Calculate FileDiff correctly for merge commits

After 7445a9123e5a the FileDiff was not calculated correctly because
DiffEntry does not support walks with more than one tree. This lead
among others to the fact that the wrong content was displayed 
on double clicking the entry in the file list.

Patch Set 1: IP review completed

When I click with compare mode off, I get the merged content which appears correct. However, if compare mode is on, then nothing happens at all... Is this the intended behavior?
