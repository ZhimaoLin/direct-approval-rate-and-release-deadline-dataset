DESCRIPTION

Can not delete git project

Bug: 395488
Steps to reproduce:
- ensure the Git decorator is enabled
- import a project to Eclipse using the Import Project from Git wizard
- try to delete the project including its contents
Deleting will fail
- delete the project without its contents

> RepositoryProvider.getProvider(project) instanceof GitProvider

This isn't necessary. We can call GitProjectData.reconfigureWindowCache() when ever a project is deleted.

Patch Set 5:

Why call reconfigureWindowCache (which does extra work) for all project deletions? It should only be necessary for Git-managed projects, right?
