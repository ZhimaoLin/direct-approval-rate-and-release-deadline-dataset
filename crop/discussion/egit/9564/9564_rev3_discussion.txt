Patch Set 3:

It's irrelevant if your a committer on another Eclipse project.

Just follow point 4. in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions#Gerrit and copy the 3 questions as a comment here and assert them here.

Wrap this like we've done with registerAutoShareProjects

Line:197, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Wrap this one too. (do we need it?. We don't do it fror AutoShareProjects. Maybe we should (separate change).
