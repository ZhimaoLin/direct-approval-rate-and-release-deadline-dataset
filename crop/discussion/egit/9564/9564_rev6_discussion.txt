Patch Set 6:

Couldn't we skip reconfiguration of the window cache if the repository's .git directory isn't on the same level or underneath the project's directory ?

e.g. my repository "foo" may contain many projects located below a common root directory:

 - foo
     |_ .git
     |_ projectA
     |    |_ .project
     |    |_ src
     |    ...
     |_ projectB
          |_ .project
          ...

Does this case really hit your problem ? Pack files are below .git directory so they shouldn't block deletion of any of the projects.

Usually my workspace contains projects from many git repositories and (if I would work on Windows) I would like to avoid that whenever any project is deleted all these repositories do reconfigureCache unnecessarily.

I can't try here since I am using a Mac.
