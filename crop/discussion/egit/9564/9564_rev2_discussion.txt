Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check in

as I already mentioned in an earlier comment:

we need you to assert the contribution questions required for every contribution by Eclipse IP policy as a comment on this review, see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Legal_Paperwork

Failing UI tests also fail without this change
