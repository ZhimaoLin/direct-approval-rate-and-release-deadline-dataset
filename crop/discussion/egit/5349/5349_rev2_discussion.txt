DESCRIPTION

Preemptively close missing projects when switching branches

Perform a tree walk looking for projects that differ between
the current branch, target branch, and working directory and
close any projects not available on target branch before
checkout begins.

Reopened projects are now also refreshed after being opened
in order to keep the Eclipse resource model in sync with the
working directory changes.
