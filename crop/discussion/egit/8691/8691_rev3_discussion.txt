DESCRIPTION

Perform synchronization for logical models in Commit and History View

When comparing files in the history (or commit) view which are part of a
logical model all relevant changes to all relevant files must be viewed
together. Thus a synchronization will be performed if the system is
capable of detecting a logical model that is based on multiple
resources.

Change #8841 seams to be same as this one, but based on latest version of dependent patch, could you abandon this one?

Patch Set 3: Abandoned

Sorry for the confusion. Somewhere in the rebase/merge process I got a new Change-Id in the commit messages which opened a new change on push.
