when EGit is updated and an old version is installed in the workbench.

Patch Set 2:

Note that this does not yet fix bug 487096. We have people out there who have already installed egit.ui.importer (without host version range), and we have people who already have installed egit.ui.smartimport (also without version range). So even adding a version range here now will not fix the problem for people who still have the egit.ui.importer plugin.

Renaming this bundle back to "importer" will give rise to the same problem for people who already have the smartimport bundle without version range.

The only solution I see it to _add_ in master a (basically empty) fragment, with proper host version range, and itself with version 4.4.0. That should override any previously installed old "importer" fragment bundle and thus fix the problem for anybody who upgrades to 4.4.0.

But an empty fragment bundle is ugly... and we'd have to keep it basically indefinitely.

I think it should be possible to to fake this using p2.inf [1] entries, though I am not a p2 expert so I am not sure
