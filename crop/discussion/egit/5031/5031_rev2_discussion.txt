DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add submodule add/sync/update support

The Submodules node and all child repository nodes now have
an Update and Sync action available from the context menu.

Root repositories and 'Submodules' nodes now have an Add action
that opens a wizard to configure a new submodule that will be
configured in the parent repository and cloned on completion.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- great, I'd like to add this for 1.3 :-)
- could you make context menu entries more specific s/Update/Update Submodule/, s/Sync/Sync Submodule/
- maybe move these commands into separate section in context menu
- it's not clear to me how to work using these commands: 
-- should I import projects from the submodule shown under the super project in repo view in order to do changes ? Or is this rather read-only and I should do modifications by adding the submodule another time to the repo view as a top level repo ?

- could you provide some documentation for the user guide ?
- can we get some tests here (could be done in a separate change) ?

Patch Set 2:

more things I discovered regarding submodules:
- staging view doesn't seem to work when selecting a submodule under a super project in repo view
- in history view details pane addition of submodule is shown as a submodule, but actions on the entry in the file list are crap and don't work, e.g. "Open Working Tree Version"
