Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Mathias, your change doesn't work for any of the two scenarios for me. In both cases, the Push Confirmation page states that it cannot connect to any URI. As far as I can see, the PushOperationSpecification in revalidateImpl still does not honor the pushURIs

Ok, I'll have to go over this again as it seems (but at least the IndexOutOfBounds should have gone)...
The git-push docu says that remote URL is optional and defaults to URL. Thus we need to be a bit smarter as it appears.
