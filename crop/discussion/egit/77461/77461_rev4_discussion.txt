DESCRIPTION

Always run Fetch from Gerrit in the background

Blocking the UI should be avoided as this leads to a bad user
experience. This commit removes the option to run fetch a Gerrit change
in the background and make it the default.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

looks good to always run this in background, though I think Fetch from Gerrit should also allow to open the result dialog shown when clicking on the progress icon in the status bar, similar to how Push from Gerrit does it in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/76983/

Patch Set 4:

> I think Fetch from Gerrit should also allow to open the result dialog shown when clicking on the progress icon in the status bar

Can we handle this via a separate bug? I think this is a different requirement.
