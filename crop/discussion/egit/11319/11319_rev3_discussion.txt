Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- it seems checking the new option to suppress the result dialog doesn't suppress the push result dialog
- the log should give similar details as the result dialog shows
- I think the log shouldn't silently go into the error log but be shown in a git console, this would simplify to understand which actions were done, to make this really useful also other git commands should write an entry to this git console
- we need a way to re-enable showing the push result dialog -> I think we should add a preference for that
- it looks like the checkbox should be indented a bit more since it's very close to the dialog's border
- found the following exception in the log after trying this

Are you referring to not-yet-existing git console from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=349551 ?

Patch Set 3:

yes, that's what I meant, of course this is beyond the scope of this change
