DESCRIPTION

Generate and run repository used by UI tests inside test harness

generated, has a much smaller size and its daemon is run as part
of the test harness to speedup the UI tests and make them
independent from external resources.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Very nice and quite a progress. However, we should not use System.out to write messages to the console: it disturbs the user and doesn't help anyone.
