DESCRIPTION

Use standard Changeset Icon for Synchronize View

We should try to avoid confusion with different concepts. Changesets
should have the same icon as they do in other team providers and not
have the repository look&feel. Seems someone already had the idea
because the icon is already there, just the right usage in the label
provider was missing.
