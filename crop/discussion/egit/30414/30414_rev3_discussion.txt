DESCRIPTION

Fix invalid thread access in BranchOperationUI

The methods shouldCancelBecauseOfRunningLaunches, getTargetWithDialog
and getTargetWithCheckoutRemoteTrackingDialog all assume they are
running in the UI thread. This is not the case when the operation is
called from FetchGerritChangePage.
