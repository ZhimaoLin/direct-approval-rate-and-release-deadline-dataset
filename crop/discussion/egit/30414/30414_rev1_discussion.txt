DESCRIPTION

Fix invalid thread access in BranchOperationUI

The methods shouldCancelBecauseOfRunningLaunches, getTargetWithDialog
and getTargetWithCheckoutRemoteTrackingDialog all assume they are
running in the UI thread. This is not the case when the operation is
called from FetchGerritChangePage.

Line:445, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/branch/BranchOperationUI.java -> Instead of having two additional levels of indentation, I'd prefer if the body of run() would just contain a call to a new method (e.g. getTargetWithDialogInUI).

Then the called method can also have a normal return value instead of having to write to the array.

Same for the other places.
