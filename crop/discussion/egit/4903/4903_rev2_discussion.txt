Patch Set 2:

works like a charm, I think we should consider the following improvements (either in this change or in following increments):

- show list of submodules where user can decide if he wants to clone them, maybe this deserves another wizard page
- if there are no submodules, this option/wizard page should be disabled
- progress monitor should show which repository / submodule is currently transported
- enhance egit ui tests to cover this scenario

Patch Set 2:

The progress monitor handling definitely needs to be improved.

I would prefer to move in increments on these things and get some base functionality into the nightlies that we can iterate on as people start using it.
