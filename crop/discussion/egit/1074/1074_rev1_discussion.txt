DESCRIPTION

EGit Core tests: fix PushOperation and add tests

While writing tests for EGit Core, the following problems with
PushOperation were identified: 
1. an operation result is returned even if the operation was not run before
2. when re-using he specification used to create the operation, the
operation result is completely wrong (says UP_TO_DATE and does
not update the remote repo even if it should)
These issues were fixed and corresponding tests
were added. 

Other tests for the 

1. ListRemoteOperation
2. TagOperation
3. TrackOperation
4. UntrackOperation
5. DiscardChangesOperation

were added along with some infrastructure for these
tests (which need to set up two repositories instead of just
one).

There were also some intermittent failures to delete resources
in GitResourceVariant* and BlotStorage tests. Hopfully the change there
will improve this.

Total test coverage for egit core improves from around 34 percent to around 51 percent.

Bug: 318444
