DESCRIPTION

Git Repositories View: avoid parallel scheduling of auto-update job

If the update takes longer than the auto-update refresh rate, the current
implementation will schedule the update job even if the last one is still running.
This checks if an auto-update job is already running and simply skips this
auto-update.
