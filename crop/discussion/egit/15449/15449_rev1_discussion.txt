DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Simplify unstage code by using reset

Similar to stage, we can just use ResetCommand instead of doing this all
"manually". The result is less code and maybe also better performance
due to not calling TreeWalk.forPath for each entry.

See also JGit change Ied750116f767518ae4d48823cf00752b049a8477 which is
needed for this to work correctly in case of an unborn branch (no HEAD).
