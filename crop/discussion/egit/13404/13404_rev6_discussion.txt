DESCRIPTION

Enable restrained synchronization

GitSynchronizeData can now filter on a set of resources instead
of filtering on a set of containers. This finer-grained filtering
allows us to constrain the scope of synchronization operations.

Patch Set 6:

- Renamed *includedPaths (field, setter and getter) to *includedResources. This refactoring touched more files than the previous patchset.
- Changed the argument type of setIncludedPaths to Set<IResource> in order to remove "private setIncludedResources()" introduced in the previous patchset. I did not used the bounded type to "? extends IResource", it really is not necessary.
- documented about null parameter meaning "no restrictions".
- Renamed a bunch of linked methods with the same pattern (path -> resources), and changed type from IContainer to IResource. This last change will make things easier if we want to allow synchronization on a single file.

I've done the same trick with the author/commiter as for https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/11928/ to be able to push a modified patchset.
You may have to wait for answer from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=415627 before accepting it.
