DESCRIPTION

Enable restrained synchronization

GitSynchronizeData can now filter on a set of resources instead
of filtering on a set of containers. This finer-grained filtering
allows us to constrain the scope of synchronization operations.

Line:119, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/dto/GitSynchronizeData.java -> When an empty "includedResources" is passed, all are included. Seems strange, should we document that or make "null" the special value meaning "no restriction"?

Line:287, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/dto/GitSynchronizeData.java -> This looks like a copy of setIncludedPaths, just with different types. Change the argument type of setIncludedPaths to Set<? extends IResource> and remove this.

Line:305, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/dto/GitSynchronizeData.java -> Would be a good opportunity to rename it to includedResources (also setter and field), because I would expect a Set<String> or Set<IPath> for getIncludedPaths.

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/GitModelSynchronize.java -> Spurious change, please remove.
