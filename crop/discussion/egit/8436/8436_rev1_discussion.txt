DESCRIPTION

Only activate content assist and quick fix in commit message field

Before this, it was also active in the staged/unstaged table viewers,
which prevented selection with Ctrl+Space from working there.

Now it is activated and deactivated like the other actions: When the
text field gains/loses focus.
