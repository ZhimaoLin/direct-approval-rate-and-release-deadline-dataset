DESCRIPTION

Handle rebase modes 'preserve' and 'interactive' in EGit

EGit and JGit treated branch.<name>.rebase as a boolean config value,
which is wrong: git actually also allows 'preserve' and 'interactive'.

Since commit aadbb158 in JGit, JGit does recognize these extra values.

Adapt the EGit UI (wizards & dialogs for branch creation, branch
configuration, pulling and pushing a branch) to provide a UI to let
the user select any valid BranchRebaseMode value. Introduce a new
BranchRebaseModeCombo for this.

Adapt UI tests.

Honor the setting in all relevant operations in EGit.

Note that JGit currently ignores the "interactive" setting in a
PullCommand and performs a normal rebase instead.
