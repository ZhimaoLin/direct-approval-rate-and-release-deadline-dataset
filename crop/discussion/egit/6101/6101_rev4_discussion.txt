DESCRIPTION

Git API does not declare GitAPIException call() and related changes

Anyone that calls a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just
the currently known exceptions.

During the process of cleaning this up a number of cases, but not all
cases, where only checked exceptions are thrown, are changed to
catch all Exceptions except Error.

This changes adapt EGit to changes made in JGit for this reason.
