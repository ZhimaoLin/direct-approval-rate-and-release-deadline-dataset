DESCRIPTION

RFC Git API does not declare GitAPIException call()

Anyone that calls a Git API should catch GitAPIException and not just
the currently known exceptions.

During the process of cleaning this up a number of cases, but not all
cases where only checked exceptions were called into catching all
Exceptions except Error.

This changes adapt EGit to changes made in JGit for this reason.
