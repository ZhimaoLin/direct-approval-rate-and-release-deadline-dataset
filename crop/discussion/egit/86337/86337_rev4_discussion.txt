- use NIO FileVisitor to search repositories
- should be faster than the old approach
- follow symlinks
- by default skip hidden directories, add option to include them
- update path of currently scanned directory in UI at max 10 times/sec
- sort list of found repository paths in natural order

Line:332, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositorySearchDialog.java -> What is a "hidden directory"? Point is, "hidden" is now overloaded. When one already has some repositories in the repositories view, the dialog will present an info "N directories are hidden as they have already been added". But that has nothing to do with this toggle.

Probably the simplest fix is to change that message to "N directories are not shown as they have already been added".

Also note that on Linux .git itself is considered "hidden". So the combination of "look for nested" and "skip hidden" can be used to find all repos except submodule repos. On Windows, that most probably (can't test) will not have that effect since the Files.isHidden() definition is different. (Unless git/jgit on Windows would set the hidden bit, but I'd be surprised if they did.)

Line:493, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositorySearchDialog.java -> Deep search could be speeded up significantly by not looking through .git/objects.
