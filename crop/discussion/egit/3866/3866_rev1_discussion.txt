Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> initial commit was already created in setUp() method

Line:94, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> This test checks mark-as-merge on modified file, shouldn't it simulate conflict and then test behavior of mark-as-merge action?

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> I would rather say that 'marked as merged' file should be in git index not in list of changed files.

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> Done

Line:94, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> For this case, there is no difference between a modified file with or without conflicts as the result is the same. Tried to make the testcase not too complex.

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> Changed in the Status object means modified + added (bad working in my eyes, had the same problem at first)
