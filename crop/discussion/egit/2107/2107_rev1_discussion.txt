DESCRIPTION

Do not try to delete an already deleted folder

Originally, the remove command tries to delete first the working
directory (if repository has one) and then the metadata directory.
However the metadata directory could be contained by the working
directory and thus already deleted when the second deletion is called.
In this case an IOException will be thrown, to indicate that the
metadata directory could not be deleted. The correction simply checks
that the metadata directory exists before trying to delete it.
