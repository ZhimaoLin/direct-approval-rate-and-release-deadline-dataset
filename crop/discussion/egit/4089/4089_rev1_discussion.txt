DESCRIPTION

Don't use surefire plugin to run UI tests

The surefire plugin doesn't know how to correctly create the
runtime classpath for OSGi based tests, instead it relies on
the compile class path. This isn't guaranteed to work, in
addition the tests will be run twice: once by the
eclipe-test-plugin and again by the surefire plugin.
