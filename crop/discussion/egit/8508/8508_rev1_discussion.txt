DESCRIPTION

Fix RevisionSyntaxException in the Push wizard

The refspec panel passed strings like "master [branch]" to the revision
parser. The revision parser used to allow garbage after the revision,
but was tightened, which then triggered this bug.

Instead of working with the content proposal label, add a method to get
the corresponding content. Then use this when working with ref specs.

Also just overwrite the combo text when it changes, otherwise the nice
label like "master [branch]" is replaced by "refs/heads/master", even
though it would not have been necessary.

Another unhandled RevisionSyntaxException was in tryResolveLocalRef,
e.g. when calling completion with "refs/".

Patch Set 1:

What do you mean? When selecting "master [branch]" from the "Source ref" combo, should it show "master [branch]", "master" or "refs/heads/master"?

Patch Set 1:

Just "master" would be ok too, similar for tags as long as it unambiguous.
