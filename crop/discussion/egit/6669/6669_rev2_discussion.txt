DESCRIPTION

Rename "EGit Import Support" feature to avoid confusion

The old name is pretty generic and confuses people, resulting in "EGit
cannot be installed" questions on Bugzilla, Stackoverflow and to me
personally. They were checking all EGit features and were confused when
the installation did not complete, e.g. on Eclipse 3.7.

With the more specific name and an extended description, it should be
clear that this is an optional feature that is not needed by non-PDE
users.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I would not use "PDE" in the name and also not use "Eclipse-SourceReferences" as this is an implementation detail which is not known by most users.

How about:

EGit Plug-in Import Support

Optional support for importing plug-ins and fragments from Git repositories.\n\
Requires Eclipse 3.8 or newer.\n


In addition, the name change should also be made in the plug-in 'org.eclipse.egit.import'.
