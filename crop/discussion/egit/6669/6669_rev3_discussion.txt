DESCRIPTION

Rename "EGit Import Support" feature to avoid confusion

The old name is pretty generic and confuses people, resulting in "EGit
cannot be installed" questions on Bugzilla, Stackoverflow and to me
personally. They were checking all EGit features and were confused when
the installation did not complete, e.g. on Eclipse 3.7.

With the more specific name and an extended description, it should be
clear that this is an optional feature that is only needed by plugin
developers.
