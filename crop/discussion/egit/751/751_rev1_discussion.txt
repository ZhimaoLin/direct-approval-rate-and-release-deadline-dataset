Looks good. We may consider pruning the last two wiki pages as they are specific to Eclipse.org but for now, I think it's ok to leave them in.

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.doc/build-help.xml -> We may not need to include this one as this is heavily targeted towards Eclipse.org developers and not EGit users specifically. For now, I think it's fine.
