DESCRIPTION

Icon clean-up: use PNG, provide HiDPI versions, include SVG sources

SVG source are included in the repository under the ./icons top-level
directory.

* Copy SVG source files from eclipse.platform.images where applicable
* Replace GIFs by PNGs
* Provide HiDPI icons

Adapt references where needed (plugin.xml and UIIcons.java). Copied
SVGs include a comment where they come from.

All EGit icons have been re-done in SVG. Differences in the generated
pixel maps are minimal.

Some basic components are under ./icons/components.

The old GIF and PNG icons have all been replaced by newly generated
PNGs and all have HiDPI xxx@xxx.xxx versions.

Wherever possible use components from existing platform icons
already available; this not only simplifies icon creation but
also makes it easier to conform to the color scheme used in
platform. This has resulted in a few minor changes where the old
gif icons did not match the new SVGs from platform. An example are
icons containing a "file" object, for instance the reflog view icon:
the old gif showed a dog-ear in the bottom-right corner of the "page",
while current platform SVGs show a dog-ear top-right. The wizard
banner images, being larger, show more pixel-level differences. That
was to be expected since they were all re-done from scratch using
the current platform wizard banner styles.

Icon etool16/annotate.png should be changed. It's the icon for the
"Show Revision Information" command, which was formerly named "Show
Annotations". With the new name, an icon symbolizing a note doesn't
make sense anymore.

Due to bug 465456 we have to keep around all GIFs used as editor
or view icons, otherwise users may experience FileNotFoundExceptions
when starting on an old workspace because E4 stores icon URIs in
workbench.xmi. This concerns:

* eview16/rebase_interactive.gif
* eview16/reflog.gif
* eview16/repo_rep.gif
* obj16/changelog_obj.gif
* obj16/gitrepository.gif

These GIF files have been re-created; they are identical to the
new PNGs created from the SVG sources. Otherwise users might wonder
why they sometimes get different icons for the same thing.

wow, this was a lot of work, a big thank you for this great improvement.

Looks good on first sight, need to have a second look to ensure I didn't miss anything.
