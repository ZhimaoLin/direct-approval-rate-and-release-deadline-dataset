DESCRIPTION

Lessen the re-indexing work and number of queued jobs

Do not queue jobs unnecessarily and eliminate some unneeded jobs. As it
turns out, this is mostly a cosmetic problem.

The jobs have a potentially long initialization where they just lessen
the risk of executing in parallel with other heavy jobs. During this
period we may still cancel previous jobs just to queue a new one,
getting a huge queue of jobs. For the full re-indexing jobs, we can just
ignore re-indexing since the first one will do all necessary work.

Also acknowledge the fact the full re-indexing job does all work that an
incremental indexing job does and therefore we can skip launching an
incremental indexing job if a full reindexing operation is imminent (in
locking phase).

Finally reduce the total number of re-indexing jobs for all repositories
to two. Two or three seems to be a general practical limit for how many
jobs can be run in parallel without losing performance due to trashing.
