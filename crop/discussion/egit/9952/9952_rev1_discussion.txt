DESCRIPTION

Lessen the re-indexing work and number of queued jobs

Do not queue jobs unnecessarily and eliminate some unneeded jobs. As it
turns out, this is mostly a cosmetic problem.

The jobs have a potentially long initialization where they just lessen
the risk of executing in parallel with other heavy jobs. During this
period we may still cancel previous jobs just to queue a new one,
getting a huge queue of jobs. For the full re-indexing jobs, we can just
ignore re-indexing since the first one will do all necessary work.

Also acknowledge the fact the full re-indexing job does all work that an
incremental indexing job does and therefore we can skip launching an
incremental indexing job if a full reindexing operation is imminent (in
locking phase).

Line:257, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Hm, is this ever non-null except after IndexDiffCacheEntry construction? I don't see it getting set to null anywhere after the job is done. Not directly related to this change though.

Line:262, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Is iteration safe against concurrent modification here? Maybe we should wrap this in synchronized(updateJobs)?

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> I think "Re-indexing repository foo (full/incremental)" would look nicer.

Line:281, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/CoreText.java -> s/reindexingincrementally/reindexingIncrementally/

Line:257, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> It's null on the first call.

Line:262, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> That's why it is a Vector.

Line:115, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> The problem is space, The repository name is so long and the most important information is that the is something going on, rather than exactly where.

Line:281, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/CoreText.java -> Done
