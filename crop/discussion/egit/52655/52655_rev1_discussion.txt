DESCRIPTION

Staging view remembers position of it's components.

Using the view's IMemento stores the SashForm weights on shutdown only.
For this reason the SashForm weights are now stored into the bundle
DialogSettings. If staging view is closed and re-opened within the same
session, the previously changed SashForm weights are restored.
