Patch Set 5: No score

Fixed test fest failure.

I have still some problems with running maven build from command line, so that I can't test it from cmd. In my eclipse previous version forks fine ...

Where is easymock coming from ? Maybe another dependency is needed here ?

For me the mentioned test is also failing from Eclipse. I am running on latest Helios on Windows XP. I run the tests from maven also against helios :

$ mvn clean install -Dplatform-version-name=helios

Patch Set 5:

EasyMock is added as a plugin dependency (see org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF) and it should be provided.

Maven build starts with yours command and fails on one of tests. This a good point to start debug it ;)

Line:200, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/views/synchronize/SynchronizeViewTest.java -> Why isn't ContextMenuHelper used here?

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncInfoTest.java -> mis-spelled name

Line:13, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The plugin itself should not depend on easymock, only the test plugin

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantComparatorTest.java -> nit-pick: reads better as ...DoesNotExist

Patch Set 5: (4 inline comments)

Currently tests fails in WorkingCopyPage.assertWorkingCopyExists() (line 53) because STWBot can not find Text widget with specified text message.

Line:200, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/views/synchronize/SynchronizeViewTest.java -> Because (as far as I remember) it throws ClassCastException in line 53

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncInfoTest.java -> Done

Line:13, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> True, I moved this dependency to org.eclipse.egit.core.test

Done

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantComparatorTest.java -> Done

Filed CQ https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4275 for reuse of easymock, we will also need a CQ for this patch.

Line:13, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I think this should be imported via package dependency (2.4 is available in galileo as well) :

Import-Package: org.easymock; version="[2.4.0,3.0.0)"

or do you have a reason to use require-bundle for that ?

we also need to file a CQ for using that, I will do that.

I've add a CQ statement into commit message, it will be updated with next patch set.

Line:13, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> No I don't have any reasons to have it as a required-bundle. It can be move into Import-Package section.
