Patch Set 8:

I've added test case for GitResourceVariantTree class. Three (shouldReturnTwoMembers, shouldReturnSameResourceVariant, shouldReturnDifferentResourceVariant) of theres tests fails when they are run together with others, but passes when they are run separately. It look like jgit cant obtain blob object with is needed by test case when this particular test cases re run as a part of whole test run.

Patch Set 8:

Could you rebase this change and the underlying http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,911 onto current master ? 
I tried to do that but probably I did something wrong because I hit tons of NPEs in synchronize tests when running egit.core tests so I suspect I somehow killed change 911.
