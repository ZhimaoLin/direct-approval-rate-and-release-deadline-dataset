DESCRIPTION

Change ref parameter of CloneOperation to String

The parameter is used for specifying what branch should be checked out
after fetch. Before this change, it was of type Ref. But a Ref is not
really right here, as a Ref should point to a valid object id, and the
ids aren't generally known before a clone. This lead users of
CloneOperation to passing a Ref with only a name set, and no object id
(using a anonymous Ref subclass or passing null as object id).

Before the parameter was a Ref, it already was a String, but one could
only specify a short branch name (e.g. "master"), not a full ref name
("refs/heads/master"). With this change, it's still the full ref name,
just as a String.
