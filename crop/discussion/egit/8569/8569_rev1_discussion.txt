Patch Set 1:

with this patch "Show in package explorer" works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't, didn't yet find out when it doesn't work

It seems "Show in Navigator" always works

Patch Set 1:

Couldn't find such a case here, with jgit repo. When the file is not in the workspace (e.g. root pom.xml), the show in menu is expected to be empty, which works here.

Does failure depend on the file or does it fail/work some of the times for the same file?

Patch Set 1:

By the way, do you have any active resource filters in the package explorer (e.g. for .*)?

Patch Set 1:

yes, I have active filters in the package explorer for:

.*, empty library containers, empty parent packages, external plugin libraries projects, import declarations, inner class files, package declarations, synthetic members

Patch Set 1:

I tried with 4.2 (was on 3.7 before), and there it does not work at all, may be due to bug 388434 in 4.2. I added a note to the bug and linked it.

The fix works on top of the latest 4.2.x and 4.3 builds. There are two small issues:
1) The change in plugin.xml and GitAdapterFactory are not needed (PageBookView handles this for us)
2) CommitEditorPage needs copyright update

Patch Set 1:

1) Hm, I developed it on 3.7 and there it does not work if I revert the changes of plugin.xml and GitAdapterFactory, it just shows <No Applicable Views>. In 4.2 it seems to work but I can't test because I don't have access to 4.2.x right now.

2) Thanks, will correct.
