DESCRIPTION

Fixes strange result set in Synchronize view on Windows

On Windows platform Synchronize view returns strange result set when
comparing two branches of tags without local changes. This issue occurs
of different file separator char on this platform. In Git we always use
UNIX file separator char for saving file paths. When we want retrieve a
file content from Git repository we should replace all windows file
separators with UNIX separators.
