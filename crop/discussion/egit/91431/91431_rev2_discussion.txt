Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Yes, that fixes the problem. Note that there are two more problems:

1. (Compare editor): if I do apply all non-conflicting changes, the left side updates and jumps to the first line. The scroll position in the right side stays where it was. Ideally, either the left side shouldn't jump to the top, or the right side also should.

2. EGit bug 425592. I'll see if I can do something about that one.
