DESCRIPTION

Revert "Save Actions for removing braces of one-line statements"

This reverts commit f95c105980fc8dc1c356665bb796f256d62bf1ca.

The problem with the save action is that it also results in removed
braces for the if in the following example:

  if (foo)
    try {
      bar();
    } finally {
      baz();
    }

Which, altough it's a single statement, isn't recommended because it's
longer than one line and confusing.

See I1279030286ef177f3360ff70660a9365e4f3119a for the exact reasons.
