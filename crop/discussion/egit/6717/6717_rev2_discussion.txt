DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Highlight filtered files in file diff viewer

The fix for bug 360073 changed the History view file diff viewer to show
all files of a commit, regardless of the resource filter. This made it
sometimes hard to find the files that the filter is focused on.

This change improves that by rendering the files that are not matched by
the filter in gray. The matching files are rendered in the same color as
before. With this, the files can be found at a glance instead of reading
through the paths.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

this works nicely when only one file is selected, but with multi-selecting some files it fails to correctly highlight the selected files if they are touched in the same commit

Patch Set 2:

Hm, works here. Could you give an example? I tried with GitDateParser and SystemReader from JGit. In commit abd6010, they are both highlighted.
