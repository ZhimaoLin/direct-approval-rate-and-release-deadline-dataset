Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

this looks pretty good now :-)

I will need more time to do more testing, will look into that soon

- you committed some class files from the deleted import bundle, please fix that
- consider to make this a new patchset for the old change instead of creating a new change, or do I miss something ?
