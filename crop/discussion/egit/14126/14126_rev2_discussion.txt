Patch Set 2:

- Removed the mistakenly committed class files.

- Matthias, I sent you an off-line message looking for advice about the previous change set.  I suspect it ended up in your spam bucket.  What it came down to was that I was having difficulty rebasing the previous change, so I ended up addressing the issues that you brought up and submitting a new change.
