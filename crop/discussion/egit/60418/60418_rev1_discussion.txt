DESCRIPTION

Check RepositoryCache for selection path

SelectionUtils should check if the selected IPath object belongs to
repositories known by RepositoryCache. Doing so we allow
CompareWithIndexActionHandler to find the repository for selected
StagingEntry in the StagingView and to open the compare editor even if
this selected object is outside of the Eclipse workspace.

Line:231, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionUtils.java -> Ok... didn't know about the RepositoryCache. In my (not yet pushed) fix for 481682 I had changed this loop to continue if _all_ mappings were null, so that it would then consider the adapters below, which was the reason for making StagingEntry a PlatformObject adaptable to Repository in Ib7127800.
