DESCRIPTION

[RFC]: Teach the Sharing wizard to share with an existing Repository

This uses the Refactoring capabilities available in Eclipse to allow
sharing an Eclipse project with a Repository that is not located in a
parent folder of the project.

The Sharing Wizard has a new radio button to allow selection of an
existing Repository (from the RepoView) and optionally a relative path
within this repository into which the project is to be shared (always
using the project name as terminating folder).

Upon finish, the project location is then moved to the new target folder
(a child folder of the working directory of the selected
Repository) before the ConnectProviderOperation is executed.
