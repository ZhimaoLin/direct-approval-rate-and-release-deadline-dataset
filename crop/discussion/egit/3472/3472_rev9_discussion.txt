DESCRIPTION

Teach the Sharing wizard to share with an existing Repository

This uses the Refactoring capabilities available in Eclipse to allow
sharing an Eclipse project with a Repository that is not located in a
parent folder of the project.

By default, the Sharing Wizard now allows selection of an existing
Repository (from the RepoView) and optionally a relative path
within this repository into which the project is to be shared (always
using the project name as terminating folder).

Upon finish, the project location is then moved to the new target folder
(a child folder of the working directory of the selected
Repository) before the ConnectProviderOperation is executed.

Users can click a checkbox to enable the previous behavior where the
Repository can only be created in a parent folder of the selected
project or projects.

Patch Set 9: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

tests are ok now :)

some more issues I found
- the repository drop-down list should be sorted
- the width of the working directory edit field is not aligned with the other edit fields, this looks weird

Line:18, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/MoveProjectsLabelProvider.java -> typo: s/provide/provider/
