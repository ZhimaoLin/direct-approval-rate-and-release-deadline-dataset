Nearly there, I think. Just a few minor comments.

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/SkipNotInterestingDeltaVisitor.java -> Please capitalize the first letter of a sentence; it makes reading easier. (And it's standard practice in English.)

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/SkipNotInterestingDeltaVisitor.java -> This would be set on the event. A PRE_DELETE event doesn't have a delta, so you'll never get here. Just remove this.
