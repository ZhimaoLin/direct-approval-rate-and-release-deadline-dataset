Line:181, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/GitResourceDeltaVisitor.java -> Can't remove that, otherwise the file will be included if there are only marker changes.

Line:708, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> PRE_DELETE events have no delta. POST_CHANGE events do.

Line:709, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> But I doubt this approach will work. I'm not sure a content change in a file is reported in the flags on the top-level delta.

Line:709, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Yeah. Sorry for this review request. This is my first review in gerrit and eclipse.

Tests are failing because I misunderstood Delta/Resources.

General idea would be setup SkipNotInterestingVisitor and execute against delta
