After some thinking I believe this new visitor can be simplified even more. Otherwise looks OK for me. 

One thing I find confusing is your account name. It appears your Eclipse account has first name "rodionovamp" and last name "mail.ru" (Owner); the "Author" of the commit is shown as "Marisol Rowland" (committer of first patch set), and the "Committer" as "Kassandra Newman" (committer of last patch set).

When I look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/status:open I see only people with "real names". Don't remember if the Eclipse Foundation has a rule about that.

Maybe you could change your Eclipse account first and last names to your real name, and if the "Committer" version comes from your git config adapt that, too?

BTW, did you do all those patch sets in the Gerrit UI? I usually find it simpler to work locally, amend my commit[1], and then push to Gerrit again.

Line:28, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/SkipNotInterestingDeltaVisitor.java -> Capital R and period at end of sentence.

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/SkipNotInterestingDeltaVisitor.java -> I think all this can actually be removed, including the then unused import of org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource.

Additions and deletions are always interesting, and GitResourceDeltaVisitor.isInteresting(delta) does return true for them.
