See inline comment. Otherwise looks good, verified that it fixes the NPE.

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/AbstractSharedCommandHandler.java -> getActiveEditorInput is "since 3.7". AFAIK we still support 3.5.

I don't like making code more complicated for compatibility, but in this case I think it's not that bad to copy the implementation with getVariable. What do you think?

Line:45, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/AbstractSharedCommandHandler.java -> I think we have said that we support the current version and the version before that. That could be 3.7 and 3.8.
