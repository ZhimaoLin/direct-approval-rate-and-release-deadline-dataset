Are you planning to revert also the first commit? Because this still has exactly the same problems, but only in CreateBranchPage.

Line:499, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> This has the same problems. (Obviously.)

I don't think we need to revert it. Wim's working on it at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/91559/ , and I've posted another approach using content assist instead at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/91579/ .
