DESCRIPTION

[sync] Fix newly created files in 'working tree' node

Newly created files wer not included in 'working tree' node because
the DirCacheIterator was not found in TreeWalk instance. It also
appears that we don't need to have instance of DirCacheIterator to get
list of children in GitModelWorkingTree and GitModelCache.
