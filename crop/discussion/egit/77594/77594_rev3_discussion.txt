Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

- looks good, this fixes a really bad bug
- when choosing "Commit" to save an uncommitted change while running submodule update I think it could make sense to provide a way to also create a branch or tag on the new commit otherwise the user can only find it by inspecting the reflog since updating the submodule will move HEAD to another commit which isn't a successor of the newly created commit. This can be implemented in a follow-up change
