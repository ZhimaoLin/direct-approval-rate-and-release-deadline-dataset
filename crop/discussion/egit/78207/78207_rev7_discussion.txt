DESCRIPTION

Auto-stage selected files on "Commit..." when staging view is used

* New preference UiPreferences.AUTO_STAGE_ON_COMMIT for auto-staging
  when the staging view is used. Default is true.
* Change some private operations from CommitUI to public static utility
  operations, so they can be re-used.
* Add auto-staging functionality in CommitActionHandler

Auto-staging honors the UiPreferences.COMMIT_DIALOG_INCLUDE_UNTRACKED
setting. Staging occurs in a background job.

Patch Set 7:

This one should probably be in "New and Noteworthy" of 4.5.

Also, I'll have to update the documentation on the Wiki. But when? If I do it now, people may find docu for something they don't have yet... Shortly before 4.5 is built? When was that planned -- end of September?

you can add it to the wiki now if you mention that this feature is available starting from release 4.5. We will release 4.5 end of September in line with Luna.1 (can't look up the date since the wiki seems to be down currently)
