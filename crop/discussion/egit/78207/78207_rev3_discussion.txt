DESCRIPTION

Auto-stage selected files on "Commit..." when staging view is used

* New preference UiPreferences.AUTO_STAGE_ON_COMMIT for auto-staging
  when the staging view is used. Default is true.
* Change some private operations from CommitUI to public static utility
  operations, so they can be re-used.
* Add auto-staging functionality in CommitActionHandler

Auto-staging honors the UiPreferences.COMMIT_DIALOG_INCLUDE_UNTRACKED
setting. Staging occurs in a background job.
