DESCRIPTION

Quick diff against git head used to fail if the project itself has no mapping.

Resources inside the project can have mappings even if the project does not.
Now get repository mappings for a single resource to be diffed and not
the whole project.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Rewrote the message slightly to have a complete subject line
and a separate body.

Please add the Change-Id to future patches. There is a hook you can add to git for automating this. I guess we should have that as an option for EGit too.
