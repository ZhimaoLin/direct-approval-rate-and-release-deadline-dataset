DESCRIPTION

Do not let the user proceed when multiple commits are selected

While the graph of commits supports multi-selection, the action
does not make sense when the user is specifying a particular
commit for the purposes of content comparison or replacement.
Thus, if the user has selected multiple commits, the commit
selection dialog should not allow the user to proceed.
