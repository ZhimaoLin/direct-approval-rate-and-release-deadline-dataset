DESCRIPTION

Delete invalid projects after work dir checkout

Operations performing a work dir checkout (e.g. branch, reset)
may delete .project files. This leads to inconsistent projects
causing follow-up problems (checkout conflicts). 
Details of the problem can be found in the related bug.
This fix deletes projects that got inconsistent by the work dir checkout.
In future there could also be a handling for projects added by a 
work dir checkout (e.g. asking the user to open these projects).
A test case for BranchOperation was added.
