Patch Set 1: No score



Line:13, .eclipse_iplog -> This is consistent with https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3589 but isn't this an unmodified binary use ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:13, .eclipse_iplog -> I'm only reporting what the automated IP log tools are reporting.  E.g. if you look at the standard automatic log for EGit [1] you will see the same information presented, which doesn't include the "unmodified binary" use flag.  Because the IP team didn't tag this CQ properly.
