DESCRIPTION

Improve GitLightweightDecorator

This change contains two improvements to the decorator:

1. Outdated decorations are shown until newly calculated decorations
   are available - this reduces 'flickering'
2. ResourceChangeEvents are better filtered - 'false' events are
   ignored (i.e. when a project is opened) and team private resource
   are also not included in the list of changed resources
