DESCRIPTION

Change decorator to make use of IndexDiffCache

To improve performance of the GitLightweightDecorator it was changed to
calculate decorations only based on cached IndexDiff results.

If resources are modified new decorations are shown almost immediately.
If the index changes (e.g. add operation) it takes for linux
kernel repo 20 sec. (vs. 35 sec. before) to propagate decorations.
