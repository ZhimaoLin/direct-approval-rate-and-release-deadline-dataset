this looks much better

I still found some problems:
* when changing the option in the staging view this isn't reflected in the preferences, when closing and reopening the staging view the change is gone. Changes to view configurations should be always persisted immediately.
* when changing the option in the preference editor this isn't reflected in the staging view if it was already open, probably it lacks some event handler listening on the preference change
* I think we should show an explicit warning if the commit button is disabled explaining why, the staging view already has a warning area above the commit message editor which displays warnings if present
* we could hide the checkbox if there are no warnings to safe some screen real estate
* in the first try I once observed that the commit button in the staging view wasn't disabled despite the fact that the changes to be commited had errors and warnings and checking was on. Looks like some initialization problem though I couldn't reproduce that.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitUI.java -> again this patch has only unrelated formatting changes.

We avoid unrelated formatting changes since they can lead to nasty unnecessary conflicts. If there's something really badly formatted you can fix that in a separate change. Avoid large pure formatting changes since this may lead to many unnecessary conflicts.

/\
maybe because the files wasn't in staged changes?
