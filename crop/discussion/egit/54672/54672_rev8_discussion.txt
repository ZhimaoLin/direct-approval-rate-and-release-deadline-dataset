Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

See comment in code.

Line:1131, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> doReload() does more then we want here. You can pass cacheEntry.getIndexDiff() as argument to this method (if cacheEntry exists of course).

Also I would prefer that the code in the job started from reload() method re-uses this method to update the commit buttons.
