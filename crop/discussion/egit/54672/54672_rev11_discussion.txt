I cooked a nicer layout of your preference page changes, if you want I can upload that, though enabling/disabling the block checkbox based on state of warn checkbox doesn't yet work correctly

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> you reformatted a lot of code unrelated to your change, please revert these formatting changes
