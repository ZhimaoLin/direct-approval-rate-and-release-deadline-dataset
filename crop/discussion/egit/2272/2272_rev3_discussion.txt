DESCRIPTION

Synchronize view performance improvements

Method GitRepositoryMapping.getTravelsals() theirs result can base
only on its projects list instead of traveling over git repository
objects. This result can be also cached for feature reuse.

In GitChangeSetContentProvider.hasChildren() for
GitModelObjectContainer parameter we can determinate result based on
given object children list. Also in this class we can cached
ResourceTravelsals for given object in case of feature reuse.
