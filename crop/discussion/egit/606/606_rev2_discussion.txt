Hi Remy, Chris,

I introduced error handling using StatusManager and adopted the 3 classes in the change. If this pattern looks good for you I can adopt existing handling in further commits.

Best regards

Jens

This looks good, Jens. I'll start altering my own patches too once this is in. Thanks for doing this!

Good job. I would probably send an email to egit-dev to remind people to log this way from now on.
