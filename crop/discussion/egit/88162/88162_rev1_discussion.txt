DESCRIPTION

[duplicate code] Unify saving in preference pages

Provide an abstract super class that encapsulates the handling of a
second preference store and its saving, if necessary. The framework
only saves the primary preference store, but not other stores that
might be used by individual field editors. See also commit 0fab91c.[1]
