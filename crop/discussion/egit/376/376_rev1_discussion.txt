Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Denny, keybindings are available in the meantime. Could you please discard your changeset as it's obsolete by now. But thanks for your contribution anyway!

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm find with discarding these changes.  Do I select the "abandon" option to do so?

There is still one existing issue, but I'm planning on submitting that as a different changeset:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=306459

Let me know if that's not the way to approach this.  Thanks!

Patch Set 1: No score

Yep, "abandon" is the right one.

And yes, would be very cool to have a fix for the last outstanding issue. Just push it as another change with a proper explanation what the fix does (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines).
