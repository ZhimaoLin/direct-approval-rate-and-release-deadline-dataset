Patch Set 9:

Thank you for fixing the remaining issues!
About the locking of resources: I think additionally the "start feature" and "start hotfix" do not have to lock and thus can return null as ISchedulingRule. For "start release" it depends on whether the release will be created from a past commit, rather than HEAD.
I will fix that as soon as the CQ is done.

Patch Set 9:

no need to wait for the CQ to be finished, just create another commit on top of this one and push it to Gerrit, as it will have this change as predecessor it can't be submitted to master before this change is accepted

could you add a section to the EGit user guide [1] describing how to work with the new gitflow feature ?
