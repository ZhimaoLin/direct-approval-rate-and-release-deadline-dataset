Line:185, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/FetchAndMergeActionTest.java -> in change I7f75957d2d44e08679c3eb512cdc446eeb426677 the timeout is 10 sec here you have 20 and below 60, what's the reason not to use a common timeout ? 

Maybe we should make this configurable through a system property so that we don't have to change code in order to experiment with different timeout settings

Line:185, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/FetchAndMergeActionTest.java -> No specific reason, just guessing which operation takes longer than others.

I'm not sure a common timeout is appropriate for jobs. Maybe we should define a default timeout per job family in a common location, so we can change it in one place?
