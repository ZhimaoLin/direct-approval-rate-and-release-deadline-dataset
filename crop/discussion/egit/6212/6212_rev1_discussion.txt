Patch Set 1:

I made the change on the stable-2.0 branch but for whatever reason this change now has 'master' as branch. Looks like yet another bug. This works out of the box when not using Gerrit.

Patch Set 1:

you pushed to refs/for/master instead you need to push to refs/for/stable-2.0

I did not expect that I have to do anything manually. Normally, when working with EGit directly against Git one creates the branch and then push automatically goes to that branch. Shouldn't EGit know that I work against Gerrit and then set a corresponding push spec on the branch?
