DESCRIPTION

Add tagging UI support

Implements UI for unsigned and annotated tags. This implementation
allows user to select with commit object should be associated with
created tag. List of all commits is available in 'Advanced' section of
dialog. There is a special combo widget that can suggest commits based
on typed in commit SHA-1 or part from first line of commit message. User
can also edit/overwrite message or associated commit of existing tag by
selecting it from existing tag list and marking 'Force replace existing
tag' check box.

By default tag is created for current HEAD, this can be changed in
'Advanced' section.

Tag dialog is available in project's context menu ('Team->Tag...').

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/TagOperation.java -> I'm not quite sure what should be returned here...

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/TagOperation.java -> Null is ok here because the operation does not change Eclipse resources.
