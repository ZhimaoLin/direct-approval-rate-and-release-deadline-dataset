DESCRIPTION

Add tagging UI support

Implements UI for unsigned and annotated tags. This implementation
allows user to select with commit object should be associated with
created tag. List of all commits is available in 'Advanced' section of
dialog. There is a special combo widget that can suggest commits based
on typed in commit SHA-1 or part from first line of commit message. User
can also edit/overwrite message or associated commit of existing tag by
selecting it from existing tag list and marking 'Force replace existing
tag' check box.

By default tag is created for current HEAD, this can be changed in
'Advanced' section.

Tag dialog is available in project's context menu ('Team->Tag...').

Patch Set 8:

Clicking on the 'Advanced' link does nothing for me on Windows 7. Anyone else getting the same thing?

great we are getting close

tried on Windows XP:
- now I am able to replace existing tags and OK button behaves properly
- clicking "Advanced" only shows up the label "Choose commit that should be associated ..." 
but no combo, resizing the dialog reveals that this is a layouting problem. 
Looks like the control on which the advanced section is expanded doesn't resize sufficiently 
to show the combo for selection of commit to be tagged.
- clear button got no text for its label in the resource bundle
- the initial dialog width looked a bit broad but that could be caused by a long error message being displayed instead of the missing clear button label

Chris: In a hurry? Don't panic! A problem with problems in UIs is that a small one can take a lot of code to fix and if we push it through a CQ, we'll need another CQ to fix it, and a dozen bug reports to tend to. It needs to be good enough for anyone to fix without resorting to duct tape.

It's better with a nice working one commit Dariusz can be pround of and at least doesn't *have to* be fixed. 

We might think of better UI's later on but that's another story.
