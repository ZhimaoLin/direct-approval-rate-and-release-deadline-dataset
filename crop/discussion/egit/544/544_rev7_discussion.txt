DESCRIPTION

Add tagging UI support

Implements UI for unsigned and annotated tags. This implementation
allows user to select with commit object should be associated with
created tag. List of all commits is available in 'Advanced' section of
dialog. There is a special combo widget that can suggest commits based
on typed in commit SHA-1 or part from first line of commit message. User
can also edit/overwrite message or associated commit of existing tag by
selecting it from existing tag list (this list can be found in 'Details'
section) and marking 'Force replace existing tag' check box.

By default tag is created for current HEAD, this can be changed in
'Advanced' section.

Tag dialog is available in project's context menu ('Team->Tag...').

Patch Set 7: No score; No score

Regarding Issue#1. Just create a lot of tags. It seems the input fields align with the bottom of the internal pane in the dialog which grows when the existing tags needs more space than has been initially acticated. 15 or so tags will show where things are going.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

In a new repo you get this in the error log and no dialog.

Patch Set 7:

If you select a tag to see its message the I cannot create a new tag anymore. I can select "advanced" and "force replace existing tag", and do it that what, but that is somewhat strange. 
(this is not a showstopper, but we will get bug reports, I'm pretty sure)

Patch Set 7:

OK, I've implemented resizing dialog and proper widget layout after changing of dialog size. Also I've fixed NullPointerException when dialog is called on new repo. Now this dialog should look good when there is lots of tag in repository.

Right now only one thing left, that is adding possibility of creating new tag after one from existing was selected. I think that I'll add an extra button 'clear' or 'new tag' in left hand corner of dialog. That will setup initial state of dialog.

All that changes will be included in patch set 8 which, I think, I'll send on Monday evening.
