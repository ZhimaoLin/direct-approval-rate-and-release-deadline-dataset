DESCRIPTION

Fix tests after changed implementation of content identifier

The commit "Show commit id instead of blob id in compare editor"
(56d406b) broke GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest. This test relays
on blob SHA-1 in GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.getContentIdentifer(),
when implementation of this method was changed this test case should be
also updated.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I just saw your fix. In the meantime I had pushed http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,1691.

You patch does not fix the tests GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest1.java and GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest2.java

You can either push a new version or take mine, I don't mind ;-)
