DESCRIPTION

Prevent NPE in RepositoriesView

When displaying refs which are inconsistent (e.g. a MERGE_HEAD
which points to something unknown) we run into NPEs. Then we
are not even displaying the good refs anymore. By replacing
certain "objectId.name()" by "ObjectId.toString(objectId)"
we can get rid of this problem easily.
