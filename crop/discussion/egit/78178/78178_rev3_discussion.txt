DESCRIPTION

Recompute index diff on project deletions

IndexDiffCacheEntry recomputed the diff on POST_CHANGE resource change
events. This missed project deletions, because by then the project is
already gone, is not shared with git anymore, and has no location
anymore.

Fix by also handling PRE_DELETE events. Remember projects to be deleted
and their locations, and once we get the corresponding POST_CHANGE
event, force a recalculation if the project directory no longer exists
(i.e., the project was also removed on disk).
