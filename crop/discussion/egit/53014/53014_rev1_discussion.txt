DESCRIPTION

[test stability] Fix test crash on timeout due running wizard operation

Sometimes we are too fast checking the wizard state and fail afterwards
to close it, causing test crash.

If one tries to close wizard dialog while operation is still running,
wizard opens each time a new message dialog with the warning about
running task. This causes SWTBot to give up closing the wizard shell,
but after the timeout of one minute, for each test running after the
current one => the execution will be aborted after 40 minutes timeout.

So before trying to validate search result, give the wizard operation a
chance to complete!
