Ok. But that bug isn't fixed yet. Bug 355809 was also about the display of 'Add to Index' in the Synchronize View. I have a follow-up change to handle that part; but it's not quite ready yet.

I had mentioned that in the original commit message[1], but somehow it got lost in all this splitting and rebasing the whole sequence umpteen times :-(.
