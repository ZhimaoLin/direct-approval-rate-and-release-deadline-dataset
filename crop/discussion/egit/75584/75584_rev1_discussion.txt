DESCRIPTION

Redesign next/previous buttons in history search widget

Instead of two huge buttons use a toolbar contribution with a drop-down
menu. The button re-performs the last action selected, initially it's
set to find the next occurrence.

Patch Set 1:

* this safes a lot of space by removing the texts from the buttons, that's a good idea
* I think I'd prefer to spend twice the space for two icon buttons for up and down navigation since that's a lot easier to use
