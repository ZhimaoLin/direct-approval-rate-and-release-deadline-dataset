DESCRIPTION

Show truncated commit ids when in comparison view

When comparing two resources, the full commit identifier is shown.
This is generally too long (and unnecessary) so truncate this as we
are doing elsewhere.

Make a helper method to return that truncated form so that we can
change the parameterisation if necessary (and/or a preference).
Leave it private in this class until otherwise needed.
