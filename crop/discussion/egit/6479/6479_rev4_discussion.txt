DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Fix NPE in GitCompareEditorInput#equals

The repository field may be null when a GitCompareEditorInput was
constructed with the IResource constructor but prepareInput was not yet
called.

The NPE could be observed like this:

1. Select two commits in the History view
2. Run Compare with Each Other
3. Do step 2 again
