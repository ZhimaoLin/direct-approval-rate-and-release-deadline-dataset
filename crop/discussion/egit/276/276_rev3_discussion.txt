Patch Set 3: No score; No score

- removed trailing whitespace
- some image filenames had blank instead of "_"
- added missing images next.gif, prev.gif, home.gif
- fixed image path for next, prev and home.gif, they all had path images/images/xxx.gif
- committing jars to the repo seems still ugly to me, what's the advantage of this approach ?

Patch Set 3:

In regards to the embedded jars, I created this bug:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=305431

I believe we can solve it at a later time.

Thanks for the modifications.
