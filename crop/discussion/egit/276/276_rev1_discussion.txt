Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Aside from the minor style remarks below, why are we hosting these large JARs like org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core_1.3.0.I20100116-0000-e3x.jar in our repository?  Can't we get our build process to pick them up from somewhere?

Line:74, org.eclipse.egit.doc/build-help.xml -> This file is full of whitespace errors.  Please consider cleaning them up.

Line:3, org.eclipse.egit.doc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We've been using %plugin_name and %provider_name within EGit for these localized tags.  Can you please match that?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Great step forward :-) I was able to build and install the plugin via Export > Plug-in development > Deployable plug-ins and fragments.

I found the following issues:
- is it ok to have the wikitext jars in the lib folder checked into our repo ? I think we should rather refer to them via plugin dependencies.
- some images are missing:
  - images for previous, next and EGit User Guide links in headers and footers of all documentation pages
  - images for topic "Committing changes" are all missing
- I think the doc plugin should be added to the EGit feature
