DESCRIPTION

Optionally hard-wrap commit message

When the user presses "Commit", the commit message is hard-wrapped to
70 characters if the "Hard-wrap commit message" preference is set.
Existing newlines are not touched, to preserve manual formatting
(e.g. ASCII graphics).

The editor shows the commit message in a configurable font that
defaults to the text font (usually monospaced). The width of the text
field is fixed to 70 characters. This way, what the user sees should
be what the user gets when we later hard-wrap the commit message.

Patch Set 2:

I changed the following in patch set 2:

- There is now a "Hard-wrap commit message" option in the preferences. (Maybe there are more options which belong into this preference page, or else we can move this setting to the general git preference page.)

- In the commit dialog there's a link which opens the preference page to change the option. The preference page opens "above" the commit dialog and nothing is lost when one returns from the preference page (this is the same as "Configure Commit Templates" in the CVS commit dialog).

- The commit message editor font is now configurable and defaults to the "text font", which is usually monospace. (General -> Appearance -> Colors and Fonts)

Patch Set 2:

Robin: Regarding preservation of ASCII graphics: The hard-wrap option doesn't remove newlines which were entered by the user (as opposed to what the commit message viewer does). So the graphics are fine as long as they are less than 70 characters wide.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

The editor area for the commit message looks ugly since
- it doesn't align with the file table. Either center it or align it with the file table.
- What's the purpose of the vertical bar at the right end of the commit message pane ?

Whitespace in front of lines in the middle of a paragraph is erased. Could this be preserved to allow indenting inside of paragraphs.

Would be nice to get a warning if there is no blank line after the header, also when the header becomes too long.

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> better use "Commit Dialog", we have another one named "History View"

Line:450, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> just use "Preferences"

Line:594, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Better use "Commit Dialog", this makes clear where the setting will be used
