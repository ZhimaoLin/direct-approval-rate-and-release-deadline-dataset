DESCRIPTION

Optionally hard-wrap commit message

When "hard-wrap" is enabled in the new Commit Dialog preference page,
the commit message editor automatically inserts newlines as the user is
typing the commit message.

The text width is 70. If a line the user is typing would be longer than
that, a newline is automatically inserted before the last word.
Existing newlines are not touched, to allow for manual formatting (e.g.
ASCII graphics).

The editor shows the commit message in a configurable font that defaults
to the text font. This font is usually fixed-width, so that the margin
line can be shown after exactly 70 characters.

Patch Set 3:

In patch set 3, I changed the following:

- Do wrapping while the user is typing instead of at the end. This way, we don't have to restrain the size of the text area (which was a hack). It basically works like in vim with textwidth set. The only problem is that there's no easy way to reflow the text (command gq in vim), maybe this should be added as a context menu entry for a selection?

- The margin line is set to 70 characters to show where the wrapping will happen.

- Renamed the preference page from "Committing" to "Commit Dialog".

- Added more testcases for wrapping, fixing the mentioned bugs.

Patch Set 3:

Matthias: I will prepare another change for indicating that there should be a blank line, but after this one is done. It would also be nice if the header line would be shown in bold.
