DESCRIPTION

Fix sorting and grouping of staging entries by state

- group all states, states which require attention more frequently come 
  first
- also sort staged changes pane
- alphabetic sorting is the natural order and doesn't need explanation,
  hence name the button to toggle sort order "Sort by state" and use a
  new icon depicting that
- rename the comparator to StagingEntryComparator since it's now used 
  for both unstaged and staged changes
