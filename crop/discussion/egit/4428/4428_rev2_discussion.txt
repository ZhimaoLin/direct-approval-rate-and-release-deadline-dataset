DESCRIPTION

Fix exception when no review notes are available

When no code review has been done yet on the remote repository in Gerrit
the fetch operation throws an exception when there is the refspec
refs/notes/review:refs/notes/review. Since this is standard Git behavior
to expect a ref on the remote if there is no wildcard in the refspec we
do not add this refspec in this case.
