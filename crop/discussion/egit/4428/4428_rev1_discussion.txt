DESCRIPTION

Fix exception when no review notes are available

When there has not yet been done a code review on the remote Gerrit
fetch throws an exception when there is the refspec
refs/notes/review:refs/notes/review. Since it is standard git behavior
to expect a ref on the remote if there is no wildcard in the refspec we
do not add this refspec in this case.
