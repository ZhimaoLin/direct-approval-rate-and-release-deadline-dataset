DESCRIPTION

When running "Commit" action open staging view instead of commit dialog

Add a preference to allow switching back to the old behavior of the
commit action to open the commit dialog. By default it now opens the
staging view. After opening the staging view auto-select and set focus
on unstaged files if there are any, otherwise set focus on the commit
message.

The commit dialog is still used by CleanupUncomittedChangesDialog.

Looks pretty good when a trim stack is used, or when the staging view is large enough to be useful. Not that obvious when the staging view is visible already but too small to be useful.

Line:49, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CommitActionHandler.java -> PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay() seems to be the recommended way. See IWorkbench.getDisplay().

Alternatively use getShell(event).getDisplay().

Tests should probably set the new preference to false.
