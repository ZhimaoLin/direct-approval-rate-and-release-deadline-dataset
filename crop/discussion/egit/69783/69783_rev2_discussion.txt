DESCRIPTION

When running "Commit" action open staging view instead of commit dialog

Add a preference to allow switching back to the old behavior of the
commit action to open the commit dialog. By default it now opens the
staging view. After opening the staging view auto-select and set focus
on unstaged files if there are any, otherwise set focus on the commit
message.

The commit dialog is still used by CleanupUncomittedChangesDialog.

Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/CommitActionTest.java -> This is global data: needs to be reset xxx@xxx.xxx too. (In the other test classes, too.) Otherwise we may sooner or later have a surprise.
