It works but it's not obvious from looking at the code because CommitDialog.getCommitHistory() only returns a Set i.e. it is not clear that the set is sorted and if it is, what the sort order actually would be.

Patch Set 1:

You can manually test this by creating making multiple commits and then opening the commit dialog and hitting Ctrl+Space.

Previously the prior commit messages shown would be sorted alphabetically, now they should appear with the latest commit message at the top of the list, followed by the previous commit messages.
