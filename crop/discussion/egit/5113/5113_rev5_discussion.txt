Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

why does duplicate modify the original entry ? If there is a good reason to do that we should have a way to undo the copy step

Patch Set 5:

Duplcate just creates another item with the same name and value, it doesn't edit the original.

It was the same behavior as previous, where if you selected an entry and click the add button, it would create a another named entry with the same value.

Patch Set 5:

here the steps I tried:
- open configuration editor on a random repo e.g. C/.git/config
- select option "core.autocrlf"
- click duplicate button
- now I see 2 entries "core.autocrlf[0]" and "core.autocrlf[1]" this looks like the original entry was modified, in fact it's not: when persisting this I end up with 2 identical entries in the config file, this is at least confusing
- it seems there is no obvious way to change the key of the newly created copy, in place editing isn't available and there is no edit button, the only way to make use of this copy is to click "Open" and change the key in the text editor
- do I miss something here ?

Patch Set 5:

The duplicate logic is there in the case when you want multiple entries of the same key, such as fetch ref specs.

The suffix's given to duplicate entries ([0],[1], etc.) has always been there and are unchanged by this commit.

The duplicate button does the same thing as the bottom add button did previously when a value was already selected.

I could remove the duplicate button but then the user would not be able to add a second value for the same key since the 'New Entry...' dialog prevents that.

I was trying to retain all the use cases the previous design had for adding, editing, removing, and duplicating entries.
