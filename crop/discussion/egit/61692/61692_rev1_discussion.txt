DESCRIPTION

Make CommitViewerComparator work with generified ViewerComparator

The ViewerComparator(Comparator) constructor says the comparator is
meant "to sort strings", so we should pass a Comparator<CommitItem>.

The fix is optional right now, but you'll run into a compile error as
soon as bug 483190 has been pushed.
