DESCRIPTION

Small enhancement to the 'Configure Git Repository' dialog

When sharing a project (Team -> Share) it is required to specify a Git
repository location. In order to create a new repository it is
required to first select a project. But it was not possible to
select the project by clicking on the check box in front of it; the
user had to click somewhere else. With this patch the project also
gets selected by clicking on the check box.
