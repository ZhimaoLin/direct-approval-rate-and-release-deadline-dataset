DESCRIPTION

Small enhancement to the 'Configure Git Repository' dialog

When sharing a project (Team -> Share) it is required to specify a Git
repository location. In order to create a new repository it is
required to first select a project. But it was not possible to
select the project by clicking on the check box in front of it; the
user had to click somewhere else. With this patch the project also
gets selected by clicking on the check box.

I don't understand what this buys me. In fact, I don't think it is obvious to the user what the difference between the selected projects and the checked projects is.

Patch Set 1:

This issue seems to be specific to some plattforms. I have create a bug (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=331764) to explain the error in more detail. There are also screenshots attached to the bug that should make it easier to understand.
