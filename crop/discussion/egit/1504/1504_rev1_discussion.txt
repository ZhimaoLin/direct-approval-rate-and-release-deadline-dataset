DESCRIPTION

Supportability: Provide a Trace Configuration Preference Page

Since we have the infrastructure in place, we can now switch debug
tracing on and off in a running IDE. 
This can be very helpful in situations where we can't debug.
Unfortunately, there is no generic UI to do this,
so this adds a preference page to show the existing trace locations for
the EGit UI and EGit Core plug-ins and allows to activate them.
This page is generic enough to be easily extended to include the 
locations of other plug-ins as long as they use an .options file to declare
the locations (and don't do anything else in this .options file).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I wonder if this is something we want to provide out of the box... it's more of a debug utility for us imho... let's think about this a bit more...

I see your point. But we need to be able to tell a customer to send us a trace file...

If that's the case, I would be more lenient to have this feature available in the earlier builds. As we get more stable, we can consider removing this if it isn't needed anymore.
