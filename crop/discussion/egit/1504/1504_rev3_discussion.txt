DESCRIPTION

Supportability: Provide a Trace Configuration Preference Page

Since we have the infrastructure in place, we can now switch debug
tracing on and off in a running IDE.
This can be very helpful in situations where we can't debug.
Unfortunately, there is no generic UI to do this,
so this adds a dialog to show the existing trace locations for
the EGit UI and EGit Core plug-ins and allows to activate them.
The dialog can not be started from a "normal" UI control, but only
using CTRL-3 and triggering a dedicated command in order to avoid
polllution of the Preference UI.
