DESCRIPTION

Supportability: Provide a Trace Configuration Preference Page

Since we have the infrastructure in place, we can now switch debug
tracing on and off in a running IDE. 
This can be very helpful in situations where we can't debug.
Unfortunately, there is no generic UI to do this,
so this adds a preference page to show the existing trace locations for
the EGit UI and EGit Core plug-ins and allows to activate them.
This page is generic enough to be easily extended to include the 
locations of other plug-ins as long as they use an .options file to declare
the locations (and don't do anything else in this .options file).

please also rebase

Line:159, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/prefpages/TraceConfigurationPageTest.java -> this fails on Mac since there preferences are under Eclipse > Preferences ..., see [1] how to fix that.

I have to second Chris here, I also don't think this should be (at least in this shape) part of the regular install. What I could imagine is that the preference page is not visible by default and we can fire it up with a command. Using a command for this has the advantage that everyone can easily execute it via Ctrl+3 but it doesn't clutter the UI in any way. Opinions?
