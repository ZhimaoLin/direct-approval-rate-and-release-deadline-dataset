DESCRIPTION

[findBugs] Fix MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL occurrences

Make mutable static fields final to prevent malicious or
accidental modification. Also consistently order modifiers,
we prefer "final static". Exclude this check on the enum
RepositoryTreeNodeType where FindBugs reports false errors
- Java doesn't allow final on enum fields.
