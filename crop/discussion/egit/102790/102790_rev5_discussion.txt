DESCRIPTION

Respect gitattributes in the compare editor

Apply smudge/clean filters. Store the filters to be applied when
we create the interal GitBlobStorage and apply them when the stream
is opened. Unfortunately this requires quite a few interface changes
to pass through CheckoutMetadata.

Adds tests for the new behavior, including index edits.

Removes two unused classes that were left over from an earlier attempt
by emf.compare to move some things to EGit. That attempt has since then
been superseded by the mergeStrategy extension point, and emf.compare
does not use these two internal classes.
