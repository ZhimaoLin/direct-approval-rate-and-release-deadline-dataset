DESCRIPTION

Respect gitattributes in the compare editor

Apply smudge/clean filters. Store the filters to be applied when
we create the interal GitBlobStorage and apply them when the stream
is opened. Unfortunately this requires quite a few interface changes
to pass through CheckoutMetadata.

Adds tests for the new behavior, including index edits.
