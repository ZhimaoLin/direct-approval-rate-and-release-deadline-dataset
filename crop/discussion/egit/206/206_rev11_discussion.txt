DESCRIPTION

Fix EGit Tycho build

- Add missing pom-first dependencies as described in [1] to fix the build.
- Create EGit update site.
- The build of the update site assumes that egit and jgit are checked out
  under a common root folder, this is needed to refer to the JGit update
  site. If the layout is different the URL pointing to the JGit update site
  has to be passed to the maven build as system property jgit-site, e.g.
     mvn -Djgit-site=file:/C:/tmp/site clean install
  or
     mvn -Djgit-site=http://point.to.jgit/site clean install
- Introduce property for Eclipse p2 repository to prepare builds against
  other versions of Eclipse.
- Adding information about mailing lists, issue tracker and license.

This change depends on the following JGit change :

    BUT: since Tycho 0.6.0 target-platform-configuration has
         groupId org.sonatype.tycho !

This patch requires being online to build. That's un-git-ish.

Are you referring to reaching out to the Galileo repo or something else?
