DESCRIPTION

Fix EGit Tycho build

- Depend on JGit feature instead of directly bundling the JGit plugin.
- Add missing pom-first dependencies as described in [1] to fix the build.
- Create update site containing EGit and JGit.
- The build of the update site assumes that egit and jgit are checked
  out under a common root folder, this is needed to refer to the jgit
  update site. If the layout is different the URL pointing to the JGit
  update site has to be passed to the maven build as system property
  jgit-site, e.g.
     mvn -Djgit-site=file:/C:/tmp/site clean install
  or
     mvn -Djgit-site=http://point.to.jgit/site
- Refer to Eclipse p2 repository using property to prepare builds
  against other versions of Eclipse.

This change depends on the following JGit change :
