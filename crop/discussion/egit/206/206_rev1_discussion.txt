DESCRIPTION

Fix EGit Tycho build

- Import JGit feature into EGit feature instead of directly bundling the
  JGit plugin.
- Add pom-first dependency as described in [1] to org.eclipse.jgit to a lot of
  pom.xmls until Tycho honors this setting. Seems inheriting the
  target-platform-configuration to consider pom-first dependencies doesn't work
  correctly with Tycho 0.6.0.
- Add pom-first dependency to org.eclipse.jgit.junit to
  org.eclipse.egit.core.test as described in [1] to fix its build.
- Generated EGit update site doesn't yet contain the JGit feature, probably this
  is caused by a Tycho 0.6.0 bug.
