DESCRIPTION

To integrate Mylyn's commit templates an extension point
is needed. During the preparation of the commit
dialogs the extensions using this extension points will be
requested for a message to add to the dialog. At the moment,
this extension point is meant for internal usage only.

Here is a sample configuration:
<extension
    point="org.eclipse.egit.ui.commitMessageProvider">
    <commitMessageProvider
        class="org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.CommitMessageProvider">
    </commitMessageProvider>
</extension>
