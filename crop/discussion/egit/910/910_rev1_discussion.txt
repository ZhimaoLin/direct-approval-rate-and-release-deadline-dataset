DESCRIPTION

Specific support for importing GitHub URL-ish

The GitHub URLs for git+ssh access don't have a valid URL
(missing a protocol, uses a : as a separator between host and path)
so if the xxx@xxx.xxx is detected, replace with
xxx@xxx.xxx so that it will be parsed automatically.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

These URLs are not github specific. We should support them in general, not just for github. See http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html#URLS

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

EGit needs to be able to handle rsync/scp-like protocols of user@host:path/to/repo as well as URLs like xxx@xxx.xxx
