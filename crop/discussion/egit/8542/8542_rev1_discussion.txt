DESCRIPTION

Remove no longer needed org.eclipse.egit.psf-feature

and 3.6 are no longer supported, we don't need it anymore.

> how can we ensure that old psf feature is deinstalled on upgrade ?

Hm, I don't know. The old psf feature lying around may indeed cause problems because it contains this in org.eclipse.egit.psf-feature/feature.xml (for 2.1):

    <requires>
          <import plugin="org.eclipse.egit.core" version="2.1.0" match="equivalent"/>
          ...

So when upgrading egit.core to 2.2, the dependency will no longer be satisfied because 2.1 is removed, right?

Maybe then we first need to change this dependency to greaterOrEqual in this cycle and then remove it in the next cycle.

I guess there is a way to achieve uninstalling an obsolete feature using a p2.inf file [1]. I'll ask a local p2 expert what exactly we should do about that
