DESCRIPTION

Make sure all bytes are written to files on close, or get an error.

Java's BufferedOutputStream swallows any errors that occur when flushing
the buffer in close().

This class overrides close to make sure an error during the final
flush is reported back to the caller.

Patch Set 1:

I'm sorry. This patch depends on a patch with the same id in jgit. Is a duplicate id bad? Gerrit doesn't mind.
