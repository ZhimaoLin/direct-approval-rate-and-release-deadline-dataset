Patch Set 1:

Didn't know we have this preference :-)

In many other places we use JGit's DateFormatter, some but not all of them (history view, interactive rebase view) allow to switch between date format defined by locale and relative date format. ReflogView currently uses a hard coded date format, GitChangeSetLabelProvider is also using this preference.

Looks like date formatting and configuring the date format could be more consistent in EGit. We could extend the preference to also show the formats supported by GitDateFormatter and use the selected format consistently across EGit. Probably the default should be defined by the system locale. The hover over timestamps shown in history graph is ISO by intention in order to show the date in the timezone of the committer/author of the respective commit which can be useful for distributed teams working in different timezones.

That's a bit a taller order. Let's abandon this here, then. Don't know yet when I'll have the time to clean up date formatting across the board.
