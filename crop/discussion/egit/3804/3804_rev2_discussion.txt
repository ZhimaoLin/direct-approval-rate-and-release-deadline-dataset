DESCRIPTION

Generate pre-built help index - local PDE Build support.

This commit adds a pre-built help index when building with PDE build
(eg in the local workspace). As a follow-up of this change, the help
index building needs to be integrated for Tycho, or the added setting
in plugin.xml will lead to an error message when searching help the
first time.

nice :-)

I think this patch should wait until we also have a solution to also generate the help index during the tycho build since with the current tycho build this would provoke runtime errors due to the reference to the index which isn't yet available from the tycho build

Line:13, org.eclipse.egit.doc/customBuildCallbacks.xml -> style nit: trailing whitespace, many more below
