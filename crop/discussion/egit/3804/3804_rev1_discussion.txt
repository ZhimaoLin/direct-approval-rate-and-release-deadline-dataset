DESCRIPTION

Generate pre-built help index - local PDE Build / PDE Export support.

This commit adds a pre-built help index when building with PDE build
(eg in the local workspace). As a follow-up of this change, the help
index building needs to be integrated for Tycho, or the added setting
in plugin.xml will lead to an error message when searching help the
first time.
