DESCRIPTION

Interactive Rebase: Open Staging View in amend mode for the edit step

When the interactive rebase stops for editing a commit, the standard
workflow is that the commit to be edited has to be amended. To help
the user doing that we now automatically open the staging view in the 
amend mode.
