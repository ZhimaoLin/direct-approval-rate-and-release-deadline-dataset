DESCRIPTION

Fix SampleTestRepository (only required if applying JGit change 2440)

After checking out JGit change 'daemon: Use HTTP's resolver and
factory pattern' (I1efa6b2bd7c6567e983fbbf346947238ea2e847e,
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/2440), SampleTestRepository does not compile
anymore. With this fix the changed daemon API is used.
