Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this



Line:28, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/IEGitOperation.java -> There is actually no need to mention SubProgressMonitor. I merely brought SubMonitor up on the bug for the benefit of others that are not familiar with that class. :)

Just state what the monitor is for and whether null is allowed or not and such and keep xxx@xxx.xxx description "narrow" by only talking about IProgressMonitor, the interface.
