Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Whats not so nice for the user is the following:

If I have e.g. 

rebase.autostash false in global  and
rebase.autostash true in repository,

I get the following:

rebase.autostash [false][true]

But maybe that should be fixed in another change.

Patch Set 2:

You can change this by clicking the toggle button "Single Value", if this is down only the last / most specific value is displayed.

I am not sure if git config differentiates between a configuration option which has multiple occurrences in the same config file or in config / base config. From git-core you get the last, most specific value when using "git config --get <key>" and all values when using "git config --get-all <key>"

Patch Set 2:

Ah yes, I was puzzled by a case where I have two entries for remote.origin.fetch in the same config file and with "single value" I see only one of them. But you are right, the command line's --get and --get-all behave the same like our "single value" button.

But on the other hand then we do not have a possibility to show the really "effective" config, i.d. the one which is valid. AFAIU there are two types of config parameters: either more than one value is allowed or not. remote.origin.fetch is an example of the first case, rebase.autostash of the latter case. For the latter case, the user cannot tell from the line [false][true] which of the two values is the valid one.

But I see that we do not have metadata for each of the config parameters to decide what to display as "effective". So I think we should leave it as it is.

Patch Set 2:

yes, I think this depends on the specific configuration option, we need to add metadata for all supported configuration options to make this more useful. This should happen in another change.
