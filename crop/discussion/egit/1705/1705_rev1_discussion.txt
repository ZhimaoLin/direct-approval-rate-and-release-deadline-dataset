Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Currently, when EGit is installed nothing appears on the Welcome screen (Help->Welcome). With this fix, you'll see some content on the welcome screen now. I didn't catch this earlier because if you self-host with PDE, the files are there but not added to the build.properties so you don't see this issue until run time.
