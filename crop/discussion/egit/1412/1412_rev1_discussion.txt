I don't have an EGit development environment setup at work but I am not seeing any changes in RepositoryActionHandler. Its getSelection() method is still arbitrarily downcasting on returns from getVariable(String).

That's already been merged though and I don't think you can "reopen" stuff like you do in bugzilla? Or do you want me to inline the comment in there? The downcast occurs on lines 294 and 295.
