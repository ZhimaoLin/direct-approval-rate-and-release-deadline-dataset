DESCRIPTION

Add Configuration to Repositories View

This adds two things: first, support for the standard
"Properties" view in Eclipse which allows to maintain
simple properties, like user name and email directly and
secondly, it adds a "Remotes" node to the Repositories
View which allows to maintain remote configurations
(re-using the existing wizard pages as much as possible).
