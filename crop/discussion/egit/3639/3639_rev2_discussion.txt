DESCRIPTION

Revert "Remove erroneous StagingView form update"

This reverts commit 6f370ce86d418aad689c0b26a5bea12fc7776e6e. Since this
commit the commit message entered in the staging view was no longer
stored when moving the focus to a resource located in another repository
and also no longer restored when moving back the focus to a resource
located in the previous repository. Reverting this commit fixes this
problem.
