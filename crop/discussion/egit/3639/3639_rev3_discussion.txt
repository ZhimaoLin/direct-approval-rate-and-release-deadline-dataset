DESCRIPTION

Revert "Remove erroneous StagingView form update"

This reverts commit 6f370ce86d418aad689c0b26a5bea12fc7776e6e. Since this
commit the commit message entered in the staging view was no longer
stored when moving the focus to a resource located in another repository
and also no longer restored when moving back the focus to a resource
located in the previous repository. Reverting this commit fixes this
problem.

Line:924, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> doReload is always called from the Job and the Job change listener should be doing this update.  The block there however is slightly different to this one.

Line:879, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> instead of the above;

if (repositoryChnaged) clearCommitMessageToggles();
upateCommitMessageComponent(true); (probably can just remove the argument!)

then remove the changes below.

The commit messages are updated correctly (although perhaps they're being refreshed too frequently this way?)

Line:906, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> this will always evaluate to true
