DESCRIPTION

Switch to 3.5 trace infrastructure

This introduces the OSGI 3.5 trace infrastructure and replaces the
current minimal implementation with the proper one which
provides powerful features (automatic addition of method names,
thread name, line numbers and so on).
The next steps will be to instrument our coding and to provide
a UI for dynamically setting the debug options during runtime
and to add some tests.
