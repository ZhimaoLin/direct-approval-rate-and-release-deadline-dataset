DESCRIPTION

Implement compare mode toggle in history view

The compare mode toggle defines the action to be executed on double
click. With compare mode enabled the compare editor is launched.
With compare mode disabled an editor is opened to view the selected
revision. Executing Compare->With history... launches the history 
view with enabled compare mode (similar to CVS).
