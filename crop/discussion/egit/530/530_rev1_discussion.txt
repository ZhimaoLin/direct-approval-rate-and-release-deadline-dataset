Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

In and by itself, I don't quite see the advantage here. In fact, the class is only used within the outer class, so I would go so far as to make the inner class private (and perhaps also static) and remove the unused private members/constructors.

Patch Set 1: No score

It's a code quality issue. GitProjectsImportPage is too long to begin with, and I don't like seeing inner classes that are more than a few lines long; it gets difficult to know what class you're actually reading at a given point in the file.

I actually don't mind this refactoring as inner classes have some issues associated with them.

Oops, sorry to bother again: the IImportStructureProvider member of the outer class is always null and should be removed (along with the method parameter in the inner class and the corresponding logic).
