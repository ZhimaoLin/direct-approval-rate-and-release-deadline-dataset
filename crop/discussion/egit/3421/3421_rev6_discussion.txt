Patch Set 6:

* Rebased
* Added support for excluding non-commit-tags like spearce-gpg-pub in egit repo

@Kevin:
I'm not sure about that idea, because synchronization view gives more options then simple 'Compare with...'

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

this seems not to work, I still see tags not pointing to commits, when trying to synchronize on these I hit:

org.eclipse.jgit.errors.IncorrectObjectTypeException: Object 8bbde7aacf771a9afb6992434f1ae413e010c6d8 is not a commit.
	at org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk.parseCommit(RevWalk.java:726)

...

also the menu label should be changed to "Synchronize" (without "...") as it doesn't open a dialog or wizard but the dynamic submenu
