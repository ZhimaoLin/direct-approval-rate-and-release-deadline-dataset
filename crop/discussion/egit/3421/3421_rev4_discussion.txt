Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

- I like this change :-)
- the dynamic menu also shows Ref for tags which don't point to 
   commits (e.g. Shawn's public GPG signing key tagged "spearce-gpg-
   pub" in egit repo), I think these should be filtered out as synchronize
   doesn't know what a public GPG key is good for
- may you could add a separator between the different Ref types in the 
   submenu

I would prefer one root Synchronize menu entry with the other options available as children. We shouldn't clutter the Team menu root as much. Other than that, this change looks awesome.

Patch Set 4:

@Matthias:
* To be honest I don't know how to remove "spearce-gpg-pub" tag from this list. As far as I investigate it, this tag is also shown by `git tag` command.

* OK, this idea seam to reasonable.

@Chris:
I think that if we move all synchronize actions into separate sub menu we will loose a little bit on usability. Because to be able to launch 'Synchronize Workspace' action user need to enter sub menu with can be annoying.
