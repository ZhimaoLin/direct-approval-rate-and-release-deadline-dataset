DESCRIPTION

Use "Show Revision Information" instead of "Show Annotations"

"Show Annotations" is not very user friendly, as annotations are
associated by Java developers with Java annotations. "Show Revision
Information" transfers the information what will happens if I select
this menu and is in line with "Hide Revision Information" which is
already used.
