> What's the problem?

1. Make sure API problem reporting is enabled by following these instructions, use EGit 2.2 as baseline:

http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Checking_for_JGit_API_Changes_using_API_Baseline

2. Wait for workspace to rebuild

3. It should report errors in CoreText and UIText (before this change)

This change fixes the errors by updating the filters.
