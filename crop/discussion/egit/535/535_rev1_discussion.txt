DESCRIPTION

Egit Push uses wrong URI/RefSpec

When using the push wizard with a remote configuration
instead of a custom URI, the push wizard wrongly
uses the fetch URI/RefSpecs instead of the Push URI/RefSpecs.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

that was an obvious bug. Strange that it was not detected
on the previous review.
