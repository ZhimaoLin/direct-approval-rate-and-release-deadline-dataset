DESCRIPTION

RepositorySelectionPage: wrong page checks

The RepositorySelection page does wrong checks. To reproduce open the Push
wizard on some repository that has a usable remote configuration for pushing.
Set the radio button to "Custom URI" and clear the URI field. Now the "Next"
button should be disabled. When switching back the radio button to "Configured
remote repository", the "Next button should again become enabled and the
URI field should become read-only.
