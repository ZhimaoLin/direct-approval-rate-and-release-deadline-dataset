DESCRIPTION

RepositorySelectionPage: wrong page checks

The RepositorySelection page does wrong checks.
To reproduce open the Push wizard on some repository
the has a usable remote configuration for pushing.
Set the radio button is to "Custom URI" and clear the
URI field. Now the "Next" button should be disabled.
When switching back the radio button to "Configured 
remote repository", the "Next button should again become
enabled and the URI field should become read-only.
