DESCRIPTION

Add OperationLogger.java and log the operations that change HEAD

You can see logs of operations that change HEAD successfully with
reflog. However, reflog is not suitable to log failed operations
such as "failed to checkout because of non-commited files" or
"merge conflict occured". This commit adds start, end, and error log
to operations that change HEAD. These logs are useful for diagnosis
of problems or training of git operations.

This is not even logging into a console. It logs into the normal Eclipse OSGI log, and via that into the "Error Log" view.

Such extensive info logging should not be done. It'll be a major nuisance for people who have set the "Error Log" view to activate on new entries.

If we wanted to have such tracing, it should be done via the already existing tracing mechanisms. That also gives a preference setting to enable/disable such traces. Also note that exceptions are already logged in general where appropriate. Blindly logging any exception is not good.

No, unless you plan to log into an Eclipse console view. If that is the intent, I could push my prototype for this that I mentioned in that bug report.

But for problem diagnosis and git training, the textual trace file produced by the Eclipse tracing infrastructure may be good enough.
