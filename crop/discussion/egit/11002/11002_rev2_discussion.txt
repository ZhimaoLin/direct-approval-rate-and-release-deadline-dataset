DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Improve usability of "Replace with" on missing

Only provide one of the equivalent options for a file that has been
deleted. For this to work, we now distinguish between missing MISSING
and MISSING_AND_CHANGED (which has changes in the index). For the latter
we still have to provide both options.

See also I65601162f7ef506ea270933218601322fde1e929 where the same change
was done for modified files.

- "Replace with HEAD" in Staging View for a staged deletion doesn't seem to do anything
- it works when issued from the parent folder in Team menu
- "Remove from index" in Staging View for a modified file doesn't work anymore

> "Replace with HEAD" in Staging View for a staged deletion doesn't seem to do anything, it works when issued from the parent folder in Team menu

Works here, did you test with anything special (e.g. nested project?).

> "Remove from index" in Staging View for a modified file doesn't work anymore

Also works here.

Can you make sure that it's this change which is the problem (try same thing without this change)?
