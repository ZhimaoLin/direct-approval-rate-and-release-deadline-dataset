Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:229, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitUI.java -> Why is this done only for JGitInternalException? It would also make sense for e.g. GitAPIException. So perhaps we could always return the cause (if not null).

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please add signed-off tag.
