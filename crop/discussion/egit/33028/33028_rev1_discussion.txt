DESCRIPTION

Add "Repository" submenu in Team menu of files and folders

Allows to access repository-wide actions such as Push, Pull, Fetch and
Switch To in the context menu of files and folders.

Hopefully, having these actions be in a submenu named "Repository"
should make it clear that they don't only act on the selected resource,
but the whole repository.

Patch Set 1:

* can you move up the "Repository" sub-menu above the "Advanced" sub-menu (in the same section), this way the order of actions is more similar to the one in the menu on projects and you need much less mouse movements to reach the sub-sub-menu "Repository > Switch to > ..."
* can you also add "Push to Gerrit..." and "Fetch from Gerrit..." if Gerrit was configured for the repository (green Gerrit decorator shown on the repository)
