DESCRIPTION

Add "Repository" submenu in Team menu of files and folders

Allows to access repository-wide actions such as Push, Pull, Fetch and
Switch To in the context menu of files and folders.

Hopefully, having these actions be in a submenu named "Repository"
should make it clear that they don't only act on the selected resource,
but the whole repository.

Good ideas, done!

Also found out that the "Advanced" submenu wasn't working when using the editor context menu, fixed in parent change.
