DESCRIPTION

Fix inefficient implementation of GitScopeOperation

The problem before was that it executed an expensive "git status"
operation for each resource, even when the resource was in the same
repository.

It now processes the resources grouped by repository and uses the cached
index diff data from IndexDiffCache.

looks good, but I would feel better if some test would cover this method
