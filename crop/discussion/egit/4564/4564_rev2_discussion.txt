Patch Set 2:

It's better than before but personally I'd not put the project name into the dialog at all: the user knows what he did a second ago and the dialog is modal.

Also I would not repeat the title but just inherit from TrayDialog instead of TitleAreaDialog and add a message area (Text control) in AbstractBranchSelectionDialog.

Patch Set 2:

Other dialogs seem to include the resource name selected such as the delete confirmation dialog and the Replace With > Local History... dialog
