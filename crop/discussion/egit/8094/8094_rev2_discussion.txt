DESCRIPTION

Allow "Push to Gerrit..." to push to refs/drafts/...

This change replaces the label displaying the "refs/for/" prefix by a
Combo which allows to select different types of prefixes for Gerrit.
Currently the classic "refs/for/" and the "refs/drafts/" prefixes are
available, but more could be added easily.
