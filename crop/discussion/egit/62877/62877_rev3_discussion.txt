DESCRIPTION

Use the shared license file scheme for the EGit feature

There is a shared license feature that can be used by feature plugins.
When using that shared license feature, we no longer have to keep and
update these license files in our own feature plugins.

good idea, though the shared license feature needs to be added to the target platform definition

Line:8, org.eclipse.egit-feature/feature.xml -> * in which p2 repository can this feature be found ?
* It needs to be available in the egit target platform otherwise the build can't resolve it

Line:8, org.eclipse.egit-feature/feature.xml -> * Seems to be https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/cbi/ according to bug 394793.
* In the target platform? It should be a build/packaging time dependency only.
