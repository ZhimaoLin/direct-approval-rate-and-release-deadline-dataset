DESCRIPTION

Support state [removed, untracked] in commit dialog

Currently files which are removed from the index but exist in the
working directory are displayed as "removed" in the commit dialog.
Committing the change removes the affected files from the repository.
Now the files are displayed as "removed" and "untracked"
and committing results in committing a change to the affedted file.
