DESCRIPTION

Fix StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in ConfigureGerritAfterCloneTask

This is caused by ignoring that uri might be URL encoded. Since URIish
already does URL decoding use URIish.toString() instead of the raw uri
string to fix this problem.

Patch Set 2:

uriDecoded is not actually decoded (still has %20 in it), so path is not found, and exception is still present
URIish toString calls format with false for escapeNonAscii, which seems to end up calling:
r.append(getRawPath());
which I think was defined:
rawPath = u.toURI().getRawPath();
which I think has escapes in it.
trying toASCIIString yielded similar results though in a different way

This alternative method for baseURL worked for me:
String baseURL = u.setPath("/").toString();
baseURL = baseURL.substring(0, baseURL.length()-1);
