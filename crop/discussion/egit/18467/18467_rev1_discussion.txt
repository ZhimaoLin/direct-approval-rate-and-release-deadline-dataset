DESCRIPTION

Update file count on clearing filter

If a filter string in the commit dialog is cleared using the clear
filter button inside the text input control, then the number of files
was not updated.

There seems to be no appropriate listener for filter changes, therefore
I had to add the label update to the refresh job of the tree viewer.

Thanks, nicely! Other subclasses also override doCreateRefreshJob, so this seems to be the way to go.
