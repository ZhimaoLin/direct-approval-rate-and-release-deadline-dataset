Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think your change improves the graphical layout of the history view but I have some style nits:

Try to find a clearer commit message for your change. Also start it with an upper case letter.

I believe you want to say that in the history view the graphical tags used to mark tags, branches and symbolic refs were not exactly aligned horizontally with the log message header of untagged entries.

Find some more comments inlined.

Line:145, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SWTPlotRenderer.java -> style nit: extra blank before textsz.x

Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SWTPlotRenderer.java -> style nit: missing blank after comma

Line:153, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SWTPlotRenderer.java -> style nit:
the following order of arguments
(cellX + x, cellY + ...
would be more consistent with other similar statements

Line:156, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SWTPlotRenderer.java -> style nit: missing blank after + operator and extra blank before textsz.x

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

I am sorry, I wanted to change this patch, but something went
wrong, and the new version is now a new patch.

Therefore I just abandon this.
