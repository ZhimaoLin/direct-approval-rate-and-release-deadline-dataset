DESCRIPTION

Removed unnecessary 'Everything is EPL' statements in README

When the project was stored in the same repository as JGit, this
made sense. However, this only contains EPL code and the top of
the notice already says as much.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Inserted blank line between subject and rest of commit message so `git shortlog` and `gitk` present the information right.
