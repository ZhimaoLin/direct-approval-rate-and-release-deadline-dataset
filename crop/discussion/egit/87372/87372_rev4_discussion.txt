DESCRIPTION

Prefer to change to existing local branch when fetching Gerrit change

When attempting to fetch a Gerrit patch set which the user has already
fetched they are now presented with an option to change to the already
fetched branch. This is the default option if a local branch exists. If
no local branch exists for a ref this option is not available.

Patch Set 4:

I'm still having controls be pushed off the page in some situations.

eg. open a dialog where the checkout existing branch option is pre-selected, then select the checkout as new branch option.
