DESCRIPTION

Prefer to change to existing local branch when fetching Gerrit change

When attempting to fetch a Gerrit patch set which the user has already
fetched they are now presented with an option to change to the already
fetched branch. This is the default option if a local branch exists. If
no local branch exists for a ref this option is not available.
