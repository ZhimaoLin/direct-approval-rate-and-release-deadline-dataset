DESCRIPTION

Eliminate file handle leaks

Running the SWTBot test suite on a windows environment highlights an
insidious file handle leaks coming from the WindowCache used in
conjunction with JGit parsed repositories. ".pack" files are opened for
reading and thus locked for deletion until the repo is properly closed,
but EGit might not keep a reference towards this repository in its
cache, "forgetting" to close it when needed. This is mostly true for
sub-modules.

This patch also gets rid of other random errors, sometimes due to a
.project not properly removed...

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 removes the line that was adding an url to the "push" remote configuration: this was useless in getting rid of the particular random error I was facing.

will upload fixed version in a minute

Line:225, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> we don't want such comments in the code, such context should go into the commit message

Line:441, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewContentProvider.java -> unnecessary comment, put such hints into commit message

Line:10, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/view/repositories/GitRepositoriesViewTestBase.java -> you only changed this header ?
