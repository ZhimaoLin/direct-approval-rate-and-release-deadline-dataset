DESCRIPTION

Eliminate file handle leaks

Running the SWTBot test suite on a Windows environment highlights
insidious file handle leaks caused by JGit's WindowCache which keeps
".pack" files open for reading and thus locked for deletion until the
repository is properly closed, but EGit might not keep a reference
towards this repository in its cache, "forgetting" to close it when
needed. This is mostly true for sub-modules.

This patch also gets rid of other random errors, sometimes due to a
.project not properly removed.

Patch Set 3: (2 inline comments)

also update javadoc for RepositoryCache

Line:232, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> call close is a try/finally statement

Line:441, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewContentProvider.java -> This should be done in a finally clause since lookupRepository may fail

Robin, should I create an updated patch built upon Matthias' changes, or I let you do it? (since this has already been merged, I don't really know how to proceed)
