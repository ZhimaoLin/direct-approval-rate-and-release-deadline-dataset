Patch Set 2:

Aren't those single quotes wrong as well, actually even more wrong as I assume " vs ' is a question of style while '' vs ' is a matter of syntax.

Patch Set 2:

Single quotes have to be escaped with an extra ' in properties file to be displayed.

'{0}' would be ignored during formatting while ''{0}'' still formats the argument but wraps it in single quotes.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The patch fixes the reported problem. I filed https://bugs.eclipse.org/363805 for more issues related to variables and single quotes.

I have to take back my previous +1: the patch removes property keys but it leaves the constants in UIText. This results in many warnings when starting, like e.g.

!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2 1 2011-11-15 14:58:07.861
!MESSAGE NLS missing message: SynchronizeFetchJob_TaskName in: org.eclipse.egit.ui.uitext

Looking at the diff I'm not seeing any removed keys.

I tried again. Looks like something went wrong when I applied the changes. Sorry for the false alarm.
