DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Show rebase buttons if rebase is in progress

In order to enable showing a conflict warning when there are unresolved
conflicts we need to enhance RepositoryState in JGit to provide
additional states representing rebase with conflicts. This will be done
in another change.

Patch Set 8:

- as soon as conflicts are resolved it is valid to create a new commit before continuing the rebase operation, hence I think we should not hide the commit button
- as soon as conflicts are resolved or as soon as rebase interactive comes into play (Tobias sitting next to me is working on that) I may want to amend the current commit hence I think renaming or hiding the commit message composite would be irritating
- will try to find a better visual layout for the buttons, don't want to waste space to keep the view usable on smaller screens

Patch Set 8:

I wasn't thinking of hiding the commit message section, but positioning the rebase buttons above it, like this:

Pushed this as Ib56342edbb0c3cd9391220183522e70b1e1c78d3 on top of this one if you want to experiment.
