DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Show rebase buttons if rebase is in progress

In order to enable showing a conflict warning when there are unresolved
conflicts we need to enhance RepositoryState in JGit to provide
additional states representing rebase with conflicts. This will be done
in another change.
