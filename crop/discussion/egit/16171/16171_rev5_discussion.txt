DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Show rebase buttons if rebase is in progress

In order to enable showing a conflict warning when there are unresolved
conflicts we need to enhance RepositoryState in JGit to provide
additional states representing rebase with conflicts. This will be done
in another change.

Patch Set 5:

.equalWidth(true) caused the buttons to be clipped when the view is small

So I changed the layout to use 2 cells for the commit&push button since it has a much wider label and gave up on equal button width. With that the clipping only occurs when the view gets smaller than the width needed for the buttons.

Any SWT wizard who has a better proposal for this layout problem ?
