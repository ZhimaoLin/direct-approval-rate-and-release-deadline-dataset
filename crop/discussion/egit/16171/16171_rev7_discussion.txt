DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Show rebase buttons if rebase is in progress

In order to enable showing a conflict warning when there are unresolved
conflicts we need to enhance RepositoryState in JGit to provide
additional states representing rebase with conflicts. This will be done
in another change.

Nice that we finally get this, see inline comments.

Regarding the UI, has it been considered to place the rebase buttons in its own "Rebase" sectuion, and put it *above* "Commit Message"?

One argument for that placement would be that the flow of the user interaction should be from top to bottom. In case of a typical rebase, what the user does after resolving conflicts is click on "Continue", and the commit message and commit buttons are not used. With the current placement, the commit message and commit buttons have to be skipped visually.

An argument against that is that in the case of a merge with conflicts, the button to click at the end is also at the bottom right, "Commit".

So I'm not sure what the best thing is here. Opinions?

If we leave the placement below commit message, I think we should change the section title from "Commit Message" to something else or put the rebase buttons in a "Rebase" section (but leave them at the bottom).

Line:439, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Do we also need to remove this on dispose?

Line:2046, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> We should use `!indexDiff.getConflicting().isEmpty()` here, not read the index. It's faster, corresponds to the file state shown in the view and allows to get rid of the exception handling.

Line:1571, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> In other places, we changed this to "Skip commit". Would also be an improvement in the staging view, but maybe it uses too much space?

Line:1587, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> How about reusing the labels, e.g. UIText.ContinueRebaseCommand_JobName for continue?
