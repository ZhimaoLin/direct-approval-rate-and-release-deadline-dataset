DESCRIPTION

Show rebase buttons in staging view if rebase is in progress

In order to enable showing a conflict warning when there are unresolved
conflicts we need to enhance RepositoryState in JGit to provide
additional states representing rebase with conflicts. This will be done
in another change.
