DESCRIPTION

Use ResourceUtil.getFileForLocation in StagingEntry.getFile

The util method now includes more logic for finding the right one, which
should also apply e.g. for Show In actions.

Additionally, selectionIncludesNonWorkspaceResources in StagingView now
uses StagingEntry.getFile instead of implementing similar but not quite
the same logic.

This fixes some strange behavior with nested projects.
