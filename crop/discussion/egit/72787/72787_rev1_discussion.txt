DESCRIPTION

[releng] p2.inf to make smartimport update the old importer fragment

org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport must override a possibly already
installed org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer fragment. Since old importer
fragments were lacking a host bundle version constraint, they might
otherwise be active even after an update and then cause conflicting
requirements, leading to a failure to resolve and activate the
org.eclipse.egit.ui bundle.

Patch Set 1:

I've never used p2.inf files before, so I don't really know if this does what it should, nor how to test it. Would be good if somebody who knows this stuff could look at it.

I guess we'll keep seeing this SmartImportWizardTest failure until Mickael's fix for bug 493606 is in the Neon staging repo :-(

Perhaps we xxx@xxx.xxx this test until then.
