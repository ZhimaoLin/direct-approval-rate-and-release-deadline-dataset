DESCRIPTION

[releng] p2.inf to remove the old importer fragment

org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport must override a possibly already
installed org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer fragment. Since old importer
fragments were lacking a host bundle version constraint, they might
otherwise be active even after an update and then cause conflicting
requirements, leading to a failure to resolve and activate the
org.eclipse.egit.ui bundle.
