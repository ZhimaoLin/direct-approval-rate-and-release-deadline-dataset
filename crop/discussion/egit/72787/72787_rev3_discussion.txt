DESCRIPTION

[releng] p2.inf to remove the old importer fragment

org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport must override a possibly already
installed org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer fragment. Since old importer
fragments were lacking a host bundle version constraint, they might
otherwise be active even after an update and then cause conflicting
requirements, leading to a failure to resolve and activate the
org.eclipse.egit.ui bundle.

Patch Set 3:

Tested this with a Mars.2 with EGit 4.3.1 including the old importer fragment without host bundle version constraint, and a maven-generated local repository.

Updating this Eclipse through "Install New Software..." from the local EGit update site gives the following:

If the Neon staging repo is not available:
* de-installs org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer
* upgrades EGit to 4.4.0
* does not install org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport (correctly, because this is >= 4.6)

(I don't quite understand why it de-installs importer if it then does not install smartimport...)

If the Neon staging repo is available:
* de-installs org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer
* Upgrades the Eclipse to Neon and EGit to 4.4.0
* installs org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport

I could not get upgrading via "Check for Updates" to work. Probably that does not connect to my local update site but to the one registered in the org.eclipse.egit-feature feature: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates . That one doesn't (yet) contain this p2.inf file and thus does not de-install org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer. If that's correct, we'd have to re-test that part once we do have this p2.inf in the official update site.

Patch Set 3:

One problem remains: if someone de-selects the smartimport fragment before starting the upgrade (i.e., leave only EGit, JGit, and the gitflow stuff selected), the old importer fragment will not be de-installed and remain active and break EGit.

I tried with a similar update clause in org.eclipse.egit.ui/META-INF/p2.inf, but that didn't work. No idea how to solve that problem with p2.inf.
