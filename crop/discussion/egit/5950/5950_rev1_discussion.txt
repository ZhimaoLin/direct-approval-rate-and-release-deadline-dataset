DESCRIPTION

Select use/create option when projects are in repositories

If all the projects being shared are already in a repository
then preselect the user/create option.

This combined with the project being prechecked in the table
allows the user to share a project without doing any explicit
actions and just clicking 'Finish' button for cases where the
projects they are sharing are already in Git repositories.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I found the following problems:

1)
- disconnect a project to detach git team provider
- share it again
- the checkbox is set as expected and the project gets shared again
- but the branch/repository decorator on the project isn't shown without an excplicit refresh on the project, it seems some refresh is missing

2)
- delete a git shared project from workspace 
- import it again using "Import existing projects..."
- in this case the checkbox isn't set automatically

Patch Set 1:

I believe Problem 1 exists before this change and isn't affected by it but definitely should be fixed.

I'm not sure I understand Problem 2 since you mention import but this only affects the sharing wizard which isn't used by the import projects wizard.
