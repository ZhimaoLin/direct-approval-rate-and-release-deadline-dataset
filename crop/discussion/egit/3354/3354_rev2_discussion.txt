DESCRIPTION

Save evaluation context to allow isEnabled to use caller's context

When an action implements isEnabled() the method setEnabled() is
used to set the evaluation context prior to the isEnabled() call.
Prior to this change the implementation would obtain the global
context rather than use any specified by the caller.
