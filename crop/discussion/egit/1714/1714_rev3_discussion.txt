DESCRIPTION

Add commit hash to history view table

When comparing two revisions from the history the compare view
shows the commit hash next the file name but from the history view
table it was not possible to identify revisions by commit-id.
To find out which revision is which you needed to select a single
revision from the history view and then check the detail pane for
that commit.
