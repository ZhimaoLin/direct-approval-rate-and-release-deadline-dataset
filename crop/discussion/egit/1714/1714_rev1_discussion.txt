DESCRIPTION

Add commit hash to history view

When you compare two revisions from the history it showed the
commit hash next the file name but from the history view table it was 
not clear which revision is which. To find out which revision is which
you needed to select a single revision from the history view and
then check the detail for that commit.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

Works fine. I just wonder if we should offer this without also offering an opportunity to search for the ID. From the coding, it doesn't look to difficult to add this.
I think users would become frustrated if they can see the ID but not search for one...
