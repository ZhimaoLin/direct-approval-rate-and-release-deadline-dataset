no, this was coincidence with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/43768/ being merged, I rebased your change on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/43888/ which adapts the EGit build to the removal of the java7 bundle

Thanks Matthias!!
What I have done in this patch is changed the remoteName datatype to Combo and guess it is affecting the UI test as well.
Let me check it in detail and revert back with the alternate way to implement it. 
let me check it again locally and upload the code if any changes.

Thanks Matthias
Guess the remoteName datatype change might have caused the trouble in UI test. Because that's the only change I have done.
Let me check in detail again and will find a alternate way to implement it.

Patch Set 4:

this doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your implementation, if your implementation looks like what you want to achieve you need to adapt the UI tests accordingly in order to fix the broken tests.
