File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.target/egit-4.4.target -> revert this unrelated and unnecessary formatting change

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> this comment is unnecessary, you can find this easily using git blame

Line:237, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> this comment is unnecessary, this information is already captured in the git history and can be easily retrieved e.g. using git blame

Line:240, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> all texts shown to the user need to be externalized to enable translation to other languages

I didn't understand the meaning of this label, maybe better:

 "Use host name as remote name"

If I check the checkbox the remote name switches to the host name but I should also be able to go back, so when unchecking the checkbox the default should flip back to origin (or if the user typed something different then it should flip back to this value)

alternatively we could use an editable combobox to define the remote name and prepopulate it with the two default proposals

 origin
 <host name>

Line:246, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> style nit: remote the generated comments and the unnecessary blank lines

Line:254, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/CloneDestinationPage.java -> remove the generated comment and replace it by

 // empty

I think the idea of a combo which can be populated with useful names would be better than locking into hostname (i.e. for github the hostname is pointless)

so for github url like: https://github.com/maxandersen/org.eclipse.mylyn I should be offered:

origin 
github.com (host)
maxandersen (user/organization)

Combo box idea seems a prompt way to implement this feature as it have all the details simply put out without much user interference.

I have already done the changes with combo box which looks more elegant.

@Max: Also adding the username/organization gives makes more sense and it gives the user much flexibility in the way the local branch is referred

Will implement this feature as well now and push it for review
