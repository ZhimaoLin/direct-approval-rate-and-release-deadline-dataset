DESCRIPTION

Separate scheduling rules for branch creation and project restoration

We cannot restore projects in a post-action of the BranchOperation:
the branch operation may have the affected projects as scheduling rule,
while project restoration needs the workspace root.

Refactor BranchOperationUI to do the tracking explicitly, and to run
the restoration in a separate IWorkspaceRunnable.
