DESCRIPTION

[sync] New 'Git Commits Model' implementation

New less memory consuming implementation of 'Git Commits Model'. It uses
cache providers added before for retrieving data from repository instead
of calculating changes in every model object.

This is only beginning of rewriting 'Git Commits Model'. Next commits
will ensure that cache objects are created only once and completely
destroyed after synchronization.
