DESCRIPTION

[sync] New 'Git Change Set' implementation

New less memory consuming implementation of 'Git Chagne Set'. It uses
cache providers added before for retrieving data from repository instead
of calculating changes in every model object.

This is only beginning of rewriting 'Git Change Set'. Next commits will
ensure that cache objects are created only once and completely destroyed
after synchronization.
