I added a 6 seconds timeout to FetchOperation, and this caused failures that I could get rid of with this change. But apparently that wasn't the cause.

Does hudson save the screenshots (org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/screenshots) somewhere?

It looks like only commiters have access to this part of hudson build.

I've taken latest version of screenshot named testFetchFromOrigin(org.eclipse.egit.ui.view.repositories.GitRepositoriesViewFetchAndPushTest).jpeg and put it on imageshack:
