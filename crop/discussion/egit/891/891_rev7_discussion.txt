DESCRIPTION

Update to latest JGit API

* Change to use FileRepository throughout most of EGit.  Too much
  of the code currently has assumptions about the repository being
  on the local filesystem, accessible by java.io.File.  Use the
  file specific repository type to better describe the dependency.

* Replace getWorkDir() with getWorkTree()

* Replace openObject(), openBlob(), hasObject() with the newer
  short style open() and has().

* Always treat blobs as InputStreams when possible.  This ensures
  that even on very large files, EGit won't explode the JVM heap
  and cause an OutOfMemoryError.

* Adapted to the new style RepositoryListener interfaces, which
  promises better long-term API stability.

* Replace static DirCache read() and lock() with Repository
  instance methods, further hiding the storage method of the
  working directory's index.
