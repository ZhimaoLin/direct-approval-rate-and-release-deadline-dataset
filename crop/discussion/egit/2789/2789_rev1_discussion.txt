DESCRIPTION

SynchronizeTest: increase timeout

On Hudson,

SynchronizeViewTest.shouldExchangeCompareEditorSidesBetween
IncomingAndOutgoingChangesInGitChangeSet

fails after 10000 ms. The total time for running this locally is
already in the range of 8 seconds. Increasing the timeout may fix the
issue on Hudson.
