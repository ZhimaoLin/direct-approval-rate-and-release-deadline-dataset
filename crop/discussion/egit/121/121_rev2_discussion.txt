This behaves like "Compare with->History..." in the CVS module. So I think the user would expect to see a view with the revisions of the file. I do not know GIT terminology that well because of my CVS background. Maybe we should rename the menu entry to make it clearer.

Apparently the code is already present, we just didn't link it into the UI?  I'd like it if the commit message explained what was really going on here, like "this action was created in commit X but wasn't enabled in the UI".

Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> What's going on here, bad indentation on this element?  Can we avoid changing it while adding new functionality?  I'd prefer to have pure whitespace fix patches be isolated.

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Should be translated through a property.

Also, shouldn't we have a tooltip?

I replaced it in 1b66794e691d9614ef0005e9fdece89b915a8546, but the remained. Then Shawn removed the replacement in 92a1cc82904b37476abb47d6462b40b0ce375e9b.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm not sure what this does, or is supposed to do. This git history page flashes and the selected revision changes, but nothing visible happens. 

Looking at the code makes me scratch my head. Seems the class is some legacy from the time when I did not know much at all about Eclipse...

I think we should bring up a compare dialog. The old history page actually had some logic like that as an indirect action, but the current version doesn't.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> The eclipse plugin editor does these things.
