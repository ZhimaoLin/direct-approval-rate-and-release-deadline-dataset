DESCRIPTION

Create ProjectRecord from .project file instead of parent

The project root folder was previously passed to the ProjectRecord
constructor incorrectly causing issues when tracking projects where
the root folder differs from the name in the .project file.

Now the '.project' file is passed to the ProjectRecord constructor
when restoring projects on a checked out branch.
