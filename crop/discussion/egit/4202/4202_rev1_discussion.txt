DESCRIPTION

Improve handling of notes commits in History View

When he FETCH_HEAD pointed to refs/notes/* the notes commits were shown
in History View if the "Show all Branches and Tags" button was selected.
Normally this is not what the user expects.

With this commit the notes commits are not shown anymore per default.
Instead there is now a new action and a corresponding preference which
controls if the notes commits are shown
