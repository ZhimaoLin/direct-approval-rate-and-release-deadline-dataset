Line:850, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Should this similarly call unstage instead of deferring to the action?

That way stage/unstage is consistent across drag and drop and menu actions

Line:850, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> The action "Replace with file in Git Index" does not perform an unstaging operation. It replaces the working tree version of a file with the version in the Git Index. Effect:
File is staged and modified => file is replaced with the staged version
File is modified and not staged: file is replaced with the HEAD version.
