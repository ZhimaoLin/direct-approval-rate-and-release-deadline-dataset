DESCRIPTION

Harmonize JDT project settings for EGit

This harmonizes the JDT project settings across EGit projects. It also
introduces a clean-up profile which is based on the JGit clean-up
profile but with modifications based on common review feedback
(for-loops, no brackets for simple if statements).

Patch Set 1:

I'm not sure about the "Use blocks in statements: Only if necessary" cleanup, because it will result in cases like the following:

    if (condition)
        try {
            doSomething();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            handle(e);
        }

We want braces here for the if block to make it clear.

Patch Set 1:

The avoid unnecessary braces cleanup is (imho) broke since it does the "cleanup" at any depth. Turn it off.

Patch Set 1:

In JGit we have less strict requirements on test code, e.g. we do not require javadocs, nor do we require externalization of strings.

Line:3, org.eclipse.egit.core/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs -> What's the difference between cleanup and sp_cleanup? Some are different

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

So it seems it's not possible to agree on a common setting. There are different compile settings between egit.ui and egit.core. Also, the cleanup feature in JDT does not support the requirements in an easy way.

Patch Set 1:

We could harmonize a bit more. The serious NO here is the reformatting of statements

Other than that and the lesser javadoc requirements on test bundles, I'm sure all other differences are accidental.

Patch Set 1:

Oh, and not flagging strings in JGit was intentional because we used to have such a large number of non-NLS strings.
