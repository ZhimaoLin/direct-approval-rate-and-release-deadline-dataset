DESCRIPTION

Improve usability of sharing wizard

Having an ellipsis in the "Create..." button's text gives users the assumption
that a dialog will come up before the real action is triggered hence the ellipsis
is removed.

In order to improve consistency the label for the ".git" postfix is enabled together
with the edit field for the repository to be created.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/sharing/ExistingOrNewPage.java -> Please introduce a constant for ".git" part: there are several places where this 'magic string' used and I see no reason to introduce an another one.

Thank you.
