DESCRIPTION

Resources should be opened in the most specific project

Some types of resources, e.g. Java source files, must be opened as
a member of the right project. Knowing which project to reference is
somewhat fuzzy, but we assume the most deeply nested projhect is the
right one.

Line:181, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ResourceUtil.java -> Could the code from here and above be extracted into one generic method? Logic looks good.

Line:181, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/util/ResourceUtil.java -> I suppose, if we need it elsewhere...
