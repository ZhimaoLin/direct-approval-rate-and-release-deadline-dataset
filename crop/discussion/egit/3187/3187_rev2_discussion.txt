Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

this doesn't compile as this patch series isn't based on your first patch series but requires class RepositoryCommit :
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3141
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3165
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3168

to fix that rebase this series onto the other one

Line:49, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorPage.java -> we don't use author tags
