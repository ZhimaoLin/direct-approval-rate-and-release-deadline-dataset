DESCRIPTION

Introduce "Compare mode" for Git Staging view similar to History view

A Compare Mode was introduced. Therefore a new property and a action to
change the value were created. The if the property is set to false a
double click on a file in the staging view will open it in the
workbench. To allow the user to switch the mode a action was added to
the toolbar of the view and to the view menu. Furthermore a entry to the
popup-menu was added to allow the user to compare a file with index.
