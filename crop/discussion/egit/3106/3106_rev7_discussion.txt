DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add a 'Staging' view

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
the working directory and index.  Such an operation would be
synonymous to adding the modified files to the index and tracking
the untracked files. Other operations like committing is also
possible from the view's context menu.

Requires jgit change I43c13eb72a44f80135c93525fce0c0280b0e64a2 for
conflict support in IndexDiff

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This changeset
* converts to the 2 pane horizonal view
* removes modified overlay and just uses the > indicator
* renamed StagedNode to StagingEntry
* fixes the naming on the UI objects
* correctly shows partially staged decorations

Open issues from previous comments
* implement a job (general performance/UI threading issues too?)
* implement exception handling (not sure on the correct approach for eclipse plugins)

Patch Set 7:

The commit pane still grabs more horizontal space than necessary according to auto-wrapping limit.

The vertical distance between the checkboxes isn't consistent (the bottom one has a bit larger distance).

Drag&Drop doesn't yet work, right ?

I noticed that when a project shared with git is selected and then the staging view is opened via "Window > Show View > Git > Staging View" the selection isn't used to fill the staging view initially, so you have to click the project again to get the staging view filled with the data for the repository this project is in.

Adding Jens as a reviewer to comment on your last two open points.
