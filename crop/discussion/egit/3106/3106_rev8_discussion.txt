DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add a 'Staging' view

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
the working directory and index.  Such an operation would be
synonymous to adding the modified files to the index and tracking
the untracked files. Other operations like committing is also
possible from the view's context menu.

Patch Set 8: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check in

Looks good as first iteration. Has been submitted to IP review. Hence blocked via IP review flag until CQ has been approved. 

Subsequent iterations should be done in additional changes depending on this one to not invalidate the started IP review process for this first part.

Patch Set 8:

Shouldn't the commit message be adapted to the content of the change? Is that still possible now that the CQ is started?
