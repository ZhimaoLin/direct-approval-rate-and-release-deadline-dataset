DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add a 'Staging' view to streamline the workflow of staging
changes

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
nodes to place modified or untracked files into the staging area.
Such an operation would be synonymous to adding the modified files
to the index and tracking the untracked files. Other operations
like committing is also possible from the view's context menu.

[ms]:
- rebased to current master
- fix unhandled InvocationTargetException in StagingView.java

[bl]
- rebased original implementation from Remy
  (I5fb81a1811cf6f2aff22016438c664fc5014b9a5)
- updated to remove deprecated api usage
