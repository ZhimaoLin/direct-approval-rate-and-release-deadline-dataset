DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add a 'Staging' view

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
nodes to place modified or untracked files into the staging area.
Such an operation would be synonymous to adding the modified files
to the index and tracking the untracked files. Other operations
like committing is also possible from the view's context menu.

Requires jgit change I43c13eb72a44f80135c93525fce0c0280b0e64a2 for
conflict support in IndexDiff

rebased to adapt build to new target version 1.0.0

I like this approach it looks much better now :-)
Mainly since the layout is much more clear and has the right focus for the task we want to accomplish with the staging view

I also like the idea to use the current selection to decide which repo is of interest.

Though some ideas for further improvement:
- the staging view should have an explicit label showing for which repository the status is currently being displayed
- the staging view should also follow if the focus is set on a repository using the repositories view
- the file lists should be sorted, maybe there could be options for different sorting criteria (alphabetically, file status)
- on a big screen this layout works well on a small laptop screen we need a way to see the full path of the files in the lists, this requires more horizontal real estate for the file lists (maybe we could have an option to stack the two lists vertically) or we make the lists themselves more compact by something similar to compressed package option in package explorer

Line:23, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/GitXStagedNode.java -> we should remove GitX from these class names as we just borrow the ui layout idea but don't depend on their implementation
