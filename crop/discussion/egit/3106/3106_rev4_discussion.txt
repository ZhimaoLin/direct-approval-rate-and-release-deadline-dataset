DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add a 'Staging' view

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
nodes to place modified or untracked files into the staging area.
Such an operation would be synonymous to adding the modified files
to the index and tracking the untracked files. Other operations
like committing is also possible from the view's context menu.

Requires jgit change I43c13eb72a44f80135c93525fce0c0280b0e64a2 for
conflict support in IndexDiff

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Initial attempt at adding a gitx like UI for the staging view.  I've left the tree implementation in place for the moment and added this version along side.
