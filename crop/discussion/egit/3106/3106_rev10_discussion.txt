DESCRIPTION

Add a 'Staging' view

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
the working directory and index.  Such an operation would be
synonymous to adding the modified files to the index and tracking
the untracked files. Other operations like committing is also
possible from the view's context menu.

Staging view is a great thing. I like the UI layout.
I have some concerns regarding the update of the staging view using reload (calculating IndexDiff). IndexDiff.diff is very expensive on big repos. On the other hand IndexChangedEvent / RefsChangedEvent occur in many situations. So I'm not sure if it's feasible to update the view based on these events.

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Why to reload if event.getRepository differs from currentRepository?

Line:109, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Why to reload if event.getRepository differs from currentRepository?

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Only reload if repository changed.

Line:353, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> yes, should be moved to a Job. An example can be found in GitHistoryPage.scheduleNewGenerateHistoryJob.
