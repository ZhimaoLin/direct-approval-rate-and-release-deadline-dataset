DESCRIPTION

Add a 'Staging' view

Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
the working directory and index.  Such an operation would be
synonymous to adding the modified files to the index and tracking
the untracked files. Other operations like committing is also
possible from the view's context menu.
