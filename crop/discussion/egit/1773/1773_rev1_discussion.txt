DESCRIPTION

Let Repositories View show detached HEADs and special refs

Repositories view was displaying HEAD under "Symbolic References".
But it did never show a detached HEAD. Also the special refs
MERGE_HEAD and FETCH_HEAD are never displayed. This is fixed
by not displaying symbolic references anymore but all the
references which are not shown under Branches and Tags. Maybe
we should also rename the tree node to "References" to tell
that not only symbolic references are shown here.

This bug depends on Change 1772. Don't merge this before we
have merge this (JGit) change

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I have prepared a change which also renames the parent to
"Named References" and allows for checking out and creation on
branches on these references.
This is independent from the JGit changes, and I'll upload this to Gerrit as soon as I have access again.

Patch Set 1:

I see from your comment that you have a change which renames the node to "named refs". I would prefer "Refs", the common thing among these refs is not that they are named, but that they are all refs which are no branches and no tags. Hard to find a good name - so I would just call them Refs.

This proposal has nothing to do how to name the node but how to get the additional nodes from JGit. Since we are currently changing that part in JGit I suggest that I fix here only the JGit dependent part and that you independently do the renaming and enabling of actions on these refs.
