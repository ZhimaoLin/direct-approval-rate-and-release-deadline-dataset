I reopened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=484915 to also get the upgrade of the EGit Hudson rolled back which fixed the gerrit-trigger issues for the JGit Hudson

Patch Set 8:

As far as I can tell, this breaks command enablement on text selection in the editor. In the RepositoryView, and in the PackageExplorer it still works. Sorry I can't provide more help right now. Too busy.
I started extending the command enablement tests, though, which will also cover the text selection.
