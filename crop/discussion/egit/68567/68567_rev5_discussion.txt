DESCRIPTION

Fix repository search dialog to detect .git files under selected root.

The search did not detect working tree with .git file in selected root
folder. It always looked in sub-folders only and in case of .git folders
it worked fine. Now it also checks the selected root folder additionally
to its children. The Git private folders like .git folder itself are not
traversed anymore.

This prepares EGit to still properly detect git repositories when
JGit change "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/" adds the evaluation
of ".git" file with "gitdir" link to worktree and evaluates commondir.
