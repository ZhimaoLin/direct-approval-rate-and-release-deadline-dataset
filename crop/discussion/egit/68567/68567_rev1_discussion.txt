DESCRIPTION

Fixed repository search dialog to detect .git files.

The recursive search did not detected working tree with .git file in
root folder. It always looked in sub-folders and in case of .git folders
it worked fine. Now it first checks the selected root folder and then
looks in sub-folders if selected. The Git private folders like .git
folder itself are not traversed anymore.

This prepares EGit to still properly detect git repositories when
JGit change "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/" adds the evaluation
of ".git" file with "gitdir" link to worktree and evaluates commondir.

The two tests are broken now, because they expect that search is working for very first sub folders of root without enabling "Look for nested repositories". But now it stops searching at root level without this option. I did not expected nested search if it's not enabled from user point of view, but anyway should it behave like it was before?

Yes it should.

root is the directory where I have my git repositories. In my case, ~/git . Inside that, my clones of remote repositories reside. So I have ~/git/repo1/.git, ~/git/repo2/.git, etc. That's why the code did look and must look in the children of root. Further levels are traversed only if the "look for nested repositories" option is enabled.

That behavior must be preserved. With different worktrees, I suspect I'd have an original clone at ~/git/original/.git, and then created a second worktree at ~/git/original_maintenance/.git.
