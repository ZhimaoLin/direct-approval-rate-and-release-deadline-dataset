DESCRIPTION

Fixed repository search dialog to detect .git files under selected root.

The search did not detected working tree with .git file in selected root
folder. It always looked in sub-folders only and in case of .git folders
it worked fine. Now it checks the selected root folder additionally to
it's children. The Git private folders like .git folder itself are not
traversed anymore.

This prepares EGit to still properly detect git repositories when
JGit change "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/" adds the evaluation
of ".git" file with "gitdir" link to worktree and evaluates commondir.

Hm, i do not know if the test error "org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Widget is disposed" is related to my changes or just temporary one.

Patch Set 2:

Looks like something is amiss. The screenshot from the failing test looks strange.[1] Why are there so many (old) FirstRepository instances?
