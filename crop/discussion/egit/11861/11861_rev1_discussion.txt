DESCRIPTION

Avoid using a .git directory that is not a repo

Don't assume that any .git directory with a file named 'config' in it 
is a git directory. This is especially wrong for $HOME/.git which 
typically contains nothing but a file named 'config'.

Otherwise you end up indexing the "repository" $HOME.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The user config is in a file called $HOME/.gitconfig, not in $HOME/.git/config, see http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_files

Apart from that, more checking doesn't hurt IMO.
