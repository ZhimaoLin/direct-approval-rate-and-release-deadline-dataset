DESCRIPTION

Avoid using a .git directory that is not a repo

Don't assume that any .git directory with a file named 'config' in it 
is a git directory. This is especially wrong for $HOME/.git which 
typically contains nothing but a file named 'config'.

Otherwise you end up indexing the "repository" $HOME.

Patch Set 2:

You're right about .gitconfig -- I completely overlooked that. For some reason I had parts of my .gitconfig as $HOME.git/config.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: extra whitespace

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's probably ok to do some extra checking, but the backgroup comment, I do not understand: Why is "$HOME/.git"  /typically" not  a repository?
