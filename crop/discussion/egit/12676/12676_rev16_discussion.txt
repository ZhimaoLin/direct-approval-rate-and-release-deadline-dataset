DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Add presentation options (list, tree, compact tree)

This adds different options for presenting the unstaged and staged files
in the staging view.

"List" is the same as before, just a flat list of files, e.g.

  file1 - src/org/eclipse
  file2 - src/org/eclipse

"Tree" shows the files in a full folder tree, e.g.

  * src
    * org
      * eclipse
        * file1
        * file2

"Compact Tree" shows the files in a folder tree where folders that have
just one subfolder do not result in a node, e.g.

  * src/org/eclipse
    * file1
    * file2

When an expanded node is dragged from one tree to another
(stage/unstage), the expanded state should be preserved.

Patch Set 16: Code-Review+1

As discussed on the bug, integrated the hierarchical compressed mode into this change. Due to this, the code in content provider could be simplified. Other changes:

* Preserve expanded state of folders when staging/unstaging
* Presentation mode changed to enum, for better type safety
* Presentation labels renamed, see bug
* Use ResourceUtil when finding IContainer for location (for nested projects)
* Various cleanups

Line:1133, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> isEmpty() isn't available in Java 5, our BREE is still J2SE-1.5

Line:1506, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> style nit: no braces around single line block

Line:1822, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I don't get why you rename this method from updateDirCache()

Line:1133, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Thanks, fixed. Ok if I push a change with sets it to Java 6 (just for EGit)?

Line:1506, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Done

Line:1822, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I guess it was for symmetry with selectEntryForStaging. But renamed back to updateDirCache now.
