DESCRIPTION

Fix synchronize with deleted resources

ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.members() must return *all* resources
known to the subscriber, whether they exist in the "workspace" or not.

Otherwise resources that were deleted will be missed.

Furthermore, isSupervised() must also work for IContainers, not just
for files.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

Unfortunately it fails other tests. Git is special since it wants to not report .gitignored resources and untracked files only if a preference is set. Also, it now reports folders that have no changes inside as changed. More work to do...
