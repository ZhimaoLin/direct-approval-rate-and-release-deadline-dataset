DESCRIPTION

Cleanup temp dirs after test execution

Currently the EGit Core Suite fails to clean up the temp directories
in my user dir. Instead of only deleting the working dirs, we now
use the deleteTempDirs to ensure we cleanup everything that we
create during the testrun. Also renamed getTempDir to createTempDir
to reflect the real intention.
