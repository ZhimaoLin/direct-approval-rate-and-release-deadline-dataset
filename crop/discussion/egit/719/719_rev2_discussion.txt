DESCRIPTION

Git Label Decorations of "detached" HEAD

In the case of "detached" HEAD, currently, there is only
the commit ID (truncated) shown in the Project label decoration.
This fix implements the suggestions collected in a mail thread
on the egit-dev mailing list by adding the information which
tag or remote branch is pointing to the currently checked out
branch.

changed-id is only needed if you have more than one patchset ;-) in order to tell gerrit that this is not going to be a new independent change

Right, you can certainly get by without it but when I've submitted patches without it I've been told to correct it. :)

This is fine.

I'm not happy having our Activator get really busy here with holding the singleton instance of RepositoryUtil but for now, this is OK.
