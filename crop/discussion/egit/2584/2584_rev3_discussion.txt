DESCRIPTION

[sync] Clean up in SynchronizeViewTest

Use global INITIAL_TAG value instead of creating unique tag in test cases.

All waits for synchronization finish can be removed because
launchSynchronization() method adds specialized hook for synchronization
finish.

All common code was moved into private methods and then reused.
