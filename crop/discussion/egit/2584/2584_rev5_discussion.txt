DESCRIPTION

[sync] Clean up in SynchronizeViewTest

Use global INITIAL_TAG value instead of creating unique tag in test cases.

All waits for synchronization finish can be removed because
launchSynchronization() method adds specialized hook for synchronization
finish.

All common code was moved into private methods and then reused.

Rebased to current master. Still fails sometimes, don't know why. But it's better than before. So let's take this as a base for further improvement.
