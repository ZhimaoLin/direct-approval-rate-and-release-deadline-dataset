DESCRIPTION

Histroy View: improve "enablement" caclculation.

With the new command-based menu contributions implemented for
the history view, we get lots of

"Could not get the current input from the history view"

messages in the log. This is because the enablement if calculated
even if the history is not visible at all.

This change does the calculation properly.
