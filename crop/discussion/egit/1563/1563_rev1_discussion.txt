DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Fix bug with hierarchical branch layout

Currently, the hierarchical branch layout wrongly includes symbolic
Refs, resulting in duplicate entries if the hierarchical branch layout
is active; for example, if there is a Ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD pointing
to refs/remotes/origin/master, then in the hierarchical branch layout
the "master" branch will appear twice:

Remote Branches
  origin
  		master
  		master
 
The fix filters out symbolic Refs during child calculation.

Patch Set 1:

When a remote tracking branch is checked out the HEAD symbolic ref isn't shown at all, but the file HEAD still exists in the .git folder.

Is that intended ?

This behavior is totally unrelated to this change. We already have bug 324183 for it.

I'm OK with this.

Line:87, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/BranchHierarchyNode.java -> We may want to have a utility method in the future that returns all refs that aren't symbolic, but for now this is fine...
