Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:224, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/ContainerTreeIterator.java -> non-technical, shouldn't that be translatable ?

Line:31, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/coretext.properties -> trailing whitespace ? or is an argument following here ?

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ListRemoteOperation.java -> I think this should be externalized
