Patch Set 2: No score

We need clarification if the reflog messages are translated.

See mail on http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg00976.html.

Line:109, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/BranchOperation.java -> I'm not sure if we translate this. I ask on the mailing list.
