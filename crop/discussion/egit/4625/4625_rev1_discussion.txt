Patch Set 1:

I did not review the code but only tested it from a user perspective.

It looks good to me in general. However, there is one use case which is now no longer consistent:
1. 'Push...'
2. click 'Finish'
   ==> This pushes all branches which I think is wrong.
       'Finish' should be disabled in my opinion.
       Filed bug http://bugs.eclipse.org/363904 for that.
3. in the result dialog click 'Configure...'
==> with the current patch set it now indicates that it pushed the current branch but this is not true.

I think we should go with this patch set and fix bug 363904.

Good catch. Thanks.

I'll fix that in a subsequent commit.

(Bugzilla seems to be down at the moment, therefore I answered here)
