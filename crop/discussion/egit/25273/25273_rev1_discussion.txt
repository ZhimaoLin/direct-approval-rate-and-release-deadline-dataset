Focus the first control in "Delete repository" dialog

dialog.

Patch Set 1:

The first check box is already focused here (before this change). Is it platform-specific? I'm using Linux (GTK).

Patch Set 1:

When I type a space after opening the dialog, the first checkbox gets checked, so the functionality is working like you describe it. But there is no indication of the currently focused control before hitting space and I have to guess what it will do.

With my change, I see a nice dotted focus indication around the label of the first checkbox directly after opening the dialog.

This is Windows 7.
