nice improvement :-)

Good idea to mimic staging view to display stash details. Though a few things should be fixed to make the stash view more consistent with the staging view:
- The git decorators in the stash commit viewer don't match the corresponding decorators shown by staging view before creating the stash. I think this should be fixed, I'll attach a screenshot to bug 436224.
- The sort order of files shown in stash commit viewer doesn't match the sort order shown in staging view, see screenshot.
- Double click on a file in the staging view opens a compare view, double clicking a file in stash view doesn't but opens the file version. I think this should be fixed so that stash view also shows compare view, add a context menu to allow opening the file version.
- The list of parents shown in the stash commit viewer could indicate what's the content of each of them, instead of showing
 
 Parent: <commitId1>
 Parent: <commitId2>
 Parent: <commitId3>

we could show:

 Previous version: <commitId1>
 Index: <commitId2>
 Untracked: <commitId3>
