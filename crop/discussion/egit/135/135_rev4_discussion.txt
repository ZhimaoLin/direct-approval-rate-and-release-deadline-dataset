DESCRIPTION

Flipped EGit to manifest-first maven-3/tycho build

New org.sonatype.tycho groupId https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/TYCHO-312
Workaround for https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/TYCHO-168

Removed checkNotNested. Conventional maven project layout results in the following
repository nesting

parallelip-egit <= egit source tree root
  /.git
  /org.eclipse.egit.core.test
    /target
      /work
        /data <= test workspace
          /.git
          /.metadata
          /Project-1

Disable checkNotNested as a short term solution, but in the long term we need to
reintroduce this check with mechanisms like Git's GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES to make
sure it does not produce false positive during maven build.

I think this should be rebased on top of Robin's change I0d39eaa6. He has removed checkNotNested so this patch set will just provide Tycho build.

Patch Set 4: No score

Egit build does not currently filter any resources and I configured it just to suppress warning messages. I used UTF-8 as per comment from Matthias, but changed it to ISO-8859-1 now. Either encoding won't affect build results until resource filtering is actually activated for egit build. You can read more about resource filtering here http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/resource-filtering-sect-description.html.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

can we rename the projects to have "." as the separator instead of "-", other than that, it's all good!

I propose we refactor the project names in a separate change since this is independent from switching to Tycho.
