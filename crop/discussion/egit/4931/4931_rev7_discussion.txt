DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Open/close projects when switching branches

Store which projects are imported on each branch and
add/open projects when a checkout is done

Close projects that don't exist on branches being checked
out and reopen them when the previous branch is checked out.

There is a new preferences on the 'Projects' page for
this behavior and it is enabled by default
