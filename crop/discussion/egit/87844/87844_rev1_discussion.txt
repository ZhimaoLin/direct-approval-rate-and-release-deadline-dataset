DESCRIPTION

[duplicate code] Unify branch/ref content assist handling

PushToGerritPage and GerritConfigurationPage contained nearly identical
code for content assist. Additionally, UIUtils also had a very similar
method.

Add a generic variant and replace the three existing implementations by
that.
