DESCRIPTION

Respect .gitignore in Synchronization view

Respect repository wide .gitignore configuration in Synchronize view.

In changes set implementation I didn't found better way to achieve this
goal, then getting list of not ignored resources in particular container
before creating list of it children. Maybe this could be done better,
but for now I don't have any idea how.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This does not yet work:

- clone jgit
- do some changes and commit them to have some food for synchronization
- create a file with some content at org.eclipse.jgit/target/a.txt
- create a file with some content at org.eclipse.jgit/b.txt
- create a file with some content at org.eclipse.jgit/testignore/c.txt
- add /testignore to org.eclipse.jgit/.gitignore to instruct git to ignore all files under /testignore
- on project org.eclipse.jgit click Team > Synchronize and select
local .git repo master branch as source (check the local change checkbox) and origin/master as the target
- result:
   - org.eclipse.jgit/target/a.txt isn't shown : good, don't know yet
if this is due to derived-ness of target folder or due to git-ignored folder
   - org.eclipse.jgit/b.txt is shown as it's neither Eclipse-derived nor git-ignored : good
   - org.eclipse.jgit/testignore/c.txt is shown : bad, this should be ignored
- double check by clicking Team > Commit : this doesn't show org.eclipse.jgit/testignore/c.txt -> gitignore is working here

Patch Set 2:

The testignore folder is included by 'Workspace' and 'Java Workspace' model's. This change add support for .gitignore only for 'Git Change Set' and 'Git' model's.

As far as I know there is no possibility to add .gitignore support to this two default model's.
