DESCRIPTION

Respect .gitignore in Synchronization view

Respect repository wide .gitignore configuration in Synchronize view.

In changes set implementation I didn't found better way to achieve this
goal, then getting list of not ignored resources in particular container
before creating list of it children. Maybe this could be done better,
but for now I don't have any idea how.
