DESCRIPTION

Update EGit to match ref API changes

JGit changed the way some ref updates are exposed to applications:

  * getOrigName() is now just getName()
  * Ref is an abstract class, use getRef instead to find HEAD.
  * writeSymref() has been replaced by RefUpdate

This commit depends upon the following JGit changes:
  * I1093e1ec2970147978a786cfdd0a75d0aebf8010
  * I26b9287c45a4b2d2be35ba2849daa316f5eec85d
