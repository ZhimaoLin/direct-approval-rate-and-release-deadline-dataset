DESCRIPTION

Don't show files message if no failing paths

Previously a line of "The following files..." would
be shown even if the merge result had null or empty
failing paths.

This now handles the case in the message when no paths
are present and also allows RevertFailureDialog to be
created with only a map of paths to reasons.
