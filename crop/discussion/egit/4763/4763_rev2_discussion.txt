DESCRIPTION

Don't show files message if no failing paths

Previously a line of "The following files..." would
be shown even if the merge result had null or empty
failing paths.

This now handles the case in the message when no paths
are present and also allows RevertFailureDialog to be
created with only a map of paths to reasons.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

When revert hits a merge conflict I still see the progress dialog open and another error dialog opens at the top of the screen (looks pretty ugly) which says that the revert of commit xyz did not complete successfully but it doesn't disclose this is caused by a conflict which I should resolve, stage to declare conflict resolution and commit to seal the deal. This seems to be caused by the fact that we only check for failing paths but not for the merge result.

Patch Set 2:

This commit was only aimed at fixing an NPE, it does not change the appearance of the revert failure dialog when failing paths don't exist but unmerged paths do.

I would be happy to improve it to show what unmerged paths exist and instructions for committing them but it should probably be in a different change since it will required a JGit change to the RevertCommand to expose the unmerged paths.
