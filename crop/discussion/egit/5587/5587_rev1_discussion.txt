- works nicely
- I think the proposed icon is hard to distinguish from the icon used for "Reset...". As "Add to Index" is represented by a green "+" icon, maybe we could instead use a red "-" sign for "Remove from Index" ?

Patch Set 1:

A "-" icon is suggesting untrack, which this isn't. The name of the used operation is also wrong. Reset is a close cousin, hence the similar icon (if we need an icon...)
