Patch Set 1: No score; No score

I wonder if we should do the logging unconditionally instead if an error occurs, exception when an InterruptedException occurs

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm convinced this is just hiding a problem. My guess is that the RCS jobs is not being cancelled properly and join just
ignoores the job instead of waiting for it to finish, but why?

Patch Set 1:

Furthermore it wont' even workaround the problem. You will
get an NPE in the trace, when enabled instead.
