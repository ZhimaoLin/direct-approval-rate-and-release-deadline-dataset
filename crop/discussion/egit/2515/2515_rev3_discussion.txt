Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

we also need org.objenesis since that seems to be used by mockito

see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg01895.html

did you generate the iplog entry using jgit iplog tool or did you change that manually ?

Patch Set 3:

I've create CQ 4957 for reusing org.objenesis. When it'll be approved I'll (this time) generate .eclipse_iplog using jgit and push updated patch set.

Patch Set 3:

you can also leave the iplog unchanged, we anyway update it before every release
