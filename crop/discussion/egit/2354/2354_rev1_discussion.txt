Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

First of all, information about bug number that particular change should fix we put above Change-Id (see for example this commit http://egit.eclipse.org/w/?p=egit.git;a=commitdiff;h=15e0da03955f554d642d2afee779a09ed3d376bb).

Secondly, we use first line of commit for providing a short topic about what this change does (by convention it should have less than 60 character), then we insert a blank line and after that we put some more detailed description about commit message (80 characters in line).

Non-workspace files appears in sync-view but you cannot see what was changed because the compare view cannot be launched for it. This isn't a full functionality that we would like to have.

Line:67, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/factories/GitAdapterFactory.java -> This code is somehow connected with topic of change?

I suppose not, because even when it is commented the non-workspace files and folders appears in sync-view
