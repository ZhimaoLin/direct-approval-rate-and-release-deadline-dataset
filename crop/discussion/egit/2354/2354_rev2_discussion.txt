Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Same as before, changes in non-workspace files cannot be viewed but such files appears in sync-view.

Please see inline comment

Line:62, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/factories/GitAdapterFactory.java -> If you replace this line with those:

IFile res = root.getFileForLocation(obj.getLocation());
if (res == null)
	res = root.getFile(obj.getLocation());
return res;

You will get an default icon for non-workspace files ;)
