DESCRIPTION

Support for symlinks in compare editor

This change makes compare editor works same way the git diff works for
symlinks: it shows *not* the diff between the file or folder contents,
but diff for the symlink target paths.

The compare editor gives a convenient way (given both bug 484498 and bug
484491 patches are merged) to modify symlink target in the IDE, without
using command line tooling.

Bug: 484494
