Does this work on Windows? Also, this only works for links outside the workspace. It doesn't handle links inside the workspace (in an open project): shows left (workspace) the contents of the linked-to file, right (index) the content of the link itself, i.e., the file name of the file being linked to.

Line:95, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/compare/LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement.java -> Do we have to care about UnsupportedOperationException here, or can we be sure that since isSymbolicLink() == true, the operation is supported? Same question also below.

Line:96, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/compare/LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement.java -> What about encoding?

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/compare/LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement.java -> Again: what about encoding?

Why not, but I have to test.

Arrgh, on Linux "broken" links aren't "inside" the workspace because workspace doesn't support them. On Windows I see that broken links shows up as files with null bits so Eclipse can show them.

Broken, I'm going to fix it.

Right.

Thanks for the review, I will update it soon.

I hadn't realized this was about _broken_ links. I tried with valid links. Next time I'll also try broken links.

I've originally wrote this for broken links but now see that the behavior is different if links are changed to valid files. I will update the code.

Actually I see right now on Windows that git CLI shows full text diff for file content if link target is changed to a valid file - or the MINGW environment doesn't really create symbolic links.
