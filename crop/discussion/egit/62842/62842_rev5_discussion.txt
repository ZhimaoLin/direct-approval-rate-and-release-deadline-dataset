DESCRIPTION

Support for symlinks in compare editor

This change makes compare editor works same way the git diff works for
symlinks: it shows *not* the diff between the file or folder contents,
but diff for the symlink target paths.

The compare editor gives a convenient way (given both bug 484498 and bug
484491 patches are merged) to modify symlink target in the IDE, without
using command line tooling.

Bug: 484494

Patch Set 5:

> Sorry, still no cigar.
 > 
 > The first problem is now not any better:
 > 
 > 0. Start off with a valid link in the workspace, pointing to
 > another file in the workspace. (Link created with ln -s in shell,
 > committed in shell, then pulled in EGit.)
 > 1. Select "Context menu->Compare with index" and edit the workspace
 > link's contents (append a zero to make it invalid -- assuming there
 > is no such file). Save.
 > 2. cgit correctly reports the link as modified. But it doesn't
 > appear at all in the git staging view!

I can reproduce this problem on Mac OS X  10.11.2
