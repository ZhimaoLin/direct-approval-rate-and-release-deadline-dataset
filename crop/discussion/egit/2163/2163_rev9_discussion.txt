DESCRIPTION

Simplify Fetch and Push second part: Add a simplified Push wizard

A new pair of "Push to upstream"/"Fetch from upstream" menu actions is
added to the team menu as well as the Repositories View. When clicked,
the relevant remote is detected (either upstream configuration of the
currently checked out branch, or "origin"), and the push/fetch is
tried for this configuration if possible.

If the currently checked out local branch is configured to use "." as
upstream (i.e. the local Repository, because the branch is based on
another local branch), the actions are disabled.
In any case, after the fetch/push, the user can click "Configure..."
on the push/fetch result dialog in order to inspect or change the
configuration.

Alternatively, the user can use the new "Configure Fetch from
Upstream..." and "Configure Push to Upstream..." menu items in the new
"Remote" sub-menu available in the Team context menu to do the
upstream configuration.
Also, the "Fetch from..." and "Push..." actions (with the advanced
wizard) were moved to that new sub-menu to reduce the size of the Team
menu.

When configuring the Push, there is a small wizard that allows to
easily select the correct branches etc. For the Fetch case, there is
currently only a rather technical dialog, which should be replaced by
some wizard asking questions like "Do you use Gerrit to push to" in
order to let the user make the right decisions.

Patch Set 9:

>When configuring destination ref for Fetch, the auto-proposed Ref doesn't contain the remote name mentioned in the first page of the configuration wizard. This says for my example: "Fetch configuration for remote "origin"" but the auto-proposed destination Ref for the source Ref "refs/heads/*" is "refs/remotes/*" instead of the expected "refs/remotes/origin/*"

Fixed.

>Didn't find a way how to configure Push refspec for "Push to upstream" if no push refspec is defined at all but only fetch refspec.

Not sure what the problem is. The table control is disabled and says something like "Pushing to all branches", but you can still press the "Add" button to override this.


>Result dialogs only pop up for a very short time and then disappear automatically (on Mac OS X 10.6.6). This way the result dialogs are useless.

Need to debug this on a Mac

>Trying to "cancel" a running fetch or push operation takes a long time until it's cancelled.

Looks like a shortcoming of the Transport implementation

>some UI tests are failing:

Fixed
