DESCRIPTION

Provide access to the absolute path of the git storages

We've implemented IStorage#getFullPath() in such a way that the
underlying resource is unresolveable for any client not aware of git
innards. This opens a new API to allow such clients a workaround so
that they may access the path if the needs arises.

Patch Set 1:

Blocks Ic23e7e8061ea4e9c87aff0f5f329d4486d562766 since a third-party tool cannot currently work around these erroneous 'paths' without relying on very dirty tricks (see the changes introduced by said commit to see examples of these... for example in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/36025/1/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide/src/org/eclipse/emf/compare/ide/utils/ResourceUtil.java where we randomly try to remove parts of the returned paths, without solving all of the issues).
