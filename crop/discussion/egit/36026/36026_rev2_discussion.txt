DESCRIPTION

Provide access to the absolute path of the git storages

We've implemented IStorage#getFullPath() in such a way that the
underlying resource is unresolveable for any client not aware of git
innards. This opens a new API to allow such clients a workaround so
that they may access the path if the needs arises.
