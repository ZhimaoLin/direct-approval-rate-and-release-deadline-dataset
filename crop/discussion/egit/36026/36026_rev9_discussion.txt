DESCRIPTION

Provide access to the absolute path of the git storages

We've implemented IStorage#getFullPath() in such a way that the
underlying resource is unresolveable for any client not aware of git
innards. This opens a new API to allow such clients a workaround so
that they may access the path if the needs arises.

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> s/3.6/4.0/

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> How does the caller know which path matches the blobId ? In general there can be multiple tree versions with different paths pointing to the same blob.

finding all paths referring to a given blob could be expensive

we are on Java 7 now so we should annotate overridden interface methods

Line:162, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> When does this make sense ? If the repository is bare the returned path is non-existing and there are no Eclipse resources mapping to the path since there's also no project which could be imported. Or do I miss something ?

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> We were already providing a path to this constructor. The paramter was just wrongly named. These storages are created when we already know the path we want a GitBlobStorage for though, so is this really a concern?

Line:162, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> I kinda coded this o be extra sure... but I guess you're right, there shouldn't be any case of a "bare" repo where eclipse IResources make sense...

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> then we should document that the caller is responsible to pass the right path for the given blob and that this class won't check this path is correct but just return the path passed to the constructor
