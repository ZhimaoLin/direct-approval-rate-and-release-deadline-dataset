DESCRIPTION

Test stability: another attempt to have stable connect() behavior

Refactored ConnectProviderOperation to make it easier to understand and
to be more verbose if it fails to connect. If multiple projects are to
be connected, do not fail entire task if only some of the projects have
issues. RepositoryFinder should also not silently fail during connect if
resource is unknown in workspace.
