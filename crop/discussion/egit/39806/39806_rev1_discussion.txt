Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Matthias, this is my first attempt to approve the commit as comitter - I'm not sure if I do it right in Gerrit - please don't mind. The change itself is OK.

I'm sorry. As expected, I did something wrong - the commit is in the repo, but it has "merged" prefix and the author is wrong. I've read the gerrit docu, but didn't found why it went wrong. Should I first rebase the change before approving next time, or do not use review and submit button?

Patch Set 1:

that's all fine, we have set submit type "Merge if necessary" on the jgit and egit repositories [1], this means if the change you approve and submit isn't a successor of the current branch tip Gerrit will automatically merge it [2]. This allows to reduce number of round trips until a change is accepted. If you want to avoid the auto-merges first rebase before you submit a change.
