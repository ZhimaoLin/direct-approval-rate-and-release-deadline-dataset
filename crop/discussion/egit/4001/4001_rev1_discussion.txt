Line:237, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/ReflogView.java -> I don't think we need to externalize logged error messages. Or is this an EGit convention that I wasn't aware of?

Line:237, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/reflog/ReflogView.java -> I just checked this by searching for Activator.logError() and it seems the majority of error messages has been externalized, also jgit is externalizing its error messages

Looks good to me, the test failures reported by Hudson do not appear to have anything to do with this change set.
