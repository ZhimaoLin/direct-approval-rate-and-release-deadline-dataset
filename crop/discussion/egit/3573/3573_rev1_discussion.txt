DESCRIPTION

RFC: Use a per-repository path encoding

This touches quite a lot of places and I changes direction on the
way.

Should I add DirCacheOptions and TreeOptions and try to extend the
use. A pronlem I found was that I did not find a good source, i.e.
config, everywhere.

AFAIK: This patch "works", but so far only with manual testing with
one repo committed using Msys git (ISO-88591-1) and one with EGit.

I can work with them on a Mac (Do not try C Git here)
