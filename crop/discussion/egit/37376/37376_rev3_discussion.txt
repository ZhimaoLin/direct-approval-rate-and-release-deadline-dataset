Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Matthias,
Sorry for late feedback, I just realized that there are few major issues with the patch:

1 The job has no rules configured (which means staging vie can create lot of them running in paralel). 
2 The job doesn't check if the view is still opened (not disposed) while running and possibly tries to refresh dead view.
3 The job doesn't implement belongsTo(family) which means it cannot programmatically be found and canceled.

Ideally before schedulling the new job the content provider should cancel all jobs of this job family and only then run the next one. Also the view or content provider schould cancel the possibly running job on dispose().

PS I'm *really* interested in this patch as we see lot of UI freezes in exact this code.

Patch Set 3:

The situation is even worse. Now in the debugger I see that we have 2 content providers *per staging view*! We do the submodule walk *twice* per input update. I have to think about it...

Matthias,
I have a patch but I can't push because:
"You must be a committer to push on behalf of others."
"error: You are not a project committer.
error: Only project committers can push on behalf of others."
So what to do now?
