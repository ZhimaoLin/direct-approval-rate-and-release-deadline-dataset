DESCRIPTION

Use StringBuilder in CreatePatchOperation

StringBuilder is a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer and faster, as
it avoids the (unnecessary) synchronization. org.eclipse.egit.core uses
the old API still in CreatePatchOperation

Line:297, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CreatePatchOperation.java -> I was simply replacing StringBuffer with StringBuilder, but I also do not see the need for this buffer, I remove it.
