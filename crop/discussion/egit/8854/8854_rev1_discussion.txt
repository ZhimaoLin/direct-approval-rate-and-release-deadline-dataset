DESCRIPTION

Use the term Working Directory rather than working tree

Seeing menus with both the term working tree and working directory
is confusing.

Line:1312, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> This label is also used in the Staging view and in the Tree Compare view. In the history view, I sometimes mistakenly press on "Open in Editor" when I want to open the current file to edit it. I'm wondering if it's just me, but I'd prefer OpenWorkingTreeVersionInEditorMenuLabel to be "Open in Editor" and OpenInEditorMenuLabel to be "Open Version from Commit".

Alternatively, I'd prefer this to be "Open Working Directory Version", because "Open Version in Working Directory" below "Open in Editor" sounds like "Working Directory" is a kind of editor (the "in" mean different things here).

Yet another option would be "Open Workspace Version", which would use the Eclipse term.

What do you think?
