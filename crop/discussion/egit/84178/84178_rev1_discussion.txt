DESCRIPTION

Hide local branch upstream warning for remote branch upstream

When using a local branch as upstream, the branch creation dialog shows
a warning which was not removed even when switching to a remote branch
as upstream.

This regression was introduced with the fix for bug 440097. That one
removed the line "setMessage(null)". This fix reintroduces that line,
but as "setMessage(initialMessageWhenThePageWasCreated)" instead. This
avoids the previously experienced wrong height calculation of the
dialog, I have tested that extensively.
