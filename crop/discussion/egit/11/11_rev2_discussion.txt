DESCRIPTION

Add NON-NLS pseudo comment to technical Strings and trace messages

"Trace messages" means messages which are written to System.out,
either directly or via Activator.trace().

Human readable texts which may go to the UI do not get a pseudo
comment.  These include texts used in:

  - Activator.logError
  - Activator.error
  - MessageDialog.openError
  - Utils.handleError
  - new Status

Hi Shawn,

I fully agree with your changes. I'm just still struggling with our company firewall, otherwise I would have posted the changed patch myself.

A remark to the IllegalArgumentException in class RepositorySelection: In my opinion messages of RuntimeExceptions should not be translated, they are not relevant for the end user. We should find out how Eclipse handles this.

Best Regards,
Stefan
