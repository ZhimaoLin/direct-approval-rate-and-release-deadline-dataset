DESCRIPTION

Add NON-NLS pseudo comment to technical Strings and trace messages

"Trace messages" means messages which are written to System.out,
either directly or via Activator.trace().

Human readable texts which may go to the UI do not get a pseudo
comment.  These include texts used in:
- Activator.logError
- Activator.error
- MessageDialog.openError
- Utils.handleError
- new Status

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score



Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelection.java -> Somehow I have this sinking feeling this winds up being a user visible message.  :-(

Line:43, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RefContentProposal.java -> No, this class is horrible, it should be translated.

Line:138, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitMessageViewer.java -> Yea, we can say NON-NLS here, but really these might need to be localized for some locales.  They are labels appearing before field values, and thus probably should be something translated.
