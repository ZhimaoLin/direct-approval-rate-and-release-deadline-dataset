Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I agree with Matthias' suggestions. Please update with a new changeset.

I also refactored a couple classes out and collapsed things into DiscardChangesOperation.

I would also request that you do the tests in another gerrit changeset so we can avoid triggering the IP process for this.

Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> I think this code should be in JGit. What you suggest is a "git checkout -- <path>", right? That's pure git logic and we should try to  keep such things in JGit. A good place for that would be in  CheckoutCommand. If we would add a method "addPath(String path)" there then we could move this code to the right location. Then other user's of the JGit API could make use of this code.

Sorry, I know I am late with this comment - and I was about to let commit this change and refactor it directly afterwards. But: officially copying code from EGit to JGit is because of the licenses not so easy.
So better put the code right now.

Patch Set 6: Abandoned

this feature was already implemented by change I0beef8da40c8e0c194f61678000f0b65bd6598b9 hence abandoning this duplicate
