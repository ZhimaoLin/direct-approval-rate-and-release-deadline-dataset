DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] Queue decoration requests

In order to avoid the creation of an individual TreeWalk for each
resource, decoration requests are queued and then processed by a
separate job using a single TreeWalk with n path filters (n = number
of folders/files). See bug 325393 for performance results.

Requires JGit change 2245 - Cache index (DirCache object) in
repository.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

With medium sized projects (e.g. org.eclipse.egit.core) I get endless redecoration of the project resource.
