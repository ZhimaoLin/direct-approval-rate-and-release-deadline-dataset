DESCRIPTION

[DRAFT] Queue decoration requests

In order to avoid the creation of an individual TreeWalk for each
resource, decoration requests are queued and then processed by a
separate job using a single TreeWalk with n path filters (n = number
of folders/files). See bug 325393 for performance results.

Requires JGit change 2245 - Cache index (DirCache object) in
repository.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(5 inline comments)

- I see lot of CoreExceptions when running ui tests
- remove debug println all over the place, in some places you may want to replace it by debug trace output which can be switched off
- all TODOs need to be fixed

Line:113, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceHelper.java -> I would put a comment here, this looks weird

Line:63, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitDecoratorJob.java -> remove this commented out debug code

Line:250, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> remove this line, we don't want println and also no commented out code

Line:254, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> I think this is ok

Line:298, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitLightweightDecorator.java -> when running the egit ui tests I hit this case many times, if this happens frequently either this points to a bug or we should not throw an error but instead only write a trace if debug trace is on, also the path of the resource should be given, otherwise this stack trace is quite useless to understand the cause
