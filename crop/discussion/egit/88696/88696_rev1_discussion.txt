DESCRIPTION

RepositoryChangeScanner should not query all repos if UI is not active

Change the order of conditions in RepositoryChangeScanner: first, check
if we must run at all and only after that query if we have repositories
via repositoryCache.getAllRepositories(). This avoids unneeded file I/O
for workspaces with lot of repositories.
