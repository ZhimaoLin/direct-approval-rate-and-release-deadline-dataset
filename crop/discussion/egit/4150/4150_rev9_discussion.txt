DESCRIPTION

[sync] Dispose resources used by 'Git Commit' model

Dispose all nested objects in collection 'Git Commit' model. This should
make things easier for garbage collector since all circular
dependencties should be cleaned.

Also prevent from creating new instance of
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber when
GitRepositoryProviderType.getSubscriber() method is called.

Patch Set 9:

It seems dispose isn't called when closing the synchronize view, anything missing here to make this happen ?

Patch Set 9:

The main idea of this change is to dispose old synchronization data when new synchronization process starts.

It seams that none of eclipse views are disposed when they are cosed. Try changing something in "Display" view or in "History" view, then close it and open again, as you can see all modification are preserved.
