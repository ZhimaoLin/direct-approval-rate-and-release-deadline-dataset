DESCRIPTION

Dispose all nested objects in collection 'Git Commit' model. This should
make things easier for garbage collector since all circular
dependencties should be cleaned.

Also prevent from creating new instance of
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber when
GitRepositoryProviderType.getSubscriber() method is called.
