DESCRIPTION

[sync] Dispose resources used by 'Git Commit' model

Dispose all nested objects in collection 'Git Commit' model. This should
make things easier for garbage collector since all circular
dependencies should be cleaned.

Also prevent creating new instance of
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber when
GitRepositoryProviderType.getSubscriber() method is called.
