DESCRIPTION

[tests] Use mocked git user/system configs for repository tests

GitRepositoriesViewBranchHandlingTest.testBranchConfiguration()
failed locally for me because I have pull.rebase=true and
brach.autosetuprebase=always set in my user config. The test,
however, expects those not to be set and tests for
RebaseMode.NONE.

Also let's pretend that no git environment variables were set.

Tests should never use real git configs, and should not depend on
external environment variables.
