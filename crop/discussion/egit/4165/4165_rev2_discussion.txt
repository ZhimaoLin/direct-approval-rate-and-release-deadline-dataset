- you can't create a new branch based on a tag which doesn't point to a commit (tags can point to any git object e.g. a blob object, I have one pointing to my public pgp key)
- when deleting a branch it is not removed from the dialog's tree (though the branch is deleted)

Line:208, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> better: Select a ref and choose action to execute

Line:210, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> maybe shorter: Checkout a ref or work with branches

AFAIR we already had some discussion about tags pointing on non-commits objects, and the conclusion was to not bothering with such rare use case, apart from that we would have some performance issues when there would be lots of tags and we'll be checking does every tag points to a commit or not.
