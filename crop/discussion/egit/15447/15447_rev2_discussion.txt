DESCRIPTION

Reorder menu entries in Team > Remote to correspond to repo view

Make it "Push, Fetch, Pull" as in the repo view. This also corresponds
to the toolbar and Git menu order.

Changing the order of "Push to Upstream" and others in the Team menu is
in the next change.

Line:3653, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> this has the effect that for a repository which isn't configured for Gerrit the team menu shows "Remote > Fetch from Gerrit..." instead of "Remote > Fetch..."
