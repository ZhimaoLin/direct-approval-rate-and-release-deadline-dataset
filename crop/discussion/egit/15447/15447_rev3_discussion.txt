DESCRIPTION

Reorder menu entries in Team > Remote to correspond to repo view

Make it "Push, Fetch, Pull" as in the repo view. This also corresponds
to the toolbar and Git menu order.

Changing the order of "Push to Upstream" and others in the Team menu is
in the next change.

Patch Set 3:

I think fetch is used more often than push if we assume the average team has more than 2 developers and developers push a similar number of commits per day.

This would mean we should rather reverse the order in git menu and repositories view to position most frequently used commands (fetch) at the top of the menu in order to minimize mouse movements. 

I almost never use pull but I use Gerrit workflow on most projects I am participating in so this may look different for other git workflows.

> I think fetch is used more often than push if we assume the average team has more than 2 developers and developers push a similar number of commits per day.

It depends on the workflow. In non-Gerrit projects with a central repo, pull is used most often, followed by push, then fetch.

If the menu opens upward (when the repo view is positioned at the bottom), then fetch at the top would require the most mouse movement. I personally use the toolbar, which is probably the quickest way.

Would you also like to change the order of the toolbar buttons (currently push, fetch, pull)?

What makes the whole thing a bit more complicated is that "Pull" in the Team menu is in its own section below fetch/push. So changing the order to fetch, pull, push would require moving pull around there. Or would you want to make the order fetch, push, pull? That seems kind of weird, as fetch and pull are related and so should be next to each other.

To be honest, I don't mind much as long as the order is consistent in the menus. What should we do to not have this stalled (I would like to get "Push Branch..." into 3.1)?

ok, I see, with different workflows and habits the pros and cons get pretty weak. So let's simply stick to what you propose here and see what feedback we get when this is out in the wild.
