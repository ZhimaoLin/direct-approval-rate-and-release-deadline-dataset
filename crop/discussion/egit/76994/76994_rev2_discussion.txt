DESCRIPTION

Allow to cancel the deletion of branches operation

We should allow that the deletion of branches can be cancelled. 

Note: Platform has as of Neon the SubMonitor.split operation for this,
but EGit cannot yet use that, as it wants to be compliant with the last
two releases.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

I couldn't really test this since on my laptop deleting branches was always too fast to be able to cancel it. Though code looks good to me.
