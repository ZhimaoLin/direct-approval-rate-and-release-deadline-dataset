DESCRIPTION

Improve label of index version in compare editors

When opening the compare editor from the staging view for an unstaged
file, the right side shows the Index version.

The problem is that not many people discover that it is in fact editable
(and the way to do partial staging).

This change tries to help a bit by changing the label from

  file.txt Index ()

to

  Index: file.txt (editable)

Index is used as a prefix because the left side is "Local: file.txt".

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I will have to rework this now that I26dbc133e2ab11682778ca564448f98bc5217c7e is in. E.g. for stage 2, it should not have " (editable)".
