DESCRIPTION

Fetch commit message template from project specific settings 

Resources of the commit are registered and the commit template of the
project, that contains a resource to commit is used for the commit
message. If resources of multiple projects with their own template are
committed, then the template of the first project in the workspace is
taken.
