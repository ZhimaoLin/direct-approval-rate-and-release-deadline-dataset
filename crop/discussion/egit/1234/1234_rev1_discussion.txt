DESCRIPTION

Provide gitignore support in commit dialog

Gitignore support was added to the commit dialog.
Furthermore the calculation of untracked files using
a ResourceVisitor was removed. This is now done
by the new TreeWalk based implementation
of IndexDiff.
Finally some unused garbage was deleted (isChanged,
tryAddResource)
