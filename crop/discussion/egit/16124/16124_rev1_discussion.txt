DESCRIPTION

Fix showing annotations for deleted file from file diff viewer

Because getNewPath was used, which returns /dev/null for deleted files,
the path could not be found and the following error was shown:

  File /dev/null is not contained in commit

This fixes it by using the old path in case of a delete.
