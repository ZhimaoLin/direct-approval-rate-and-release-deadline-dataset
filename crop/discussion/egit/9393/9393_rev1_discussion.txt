Patch Set 1:

In that case we could even remove the "soft" option, right (no-op)? The labels on the options could also be shortened because HEAD is not updated, so e.g. Mixed would say "Mixed (index updated)".

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this doesn't match what you implemented, did you mean:

Only show target in reset dialog if it differs from HEAD

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I also stumbled when first reading it, but it's meant like this:

When target is the same, only show current HEAD (instead of also showing target)
