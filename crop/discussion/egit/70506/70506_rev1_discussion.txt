DESCRIPTION

Prefer the usage of staging area / to stage over index or add to index

Douglas Trujillo the EGit project leads suggested to me for my Git book to
used the term "Stagging Area" instead of Index. I think the terminology
in the Eclipse Git tooling should also be adjusted to reference that.

This is the first part of a series of changes. If accepted IÃ¤m going to
replace the other reference to index with staging area.

Line:231, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> This seems inconsistent. I think we should either use "Stage" and "Unstage" or "Add to Staging Area" and "Remove from Staging Area".

The former is shorter, the latter is closer to the command names many git users know from the native git command line.

Maybe we should send an email to the egit mailing list to gather  feedback from more users on this change.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/used/use/

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/Stagging Area/Staging Area/

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we should also reference the corresponding discussion on the git mailing list

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we should change this consistently in a single change in order to avoid confusion for the many users using the nightly build.

TODOs:  also change command names in 
* team menu 
* and repositories view
* adapt user guide https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide
