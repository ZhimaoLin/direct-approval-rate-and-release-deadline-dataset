Line:294, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> I have a hard time understanding this. First if we come in with null here, how does this fit the comment below ("URI hasn't changed...")? Second, which case of this super-complex GitCloneWizard is this? How can I reproduce the bug?
Third, if you need this null check here, don't you also need it in CloneDestinationPage.checkPreviousPagesSelections() and CloneDestinationPage.revalidate()? Or does this page prevent advancing to the next if newRepoSelection is null? (See the no-args constructor of AbstractGitCloneWizard for why I ask.)

Line:294, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> AbstractGitCloneWizard.getRepositorySelection() can return null if an exception is caught in that method. I rewrote the change to make this clearer. You are right the same problem is in CloneDestinationPage.revalidate().
