DESCRIPTION

Refresh only deltas to the last refresh in IndexDiffCacheEntry

This change is a EGit-only implementation of the preceeding changes:
 EGit: Change-Id: I09a4dc7b76c9a106eb15d002c7d626b62061e8a9
 JGit: Change-Id: Ia1eae05793483a3fc837e4e0d28c2a52c5013d0b
 
This has the advantage over the other implementation that it is local to
the location that actually has the performance issue. Also this
implementation allows for the RefsChangedEvents to be handled in
addition to the IndexChangedEvents.
