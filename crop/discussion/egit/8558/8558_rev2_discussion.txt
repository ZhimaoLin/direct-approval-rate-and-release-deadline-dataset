DESCRIPTION

Refresh only deltas to the last refresh in IndexDiffCacheEntry

This change is a EGit-only implementation of the preceeding changes:
 EGit: Change-Id: I5cd27f79606decca73b7a0977d147c97e06bfaba
 JGit: Change-Id: Ia1eae05793483a3fc837e4e0d28c2a52c5013d0b
 
This has the advantage over the other implementation that it is local to
the location that actually has the performance issue.

Bug: 393642

I think I like this approach better. Please see inline comments.

Line:100, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Please add a space between keywords and parentheses. Also in rest of change.

Line:102, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Also use repository.readDirCache here like below.

Line:185, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> This mentions refs changed, but the listener above does not use it.

Line:189, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Does this have to be public?

Line:207, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> walk should be released (I'm not sure if it's absolutely necessary here, but do it anyway).

Line:223, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Please catch only necessary exceptions, not everything.

Line:225, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> "failed to calculate index delta!" -> "Exception while calculating index delta, doing full reload instead"

Line:265, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/CoreText.java -> Suggestion: failed_index_load -> errorCalculatingIndexDelta

Line:266, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/CoreText.java -> Please add missing copyright here too.

Line:220, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> nit-pick: we don' use branches for very simple statements

please add a test

Line:191, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> bare repositories don't have a working tree so this seems esoteric to me

Line:220, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> I guess you meant no braces around single line statements

new patchset coming. about the test: i had a look at whats there, and i think that IndexDiffCacheTest.testAddingAFile() is sufficient - i don't know what else i should test.

by the way:
I have authored 100% of the content, I have the rights to give you the contents, and i contribute it under the EPL

Line:189, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> not really - i changed to private. if somebody would need the api from the outside, we can change it back anyway :)

Line:207, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> oups - i had that in the first version, but missed it here :/

Line:220, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> Done

Line:223, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> done. still i'm only catching IOException, and not CorruptObjectException additionally, as i would handle both the same.
