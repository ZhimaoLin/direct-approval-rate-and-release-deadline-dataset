DESCRIPTION

Refresh only deltas to the last refresh in IndexDiffCacheEntry

This change is a EGit-only implementation of the preceeding changes:
 EGit: Change-Id: I5cd27f79606decca73b7a0977d147c97e06bfaba
 JGit: Change-Id: Ia1eae05793483a3fc837e4e0d28c2a52c5013d0b

This has the advantage over the other implementation that it is local to
the location that actually has the performance issue.

Patch Set 5: Do not submit

The following seems to be broken by this (please disregard sign-off for now):

* Create a new folder foo in a shared project
* In this folder, create a new file - that should now be decorated with ? (untracked)
* Add the folder to index via Team > Add to Index

The file now shows a + decoration (added), but the folder is still ? (untracked) instead of * (modified).

Patch Set 5:

The problem seems to be in the IndexDiffData constructor which merges the existing IndexDiffData with a new IndexDiff:

The mergeList logic does not work for folders, this call:

		mergeList(untrackedFolders2, changedFiles, getUntrackedFolders(diffForChangedFiles));

Is that a new bug or not?

Patch Set 5:

I'm not sure what you're asking. The behavior described above only happens with this change applied, because it no longer does a full refresh. The bug in the IndexDiffData merging code was there before, but it should be fixed before this change is submitted.

Patch Set 5:

it seems like adding files to the any of the known file-list will never treat the path the file is contained in in any of the directory-lists. i think the code would have to check for files whether their (or any parent) path is in any of the directory-lists and handle it accordingly. thoughts?
