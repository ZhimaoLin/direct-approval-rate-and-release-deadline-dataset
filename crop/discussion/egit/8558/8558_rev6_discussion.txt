DESCRIPTION

Refresh only deltas to the last refresh in IndexDiffCacheEntry

This change is a EGit-only implementation of the preceeding changes:
 EGit: Change-Id: I5cd27f79606decca73b7a0977d147c97e06bfaba
 JGit: Change-Id: Ia1eae05793483a3fc837e4e0d28c2a52c5013d0b

This has the advantage over the other implementation that it is local to
the location that actually has the performance issue.

Markus: I rebased this change onto a change which contains a test case for the problem. I suggest we now extend this change so that the test case passes. Do you want to work on that?

I think the solution needs two things:

In IndexDiffCacheEntry#calcIndexDiffData, check the untracked folders of the current indexDiffData if they contain one of the filesToUpdate paths. Add all those to the diffForChangedResources filter.

In the IndexDiffData constructor which merges the two, fix the treatment of untracked folders. I think all existing untracked folders containing one of the changed files need to be removed, and all the new untracked folders need to be added.
