DESCRIPTION

Refresh only deltas to the last refresh in IndexDiffCacheEntry

This change is a EGit-only implementation of the preceeding changes:
 EGit: Change-Id: I5cd27f79606decca73b7a0977d147c97e06bfaba
 JGit: Change-Id: Ia1eae05793483a3fc837e4e0d28c2a52c5013d0b

This has the advantage over the other implementation that it is local to
the location that actually has the performance issue.

Implemented the changes as described above, rebased.
