Matthias,

What is the rule for those little changes. Can they be merged by a committer submitting the review or do they also require a +1 from another committer?

Patch Set 2:

In principle we want review on all changes. I am not waiting for committers to review changes I need to do in order to create a new release since that would eat too much time and most of that is automated in the mean time.

but ok, such really small things could go without, though on the other hand my own experience is that even with small changes a reviewer can spot something to improve

I didn't yet look at this change yet since I was struggling to fix the build problem https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=460751
