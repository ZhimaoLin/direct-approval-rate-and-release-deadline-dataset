DESCRIPTION

Support 'Show Annotations' on history items

Blame can now be run from the file table in the history view
as well as the file section of the commit editor.

The blame operation will open the file in a read-only editor
and show annotations starting at the selected commit.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm afraid that this change will not work for non-workspace files

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/ShowBlameActionHandler.java -> If selected resource is non-workspace, then you'll get first path element from getProject() method, and finally getMapping will return null. With change I929c3c32e getMapping for non-workspace files will return proper RepositoryMapping.

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/ShowBlameActionHandler.java -> Show Annotations prior to this change didn't work with non-workspace files either therefore I'm not sure that is a valid reason to -1 this change.

Just because a feature doesn't support non-workspace files doesn't mean it doesn't have value to the users of Eclipse that will be using repositories that are part of their workspace.

Patch Set 2: No score

Line:41, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/ShowBlameActionHandler.java -> I was pretty sure that "Snow Annotations" will work for non-workspace files. But if it doesn't work then -1 isn't valid

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful; IP review completed

Works as expected. The only thing that is missing are tests that will ensure that 'Show Annotation' menu option is in place and that it at least open an editor
