DESCRIPTION

Support 'Show Annotations' on history items

Blame can now be run from the file table in the history view
as well as the file section of the commit editor.

The blame operation will open the file in a read-only editor
and show annotations starting at the selected commit.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

This is very useful.

What I am missing is menu entry to the context menu in the editor of historic versions. Normally I first open an editor and then I decide to open the blame annotations. Unfortunately there is no Team menu on editors which do not have an IFile as input.
