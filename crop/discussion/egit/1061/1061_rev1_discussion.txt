DESCRIPTION

Minor fix for UI tests to get the correct button on GTK

On GTK, the default behavior is to show the cancel button before the OK button in
all dialogs. In the tests we should not assume the order of the buttons but try
to match by the button text. In order to run the tests on GTK, it is neccessary to identify
the right button as all tests currently "click" the Cancel button when trying to
open the Repository View.

Why haven't I seen the problem (Kubuntu 10.04)? Does GTK
have different button orderings between Gnome and KDE?

Patch Set 1:

By default, GTK has another button ordering than Windows or Mac. But at least on Kubuntu, you should see the same unless you didn't specify the "gtk-alternative-button-order=1" in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file (see http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.5-200906111540/eclipse-news-part1.html - Alternate Button Order)
For me, the Cancel button is on the left and the OK button on the right.
