DESCRIPTION

Minor fix for UI tests to get the correct button on GTK

On GTK, the default behavior is to show the cancel button before the OK button in
all dialogs. In the tests we should not assume the order of the buttons but try
to match by the button text. In order to run the tests on GTK, it is neccessary to identify
the right button as all tests currently "click" the Cancel button when trying to
open the Repository View.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Duh. Not sure why I did this here. Of course this is the proper solution (I have replaced the literal with a constant, though). Looks like there are a lot of other tests that I'll have to check, too where wizard pages are involved. On those wizard pages, I wasn't able to find the buttons by their label, so I used the button(int) pattern a lot.... Or are the tests fine there?

Looks good, thanks for the catch.

UI tests in general have to becareful when it comes to making assumptions on button order for OK/Cancel. The other buttons should be fine.
