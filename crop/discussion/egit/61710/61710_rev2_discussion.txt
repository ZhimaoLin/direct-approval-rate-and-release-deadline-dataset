DESCRIPTION

Try to make that EasymportWizardTest more stable

That test didn't run at all on my local machine; it failed already
because getting the branch info takes a bit more time from here.

Then it failed because it tried to get the projects before the
import was done.

Finally I had an exception reported by the Java auto-builder who
couldn't find the projects that were imported and then deleted at the
end of the test.

And on EGit Hudson, it usually fails because it cannot find
"File->Import...".

Add some more waiting, switch off auto-build, close the welcome page,
and try to ensure the Eclipse workbench window is activated (hopefully
that will solve the "File->Import..." not found problem; I couldn't
reproduce that locally.)

Trying your suggestion with the shell activation with code from EGitTestCase, which unfortunately isn't visible here.

Let's try this. If we still get spurious failures despite the shell activation, we can still add the waiting from PS1.

Heh :-) You were seconds faster than me.

What's up with Nexus? EGit "master" build fails because of HTTP response 503: https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit/4043/console .
