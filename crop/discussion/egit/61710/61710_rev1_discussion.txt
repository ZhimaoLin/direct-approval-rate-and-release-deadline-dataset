DESCRIPTION

Try to make that EasymportWizardTest more stable

That test didn't run at all on my local machine; it failed already
because getting the branch info takes a bit more time from here.

At the end it failed because it tried to get the projects before the
import was done.

And on EGit Hudson, it usually fails because it cannot find
"File->Import...".

Add some more waiting all around.

Line:34, org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer.tests/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/importer/tests/EasymportWizardTest.java -> Just wondering if the File->Import was not working because of missing active window??? Don't have the code right now, but arent't other tests extending some egit test base class which does some extra shell activation stuff etc?

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Any idea why????

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> No. That one didn't happen locally, so I've got no idea why it occurs from time to time on Hudson. My "fix" is just to wait a little until that menu entry is there, but I agree that this isn't quite so nice. Maybe you're right about the shell activation...

Patch Set 1:

BTW if you haven't noticed yet: if we merge changes, the egit "master" build job is triggered with some delay, and if it runs in parallel with egit.gerrit job we will most likely have unexpected sporadic test failures in either of both. 

Therefore I try to not schedule new gerrit builds for ~1 hour after merges to master.

Just to make sure are not observing this issue.

I hadn't noticed; but then I hadn't paid attention to egit.master. But if that's the case, something is wrong in the Hudson job setups. I didn't look yet at their configuration. Do they have a shared maven repo? That might be a possible cause of such interference.

The problem is not maven in this case, but (I guess) Desktop / Display setup which could be shared for whatever reasons  - I'm not a hudson expert.
