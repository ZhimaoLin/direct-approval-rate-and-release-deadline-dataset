DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Take bold font into account when drawing branch labels

Change I693694bca055c4b913b064a3e3f3a0bced058296 introduced the usage
of bold fonts for branch labels that are checked out. As this also
changes the text's width, parts of the text did not fit into the
background anymore. This fix takes the new width into account when
calculating the background width.
