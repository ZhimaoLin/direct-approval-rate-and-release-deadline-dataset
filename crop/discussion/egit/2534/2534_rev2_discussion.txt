DESCRIPTION

Fixed a problem when committing mode changes

When HEAD and index contained a regular file (a file with the
executable
bit not set) and in the working tree the associated file was modified
to
be an executable file then EGit had a bug while committing this mode
change. In EGits commit operation the index was updated and the tree
for
the commit got prepared. The index was updated correctly but the tree
to
be commited always contained a regular file. After the Commit
operation
we had different entries for this file in index and HEAD.

This commit fixes this by explicitly checking for executable-bit in
the
associated index-entry and setting the new TreeEntry accordingly.
