DESCRIPTION

Allow to show/edit branch configuration

It should be possible to see/change branch configuration (upstream
configuration) when selecting a branch in the Repositories View.

A Properties View can be opened which will show the upstream
configuration for the selected branch. From there, it is possible to
open an editor for this configuration.

Alternatively, a right-click on the branch node will open the editor
directly.
