DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Start integration of a merge tool

At the moment, this is intended as Request for Feedback.

This change adds a "Merge Tool" action to the team menu which is
only active if the repository containing the selected resources
is in state "Merging". When selected, a dialog will appear asking
whether the workspace (pre-merged) or HEAD (un-merged) version
of the files should be used as input for the merge editor.

The selected files will be shown in the upper part of the editor
(only the files which have conflicts or have different content in
the workspace compared to the  HEAD version). On double-click, the
actual merge editor will be shown. The user can now edit the left
part and save the changed content to the workspace. Clicking
next/previous the user can navigate to the next/previous conflict/
change (even across file boundaries).

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- rebased to current master
- resolved resulting conflict

- this is already a great improvement compared to editing plain conflict markers :-)

- I think the merge editor should be immediately be opened on the pre-selected first conflicting file instead of requiring a double click
- also when navigating the list of files in the upped part this should automatically show the merge editor in the lower part

- when selecting "show the version pre-merged by git" I would prefer if this would only affect the hunks which have been automatically merged by git without conflicts, the conflicting hunks should be displayed in the same way as when the other option "Use HEAD" is selected since the traditional format with the conflict markers redundantly shows both conflicting changes in the left pane. This is redundant in the merge tool since the other version being merged in and the base version are already displayed in the other panes of the merge tool.

- when clicking "Copy current change from right to left" I would prefer if the change from the right would overwrite the change on the left instead of appending it. Same for "Copy all changes from right to left". Maybe we could have another action "Append change from right to left".

- some files have no license header
- the merge tool view should get a more useful title, currently it's just "Compare", instead we could show '[egit] Merging branch "xyz" into "master" ' displaying the repository and the branches being merged"
