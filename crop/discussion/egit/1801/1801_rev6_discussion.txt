DESCRIPTION

Integration of a merge tool

This adds a "Merge Tool" action to the team menu which is only
active if the Repository of the selected resources is in state "Merging". 
When selected, a dialog will appear to ask the user whether they want to
use the workspace (pre-merged) or HEAD (un-merged) version of
the conflicting files as input for the merge editor left side.
The selected files will be shown in the upper part of the editor (only
such files who have conflicts or whose content differs between the
workspace and HEAD version). On double-click, the actual merge editor
will be shown. The user can now edit the left part and save the changed
content to the workspace. With next/previous they can navigate to the
next/previous conflict/change (even across file boundaries).
The choice on the first dialog is only relevant for conflicting files,
i.e. files that are not auto-merged. In the case of a conflict-free merge,
always the workspace content will be shown on the left side.
The right side will either show the version found at MERGE_HEAD (in
case of conflicts) or HEAD (in case of conflict-free merge).
