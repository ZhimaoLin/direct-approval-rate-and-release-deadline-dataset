DESCRIPTION

RFC: Start integration of a merge tool

At the moment, this is intended as Request for Feedback: this adds a
"Merge Tool" action to the team menu which is only active if the
Repository of the selected resources is in state "Merging". When
selected, a dialog will appear to ask the user whether they want to
use the workspace (pre-merged) or HEAD (un-merged) version of
the conflicting files as input for the merge editor.
The selected files will be shown in the upper part of the editor (only
such files who have conflicts or whose content differs between the
workspace and HEAD version). On double-click, the actual merge editor
will be shown. The user can now edit the left part and save the changed
content to the workspace. With next/previous they can navigate to the
next/previous conflict/change (even across file boundaries).

Uploaded patch set 3.

Patch Set 3:

* I think the merge editor should be immediately be opened on the pre-selected first conflicting file instead of requiring a double click

Done.

    * also when navigating the list of files in the upped part this should automatically show the merge editor in the lower part

Not sure if this is at all possible

    * when selecting "show the version pre-merged by git" I would prefer if this would only affect the hunks which have been automatically merged by git without conflicts, the conflicting hunks should be displayed in the same way as when the other option "Use HEAD" is selected since the traditional format with the conflict markers redundantly shows both conflicting changes in the left pane. This is redundant in the merge tool since the other version being merged in and the base version are already displayed in the other panes of the merge tool.

Done.

    * when clicking "Copy current change from right to left" I would prefer if the change from the right would overwrite the change on the left instead of appending it. Same for "Copy all changes from right to left". Maybe we could have another action "Append change from right to left".

Not possible with this framework as far as I can say.

Thanks for the improvements.

I tried with a real world merge trying to resolve the conflicts raised when I (using native git) merged the current egit origin/master (cb2e630b) into egit change 1692, patchset 1 (3e494ae2) and found some more issues. 
I started the merge tool with the option HEAD (unmerged) :
- the progress bar reveals that the merge tool seems not to skip class files under the bin folder which could be skipped according to ignore rules
- the merge tool displays files which are displayed as "staged" in the package explorere but they don't show any difference in the merge tool
- when closing the merge tool and trying to re-open it I can't since the merge tool menu entry is grayed out
- to try again I did a hard reset and retried - this time using egit to merge - interestingly egit claims that it can do the merge without conflicts, I suspect this points at some error in egit's merge
- so I again reset and retried - again using native git for the merge - and using the "pre-merged" option. Looking at the Java Structure compare for UIText.java this looks not consistent with what the text compare shows

Line:2007, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> really ? this looks like a copy&paste mistake. I would expect MergeToolActionHandler here.

Patch Set 3:

I also found that when trying to use the merge tool on the result of rebase origin/master on the same scenario I cannot use the merge tool since the menu entry is grayed out. What's the difference compared to merge ?
