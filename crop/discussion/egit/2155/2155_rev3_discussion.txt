DESCRIPTION

Created an extension point to extend the commit message.
 
To integrate Mylyn's commit templates an extension point 
is needed. This extension point provides an interface you 
must implement. During the preparation of the commit 
dialogs the extensions using this extension points will be 
requested for a message to add to the dialog.

Here is a sample configuration:
<extension 
    point="org.eclipse.egit.ui.commitMessageProvider">
    <commitMessageProvider
        class="org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.CommitMessageProvider">
    </commitMessageProvider>
</extension>
