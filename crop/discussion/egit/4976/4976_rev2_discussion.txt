DESCRIPTION

Nice checkout conflict display instead of internal error

When switching branches by double-clicking their label, a nice checkout
conflict display appears if a conflict exists. When creating a new
branch, an ugly error box is shown instead. By detecting the
CheckoutConflictException explicitly and just returning, the
BranchResultDialog will be used there too, and show a nice overview of
all conflicts. Exception handling needs to be cleaned up (bug 369303)
when JGit has fixed bug 356922.
