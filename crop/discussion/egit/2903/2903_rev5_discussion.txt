DESCRIPTION

Check for trailing newline before writing to .gitignore file.

IgnoreOperation wrote entries to the .gitignore file without checking
if the file currently had a trailing newline which would cause
entries to get written on the same line as other entries for files
that were missing a trailing newline.

Added unit test to IgnoreOperationTest for this case.
