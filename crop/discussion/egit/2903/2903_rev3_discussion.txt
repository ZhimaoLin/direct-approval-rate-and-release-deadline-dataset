DESCRIPTION

Check for trailing newline before writing to .gitignore file.

IgnoreOperation wrote entries to the .gitignore file without checking
if the file currently had a trailing newline which would cause
entries to get written on the same line as other entries for files
that were missing a trailing newline.

Added unit test to IgnoreOperationTest for this case.

Some minor remarks...

Line:174, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/IgnoreOperation.java -> "...see if it..."

Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/IgnoreOperation.java -> You can also remove this bracket.

Line:203, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/IgnoreOperation.java -> See above.

Line:204, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/IgnoreOperation.java -> You shouldn't assign the new value to the parameter. I would prefer having a local variable.
