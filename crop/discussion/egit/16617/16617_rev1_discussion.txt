DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Fix selection after showing view initially

How to reproduce:

1. Close the view
2. Select a file in a project connected to a repo
3. Show the staging view

Expected: The view is linked with the repo from step 2
Actual: It shows "No Repository Selected"

The problem was that getActivePart in the old code returned null in the
above case. Going via the active workbench window didn't change that.
What works is getting it via execution context.
