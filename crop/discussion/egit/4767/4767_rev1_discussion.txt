DESCRIPTION

typing is very slow when entering invalid name in Create Branch
dialog 

* Do not re-layout controls unless the layout has changed.
* Invoke setErrorMessage() only once during validation to avoid updating
of the layout more than once.

This change improves performance on Gtk when entering invalid branch
names.

Steffen, I think the patch goes into the right direction but I don't see why the layout code is in the checkPage() method in the first place. I would expect that the layout is done exactly once, or do you see a scenario where it happens more than once?

I think the call to layout() is correct. If I remove the call and switch between "HEAD" and "refs/heads/master"  in the Source Ref combo I end up with blank space in the dialog. The call to layout ensures that all controls are packed properly after control visibility changes.

Yes, the call is needed but only once I I'd say. Hence it should be done outside checkPage().

Line:365, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/CreateBranchPage.java -> style nit: we don't use curly braces around single line blocks

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nits: 
- start with an uppercase letter 
- use a shorter title (put the rest into the body of the commit message)
- avoid trailing whitespace
- title should rather explain what this change does instead of describing the problem symptom, e.g. Fix very slow typing ...
