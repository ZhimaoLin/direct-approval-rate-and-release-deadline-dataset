I like this change, now commit dialog looks really great (maybe it is less intuitive).

Line:570, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> IMHO this string should be exported into UIPreferences class

Line:772, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> unnecessary brackets

Line:736, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> I can't find proper variable mapping in UIText class for 	CommitDialogPreferencePage_changeIdTooltip
