File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.core.test/fragment.xml -> Why is this and the build changes necessary? According to the commit message, this just extracts the classes, but it seems it does more. I assume this is necessary for later changes? Please update commit message.

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/models/ModelTestCase.java -> should be abstract.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.core.test/fragment.xml -> The SampleModelProvider was previously an inner-class of GitSubscriberMergeContextTest... and was used in a 'non-plugin' way (by directly instantiating it). I've extracted it out and contributed it through this fragment.xml to better reflect the "real" use case and to be able to use it from other tests.

I'll try and make the commit message clearer on that aspect.

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/models/ModelTestCase.java -> Done
