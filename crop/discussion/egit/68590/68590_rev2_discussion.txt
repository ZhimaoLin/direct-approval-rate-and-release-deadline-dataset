DESCRIPTION

Fix refresh after re-connecting a project with submodules inside

Follow-up to commit a8bcee9.

When a previously connected, then disconnected project is re-connected,
there is no resource change event. Thus the GitProjectData doesn't pick
up inner repositories, and doesn't re-set the RepositoryMappings for
folders inside the project that contain submodule or nested repository
working trees.

Because of another bug that I plan to fix soon (disconnecting a project
does not remove the RepositoryMapping session properties), this problem
is currently only visible if one quits and restarts Eclipse after having
disconnected. (Otherwise, the previous session properties are still set,
and everything appears fine.)

Thus we need to make sure when a project is shared that we get at least
a resource delta including all .git files and folders in the hierarchy.
Ensure that by touching all such inner resources.

Also, the SharingWizard must not suppress the refresh.

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/wizards/share/SharingWizardTest.java -> Looks like this test doesn't wait quite long enough. Locally, I sometimes see "TestProjectN is not open", sometimes "does not exist". Something appears to be happening asynchronously here. Forcing a refresh seems to fix this.

Probably creating the project not via the UI but directly would also fix it (and might make sense anyway, since we're not trying to test the BasicNewProjectResourceWizard).
