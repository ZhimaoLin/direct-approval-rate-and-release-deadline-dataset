DESCRIPTION

Git Configuration UI

The "Properties" view shows the configuration of the repository
currently selected in the repositories view. The toolbar was cleaned up
and simplified and the "direct editing" available in the properties view
was removed. Instead, when hitting a new "Edit" button in the toolbar, a 
dialog appears presenting the same UI that is used in the "Global Git Configuration"
preference page which can then be used to edit the configuration in a comfortable
way.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(12 inline comments)

I didn't inline this comment in the code but would like the buttons in ConfigurationEditorComponent to have some layout data set on them because their widths are all over the place right now.

I was also wondering if the editor could be changed to only commit the changes after the user has actually clicked 'OK' in the dialog? My test changes actually got delivered to my .gitconfig and now I have lost some configuration settings that I have forgotten about as I was removing stuff randomly (and it's been a few months since I last touched Git).

Line:1237, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/UIText.java -> It's a 'Delete' button not a 'Remove' button.

Line:483, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryPropertySource.java -> If a TitleAreaDialog is going to be used (which I am not really convinced is necessary in this scenario), please also set a description.

Also, it feels kind of weird to me to be setting a title of a dialog in a method that's meant for the creation of buttons.

Line:205, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> Don't use 'apply' in the name of the field if the widget's label is actually 'Change'.

Line:221, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> Don't use 'remove' in the name of the field if the widget's label is actually 'Delete'.

Line:252, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> I think I'd prefer if this section was after the table (instead of at the end) and right-adjusted but am open to what others feel about the layout.

Line:769, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> I think this is a bad name because there's also an org.eclipse.jface.viewers.LabelProvider.

Line:820, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigurationEditorComponent.java -> You created it, you disposed it. This is a resource leak as this font is never disposed.

Line:749, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Needs a mnemonic and a colon at the end.

Line:750, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Lowercase 'String' to 'string'.

Line:752, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Please change to '&New Entry...'.

Line:759, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> 'Delete' button not a 'Remove' button.

Line:764, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/uitext.properties -> Needs a colon at the end.
