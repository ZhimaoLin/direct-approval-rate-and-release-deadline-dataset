DESCRIPTION

Mark org.eclipse.debug.ui as optional dependency

properties for convenient configuration of default repository folder.
This also makes creating standalone EGit client harder and increase its
weight.

This patch mark this dependency as optional and will hide 'Variable...'
button when StringVariableSelectionDialog class cannot be found on
classpath.
