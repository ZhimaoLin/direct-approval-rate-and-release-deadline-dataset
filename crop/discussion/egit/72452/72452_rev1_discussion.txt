DESCRIPTION

Leave the commit message enabled in staging view

The CommitActionHAndler tries to focus the staging view. If the view was
freshly created, all its widgets are disabled. Focus thus gets set to
nowhere, and context menus in the view where the commit command was
invoked get confused. ("Show In" and "Team" sub-menus in package
explorer, or the context menu in the repositories view.)

By leaving the commit message area always enabled, focus can be set
properly and all is fine.
