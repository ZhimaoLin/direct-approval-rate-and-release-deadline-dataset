DESCRIPTION

Leave the commit message enabled in staging view

The CommitActionHAndler tries to focus the staging view. If the view was
freshly created, all its widgets are disabled. Focus thus gets set to
nowhere, and context menus in the view where the commit command was
invoked get confused. ("Show In" and "Team" sub-menus in package
explorer, or the context menu in the repositories view.)

By leaving the commit message area always enabled, focus can be set
properly and all is fine.

Patch Set 4:

SmartImportWizardTest fails also locally for me. I just cannot import the Java projects, reports "Skipped 27 locations because of errors" and for all JGit projects lines like "org.eclipse.jgit.ant/.project Could not import project located at <location of .project file in temp test folder>".

No idea what's going on there. Looks like Mickael should look at this. Bug 493606 looks somewhat related.

Definitely the bug you identified. It's fixed in Platform snapshot and will be part of RC2.
