DESCRIPTION

Don't use alternating row colors for staging areas

To be consistent with other similar file viewers in Eclipse we should
avoid using alternate colors for simple file lists - they only add
visual noise. See also https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/31804/ removing
alternating row colors for commit file diff viewer.
