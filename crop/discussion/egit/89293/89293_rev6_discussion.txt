* add the new feature to the egit p2 repo
* rebase this change on origin/master

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.ease-feature/feature.xml -> missing required bundle org.eclipse.ui 3.5 (require same version as org.eclipse.egit.ui

Line:47, org.eclipse.egit.ease-feature/feature.xml -> add the feature's dependencies to ensure that egit p2 repo is self-contained

Line:18, org.eclipse.egit.ease.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> if possible don't require a different version than org.eclipse.egit.ui

Line:10, org.eclipse.egit.target/projects/ease-latest.tpd -> * using a second location in the same tpd file doesn't seem to work
* don't use release train repository to add a single additional bundle since these repos are huge and heavily slow down target platform resolution since p2 has to download the complete index

Line:3, org.eclipse.egit.ease-feature/.project -> org

Line:23, org.eclipse.egit.ease-feature/pom.xml -> we use a different groupId for features hence there is no need to add feature here
