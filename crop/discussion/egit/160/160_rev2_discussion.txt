DESCRIPTION

Font and color decoration.

Implemented font and colour decoration. The same font and colour is used
for all uncommitted changes, i.e. resources that have differencies from
their corresponding index files and resources that are not tracked by git
(and are not ignored). Most of the plumbing code was shamelessly copied
from CVSLightweightDecorator.

Patch Set 2: No score

- rebased to current HEAD
- cleaned up trailing whitespace in plugin.xml

I installed this change but I can't see the difference yet, where should I look at ? I expected to see some different fonts for e.g. dirty files.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

ok, first I have to adjust font and color settings under
Preferences > General > Appearance > Color and Fonts > Git
then it works :-)
