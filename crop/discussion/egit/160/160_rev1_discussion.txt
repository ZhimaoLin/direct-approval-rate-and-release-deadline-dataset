DESCRIPTION

Font and color decoration.

Implemented font and colour decoration. The same font and colour is used
for all uncommitted changes, i.e. resources that have differencies from
their corresponding index files and resources that are not tracked by git
(and are not ignored). Most of the plumbing code was shamelessly copied
from CVSLightweightDecorator.
