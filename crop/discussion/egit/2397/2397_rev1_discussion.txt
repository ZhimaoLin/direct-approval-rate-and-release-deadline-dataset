DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Move "Compute Change-Id for Gerrit" to repo config

The idea of this change is that we can simplify the commit dialog by
removing the Change-Id check box from it. Instead, it can be configured
in the Git property page of a project. The setting is stored in the
.git/config file of the corresponding repo.

In the commit dialog, we then add a Change-Id automatically if it's
configured for the repo to which we are committing.

Maybe an entry in the commit message context menu is also necessary, for
manual adding.

This is an interesting approach. I actually like it but not sure if this is the kosher way of handling things. It's better than an Eclipse preference imho too :)

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> The key you use should be mentioned in the commit message.

I like this approach, because its similar to the commit-msg hook that Gerrit comes with; you install it in your repository and it always updates your commits.  The downside is, the hook fires even if you don't want a Change-Id in your message.

But I'm not sure that is a problem.  I think if your upstream is using Gerrit Johnathan Pham, you probably just always want the Change-Id automatically inserted in any commit you make in this repository.  At least that's my use case.  :-)
