DESCRIPTION

Move "Compute Change-Id for Gerrit" to repo config

The idea of this change is that we can simplify the commit dialog by
removing the Change-Id check box from it. Instead, it can be configured
in the Git property page of a project. The setting is stored in the
.git/config file of the corresponding repo as follows:

[gerrit]
	addChangeId = true

In the commit dialog, we then add a Change-Id automatically if it's
configured for the repo to which we are committing. If the Change-Id is
not wanted for a specific commit, it can be removed by deleting the line
from the message.

Change-Id: Ie1b49677cf2cec30a0a41ac15608db9dd87b9dc6

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I wonder if we shouldn't put things where they belong: if this is a repository configuration, we should show it there (and let it be changed there, too).
Unfortunately, the UI support for the repository configuration is currently very limited (it's shown as Property page when a Repository is selected in the Repositories View), but we will need more of this kind of configuration soon (autosetupmerge and autosetuprebase come to my mind, for example), so  I think we should look into this direction (e.g. some sort of "Repository configuration" dialog).
I don't think Eclipse users would ever understand that they have to open a Project property page to find a property that is not stored in the project meta data.
Furthermore, going the configuration approach, we could also tell users to add this flag to the user-specific configuration so that they don't have to bother with configuring each repository one by one.

Patch Set 2:

I agree, it's not quite right in the project properties.

Are you thinking about a property page dialog which can be opened from the Git Repositories view? CVS has this, it can be opened via the context menu of a repository or using File -> Properties.

Patch Set 2:

I think it should be similar to what we have under Preferences > Team > Git > Configuration for system-wide and user-wide configuration. We could just add another tab "Repository" on that preference page and add a combo for selecting the repository

Patch Set 2:

I like Matthias' idea. We could still add a context menu in the Repositories View to quickly open this preference page (without having to click Window > Preferenes > Team > Git > Configuration > Select Repository), but in general I think that this would be the right place to add this UI.

It shouldn't be a big deal to add this third tab to the Preferences page (something like "Repository setting" next to "User setting" and "System setting").

Unfortnuately, we don't have any semantics on these pages (yet), so the next step may be to improve the dialog shown after clicking the "New Entry..." button with some help regarding keys and values to assist users with the task of setting configuration values.

I created https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=336415 for the repository configuration.

Should I abandon this change for now?
