DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary refresh request when removing repositories

The 'Git Repositories' view has listeners for monitoring changes to
the list of repositories that should be displayed. This listener is
triggered during the repository removal operation so it is not
necessary for the operation to explicitly request that the view
refresh itself.
