DESCRIPTION

Fix infinite loop on branch deletion

This change fixes several issues in the branch deletion action of
repositories view:

1. Branch deletion was done in the UI thread. Execution is done in
ModalContext thread now.
2. Branch deletion executed multiple workspace runnables. A top level
workspace runnable is added to provide atomicity and to avoid multiple
change broadcasting.
3. RepositoryPropertySourceProvider performed a syncExec in its config
change listener which caused the loop.

Patch Set 1:

I believe this infinite loop bug was also an issue at the JGit level when the packed-refs file was racily clean.
