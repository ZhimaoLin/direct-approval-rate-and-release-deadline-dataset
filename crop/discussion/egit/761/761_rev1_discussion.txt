Hmm, Does the project have to be a Java project? I guess
the PDE build does nothing here, so we need only a placeholder, i.e. generic project and the only way to build this project is through maven?

We need 1.3+ in order to be able to make use of the nice improvements which simplified our ant script considerably. This version is available here

You are right we don't have Java in here, so I will remove the  Java nature.
