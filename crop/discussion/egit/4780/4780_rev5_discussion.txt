DESCRIPTION

Skip clone for import of project from existing repo

Before, we would abort importing when the target directory already
existed. Now we check if the target directory contains a repository that
was cloned from the same URL and if so, skip the clone step. When the
target exists and is not a repo or not for the same URL, we still abort.
