DESCRIPTION

Skip clone for import of project from existing repo

Before, we would abort importing when the target directory already
existed. Now we check if the target directory contains a repository that
was cloned from the same URL and if so, skip the clone step. When the
target exists and is not a repo or not for the same URL, we still abort.

(2 inline comments)

see my in line comments

Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitProjectSetCapabilityTest.java -> I would prefer annotate this test case with:

@Test(expected = TeamException.class)

instead of having try-catch block in test logick

Line:198, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/ProjectReferenceImporter.java -> I would rather check all configured remotes not only default one.

Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitProjectSetCapabilityTest.java -> I want to make sure that it's thrown for the last import, i.e. it shouldn't throw for the second import. Is there a way to make sure of that xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:198, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/ProjectReferenceImporter.java -> Good idea, thanks. Done.

Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitProjectSetCapabilityTest.java -> True, xxx@xxx.xxx you cannot assure that exception is thrown from given place in test case, so lets leave it how it is.
