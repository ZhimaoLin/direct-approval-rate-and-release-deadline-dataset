DESCRIPTION

Skip clone for import of project from existing repo

Before, we would abort importing when the target directory already
existed. Now we check if the target directory contains a repository that
was cloned from the same URL and if so, skip the clone step. When the
target exists and is not a repo or not for the same URL, we still abort.

Line:287, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/GitProjectSetCapabilityTest.java -> +1 for such refactoring in general but it's unrelated to the main goal of current changeset. Could you move it in a separate independent changeset?
