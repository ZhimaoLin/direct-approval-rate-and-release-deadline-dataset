DESCRIPTION

Skip clone for import of project from existing repo

Before, we would abort importing when the target directory already
existed. Now we check if the target directory contains a repository that
was cloned from the same URL and if so, skip the clone step. When the
target exists and is not a repo or not for the same URL, we still abort.

There are two minor issues in code style, I'll fix them, rebase it and then merge it

Line:93, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/ProjectReferenceImporter.java -> style-nit: we don't use curly brackets around single line blocks
