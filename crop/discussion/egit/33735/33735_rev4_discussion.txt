Patch Set 4:

> A bare repository should be treated as no repository I think. 

RI view won't try to initialize rebasing plan for bare repository or repository without working copy any longer (copied from StagingView), but it will still display repository description in the view's header. Don't know if it should be considered an issue to be fixed or just a feature.
