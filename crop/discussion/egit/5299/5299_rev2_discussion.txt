DESCRIPTION

Proposal: make the staging view use the IndexDiffCache

This makes the staging view no longer use a separat "Staging view
indexer job", but rather uses the already existant (and always updated)
IndexDiffCacheEntry for the selected repository.

This is WIP, especially as i can't get the SWTBot test to behave.
everything works if i click through manually, but when the bot selects
the repository node in the test, the staging view is not notified, and
thus the view is not updated (breaking the test).

all suggestions welcome!

Patch Set 2:

IMO we should keep the refresh button, it's handy to be able to explicitly trigger refresh e.g. after doing changes outside the workbench

Please update the commit message so that we can submit this change when Jens reviewed it.

On which platform do you see test failures ? Which test is failing ?

Patch Set 2:

i see the test failure on my gentoo linux in a Xephyr nested x server, running the StagingViewTest solely. it fails because the selection of the repository node in the (inactive!) repository view in the background does not trigger a selection event. this causes the staging view to not do anything - and the test fails. it works when i manually activate the view and click on the repository node - no idea whats wrong with the test.

new patchset with new commit message is coming up...
