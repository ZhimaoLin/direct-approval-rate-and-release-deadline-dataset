Noticed that the mnemonic is missing, and one style nit.

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteTagOnCommitHandler.java -> We usually have execute first, could you move this method one down?

Line:1447, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> The mnemonic is missing (sorry, didn't notice the first time). Maybe use "e", as "d" is already taken.

Line:54, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteTagOnCommitHandler.java -> Done

Line:1447, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> I am unable to test that. I use OSX where Mnemonics are not supported! :-D
