Some comments, otherwise looks good!

Line:49, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteTagOnCommitHandler.java -> Where is the implementation of isEnabled? Looks like the menu entry is currently also enabled when there is no tag on the commit.

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/DeleteTagOnCommitHandler.java -> typo "mulitple"

Line:1447, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> I think this should be "Delete Tag..." and we should ask for confirmation even when exactly 1 tag is selected.

The reason for this is that tags (e.g. ones with message and a tag date) are a bit harder to recover than branches. And for branches, the menu entry asks in case the branch is unmerged.
