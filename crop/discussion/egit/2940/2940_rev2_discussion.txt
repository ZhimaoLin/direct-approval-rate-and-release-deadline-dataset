DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Include 'Rebase' action in projects context menu

Accessing 'rebase' command only form 'Repositories view' isn't obvious
for newcomers. This action should be also included in projects context
menu same as commit and add actions.

Not only 'Rebase' action is added, but also 'Continue', 'Skip' and
'Abort' actions are added. When repository is in 'SAFE' state only
'Rebase' action is shown in context menu, but when repository state
changes to 'REBASING_INTERACTIVE' 'Rebase' action isn't included but
'Continue', 'Skip' and 'Abort' actions are show in context menu.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Very good initiative. However, I see an issue with storing the repository state in the project node persistently.

Fortunately enough, there is no need for doing so. We now build our own "Team" menu using the org.eclipse.ui.menus contribution. It should be easy enough to add the actions there (in the plugin.xml go to org.eclipse.ui.menus->popup:org.eclipse.ui.popoup.any?...->T&eam. Look at the "R&emote" node to see how to add commands there).

It's also better in the long run not to rely on the org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus extension....
