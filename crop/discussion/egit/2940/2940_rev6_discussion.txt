DESCRIPTION

Include 'Rebase' action in projects context menu

Accessing 'rebase' command only form 'Repositories view' isn't obvious
for newcomers. This action should be also included in projects context
menu same as commit and add actions.

Not only 'Rebase' action is added, but also 'Continue', 'Skip' and
'Abort' actions are added. When repository is in 'SAFE' state only
'Rebase' action is shown in context menu, but when repository state
changes to 'REBASING_INTERACTIVE' 'Rebase' action isn't included but
'Continue', 'Skip' and 'Abort' actions are show in context menu.

Hopefully the last one... We should also cleanup the menu labels (I found some issue with the one used in the Repositories View), but don't worry about this right now.

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/RebaseCurrentRefCommand.java -> I'm not absolutely sure about this, but please use Object, not ISelection here; we aren't losing anything bug might prevent ClassCastExceptions in certain circumstances.

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/RebaseCurrentRefCommand.java -> ClassCastException should never appear here. In case when selected element isn't instance of ISelection the ExecutionException will be thrown from org.eclipse.ui.handlers.HandlerUtil.getCurrentSelectionChecked(ExecutionEvent) and we can't prevent from throwing this exception. Therefore I don't think that making currentSelection to be an type of Object make any sense here.
