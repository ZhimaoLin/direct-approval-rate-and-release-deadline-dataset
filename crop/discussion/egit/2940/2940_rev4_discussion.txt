DESCRIPTION

Include 'Rebase' action in projects context menu

Accessing 'rebase' command only form 'Repositories view' isn't obvious
for newcomers. This action should be also included in projects context
menu same as commit and add actions.

Not only 'Rebase' action is added, but also 'Continue', 'Skip' and
'Abort' actions are added. When repository is in 'SAFE' state only
'Rebase' action is shown in context menu, but when repository state
changes to 'REBASING_INTERACTIVE' 'Rebase' action isn't included but
'Continue', 'Skip' and 'Abort' actions are show in context menu.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Yes, almost there: if you let AbstractRebaseComandHandler extend from AbstratSharedCommandHandler, we can save some more coding...

Oh, and I think I'd move the getRef method there, too.
