DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Include 'Rebase' action in projects context menu

Accessing 'rebase' command only form 'Repositories view' isn't obvious
for newcomers. This action should be also included in projects context
menu same as commit and add actions.

Not only 'Rebase' action is added, but also 'Continue', 'Skip' and
'Abort' actions are added. When repository is in 'SAFE' state only
'Rebase' action is shown in context menu, but when repository state
changes to 'REBASING_INTERACTIVE' 'Rebase' action isn't included but
'Continue', 'Skip' and 'Abort' actions are show in context menu.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Much better. However, there is  a ClassCastException now (see my inline comment).

In addition, you might want to move the command implementations from the repository.tree package into the commands.shared package (and also use the abstract handler class there). I introduced this package to hold all command implementations that are not specific for the RepoView or Team context menu; feel free to add a "getRef()" method to the abstract class for later re-use.

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RebaseCurrentRefCommand.java -> This fails when you call rebase from a RepositoryNode (i.e. a "Repository" node from the repo view; in this case, ref should simply be null; doing something like 

if (node.getType() == RepositoryTreeNodeType.Ref)
ref = ((RefNode)...
else
ref = null;

should do the job.
