DESCRIPTION

Make merge and rebase result status more visible

The dialogs displaying the results of a merge or rebase should make the
user aware that something didn't work out, e.g. when a conflict or
an error occurred.

The dialogs now use the standard messagebox icons (error, info, warning)
to communicate the status.

Also made the pull and merge dialogs look a bit more similar.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

IMHO for consistency when current branch is already up to date result stats dialog should also have info icon.

Also icon should be on the left side of status message like in normal info/warning/error dialogs
