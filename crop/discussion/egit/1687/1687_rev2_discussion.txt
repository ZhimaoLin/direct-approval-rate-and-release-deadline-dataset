DESCRIPTION

Extract utility method to open Eclipse preferences

On Mac the menu entry for Eclipse preferences is located in the
application menu. On all other platforms it is located in the
"Window" menu. Hence special code is needed to open it in SWTBot
tests. Extract this code from GlobalConfigurationPageTest to
enable reuse from other UI tests.
