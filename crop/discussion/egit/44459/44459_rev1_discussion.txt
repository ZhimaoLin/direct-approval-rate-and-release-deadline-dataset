DESCRIPTION

Fix ResourceUtil performance on big repositories/workspaces

IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI(URI) and
findFilesForLocationURI(URI) methods performs very poor on big
repositories and workspaces, and gets even worse with lot of links in
the workspace too. Example is the staging view with 2000 changes files
on a huge workspace - updating the index is faster then updating the
staging view which uses ResourceUtil!

The fix tries first to get the direct workspace resources map hit by
using IWorkspaceRoot.get*ForLocation(IPath) and only if this
fails, fail over to the slow find*ForLocationURI methods.

This works very fast for almost all cases (constant execution time) and
adds only a small overhead if the matching project/folder is contained
in a *closed* project which overlaps location of another *opened*
project.

See also similar fix in IteratorService (bug 440722 commit
d3a78e05381ff38370ba6a6a1d6733d741d15f45).

Patch Set 1:

please move this change to master, as I explained on the egit-dev list I created stable-4.0 to be able to create 4.0-m1 without disturbing the ongoing work on master. 4.0 development continues on master until we send the 4.0 IP log for review. I'll merge the stable branch back to master soon.
