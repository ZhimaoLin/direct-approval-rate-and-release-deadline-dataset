DESCRIPTION

Fix LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement using getFullPath for absolute path

Similar to bug 378948, it was confusing workspace paths with filesystem
locations.

Change it to accept an IPath directly and work with that to get to the
File object. Also, correct the error handling which passed null as an
IStatus causing an NPE.
