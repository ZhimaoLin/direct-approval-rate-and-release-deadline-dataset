page tailored for JBoss which isn't appropriate for EGit.

Patch Set 3:

About the font size, there is a CSS file you can override ( https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-maven-plugins/blob/master/tycho-plugins/repository-utils/src/main/resources/web/site.css ). Using Firebug or equivalent might help you to find the right property.
Once you know what change to make, use the "siteTemplateFolder" property in your pom to point to a folder containing this alternative CSS file. Then the mojo should use it.

Or maybe you could just simply set the "skipWebContentGeneration" property to true the plugin configuration, so you would rely on regular Eclipse pages.

it seems the style sheet
https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-maven-plugins/blob/master/tycho-plugins/repository-utils/src/main/resources/xslt/site.xsl#L28 is hardcoding the font size in this table to x-small
