DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Fix GitRepositoriesViewFetchAndPushTest

ContextMenuHelper was removed from GitRepositoriesViewFetchAndPushTest
because it was assumed that ContextMenuHelper causes the test failures.
Instead of ContextMenuHelper the context menu is triggered by using
the SWTBot contextMenu method. To make this work the setEnabled method
of FetchConfiguredRemoteCommand was changed to use
ISources.ACTIVE_CURRENT_SELECTION_NAME instead of
ISources.ACTIVE_MENU_SELECTION_NAME. Otherwise the test fails because
FetchConfiguredRemoteCommand is not enanbled when clicking the Fetch
context menu entry.

Patch Set 1:

Test error on Hudson: The widget {(of type 'MenuItem' and with mnemonic 'Push')} was disposed.

Problem could be that refresh of Repositories View happens while test clicks on context menu.
