DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources.

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, decorators, actions, etc.

Patch Set 4:

I've added a test class with a few test cases related to linked resources.
Not sure why the build on hudson failed. The test on which it failed passed fine here, but another test failed here but not on hudson.
Overall I don't get consistent results with swtbot, and as a result don't rely on it for submitting code.
Is there anything I should be aware to make these SWT tests work all the time?
I'm on eclipse 3.7.2 on linux 64bit.

Patch Set 4:

UI tests are sometimes unstable because they run into a timeout because the machine on which they run is pretty slow.

I17ac04228f4cf5a7df0c9066d5d4e853c2ab9fc5 was recently submitted which may help. Could you rebase your change?

Would be nice to get this change in for 2.2.
