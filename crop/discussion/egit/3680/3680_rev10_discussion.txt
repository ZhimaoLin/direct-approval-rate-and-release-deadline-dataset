DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources.

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, handlers, actions, etc.

Patch Set 10:

I've reduced the scope of this change in the latest patch set as recommended in previous comments. It's still a big change, so I understand the desire to merge it after egit 2.2. Just bear in mind however that I've been keeping it up-to-date since June last year. Please let's make it a point to review and merge it just after egit 2.2 gets released.
