DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources.

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, decorators, commands, and operations.

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CommitActionHandler.java -> reformat

Line:43, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/AssumeUnchangedActionHandler.java -> This is inconstent with other operations that accept linked resources, but ignore them when executing the operation.

The same pattern seems to apply to other operations and patterns.

I pushed a new version of this change. Unfortunately, due to some difficulties when migrating my gerrit user to the new eclipse git/gerrit server, pushing it again gave it a new home:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5766/
ChangeId is still the same though...

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CommitActionHandler.java -> Done.
