DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, handlers, actions, etc.

I've changed the code accordingly to answer each comment, except in the case of RepositoryFinder for which I ask confirmation before proceeding.
