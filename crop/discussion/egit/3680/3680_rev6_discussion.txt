DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources.

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, decorators, actions, etc.

In the end this change request has been reassigned to me, so let's keep this one.

Line:118, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryAction.java -> Shouldn't we also check isEnabled() which checks handler.isEnabled()?
I'm asking because this change request provides most handlers with an implementation of isEnabled() that checks whether linked resources are selected. But if handler.execute() method is called without prior checking of isEnabled() then maybe a double check should be made in the handler.execute(). Comments anyone?

Patch Set 6:

Actually I just thought of some particular case that probably needs to be catered for: linked resources pointing to resources outside the project folder in the file system but still within the same git repository. In such case the linked resource can be operated on. With the recent change that makes sure we use IPath instead of IResource, maybe that should work.
Thoughts anyone?
