DESCRIPTION

Gracefully ignore linked resources

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources. This patch adds a few checks to
gracefully ignore them in a few functional cases: iterator, handlers,
actions, etc.

It was my plan to submit this today, but I see Matthias was faster :).

Well done Fran√ßois! Remember for your next change, keep it as focused as possible, do refactorings (e.g. trackAllFiles in this change) as separate changes, which could have been merged right away.

I've made a couple edits to http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/New_and_Noteworthy/2.3 to reflect this change.
Thanks everyone for reviewing and committing this change that has grown bigger than I expected. I certainly will pay more attention to the granularity of changes in the future!
