It's not a 'extract class' refactoring as it changes original logic.

Line:9, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/ProjectReferenceImporter.java -> Should it be .internal? The only usage for now is in GitProjectSetCapability. Yes, it has a default access level for class itself and its constructor but it would be better to express ths fact (it's for internal use and not an API) explicitly.

Line:67, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/ProjectReferenceImporter.java -> It's not a simple refactoring AKA extract class. It has logic that is different from original one and it changes original functionality.
