Line:125, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/TagActionHandler.java -> I'd prefer to remove the field itself. Feels a bit unclean to have a field which is only valid during the execute method. It should be a local variable in execute and passed as an argument to getTagTarget. What do you think?
