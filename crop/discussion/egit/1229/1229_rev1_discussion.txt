DESCRIPTION

Clone operation should run in background

As cloning is a long-running task, it should always run as
background job with a non-modal dialog. Introduced a job
family so we can easily join on the Clone operation to wait
for it to finish.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I git the following problem on testing:
Import->Git->Projects from Git
Push "Clone"
Now the clone Job runs in background
After the clone Job has finished, the new repo is not offered in the repository list.
I think this should be fixed. Additionally the user should somehow see that the Import projects from Git dialog is waiting for the result of the clone operation.

Patch Set 1: IP review completed

As Jens mentioned, we have an issue when going through the Git Import wizard. We have to see whether we should close the wizard and pop it back up after the clone is done. If we have a checkbox saying whether or not the clone should be done in the background, we can decide how to act. Not all clones will take forever and warrant the running in the background behavior.
