DESCRIPTION

Clone operation should run in background

As cloning is a long-running task, it should always run as
background job with a non-modal dialog. Introduced a job
family so we can easily join on the Clone operation to wait
for it to finish.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Now import wizard uses getContainer.run to clone and clone action in repository view uses a Job. This seems to be the best solution.

Small bug in code (see inline comment).

Line:206, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCloneWizard.java -> Is it better to pass e.getCause() to handleError? This brings the real cause on top.

Line:233, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCloneWizard.java -> override this method

Thanks

Line:206, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCloneWizard.java -> Done, you're right, passing the real case makes more sense.

Line:233, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitCloneWizard.java -> Done, good catch
