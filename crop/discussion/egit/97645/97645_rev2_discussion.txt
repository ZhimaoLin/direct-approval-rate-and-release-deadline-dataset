DESCRIPTION

Extract commitMessageCalculation to separate class

As a preparation for the implementation of Bug 516867 (Support cursor
positioning for CommitMessageProviders), I moved
calculateCommitMessage() from CommitMessageComponent to a separate
class.

Hi,

can anyone help with the failed test in this build? It doesn't seem to be related with my changes.

org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Failed to execute runnable (java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Argument not valid)

Thanks!

Good point, keeping the CommitMessageProviders stateless.
In this case, it doesn't make sense, that ICommitMessageProvider2 extends ICommitMessageProvider.
Is it okay, if one Extension Point accepts two different interface types?

Good Morning.
Another short question... What do you prefer:

CommitMessageComponent could keep track of the caret position, analog to commitMessage (introduce new fields caretPosittion & previousCaretPosition. Add a field caretPosition in CommitMessageComponentState).

or

Use the type CommitMessageWithCaretPosition instead of these two separate fields?
