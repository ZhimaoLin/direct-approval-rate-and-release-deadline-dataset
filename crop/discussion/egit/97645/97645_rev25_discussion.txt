DESCRIPTION

Add ICommitMessageProvider2 for caret positioning in commit messages

The caret in the CommitMessageComponent is placed according to the
value of getDesiredCaretPosition() of the first implementation of
ICommitMessageProvider2 that provides caret position. In case there
are multiple implementations available that provide a defined caret
position the second and subsequent positions are ignored.

Commit messages are not trimmed anymore to ensure consistency between
a provided message and the provided caret position.

Includes unit and UI tests.

> How does the CQ work?

It's a legal review required for contributions with more than 1000 changed lines by people who are not Eclipse Committers.

Matthias or I will have to create one, then the legal team will review and approve it, then we can submit it.

I just wanted to wait and see what Matthias's opinion on this change is now. I think it doesn't make sense to let the legal team look at something that's still in flux. Though by now I think this change here is fine and won't see major modifications anymore.

@Matthias: could you look over this once again? I've been so heavily involved that I may not notice flaws anymore.

Line:64, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitMessageComponentStateManager.java -> This needs to be improved. If somebody has this and then opens the workspace with an Eclipse that has an older Egit version, he'll get an InvalidObjectIdException.

Add the new caret position at the end. Then old Egit can read state saved by new EGit (it'll simply ignore the caret position).
