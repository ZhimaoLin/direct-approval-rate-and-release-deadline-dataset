DESCRIPTION

Add ICommitMessageProvider2 for caret positioning in commit messages

The caret in the CommitMessageComponent is placed, according to the
value of getDesiredCaretPosition() of the first implementation of
ICommitMessageProvider2, that provides caret position. In case there are
multiple implementations available, which provide a defined caret
position, they are ignored.
Commit messages are not trimmed anymore, to ensure consistency between a
provided message and the provided caret position.

Patch Set 10:

I added a first ui testcase, based on an executable extension factory, which adds an ICommitMessageProvider2 implementation.
This is my first work with SWTbot and I am not an experienced rcp developer either.
So any feedback is welcome.
