DESCRIPTION

Add ICommitMessageProvider2 for caret positioning in commit messages

The caret in the CommitMessageComponent is placed, according to the
value of getCaretPosition() of the first implementation of
ICommitMessageProvider2, that was discovered. In case there are multiple
implementations available, they are ignored.
Commit messages are not trimmed anymore, to ensure consistency between a
provided message and the provided caret position.
