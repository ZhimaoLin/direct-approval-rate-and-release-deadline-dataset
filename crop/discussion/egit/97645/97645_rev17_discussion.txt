DESCRIPTION

Add ICommitMessageProvider2 for caret positioning in commit messages

The caret in the CommitMessageComponent is placed according to the
value of getDesiredCaretPosition() of the first implementation of
ICommitMessageProvider2 that provides caret position. In case there
are multiple implementations available that provide a defined caret
position the second and subsequent positions are ignored.

Commit messages are not trimmed anymore to ensure consistency between
a provided message and the provided caret position.

Includes unit and UI tests.

Thanks for the support!
Can you think of more test cases, that we should add? 
With max one CommitMessageProvider, configurable for SWTBot tests, we can't have many combinations. And the more complex test cases are already implemented without SWTBot.

Do you think, the current tests are sufficient?

Is the change ready to be merged?
