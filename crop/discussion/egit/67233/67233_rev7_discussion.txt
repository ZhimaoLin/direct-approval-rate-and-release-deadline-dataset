DESCRIPTION

Extended support for nested repositories in project.

The fixes are going to support nested repositories in one project.
I've reworked it based at changes
from "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67186/".

Additions:
* RepositoryMapping
  + getMapping(IPath): searches in all project mappings
  + getMappings(IProject): returns all mappings for a project
* IDecoratableResource, DecoratableResource etc.
  + isWorkingTreeRoot(): returns true if a resource is a repository
container, like project, submodule or nested repository woorking tree
root)

Refactorings:
* GitProjectData: renamed hasSubmodules() to hasInnerRepositories(),
because not just submodules but all "inner" working trees (repositories)
are supported
* introduced RepositoryMapping-getProjectData(), because needed in other
methods multiple times
