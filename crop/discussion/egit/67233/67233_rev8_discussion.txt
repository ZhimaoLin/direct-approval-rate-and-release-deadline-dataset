DESCRIPTION

Extended support for nested repositories in project.

The fixes are going to support nested repositories in one project.
I've reworked it based at changes
from "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67186/".

Additions:
* RepositoryMapping
  + getMapping(IPath): searches in all project mappings
  + getMappings(IProject): returns all mappings for a project
* IDecoratableResource, DecoratableResource etc.
  + isRepositoryContainer(): returns true if a resource is a repository
container, like project, submodule or nested repository woorking tree
root)

Refactorings:
* GitProjectData: renamed hasSubmodules() to hasInnerRepositories(),
because not just submodules but all "inner" working trees (repositories)
are supported
* introduced RepositoryMapping-getProjectData(), because needed in other
methods multiple times

Also, this change mixes two things: cleaning up the DecoratableResourceAdapter, and refactoring RepositoryMapping.getMapping(IPath) to make it support submodules and inner modules. Would be better if those were two different changes.

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceAdapter.java -> "for decorating projects and folders..."

Line:327, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Use xxx@xxx.xxx IProject project" to make JDT format better. Also in other places.

Line:347, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> resource

Line:352, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Needs to be rephrased.

Line:388, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Unless I overlooked something; the only call to this is line 413 below. So there's no need to make this public.

If a public version is needed in the future, it can be introduced then.

Thanks, i will try to split this in two changes.

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceAdapter.java -> Done

Line:327, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Done, also in other places not related to my changes, it's trivial and i hope will be accepted :)

Line:347, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Done

Line:352, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Done

Line:388, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/RepositoryMapping.java -> Done
