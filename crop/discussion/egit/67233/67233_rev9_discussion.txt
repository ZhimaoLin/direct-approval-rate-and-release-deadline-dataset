DESCRIPTION

Extended support for nested repositories in project.

The fixes are going to support nested repositories in one project.
I've reworked it based at changes
from "https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67186/".

Refactoring of RepositoryMapping.getMapping(IPath) to make it support
submodules and inner repositories.

* RepositoryMapping
  * changed getMapping(IPath): searches in all project mappings
  * added getMappings(IProject): returns all mappings for a project
  * introduced getProjectData(): because needed in other methods
multiple times
