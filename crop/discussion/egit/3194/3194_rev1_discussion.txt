good catch

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/PasteCommand.java -> you can't add a copyright for SAP, instead add a new line with your company's copyright

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/PasteCommand.java -> URIRISH looks strange, maybe better URIISH ?

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/PasteCommand.java -> we don't need this comment, the commit's diff has the same information and doesn't clutter this class

Line:58, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/PasteCommand.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: don't put the bug id in the commit message header instead add a bug footer, Gerrit will then render a proper hyperlink. Also include a Gerrit change-id using the commit message hook (see contributor guide how to install that) or EGit

so this should look like:

 Pasting remote git ...
