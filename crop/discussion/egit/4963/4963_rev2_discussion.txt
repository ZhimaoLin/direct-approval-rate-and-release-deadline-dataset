DESCRIPTION

Initialize date format to fix failing CompareActionTest

CompareActionTest.testCompareWithCommit() fails since
GraphLabelProvider.format is null if relativeDate(boolean) hasn't been
called. Fix this by initializing format with default. This bug was
introduced with change Ifb31dc38ea673b096869437b03e3c738fa89a07c.
