DESCRIPTION

IndexDiffCache: recalculate IndexDiff if too many resources changed

Calculating an IndexDiff for a given list of files is more expensive
than calculating a complete IndexDiff if the number of files is big.
Now a complete IndexDiff is calculated if a big number of resources has
changed.
Furthermore tracing was improved.
