By the way, I wonder if we wouldn't be better off just using a ViewerSorter instead of doing the sorting in the content provider. Because the ViewerSorter uses the label, it would be correctly sorted already. What do you think?

Line:381, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewContentProvider.java -> What if there are multiple files with the same name (e.g. pom.xml) in different directories? Should sort by full path then.
