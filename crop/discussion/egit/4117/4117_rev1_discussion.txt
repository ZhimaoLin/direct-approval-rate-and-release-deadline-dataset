DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Open files in content-type specific editor.

Updates the "Open in Text Editor" command to be "Open in Editor".
This affects the double-click action as well as context menu action
in the Git Repositories view to no longer be hard-wired to open
selected files in the default text editor.
