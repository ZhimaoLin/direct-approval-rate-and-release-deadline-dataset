DESCRIPTION

RFC: redesign history search widget

Use a pop-up widget in the top-left corner of the history view as
suggested in the bug report.

Four minor problems:
* Visual updates for keeping the pop-up in the top-left corner lag
  a little bit when the view is resized.
* Finding the correct position is not as clean as I would have liked.
  A method somewhere to obtain that top-left corner of a view part's
  main content control might be helpful.
* The pop-up is done using a shell. SWT/JFace does not seem to have
  support for shells that auto-resize to the size of their contents.
  At least I haven't found anything and have thus implemented my own
  work-around.
* Moving the history view between windows closes the pop-up if the
  shell cannot be re-parented.
