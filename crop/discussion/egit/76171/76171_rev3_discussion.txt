DESCRIPTION

RFC: redesign history search widget

Use a pop-up widget in the top-left corner of the history view as
suggested in the bug report.

Four minor problems:
* Visual updates for keeping the pop-up in the top-left corner lag
  a little bit when the view is resized.
* Finding the correct position is not as clean as I would have liked.
  A method somewhere to obtain that top-left corner of a view part's
  main content control might be helpful.
* The pop-up is done using a shell. SWT/JFace does not seem to have
  support for shells that auto-resize to the size of their contents.
  At least I haven't found anything and have thus implemented my own
  work-around.
* Moving the history view between windows closes the pop-up if the
  shell cannot be re-parented.

Patch Set 3:

PS3:

* Fix the clipped text on GTK. Problem is really in SWT, which apparently cannot compute correctly the extent of proportional-font text. Work-around: use JFaceResources.getTextFont(), which is typically a monospaced font.

* Re-do the search when widget is re-opened with text: done.

* Shadow: no can do; it's a feature of the shell and I have no idea how I could get rid of that. Note that tooltips also have shadows.

* Background: I'd rather stay away from that. Got strange effects on GTK. (Background mode INHERIT_FORCE, and set the color to the one from the commit message view: works even when switching to dark theme, but some buttons don't seem to respect the background color when the popup is _not_ focused.)

* Re-do the search when the search scope changes: I'd prefer to do that in a follow-up change. This functionality is unchanged; I'd like this change to be about the visual appearance. We can improve the find logic later.
