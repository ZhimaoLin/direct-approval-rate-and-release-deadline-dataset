DESCRIPTION

RFC: redesign history search widget

Use a pop-up widget in the top-left corner of the history view as
suggested in the bug report.

Four minor problems:
* Visual updates for keeping the pop-up in the top-left corner lag
  a little bit when the view is resized.
* Finding the correct position is not as clean as I would have liked.
  A method somewhere to obtain that top-left corner of a view part's
  main content control might be helpful.
* The pop-up is done using a shell. SWT/JFace does not seem to have
  support for shells that auto-resize to the size of their contents.
  At least I haven't found anything and have thus implemented my own
  work-around.
* Moving the history view between windows closes the pop-up if the
  shell cannot be re-parented.

I agree. It's more "eclipsy", too, and a little less hacky.

@Thomas, are you interested in helping eclipse platform to design such a widget for the search functionality? The current popup is really annoying.

Interested yes, but, alas, I don't really have the time for it. Also, personally, I don't find the global search dialog that bad. A popup like the one prototyped here in this change has the basic problem that it obscures part of the view. That search could be improved is certain; otherwise there wouldn't be various plugins in marketplace that offer different ways of "insta-search". But hashing out all the nitty-gritty details of a general-purpose search widget is more than I could take on right now.

I agree Ctrl+H is good and I would leave that one. My suggestion was for Ctrl+F

> Interested yes, but, alas, I don't really have the time for it. 

Understandable, a common problem. :-)
