The commit message should not explain what you are doing but why you are doing this change. The what is in the diff ...

So I would write something like:

Fix NPE when deleting project used in Synchronize View

NPE is hit when user deletes project that currently is used in Sychronize View.

do not put the bug number here, this belongs into the commit message

Line:372, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTree.java -> style nit: no braces around single line

don't put the bug number here, this belongs into the commit message and has no more relevance as soon as the bug is fixed. If somebody wants to understand why this was added he can check the project history (e.g. using git blame) and will find the bug number in the commit message
