DESCRIPTION

Make use of secure storage for ssh auth again

Let EGitCredentialsProvider handle all currently known credential types
instead of just username and password. Both pubkey and password auth
work.

Reverts http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3574 so that the
EGitCredentialsProvider is not silently overwritten.

Additionally removes the need for http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3594

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please address my comments from patch set #1 regarding the commit message and trailing whitespaces.

Patch Set 2:

I did cannot see any red-flagged whitespace in patch set 2 anymore!? I also commmented your comment to the commit message in patch set 1. It's still marked as "draft" though, so I'm not sure you can see that. I don't know how I could mark it as non-draft either.

Patch Set 2:

Right, the whitespace errors are away now. My fault: I looked at a diff between patchset #1 and #2 which ignored whitespaces.

Regarding the commit message: I cannot see any comments from you when they are still in "draft" status. You have "Review" the patchset where you put your comments to publish all comments. From change overview click on "Patch Set 1", press the "Review" button in the Patch Set 1 section and then press "Publish comments"

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

I still have some question which I'll ask on the mailing list. But this proposal is ok for me.
