DESCRIPTION

Make use of secure storage for ssh auth again

Let EGitCredentialsProvider handle all currently known credential types
instead of just username and password. Both pubkey and password auth
work.

Reverts http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3574 so that the
EGitCredentialsProvider is not silently overwritten.

Additionally removes the need for http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3594

I like this attempt. It requires less jgit changes as in my proposal #3594. I will abandon #3594 when this one got accepted.

Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/credentials/EGitCredentialsProvider.java -> Style-nit: please remove the trailing whitespaces here and in 13 other places in this file. The gerrit web-ui tells you with red markers about trainling whitespaces.

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CustomPromptDialog.java -> Style-nit: please remove the trailing whitespaces in this file

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Are you sure this is for ssh authentication? When I use EGit to push via ssh then your new dialogs don't pop up. SSH communication goes through the jsch component and their dialogs.
I think this proposal fixes http pushes and https pushes where I am asked for http user/password or, during https communication, passphrases to access certificate stores

Thanks Christian, here's my comment.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This patch basically provides complete credential support for EGit and is similar to the AwtCredentialsProvider for the jgit commandline app. So it may indeed fix http authentication issues (of which I am not aware).

It does fix ssh authentication, at least for me. The point is EclipseSshSessionFactory.configure(), where this patch will not overwrite the existing UserInfo (for me always an instance of CredentialsProviderUserInfo) anymore. 

If the session factory installs the UserInfoPrompter, the jsch authentication dialog will be used. And this is the cause for those many authentication dialogs, because username and password are not remembered anywhere.

(And sorry for all that whitespace in the patch, I had disabled the save-actions in Eclipse because of some other problem I had with them).
