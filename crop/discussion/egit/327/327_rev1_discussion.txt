Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I guess you probably wanted to replace http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,269.
What you did put into the new commit message should have rather gone into the cover message in gerrit. The commit message should explain the "why" but not the delta to the previous patch set for the same change. I suggest to update the commit message you had in 269 and push this change as new patch set for 269. Let me know if you need help for that.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Wim:

I moved this patch-set on top of http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,269
if this now contains what you wanted then abandon this change.

Your problem was that the two changes were based on different parent commits (probably you used two different branches). I rebased this change onto the current master and then transferred the commit message of your previous change.
