DESCRIPTION

Don't use alternating row colors for file diff viewer

Alternating row colors are useful for tables with more than one column,
so that it's easier to see which cells belong together. But the commit
file diff viewer table only has one column.

Looking at other such tables in Eclipse, I couldn't find any that uses
alternating row colors.

Also, it makes it harder to see which files are greyed out
(non-interesting ones), see bug 440979.
