DESCRIPTION

[sync] Fix addition/deletion of incoming commit being reversed

When a file is added as part of an incoming commit, it should not be
shown as deleted and vice versa. I don't know why this was done in the
first place.

There was also confusion about what the LEFT and RIGHT direction mean in
the context of synchronization. The static block in
org.eclipse.compare.CompareConfiguration shows that LEFT is incoming and
RIGHT is outgoing.
