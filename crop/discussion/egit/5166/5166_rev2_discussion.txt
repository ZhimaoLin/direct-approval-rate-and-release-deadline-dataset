DESCRIPTION

Wait for remote branches to be fetch in UI test

UI Tests on hudson are failing because of blocked UI with
ListRemoteOperation. This patch adds additional timeouts for
fetch remote branches operation now even when fetch operation fails rest
of test cases should pass because UI would be unlocked.
