DESCRIPTION

[stagingView] Compare against HEAD for conflicting files

Previously, the first index entry was used (base stage, content of file
in common ancestor), which is confusing. Comparing against HEAD is more
sensible in that case.

Patch Set 2:

>I don't think there was any intention when this was chosen, apart from "CONFLICT" files are shown in unstaged changes, so compare against index like the other cases. It just so happens that the first index entry is the base stage.

probably you are right, I was just guessing

> Also, "two stages are shown already in the left hand pane" -> this is no longer the case after you started resolving conflicts.

true, I missed this use case

> I'm not sure. When someone wants the merge tool behavior, they can just use the merge tool instead, no? Or what would be the difference between this new compare and merge tool?

again you are right

> I've heard from several people that the right pane "makes no sense", including the bug reporter. I myself sometimes just staged the conflict and then did compare to see the diff I actually wanted.

understood

> For modified files, comparing shows the differences to what is committed (or staged in case of partial staging). This is just as useful for conflicting files, for a "what's the effective result of this merge?".

+1

> So, in summary, I think the merge tool should be used for a nice real 3-way compare, and compare should be a simple "what would be the changes if I commit the file", as in other cases.

agreed, now I understand the motivation

> (Btw, I'll be on vacation the next few weeks, so won't be able to do any changes, sorry :).)

enjoy your vacation :-)
