DESCRIPTION

Validate repository path entered by the user

Validate the repository path entered in NewRepositoryWizard or
GitImportWizard to prevent we hit an InvalidPathException in JGit.

Since it seems many users try to paste a git clone command or a URL
instead of a local path raise a dedicated error messages for these
cases.
