DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Fix label coordinates for hover detection

The coordinates which are used to detect whether a hover tooltip should
be shown didn't consider the width graph at the left side (cellX).

With only one lane, it's not a big deal, but the more lanes there were
on the left the more off the positions were.

Also widen the coordinates a bit to account for border.

Hey Robin,

I taking a look at this and having some trouble reproducing the issue.

Is it just that the tooltips don't appear when a ref is hovered over?  And it gets worse the more lanes that are in the row?

Patch Set 1:

Yes, that's it. The positions are off by the width of the graph. Try a ref at the far right when there are 5 lanes or so (jgit repo), and you will notice the tooltip doesn't appear. Now go a ref to the left and the tooltip text will be shown for the other ref because it's that much off.

With this change applied, it should work flawlessly.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

I see that this has been fixed in a different way in the meantime in Ib1d6ad50105c746e9f2918bbb1cc212c5ffcdc50 -> abandon this one. There is still one remaining problem, I pushed a fix for that in I23c619e6eed73b8b1055218c57016e502e6dec69.
