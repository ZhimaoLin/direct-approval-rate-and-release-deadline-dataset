DESCRIPTION

Fix that double click is needed to "Check/Uncheck All Repositories"

When using the add existing repository wizard it was necessary to double
click "Check All Repositories"/"Uncheck All Repositories" to
check/uncheck listed repositories. c62ffbf5 tried to fix this but made
it worse for the user: while it unchecked all elements in the UI it then
added all repositories on Finish.
