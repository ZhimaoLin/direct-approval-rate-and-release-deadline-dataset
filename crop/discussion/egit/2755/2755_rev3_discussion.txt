DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Enable pull for multiple repositories

When having multiple projects (each corresponding to a different
repository) and needing to regularly keep up to date with changes, EGit
provides no easy way to deal with this. The only way at the moment is to
select a single project and pull, and repeat that for every project.
When the number of projects is two, this is okay, but for more than a
couple of projects it's simply infeasible.

This change enables pull for multiple repositories. It's more a proof of
concept and has multiple problems, but it's there to get the discussion
started on how to implement this.

Patch Set 3:

Inline comments are fixed in changeset 3.

Yes, ideally there would be only one result dialog, with the results grouped by repository. A tree view may be a good idea, something like:

• Repo 1: already up to date
• Repo 2: pulled
  • Fetched master into origin/master
    • Commit 1
    • Commit 2
  • Merge branch 'master' of git:origin
    • Parent commit 1
    • Parent commit 2

Patch Set 3:

Good idea to improve the PullResultDialog (see Robins remarks in the previous patch set). We might even get away without having to change the PullOperation here... Robin, could you come up with some fix for that?

Without the PullResultDialog improvements, I'd rather have another opinion before accepting this because of the user experience issues described in patch set 1.

Patch Set 3:

I will work on it, but can't give any estimates as to when I'll be able to submit it.

In the meantime, it would be nice if this simple implementation could get in. IMO it's better than no support for pull multiple, and it doesn't negatively affect the interaction for pulling one.

Patch Set 3:

Ok, I suggest the following:

* create a bug that says something like "PullResultDialog should be able to show results for multiple Repositories"
* update the commit message (remove the RFC prefix and the "proof of concept" part, describe the issue we discussed here and mention that new bug)

I might be able to get around to working on the PullResultDialog these days, but we should have a bug first.
