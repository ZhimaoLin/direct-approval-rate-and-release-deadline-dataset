DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Enable pull for multiple repositories

When having multiple projects (each corresponding to a different
repository) and needing to regularly keep up to date with changes, EGit
provides no easy way to deal with this. The only way at the moment is to
select a single project and pull, and repeat that for every project.
When the number of projects is two, this is okay, but for more than a
couple of projects it's simply infeasible.

This change enables pull for multiple repositories. It's more a proof of
concept and has multiple problems, but it's there to get the discussion
started on how to implement this.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Calling the pull operation several times makes the user experience a bit ugly, for example when it comes to errors (multiple error pop-ups etc.)... Also the result dialog currently would be shown several times... Not sure how problematic this is in reality. In the long run, we might need to improve PullOperation to accept multiple repos in its constructor and make sure error handling.

In any case, I'd like to get a second opinion on this aspect.
