DESCRIPTION

Mylyn OCT Support. Vendor-specific task repository resolving

New extension point allows to implement specific task repository
resolving mechanisms for Open Corresponding Task Support.

Task repository url will be resolved in 3 steps:
1. Checking bugtracker.url option in .git/config
2. Asking extensions for url (if step 1 failed)
3. Assuming task repository is on same host as origin (if step 2
failed)

Patch Set 1:

Any idea why this specific mechanism should be pluggable via an extension point? Before creating extension points, it's generally good to have at least two cases in mind.

In the case of extension specific Mylyn connector can use it's internal classes and cached tasks data to resolve task repository.
