DESCRIPTION

Fix build and test failures

- Correcting versions.

[ms:
- Correcting wrong version for org.eclipse.core.filesystem to [1.1,2.0)
- "Require-Bundle:" needs to use "bundle-version:" to specify version.
- Manifest refered to JUnit 4 but test execution specified JUnit 3.
- Fix tests which have been broken by the change
  667f571b "Fix enabling team operations on project import."
- Split packages between org.eclipse.egit.core and org.eclipse.egit.core.test
  caused ClassNotFoundException in test execution hence moving test packages.
