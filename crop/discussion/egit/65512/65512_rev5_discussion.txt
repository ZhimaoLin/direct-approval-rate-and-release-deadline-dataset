DESCRIPTION

Do not autofill clone wizard for arbitrary clipboard input

The clone wizard would auto-fill also if the clipboard contained
arbitrary, non-git related HTTP(S) URLs. This is a regression that was
introduced in commit 39f3c68.

Auto-fill the clone wizard for HTTP(S) clipboard content not ending in
".git" only if  the host is a known git server. A known git server is
one from which the user had already successfully cloned a repository
over HTTP(S). As a convenience, we provide a very small set of default
hosts (git.eclipse.org, github.com, and bitbucket.org).

For HTTP(S) URIs that end in .git, we always pre-fill the wizard.

Also consider only clipboard content up to the first whitespace (after
having removed a potential "git clone" prefix). Formerly, we stopped at
the first blank, not general whitespace, and would thus autofill even
with multi-line clipboard content like

  foobar
  baz
  .git

(No blank in there, just line endings.)

Finally, add a few missing braces and remove a spurious trim() call in
RepositorySelectionPage.
