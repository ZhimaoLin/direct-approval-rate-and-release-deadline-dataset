DESCRIPTION

Do not autofill clone wizard for arbitrary input

The clone wizard would auto-fill also if the clipboard contained
arbitrary, non-git related HTTP(S) URLs. This is a regression that was
introduced in commit 39f3c68.

Remove the tests for HTTP protocols. They are allowed anyway by the
general test that the clipboard content ends in .git.

Also consider only clipboard content up to the first whitespace (after
having removed a potential "git clone" prefix). Formerly, we stopped at
the first blank, not general whitespace, and would thus autofill even
with multi-line clipboard content like

  foobar
  baz
  .git

(No blank in there, just line endings.)

Finally, add missing braces and remove a spurious trim() call.
