DESCRIPTION

Fix cloning a repository with detached HEAD

The clone wizard could not handle remote repositories where the HEAD
is no branch. The SourceBranchPage threw an exception in the
LabelProvider. When the user selected "HEAD" on the
CloneDestinationPage the cloned repository was inconsistent.

Furthermore it is now possible to use the CloneOperation with
arbitrary Refs, not only with refs/heads/*.
