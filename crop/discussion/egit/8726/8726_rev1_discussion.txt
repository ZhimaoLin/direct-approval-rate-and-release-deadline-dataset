DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Remove view setting actions from commit context menu

They are still available from the toolbar menu, just not from the
context menu.

The reason for this is to reduce the menu size. Also, in contrast to all
other actions, they don't "operate" on the selected commit but on the
whole view.
