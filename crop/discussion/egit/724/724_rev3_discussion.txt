DESCRIPTION

Add action to trigger (fast-forward) merge

Add a new action to the team menu which opens
a merge dialog where a branch can be selected.

Currently jgit supports only fast-forward merges,
therefore the action label is "Fast-forward merge..."

In order to achieve better reuse the BranchSelectionDialog
is refactored.
