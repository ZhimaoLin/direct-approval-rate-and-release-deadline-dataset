DESCRIPTION

Add action to trigger (fast-forward) merge

Add a new action to the team menu which opens
a merge dialog where a branch can be selected.

Currently jgit supports only fast-forward merges,
therefore the action label is "Fast-forward merge..."

In order to achieve better reuse the BranchSelectionDialog 
is refactored.

Looks great. You will probably have to rebase due to Iab813336f66328f5a3b7b2e3dbfffc1e79c1d094

I would simply call this new entry "Merge..." for now and make a note as it only supports fast forwarding at the moment in the dialog. We should probably also use a MessageDialog instead of just a Dialog for the branch dialog... it looks very plain at the moment.
