DESCRIPTION

Allow the user to select the Git prefix

The Git prefix is the location of the user's C Git installation. EGit
does not use C Git, but want to see its system wide configuration.

This mainly affects Windows users, since Git for Windows overrides
defaults in $git_prefix/etc/gitconfig. Additionally many Windows users
do not add Git to PATH, so automatically determining the location often
does not work on Windows.

The overridden Git prefix is stored in the workspace

Bug: 301775 (regards finding the setting for core.autocrlf)
