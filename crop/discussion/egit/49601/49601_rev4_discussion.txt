DESCRIPTION

Don't use RepositoryProvider.getProvider() directly to avoid deadlocks

Added ResourceUtil.getGitProvider(IProject) and
ResourceUtil.isSharedWithGit(IResource) utility methods which mimics the
code in the RepositoryProvider.getProvider() without accessing any
locks.

Additionally fixed related, possible NPE's along the RepositoryMapping
constructor and getGitDirAbsolutePath() code.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

I've finally found the solution for the stupid mistake I made in ExistingOrNewPage (caused 2 test failures).

Matthias, would be nice if you could review this one. 
The deadlock is away and there seem to be no side effects.

Everything seem to work if I test it manually and also egit do not deadlock anymore during our the automated test suite (it did it reliably before).
