DESCRIPTION

Revert Jetty from 8.1.3.v20120416 to 7.6.0.v20120127

Update target platform to use the latest available Jetty 7.6.0.v20120127
release instead of Jetty 8.1.3.v20120416. We can't use Jetty 8.x since
it depends on Servlet API 3.0 which requires Java 6 but JGit still wants
to support Java 5.

JGit change I343273d994dc7b6e0287c604e5926ff77d5b585b needs this target
platform.
