Please follow [1] and mark draft changes accordingly using [DRAFT] or [RFC] in commit message header to avoid wasting time of those reviewers which are not interested in incomplete work.

Does your last name really end with "?" ?

We need you to assert the contributor questions as a comment on every change you upload to Gerrit [2].

In general we strive for good test coverage. So if you add a feature or fix a bug also add or enhance tests.

Line:173, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> - text needs to be externalized to enable translation 
- how to invite multiple reviewers ?
- would it be possible to get value help from Gerrit so that only known users can be invited ? I am not sure if this is already exposed by Gerrit's REST API.

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> style nit: this line isn't formatted properly

Line:244, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> we don't use curly braces around single line blocks, see [1]

Line:173, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> * Yes I know that. I intend to create some sort of prototype to check whether it is interesting to you. My blame - I should push it to drafts.
* As i wrote, It's a prototype. In next patch set I will provide more advanced UI.
* I'm going to investigate how Mylyn gerrit connector deals with it.

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> Will be fixed.
