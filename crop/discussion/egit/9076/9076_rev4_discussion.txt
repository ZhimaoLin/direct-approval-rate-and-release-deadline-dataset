Line:285, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> As a "--reviewer" Gerrit can accept:
* User's full name (specified in Gerrit user's settings)
* User's e-mail (specified in Gerrit user's settings)
* User's login (specified in Gerrit user's settings)

Should we somehow inform user what he/she can type in UI ?

Line:527, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushToGerritPage.java -> It's just to present how field assistance looks like.

Line:16, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/IPersonProvider.java -> I've idea for 3 different providers:
* provider of people defined in Eclipse's preferences (In Team -> Git subtree). User can manually add some well known reviewers. This settings may be easily shared among within developer team by using 'Workspace Mechanic' or by importin/exporting Eclipse's preferences.
* we can obtain list of users using REST endpoint that show changes. Yeas I know it will be quite slow but there is no other way to obtain users from gerrit (f you don;t have admini privileges)
* provider that obtains people from gerrit mylyn connector
