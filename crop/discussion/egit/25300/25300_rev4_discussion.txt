DESCRIPTION

Only enable "Open Workspace Version" when file exists

The "Open Workspace Version" menu of the history table now also checks
for existence of the single selected file, similar to the "Compare with
workspace" command.

Thanks for fixing the commit message. Would it be useful to have some validation of such format requirements directly inside EGit maybe, to show a warning icon besides the commit message? I was not aware of that exact requirement, and maybe others also aren't.

Not sure, other Eclipse projects do it differently I think. Our preferred format is documented in the contributor guide:

https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines

But the general format of the commit message footer is generally agreed to AFAIK. I think there was a bug report/comment somewhere about commit message validation, but not sure. In any case, this is low prio IMO :).
