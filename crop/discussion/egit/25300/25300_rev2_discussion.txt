The "Open Workspace Version" menu of the history table now also checks
for existence of the single selected file, similar to the "Compare with
workspace" command.

Line:341, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitFileDiffViewer.java -> That's what I meant. But now that I see it I'm asking myself why we don't use diff.getPath here, it returns the old path in case of a delete. It would be useful to be able open a file that was deleted in a commit but was later restored.

Could you change it to just use getPath and also change it in Action#run? Sorry about that :).

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We put the bug number in a footer line like this:

    Bug: 432915

And the subject should describe what the change does, not the bug, e.g.:

    Only enable "Open Workspace Version" when file exists
