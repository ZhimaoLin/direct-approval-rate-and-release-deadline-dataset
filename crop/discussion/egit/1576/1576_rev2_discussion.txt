DESCRIPTION

Sort roots by full path to ensure stable assertion results

GitResourceVariantTree uses a HashSet to store resource variants
which doesn't guarantee stable sort order which may break the
assertions in GitResourceVariantTreeTest.shouldReturnTwoRoots() [1]. 
To fix this we sort the roots before doing assertions.
