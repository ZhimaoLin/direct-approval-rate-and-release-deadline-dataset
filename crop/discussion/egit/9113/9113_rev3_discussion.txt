DESCRIPTION

Run "click context menu" synchronously where possible in tests

This could further stabilize some tests, as running the context menu
action synchronously makes sure that the action is complete before
returning to the caller.

The asynchronous variant is still necessary for when more UI interaction
is required to complete the action.

Patch Set 3:

The problem was in CompareActionsTest, where sync was used even though a dialog was opened. Should run now.
