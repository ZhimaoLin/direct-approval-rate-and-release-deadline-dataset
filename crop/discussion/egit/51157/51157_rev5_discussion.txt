Max, I think you have found a bug in gitflow plugin with your tests. I think (I haven't checked this) that if gitflow contributes adapters to files, they could make the handler go crazy by supplying repository *also* for external links.
Can you please check this? I can't believe the test failure we see is occasional one. This mist be a hiden bug.
