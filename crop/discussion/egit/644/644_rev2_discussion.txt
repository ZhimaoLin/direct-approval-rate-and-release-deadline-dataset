DESCRIPTION

Fix remaining NLS issues

To reach complete translatability for Helios externalize the remaining
strings visible to end users and put NLS comments to mark technical strings.
Also change compiler settings to raise an error on NLS problems so that we
stay clean from now on and upgrades other compiler settings to Eclipse 3.6
default.
