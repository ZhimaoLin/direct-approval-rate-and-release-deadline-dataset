DESCRIPTION

Move staging/unstaging into a background job.

Since a few commits ago, this sped up drastically, so i don't know
whether there is interest in this change anymore.

Move the staging/unstaging into a job so that the UI does not freeze
while waiting for the index to be calculated/written.

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Rebased just to check it out. 
I don't like the progress dialog that appears, even for small operations.

there was a bug a while ago, that made staging hell slow, and in that case this change helped a lot. but: the bug disappeared, and staging is blazingly fast now again, even for larger numbers. i don't see the need for this change anymore, actually. abandon?
