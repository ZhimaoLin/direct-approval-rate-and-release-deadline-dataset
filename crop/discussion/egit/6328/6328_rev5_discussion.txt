DESCRIPTION

Move staging/unstaging into a background job.

Since a few commits ago, this sped up drastically, so i don't know
whether there is interest in this change anymore.

Move the staging/unstaging into a job so that the UI does not freeze
while waiting for the index to be calculated/written.

Line:1095, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Why is the method called asyncUnlockUI? In the end it works synchronously (Display.syncExec is called). Just call it unlockUI.

Line:1138, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Joining a Job from UI thread might be a problem (blocks UI thread). Since user has no chance to trigger a second stage/unstage job while the first is running (tables disabled) it should be ok.

Line:1264, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Use asyncExec here to display the error text. There is no need for syncExec and syncExec might cause problems because the calling thread has to wait until the UI thread is free.
