DESCRIPTION

Move staging/unstaging into a background job.

Since a few commits ago, this sped up drastically, so i don't know
whether there is interest in this change anymore.

Move the staging/unstaging into a job so that the UI does not freeze
while waiting for the index to be calculated/written.
