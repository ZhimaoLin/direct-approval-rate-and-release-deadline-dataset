DESCRIPTION

Move staging/unstaging into a background thread.

On large repositories using the staging view seems to freeze the UI
thread. This is "new", as previously one could start writing commit
messages while waiting for the staging to complete.

To restore the old behavior, the staging/unstaging is moved to a
background thread, disabling tables in the meantime to prevent the user
from triggering again before the first operation has finished.

Line:1019, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> it seems this should be the javadoc for synUnlockUI and vice versa

typo: s/staged and unstage/staged and unstaged/

I don't understand why you use the prefix "sync", I thought it's "async" ?? More occurrences below

Line:1063, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> This should be done in a Job, not in a Thread.

That way the user can see it is running, cancel it, etc.

Line:1063, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> is this really necessary here? the longest that i saw is ~20 seconds on our (really big an clunky) repo. And how should cancellation of the job be handled then? would it stop staging in the middle? 

i think (without proof) that the add.call and rm.call are the thinks that take a while (i saw updateSmudgedEntries in that area somewhere running a while - it checks the whole index, right? much for 33800 files). i think i cannot really cancel those? or can i?

you see - some confusion ;)

Line:1037, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Should the commit button also be disabled?

Line:1063, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> The ability to cancel a job can de disabled, right? Showing that an action is in progress (even if it doesn't have a progress bar) is useful to the user, so it should be done in a job.
