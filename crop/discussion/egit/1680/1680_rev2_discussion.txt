DESCRIPTION

Import Projects Wizard: select added Repository

After adding one or several Repositories, the added Repository should
be selected in the RepoSelection page so that the user can hit "Next"
immediately instead of seeing an error message.
If more than one Repository is added, the last one is selected.
