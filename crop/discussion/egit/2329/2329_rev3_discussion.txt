DESCRIPTION

Add a "Compare with -> Commit..." action

When the user selects this, a dialog is shown to select a commit to
compare the resource with. Depending on whether the resource is a file
or a container, either the Git Tree Compare View or a Compare Editor
is opened for the selected commit.

Patch Set 3:

As for remark 1., I see this as a valid requirement, but we can add this later, I think. Then we would probably want all the other nice features, like search, toggle between "Show All" and "Normal" history and so on.
As for remark 2., I have rebased this on the other change which fixes this.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Build Successful; IP review completed

OK, explanation for first remark is reasonable for me;)

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

toggle buttons in compare view do not work as I would expect, e.g. when "Show added files only" is clicked I still also see modified files, same for "Show deleted files only". It also sounds strange that both can be clicked simultaneously, I think semantics of these toggles is unclear (at least I don't understand them)

Again it would be nice if multi-selection of multiple projects in the same repo would be possible
