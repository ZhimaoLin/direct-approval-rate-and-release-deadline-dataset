DESCRIPTION

Add a "Compare with -> Commit..." action

When the user selects this, a dialog is shown to select a commit to
compare the resource with. Depending on whether the resource is a file
or a container, either the Git Tree Compare View or a Compare Editor
is opened for the selected commit.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

1. List of commit in dialog should be reduced only to commits that affects selected file
2. It seams that ignored folders (I always see bin folder in comparison) are included in "Git Tree Compare"
