DESCRIPTION

Fix unstable DecoratableResourceAdapterTest

It failed in https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/egit.gerrit/4256/
because it was using the workspace root as a repository, which can be
pretty unstable due to config files being added/removed.

Convert to a LocalRepositoryTestCase to fix this.
