Patch Set 2: IP review completed

I'm not sure about the following points (Eclipse UI standards):

1. Is a toggle button a common pattern or should there be a select all and an unselect all button.

2. Is it common to write the selection count (e.g. 1/3) above the list box?

1. I took the toggle button idea from the import repositories wizard.

2. I did that as a space saver, instead of creating another label inside the Group.

I think both toggle button and showing number of selected repos above list box is ok (at least I understand it without needing a manual :-)

But the initial selection count when the search wizard is opened is always zero, in my case I have 9 repos in my workspace and all of
them are selected since the wizard remembers what I used in the
last search but the counter says Repositories (0/9), when I toggle
any of the check boxes it shows the correct number.
