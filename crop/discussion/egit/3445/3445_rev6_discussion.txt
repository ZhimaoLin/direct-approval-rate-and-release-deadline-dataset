Patch Set 6:

this is saving screen real estate, but I feel these buttons don't look like buttons but rather like inactive (since the check mark looks gray-ish) checkboxes so it's not obvious that these are buttons, so I would say either find images which look more like a button (increasing image size to usual button size could help) or add text labels and move the 2 buttons to the right of the "Search all branches" checkbox.

BTW which branches will be searched if "Search all branches" is deselected ?
