DESCRIPTION

Make Synchronize view UI tests stable

There were a few things contributing to the instability:

- The test setup was only done once xxx@xxx.xxx and then "cleaned
  up" by doing a reset twice and waiting. Setup is now done xxx@xxx.xxx
  and a complete cleanup is done xxx@xxx.xxx so that test execution order
  does not affect the outcome.

- Switching between "Git Commits" and "Workspace" models was done by
  clicking on the drop down in the Synchronize view toolbar, which is
  very fragile. The desired model is now enabled via team API once for
  each test class.

With this, 2 tests no longer need to be ignored and all tests succeed
reliably on my machine.
