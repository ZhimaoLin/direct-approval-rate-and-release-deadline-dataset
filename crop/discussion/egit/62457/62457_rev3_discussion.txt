@Max: here's my take on this. Please verify this does what was intended; I'm not a gitflow user myself, so I have missed some things. Also, I didn't check whether tests stillw orked. I concentrated on the basic visibility and enablement of actions, and that looked good in my tests. But I didn't actually create hotfixes, features etc. and go through their life cycle.

The main change is that I made the property tester handle adaptations itself, which then allowed me to simplify the plugin.xml quite a bit. The same mechanism is also used in egit.ui.

Heh :-) Hopefully not. I meant "I _may_ have missed some things".

with this change there are no longer commands shown under "git flow" in the history view when using the context menu on a commit in the history view

Line:199, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/plugin.xml -> trailing whitespace

I don't see any change in that respect. Using Egit 4.1.0 in Eclipse Mars, I get a Git Flow menu, with one sub-entry "Start a release from commit SHA1". Using this change, I get exactly the same. I don't know whether there ever were more entries there; if I look at org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui.internal.menu.DynamicHistoryMenu I doubt it. Max?

However, I noticed that the Team menu got contributed to the context menus in the repository view and in the history view. That's fixed in PS 4.

Line:199, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/plugin.xml -> Done
