DESCRIPTION

Fixed deprecated API usage

Besides fixing the deprecated API call, also moved the sleep in AppOperationTest
to a more reasonable location. For me, the tests failed most of the time as localTime
and the timestamp in the repo were the same. I think it makes more sense to wait
after the commit to have a time gap between commit and file change

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

This is fine given that the API appeared in 3.5
