Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

when the "feature finish" squashes multiple commits a dialog should be opened which allows to combine and edit the commit messages of the commits being squashed. Same like "Squash" action in the interactive rebase view does.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> duplicate "to"

I agree. I looked into that, but it seemed like it's not a small change.
Therefore, wouldn't it make sense to have a separate review for that?
