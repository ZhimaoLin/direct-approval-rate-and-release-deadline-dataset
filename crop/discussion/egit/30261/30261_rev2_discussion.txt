DESCRIPTION

Introduce IndexDiffUpdateJob to schedule resource updates

The IndexDiffCacheEntry currently immediately schedules update jobs on
resource changes. Given a resource related task which affects multiple
resources in 'n' workspace changes (e.g. "clean compile" on n projects),
IndexDiffCacheEntry.scheduleUpdateJob() is called n times on same
repository, creating n jobs (which in worst case creates n threads in
Eclipse), running one after each other and creating n notifications on
completion. This significantly affects Eclipse UI performance on huge
git repositories.

To avoid this, one single (collecting resources) IndexDiffUpdateJob is
created and used per IndexDiffCacheEntry. On each resource change
pending changes are collected by this job, but instead of immediate
scheduling default delay of 400 milliseconds is used to schedule the
job. This reduces both memory consumption and overhead by reducing
notifications count to UI listeners.
