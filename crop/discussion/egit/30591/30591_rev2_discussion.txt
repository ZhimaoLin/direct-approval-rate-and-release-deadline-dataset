DESCRIPTION

Release lock on all paths in scheduleReloadJob()

FindBugs found out that lock is not released on all paths in
inscheduleReloadJob(). Moved the lock outside the first try block to
make sure it is aquired only if no exception happen.

Yep, to make FB happy. In theory there could be code added to the try block after the lock(), which would make this warning real. 
Sorry for second patch set without changes, which seems to be a side effect of pushing another change to Gerrit.

The problem is that your commits have other unrelated commits (that are also in review) as parents. This should not be done for this reason and also so that each change can be independently submitted.

Patch Set 2:

I'd like to submit this change but can't, because it has a parent that I don't want to submit yet, and I can't rebase it because of this: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437166

So, please do this:

* Check out a new local branch based on origin/master
* Cherry-pick the commit for this onto it
* Push it

This way, the commit will be based off master. (Gerrit will still know that it belongs to this change because of the Change-Id.)
