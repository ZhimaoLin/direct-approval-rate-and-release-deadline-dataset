Hi Robin, just one minor comment. But nothing serious from my side.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/common/LocalRepositoryTestCase.java -> The changes to this file seem to be unrelated to the fix. But it's a test case. Thus, I don't worry much. Just need confirmation from your side if that is intentional.

File Comment: org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/common/LocalRepositoryTestCase.java -> touch is used in the new test case to create a new file. Before, it could only change the contents of existing files. As it doesn't break other tests, I think the change should be ok.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

This should be in 3.0.2, retargetted: https://git.eclipse.org/r/15953

The test is a bit more invasive and ideally, I'd like to switch to a newer version of SWTBot which includes SWTBotTreeColumn, so the above only contains the trivial fix.

please rebase and resolve conflicts, is this ready to go or do you want to first move to a newer version of swtbot ?

Patch Set 4:

Yes, I'd like to look into updating to a newer SWTBot, which requires updating to Hamcrest 1.3, which in turn might require using a newer Orbit.

Patch Set 4:

then you have to wait a while since currently there is no recommended orbit build (R-build) which has all the hamcrest 1.3 libs, the orbit builds used in the current swtbot snapshot are outdated I or M-builds which don't exist anymore, -> this currently looks like a mess
