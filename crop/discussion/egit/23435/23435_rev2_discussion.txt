DESCRIPTION

Push Branch: Pre-fill branch name of upstream config if available

In case branch.*.merge is already set, default to that branch name when
starting the wizard.

With that, if the branch is already configured, running the "Push
Branch..." wizard without changing anything should behave the same as
with "Push to Upstream".
