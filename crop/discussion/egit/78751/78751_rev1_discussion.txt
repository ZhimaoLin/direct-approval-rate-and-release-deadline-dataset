Yes, I just added a detailed description/motivation in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=451216

Other projects include the bug ID in the commit message so they're kind of auto linked, but I noticed in the history that EGit doesn't do that.

I see it has a conflict now.  Bad timing.  Should I take action?
