DESCRIPTION

Run Test Suite AllNonSWTTests in Maven Build

The test suite AllNonSWTTests was not part of the build.
To execute AllNonSWTTests a new test suite AllSWTAndNonSWTTests was
created that combines the suites AllLocalTests and AllNonSWTTests.
The Eclipse launch configuration "All-Non-SWT-Tests" was changed to run
outside the UI thread. This was done because the suite AllNonSWTTests
does not require the UI thread and does not run stable in the UI thread.
