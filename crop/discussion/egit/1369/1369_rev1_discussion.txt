DESCRIPTION

Repositories View: wrong buttons when showing Remote Configuration Properties

The Properties page exposed by the Repositories View is reused between
showing the repository configuration and the remote configuration(s) (the latter
is shown when a "Remote" node or one of its children is selected in the view).
Currently, the toolbar is polluted with unwanted buttons when switching from
a repository config to a remote config.
