DESCRIPTION

Speed up building of the sync cache using dircacheiterator

By using the dircache we can usually avoid actually reading the file
most of the time. The most obvious effect is the amout of time it
takes before the git decorations appear. It also affects the
synchronization view.

Patch Set 7:

I see these warnings all the time, ABORT usually happens when Hudson doesn't feel well and needs a restart or maybe it's caused by other jobs running concurrently

Line:151, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/view/synchronize/AbstractSynchronizeViewTest.java -> Of course this "fix" is somewhat ugly. We shouldn't have
