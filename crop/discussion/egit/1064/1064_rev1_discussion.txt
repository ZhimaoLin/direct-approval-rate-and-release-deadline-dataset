DESCRIPTION

Fixes obraining common acestor in Synchornize view

For obtaining common base ancestor I've used suggested RevWalk with
RevFilter.MERGE_BASE. For API compatibility it is also used for
obtaining remote variant.

This patch set adds implementations of git representations of IResource,
IContainer, IFile, IFolder and IProject this allow return proper value
in IResourceVariantTree.members() method.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This change is *almost* ready for review. Currently I see four things to improve/work on:
* GitSyncInfo class
* GitResourceVariantComparator
* handle multiple merge base points in GitBaseResourceVariant
* fix test cases

I'll send mail on jgit dev list with detailed description of first three points. Sending this to gerrit will make discussion easier ;)
