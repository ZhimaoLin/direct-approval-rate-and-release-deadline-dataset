DESCRIPTION

Fixes obtaining common ancestor in Synchronize view

For obtaining common base ancestor I've used suggested RevWalk with
RevFilter.MERGE_BASE. For API compatibility it is also used for
obtaining remote variant.

This patch also improves GitResourceVariant implementation. I replaced
all dependencies to deprecated TreeEntry with proper RevObject
implementation. This have also requires to update test cases.

I like this. Now the implementation is much clearer.
