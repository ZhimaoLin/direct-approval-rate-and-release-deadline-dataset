DESCRIPTION

Fixes obtaining common ancestor in Synchronize view

For obtaining common base ancestor I've used suggested RevWalk with
RevFilter.MERGE_BASE. For API compatibility it is also used for
obtaining remote variant.

This patch set adds implementations of git representations of IResource,
IContainer, IFile, IFolder and IProject this allow return proper value
in IResourceVariantTree.members() method.

Patch Set 3: (2 inline comments)

Once again there are some strange behaviors of tests when they are run as a part of test suite. Currently only two test cases fails in test suite:
* GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest.shouldReturnCommonAncestorAsBase
* GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest.shouldReturnRemoteTree

Rest tests works fine no matter how they are launched.

Line:107, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriberTest.java -> I don't know why this test randomly fails when it is run as part of test suite, but it it is run as single test case it always passes.

Patch Set 3:

Looks much better but didn't have the time to fully review.

- the commit message needs to be reworked since the IResource representations are gone
- this change clearly needs a CQ
