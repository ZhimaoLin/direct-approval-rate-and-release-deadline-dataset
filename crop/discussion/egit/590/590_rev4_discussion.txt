DESCRIPTION

'Repositories' view should use IOpenListener

Using open events to expand/collapse tree nodes or to open the
current selection is very common in the Eclipse workbench. An
IOpenListener has been attached to the 'Repositories' view so
that it will react in the same way as other Eclipse views.
