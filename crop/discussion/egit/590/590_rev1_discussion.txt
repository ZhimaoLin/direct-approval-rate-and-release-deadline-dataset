DESCRIPTION

'Repositories' view should hook into open events to open the
current selection or to expand/collapse the selected tree node.

Using open events to expand/collapse tree nodes is very common
in the Eclipse workbench. An IOpenListener has been attached to
the 'Repositories' view so that it will react in the same way
with other Eclipse views.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Style nit: the commit message header (first line of the commit message) should be shortened so that it fits on a single line. Simply move the explanations to the body of the commit message.
