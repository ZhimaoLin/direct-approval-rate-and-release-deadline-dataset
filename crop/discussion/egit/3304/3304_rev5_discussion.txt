DESCRIPTION

Speed up confirm delete branch dialog displayed for unmerged branches

The performance issue appears when you have a log of unmerged
branches, i.e for example if you have remote tracking branches for a 
Gerrit repo or other automated branches.

Also updates the progress monitor and adds a toString to the
RepositoryTreeNode for convenience when debugging..
