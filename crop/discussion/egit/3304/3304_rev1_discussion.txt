DESCRIPTION

Speed up confirm delete branch dialog displayed for unmerged branches

The performance issue appears when you have a log of unmerged branchs,
i.e for example if you have remote tracking branches for a Gerrit
repo or other automated branches.

Also updates the progress monitor and adds a toString to the
RepositoryTreeNode for convenience when debugging..
