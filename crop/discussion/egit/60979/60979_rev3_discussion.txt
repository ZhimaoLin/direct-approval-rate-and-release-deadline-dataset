Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/ResourcePropertyTester.java -> That won't work. The core framework only checks the type hierarchy but not for adaptations. Since this tester is registered only for IResource, it will never be called for other contributed elements in a navigator (for instance, the package explorer). Hence adapting here doesn't help.

The new properties must go elsewhere; probably into the SelectionPropertyTester.

I've also tested for "plain" project and so missed the JDT specific behavior. My bad.

This reminds me the change I've committed to AnyEdit where I had to change actions to commands and also enable visibility computation, see https://github.com/iloveeclipse/anyedittools/commit/ce7b2ab10f1ea4c4ad6146ed85a82d9f47052e63

We have to inspect selection and check there for IResource or IFile adapters (or File like AnyEdit :-)).
