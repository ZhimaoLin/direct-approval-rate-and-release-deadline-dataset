DESCRIPTION

New tests for merging through Team (GitSubscriberMergeContext).

IMergeContext offers API for clients to merge files or models through
pure Team APIs, without resorting to repository provider dependencies.
This adds tests for these actions and fixes some issues (NPEs) because
of EGit UI not checking whether the workbench is initialized before
using it.
