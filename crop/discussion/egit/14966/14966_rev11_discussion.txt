DESCRIPTION

New tests for merging through Team (GitSubscriberMergeContext).

IMergeContext offers API for clients to merge files or models through
pure Team APIs, without resorting to repository provider dependencies.
This adds tests for these actions and fixes some issues (NPEs) because
of EGit UI not checking whether the workbench is initialized before
using it.

See inline comment, otherwise LGTM.

Line:368, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> Isn't this what the line below already does? If so, you can remove the first param of this function.

Line:368, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> It is. This patch is the first in a line of 6 inter-dependent changes though... would it be okay with you if I made this change (change the method signature and all callers as a result) in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/30190/ instead (two changes down the dependency line, where I extract this method into a superclass for my tests)?

I can do the modification here, but it'll mean re-pushing a new patch set for a few of its dependencies too (along with the noise in notifications). If that's okay with you, then I'l do it right away in this review.

Line:368, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> Don't worry about the additional notifications. The commit message of this change also needs to be updated (and it seems later ones too).

Line:368, org.eclipse.egit.core.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSubscriberMergeContextTest.java -> Indeed, I had left the commit message intact even after extracting the "NPE fixing" from patch set 6 out of this review.

I'll push an updated version of this change in a few moments.
