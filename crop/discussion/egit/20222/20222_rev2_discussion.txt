> maybe we can mirror diffy so that its pecker is over the repository icon or use a slightly darker yellow

Diffy's left profile is much better then the right one, so I went with making the pecker a bit darker ;)

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

The repo icon looks ok. I can't test the menu icons as Linux GTK does not show them.

By the way, can you add a reference to bug 423138 in the commit message?
