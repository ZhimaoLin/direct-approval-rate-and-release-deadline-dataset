DESCRIPTION

Mark all .git dir's as ignored

The Team Ignore extension point checks given ignore pattern against file
name or whole workspace relative path. Sometimes we need to ignore files
like .git/index that won't match using old pattern. In such cases a new
pattern needs to be added to match files inside .git folder.

The Team Ignore extension point will expand resource path into workspace
relative path when it finds '/' character in pattern. Such expanded path
will contain project name, therefore we need to add '*/.git/*' pattern
into ignored ones.
