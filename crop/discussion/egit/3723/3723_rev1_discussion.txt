DESCRIPTION

Mark all .git dir's as ignored

The Team Ignore extension point check given ignore pattern against file
name or whole workspace relative path. Sometimes we need to ignore files
like .git/index that won't math using old patter. In such cases new
patter needs to be added to match files inside .git folder.

The Team Ignore extension point will expand resource path into workspace
relative path when it finds '/' character in pattern. Such expanded path
will contain project name, therefore we need to add '*/.git/*' pattern
into ignored ones.

couldn't reproduce the problem reported in bug 334369 without  this change, so I am not yet convinced that this is needed

Patch Set 1:

To reproduce this issue, launch synchronization and keep this view open after it finish. Then in package explorer add file to index. This should result adding .git folder into sync-view
