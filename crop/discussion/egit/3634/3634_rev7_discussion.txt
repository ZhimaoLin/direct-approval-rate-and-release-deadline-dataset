Line:30, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CleanOperation.java -> here you should use org.eclipse.egit.core.Activator here ;)

Line:71, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CleanOperation.java -> this is already checked in CleanActionHandler (actually org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.actions.RepositoryActionHandler.getSelectedResources(ExecutionEvent) will never return null)

Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CleanOperation.java -> this is also already checked in CleanActionHandler.

Line:79, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CleanOperation.java -> Here is what I was thinking about:

Repository repo = getRepository(res);
if (repo == null)
    continue;
RepoTree = new Git(repo);
...

same in line 84

Line:26, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I'm guessing that you add this import to use org.eclipse.egit.ui.Activator in core fragment. In org.eclipse.egit.core we have also specialized Activator, in egit.ui we use ui.Activator and in egit.core we use core.Activator ;)

Line:87, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CleanActionHandler.java -> not really yet, but we are closer ... I would prefer that we reuse org.eclipse.egit.ui.Activator.logError(String, Throwable) static method. Or if you want to log it as a info I would suggest to add org.eclipse.egit.ui.Activator.logInfo(String, Throwable) method

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CleanOperation.java -> chris moved to another company, so I suspect you need a different mail address here.

Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CleanOperation.java -> why does this need to be static ?

Line:26, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> egit core should not depend on egit ui

Line:2, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CleanActionHandler.java -> I think Chris moved to another company, check with him which copyright notice to use.

Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CleanActionHandler.java -> why is this member public ?

Line:100, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CleanActionHandler.java -> Why is this commented out ? We don't like dead code ending up in the repository.
