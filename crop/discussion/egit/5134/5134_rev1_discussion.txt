Argh, you're absolutely right. This is blocked by bug 365425.

I guess so, but the forementioned bug is still open.

Patch Set 1:

The Javadoc of InstanceScope.INSTANCE and DefaultScope.INSTANCE xxx@xxx.xxx 3.4 (Ganymede). The bug mentions dropping support for 3.5 (Galileo). IMO we should proceed with this change, as 3.4 is definitely too old to support.

Comment on the change itself: Please get rid of the unrelated whitespace changes.

There are no whitespace changes in the patch, I guess you're referring to removed curly brackets for single liners. This was done by a save action for each file I touched.

Patch Set 1:

Yes, I meant the curly braces. We reverted the save action some time ago as it was too eager. Please remove these changes (I'm sorry for the inconvenience).
