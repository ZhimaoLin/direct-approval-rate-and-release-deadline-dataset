DESCRIPTION

Fix instability in MergeToolTest

It recently failed here:
https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/egit.gerrit/4746/

The problem was that the "ancestor" text editor was sometimes shown and
returned as the first text editor, where the code expected to get the
"left" editor.

As the sync view tests also use the compare editor, abstract this in a
new CompareEditorTester which handles this.
