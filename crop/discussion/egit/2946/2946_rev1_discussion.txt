DESCRIPTION

Prevent flickering in history view

When the history view is showing an error message, the user can
produce flickering by constantly clicking on the refresh button.
This was caused by the fact that setErrorMessage was called twice
internally. By simply moving one of the statements to another place,
this flickering is avoided.
