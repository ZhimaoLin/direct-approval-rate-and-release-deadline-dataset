Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Can we refactor out this add to .gitignore logic into an operation that would be available in org.eclipse.egit.core? Right now I'm not too comfortable with the coupling of the actual operation and action.

Patch Set 1: No score

It would also be easier to test if refactored into a new clean operation :)
