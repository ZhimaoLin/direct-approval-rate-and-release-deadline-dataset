DESCRIPTION

Changed the project import page checkboxtable into a filtered tree.

With large repositories it is difficult to get a subset of projects because the
import projects tree could not be filtered. Now the import projects uses a
filtered tree which is commonly used inside Eclipse.

- The tree can be filtered with *text like syntax.
- If a project is selected it always stays in the view even if it does not match
  the filter.
- If projects are deselected with the "deselect all" button they can be removed
  from the view if it does not match the filter string. This is done by calling
  setinput again. This is not done for individual deselections because that did
  not look right and I am not sure about the setinput overhead on really large
  repositories

I have tested this with the following repositories:
git://github.com/smilebase/org.eclipse.mylyn.github.git
git://github.com/aptana/studio.git
git://ecf1.osuosl.org/home/gitcvs
and the egit and jgit repositories

It was noticed that some of the aptana and ecf projects (notably the feature
projects) were not attached to teaming after import. This is probably not caused
by this change.

I like this change.

The mentioned problem (projects not shared after import) is fixed with commit 667f571b266f7c0dab952733c22bb5f029754f44 (Fix enabling team operations on project import).

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I like the idea of this change, but there's been some changes in the commenting structure which are unnecessary.

Line:237, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> Is it worth noting that this is something used from GWT Designer? Does it make sense to keep this in the main repository?

Line:346, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> Why did we remove the (non-JavaDoc) comment here? The purpose of including it is to note that the method comes from elsewhere, but without overriding the JavaDoc comment. It may get generated again later.

Line:363, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/GitProjectsImportPage.java -> There's no dice to begin with; why do we need to comment this fact?

Useful extension. Perhaps as default all projects should be deselected. With all projects selected in advance you wonder why the filter has no effect.
