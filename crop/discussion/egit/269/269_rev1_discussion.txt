Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I tried this and found some problem with the filtering:
- clone http://egit.eclipse.org/jgit.git
- on import project page of import wizard type *.jgit.http into the filter field
- this filters the project list to only display the two http projects
- press select all, this marks the 2 http projects for import
- now delete the text in the filter field
- this changes the projects marked for import from the 2 http projects to the first 2 projects on the list (org.eclipse.jgit and org.eclipse.jgit.console)
- I think instead the two http projects should stay selected
