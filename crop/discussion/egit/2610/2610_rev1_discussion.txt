Line:703, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> This is different from the initialization of createChangeId, but I like it more because here it is clearer what the default is.

We should change the initialization of createChangeId later on in order to improve consistency.
