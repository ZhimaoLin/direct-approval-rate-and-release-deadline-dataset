DESCRIPTION

Added context actions 'Assume Unchanged' and 'Untrack'

Modified unstaged changes can be marked as 'Assume Unchanged' or
untracked using a context menu action.

AssumeUnchangedOperation and UntrackOperation are extended by a
constructor that takes a path list. Reason is that it cannot be assumed
that in the StagingView the StagingEntry's are workspace resources. In
this case the selection is a collection of paths of the current selected
repository.

Compact Tree representation and filtered views are also considered.

Bug: 381158

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

Thanks a lot, Karsten! Works well now with Untrack.

I must admit that I don't quite understand how Assume Unchanged/No Assume Unchanged are supposed to work; I have never used those. I notice that Assume Unchanged does correctly remove a changed file from the unstaged view, but when I then do a "No Assume Unchanged" on that file in the package explorer, it doesn't re-appear as modified in the staging view. It needs a null edit to re-appear... That, however, is unrelated to this change here.

I consider adding an undo mechanism, at least for the last command, as beyond the scope of this change. So from my point of view, this change is good enough.

Right, this seems to be a bug that should be handled separately.

The assume unchanged flag tells git to ignore the status of the flagged file so (j)git assumes it's unchanged.

I tried this on a file which is in the workspace (in an imported open project) and it works for me, "assume unchanged" removes a modified file from staging view and "no assume unchanged" brings it back.
