DESCRIPTION

Added context actions 'Assume Unchanged' and 'Untrack'

Modified unstaged changes can be marked as 'Assume Unchanged' or
untracked using a context menu action.

AssumeUnchangedOperation and UntrackOperation are extended by a
constructor that takes a path list. Reason is that it cannot be assumed
that in the StagingView the StagingEntry's are workspace resources. In
this case the selection is a collection of paths of the current selected
repository.

Compact Tree representation and filtered views are also considered.
