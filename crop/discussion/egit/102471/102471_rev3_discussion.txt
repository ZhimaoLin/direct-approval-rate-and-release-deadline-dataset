DESCRIPTION

Added context actions 'Assume Unchanged' and 'Untrack'

Modified unstaged changes can be marked as 'Assume Unchanged' or
untracked using a context menu action.

AssumeUnchangedOperation and UntrackOperation are extended by a
constructor that takes a path list. Reason is that it cannot be assumed
that in the StagingView the StagingEntry's are workspace resources. In
this case the selection is a collection of paths of the current selected
repository.

For the staging view, how about a more ambitious approach: use an undo stack and the standard undo/redo operations? Would that be feasible? Or too expensive because we'd have to remember the list of files operated on? (If so, perhaps limit the undo stack to depth 1?)

When (Compact) Tree View is enabled, the actions are also available on folders and then apply to everything underneath that folder (recursively!). I made a dummy change in EGit UI Activator to have it show up in unstaged, then chose "Untrack" on the folder, and ended up with all files of the EGit UI bundle being removed from the index.

This should behave more like the stage/unstage actions, which apply to all StagingEntry items below a folder. Also note that stage/unstage maintain the selection and expansion state of the tree. If untrack did that, the index deletions would be selected in the staged area, and thus the operation could be quickly undone by unstaging the staged index deletions.

Selecting a folder in compact mode will now collect the StagingEntry below to compute single paths. Thus not the whole folder will be untracked/assumed unchanged.

Thanks Thomas for the careful review, detailed explanations and patience. I considered the filters now also as decribed.
