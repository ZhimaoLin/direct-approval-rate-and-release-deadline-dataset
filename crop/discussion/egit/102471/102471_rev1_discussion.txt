Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Good idea, but this doesn't work yet on files not in the workspace. Other operations in the staging view do. Looks like UntrackOperation and AssumeUnchangedOperation would need to be improved to also be able to work on a collection of IPath.

Line:2809, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> We use curly braces even for single-statement ifs.

Line:2823, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Strange indentation.

Line:2809, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Several other places don't do it here. This got into here by copy/paste another action' section.

Line:2823, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> was done by save action

Good point, this was not considered.

Patch Set 1:

Looks like we'll need a way to quickly find files marked assumed unchanged so users can revert the action of marking a file assumed unchanged easily. With git command line this can be done using

 $ git ls-files -v | grep '^h'

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2809, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Egit rules have changes. Originally they even said _not_ to use curly braces in such cases. At some point it was switched, but no global clean-up was done. Instead we fix it as we go in code that we change anyway. New code, even if copy-pasted, should follow the current rules.

I know it can be confusing. :-)
