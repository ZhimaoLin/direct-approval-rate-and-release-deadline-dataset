DESCRIPTION

Refresh decorations after re-connecting a project

Re-connecting a previously connected, then disconnected project did not
refresh the decorations in the project explorer.

RepositoryChangeListener was unused, and likewise
GitProjectData.addRepositoryChangeListener(). Therefore, all calls to
RepositoryMapping.fireRepositoryChanged() had absolutely no effect. Thus
I have removed all these calls and the method.

Interesting bit of EGit history: the very first version (even before
EGit became an Eclipse project) of GitProjectData contained what is now
known as the RepositoryCache (the one in EGit). The
RepositoryChangeListener indeed was notified on changes in a repository.
In that original commit, there was exactly one such listener: in the git
decorator.

Through various refactorings, RepositoryCache was extracted from
GitProjectData, and then IndexDiffChangedListener appeared.
RepositoryChangeListener became unused; GitLightweightDecorator was
changed to listen on index diff changes in commit f332331.

Nowadays, this RepositoryChangeListener is notified not on repository
changes, but whenever a new RepositoryMapping is added to the Eclipse
resource tree. And that is exactly what is needed to fix bug 489696:
when a previously connected, now disconnected project is re-connected,
there will be no resource change events (the project is known in
Eclipse's resource tree already, and adding new RepositoryMappings as
session properties doesn't trigger a resource delta). There also will be
no repository or index diff related events (provided the repository is
still known to EGit, for instance because it is in the Repositories
view, or because there are other projects from that repository.) So the
GitLightweightDecorator will not refresh decorations.

Using a RepositoryChangeListener (again, after 5 years) the
GitLightweightDecorator can correctly refresh the project explorer in
this case.

Since this listener is no longer invoked when a repository changes, but
when a new RepositoryMapping appears, I have renamed and re-purposed the
interface to RepositoryMappingChangeListener.
