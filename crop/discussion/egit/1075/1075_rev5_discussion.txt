DESCRIPTION

Cleanup FilteredTree usages

Replaced the deprecated constructor with the new
one after changing the dependency to eclipse.ui
accordingly.
The FilteredCheckboxTree was fixed (it used to
render the controls twice) and used where possible
(i.e. in the RepositorySearchDialog and in the
GitProjectsImportPage).
Test was adjusted as needed.
