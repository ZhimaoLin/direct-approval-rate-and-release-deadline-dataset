Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

The verb in English is "to cherry-pick" (with the dash). So the label should be "Cherry-pick" (or "Cherry-Pick") I see that we have that wrong in other places, too.

The commit message should be reformatted to conform to the EGit conventions; see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines .

All other properties in uitext.properties don't use blanks around the "=" sign; the new entry should conform.

I'll clean this up shortly.
