DESCRIPTION

Fix some UI Tets

Some UI tests were broken because their
sequence has changed and thus some
user preferences that were changed no
longer have their default values as expected
by some other tests.
Furthermore, the "delay" being set by a static
method in one of the test base classes got
lost due to this change (whether this parameter
is effective depends on the sequence of class loading,
so it is not reliable), and the delay was
removed altogether and some Thread.sleep()
calls or local refresh calls were added where
needed. This resulted in much faster execution.
In order to allow delayed replay, a specific
launch config was checked in.
Finally, one test was broken to to productive code
changes.
