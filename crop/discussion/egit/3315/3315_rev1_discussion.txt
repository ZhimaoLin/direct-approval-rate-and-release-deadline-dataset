DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add preconfigured options into synchronization wizard

Adds new page into synchronization wizard. This page contains two
predefinded configurations for quick launch synchronization of local
working directory or against remote tracking branch. Additionally
'custom' configuration can be selected where user can specify source
and destination branch and also does local changes should be included
in synchronization.

When at least one 'custom' option was selected user must go to the
second wizard page (the 'finish' button is disabled). In other cases
'next' button is disabled and user can quickly launch synchronization.

I don't get how to use this wizard, could you describe that ?
Why two different ways to start synchronize (comparing this wizard to the dialog you get from Team > Sychronize) ?

Change needs to be rebase since we switched to 1.0 so this doesn't compile against jgit's HEAD anymore
