DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Add preconfigured options into synchronization wizard

Adds new page into synchronization wizard. This page contains two
predefinded configurations for quick launch synchronization of local
working directory or against remote tracking branch. Additionally
'custom' configuration can be selected where user can specify source
and destination branch and also does local changes should be included
in synchronization.

When at least one 'custom' option was selected user must go to the
second wizard page (the 'finish' button is disabled). In other cases
'next' button is disabled and user can quickly launch synchronization.

Patch Set 2:

* Rebased
* Fixed typo

You can start this wizard by clicking on most left hand side icon in 'Synchronize view' tab or by pressing ctrl + 3 and typing 'synchronize...'. In first step select 'Git' and click on 'Next'. On second page select checkbox near repository name that you want to launch synchronization, after that choose one from three possible cofiguration:

* workspace - this is equivalent to comparing against current HEAD with included local changes
* remote tracking - this option is enabled when current branch tracks another branch, and this is equivalent to comparing working directory against eg. origin/master with included local changes
* other - in case when none from previous configuration feats your needs you can create your own configuration on next wizard page

First two options enables 'Finish' button. If there is at least one 'custom' configuration selected the 'Next' button will be activated ('Finish' should be disabled). In next wizard step you could configure source and destination branch as it was before.

Synchronize wizard seams to be a regular feature of Eclipse Team Framework. And also it seams to be used by some people. I think that we should also add similar predefined actions into 'Team' context menu (see change Ibe79e8b50571c0e56be507ace842fcf4db387408)

(5 inline comments)

Even with your description it's hard to understand how to use this wizard. It's not intuitive currently.

I think we should come up with a better approach to start synchronize, we now have two implementations, a dialog and this wizard, I think both look ugly and are hard to understand. 

I propose we go back one step and first find a UI design which is understandable and usable from both places (team menu and synchronize view). I think we should do this discussion in an enhancement bug. Let's first gather the requirements what should be selectable and how the user interaction should look like. To make this more tangible you could create some simple mockups. For that you may either use your favorite drawing tool (I use Gimp) or ask for a free license of WireFrameSketcher, they give free licenses for use in Open Source projects. The latter one can even generate an editable mockup from an existing Eclipse UI. I will also try to come up with a mockup so we have something to play with and compare the different proposals.

We could also ask Kevin for comments, I saw some nice ui designs in some of his recent contributions.

Any thoughts on this ?
