DESCRIPTION

Append "..." to delete command's menu label

The delete branch command raises a confirmation dialog listing the
branches to be deleted. Hence the command's menu label should end with
"..." to make clear that the command will open a dialog.

Line:359, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> So this is for Team->Advanced->Delete Branch in the project explorer?

Seems to me that DeleteBranchCommand.name and RenameBranchCommand.name have no effect whatsoever. They are used as default command names, overriden in plugin.xml by explicit label directives on the menu commands that then use DeleteBranchMenu.label and RenameBranchMenu.label.

The only place the default would perhaps be used might have been the legacy DeleteBranchAction and RenameBranchAction, but those appear to be unused?

The repository view uses a different command ID (org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete), a different label (RepoViewDeleteBranch.label), and a different handler (org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.repository.tree.command.DeleteBranchCommand) and should not have the "..." anyway since it doesn't always ask for confirmation.

Line:1514, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> And this is for Delete Branch in the context menu of the history view.

DeleteBranchOnCommitHandler will ask for confirmation only if there are several branches on the commit, or if the commit is unmerged. To me "..." is an indication that I can click the item safely, and that I will get a chance to back out no matter what. That's not the case here.
