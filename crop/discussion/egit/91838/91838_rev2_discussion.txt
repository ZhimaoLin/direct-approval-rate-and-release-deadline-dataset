DESCRIPTION

Sort branches by name for content assist

I recently noticed that auto completion for branch names (e.g. in the
push branch wizard) lists them in a non recognizable order. This changes
the content assist list to be sorted by name, similarly like branches
are already sorted by name in tree views.

I have not run UI tests for this change, since local egit tests
generally tend to be red, even on origin/master.
