DESCRIPTION

Fix path prefix computation in RepositoriesViewCommandHandler

Commands would be disabled on a top-level .gitignore (or other file
named .git*) because of naive string prefix calculation, which would
conclude that .git was a prefix of .gitignore and thus the .gitignore
was inside the .git directory.

Fixed by using java.nio.Path.startsWith instead of String.startsWith.
