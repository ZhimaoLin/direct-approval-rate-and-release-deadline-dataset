Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

I like the idea ...

I think we should go one step further:
- also move "Configure preferences" to the toolbar
- make "Show untracked files" a toggle button in the toolbar

I feel the icon for sign-off should contain something like a check mark. The icon for amending is hard to understand, the blueish blur is disturbing.

Maybe we could in addition add a menu in the style of a view menu (don't know if that fits to Eclipse UI standards). For beginners a menu is easier to understand. And the little triangle for opening the menu wouldn't clutter the UI so it wouldn't disturb experienced users.

Line:166, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> i18n: shouldn't that be translatable (think about Chinese) ?

Line:123, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> i18n: text should be externalized

Line:127, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> i18n: text should be externalized

This text looks good, but at runtime I see a different tooltip text on the gerrit button: "Inserts the final id when you press Commit" -> that's hard to understand

Patch Set 2:

Good idea!
In the beginning I was a bit confused that I have to look for options at two places. So it would be better to also put "Show untracked files" and "Configure Preferences" in the toolbar. It would also be nice if there would be preferences for adding signed of and gerrit change id automatically.
