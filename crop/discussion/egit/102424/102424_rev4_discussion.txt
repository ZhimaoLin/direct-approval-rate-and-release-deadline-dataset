DESCRIPTION

Clean-up: resolve duplicate code in RebaseInteractiveCurrentHandler

A Hudson build for https://git.eclipse.org/r/102415 reported a fixed
duplicate code finding. On closer inspection, that report was bogus:
the analysis considered the duplication fixed because a change made
in one class resulted in two smaller duplicate blocks below the
reporting threshold.

In reality, the same change should have been made in the other class,
too... instead resolve the code duplication properly.
