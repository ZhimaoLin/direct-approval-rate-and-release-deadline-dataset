DESCRIPTION

GitSyncObjectCache erroneously changes the sync state of resources

When using the mapping context to determine the synchronization state
of individual resources, the GitSyncObjectCache changes all other
resources' state to "in-sync"... and never looks back. This causes
very weird issues when using Team APIs, and a totally unspecified
behavior such as a resource going from "MODIFIED" to "IN-SYNC" for no
obvious reason.

I've fixed the coverage (see my inline reply in the patchset 4). 

Still, the discussed behavior still occurs. 

Thank you for your help with this!

Line:194, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncObjectCache.java -> When DiffEntry.getPath returns the full path, we don't need the parentPath at all -> removed in next patch set.

Line:165, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java -> I think this would have lead to NPEs. Replaced by fully replacing the cache in the next patch set.

Line:204, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java -> This was incorrect, it mixed repo-relative paths of different repositories together. Fixed in newest patch set.
