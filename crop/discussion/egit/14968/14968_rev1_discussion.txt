DESCRIPTION

GitSyncObjectCache erroneously changes the sync state of resources

When using the mapping context to determine the synchronization state
of individual resources, the GitSyncObjectCache changes all other
resources' state to "in-sync"... and never looks back. This causes
very weird issues when using Team APIs, and a totally unspecified
behavior such as a resource going from "MODIFIED" to "IN-SYNC" for no
obvious reason.
