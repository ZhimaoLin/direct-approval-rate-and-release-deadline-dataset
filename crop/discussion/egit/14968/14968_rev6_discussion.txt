DESCRIPTION

GitSyncObjectCache erroneously changes the sync state of resources

When using the mapping context to determine the synchronization state
of individual resources, the GitSyncObjectCache changes all other
resources' state to "in-sync"... and never looks back. This causes
very weird issues when using Team APIs, and a totally unspecified
behavior such as a resource going from "MODIFIED" to "IN-SYNC" for no
obvious reason.

Mikael, see inline comment, I think I found the cause for the strange behaviour of hasRemoteChange. Please also review the hasRemoteChanges test case, is it now as you would expect?

If yes, I think we should submit it for 3.0.

Line:203, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncObjectCache.java -> Before, it only replaced the changeType, but hasLocalChange and hasRemoteChange were looking at the direction. I think this lead to the strange results in hasRemoteChange.

Robin, 

Thank you for your help. Everything is fine regarding the tests. It would be great if it could be submitted to 3.0!
