DESCRIPTION

Galileo-based target platform definition for SWTBot-based unit tests

'SWTBot for Eclipse Testing' feature should be installed in order to run
SWTBot-based unit tests. SWTBot's download page provides a set of update
sites for different Eclipse releases. We use an update site for
Galileo [2] as EGit 0.7.1 was targeted for Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo).

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't understand all of this. Does the existence
of this one help with installation of SWTBot?

Can you make this Eclipse 3.4 based and do we need to
specifiy and exact SWTBot version? SWTBot is updated frequenctly.
