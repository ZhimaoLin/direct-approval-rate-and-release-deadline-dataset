DESCRIPTION

[RFC] Use IStorageMerger to perform certain merges

In order to support other file formats that need to be merged in a
special way, we should introduce a new content merger that uses the team
framework (especially IStorageMerger and IStreamMerger) to merge the
contents of files.

Depends on I7817e212
