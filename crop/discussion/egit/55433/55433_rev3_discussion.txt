DESCRIPTION

[Importer] More direct re-use of EasymportWizard

This changes reuses the EasymportWizard and its operations
instead of re-using finer-grained operations and classes that
may change in the future.
With this change, all changes in the EasymportWizard will be
cascaded to EasymportGitWizard without any integration, reducing
maintenance effort and ensuring a better consistency.
