DESCRIPTION

[Importer] More direct re-use of EasymportWizard

This changes reuses the EasymportWizard and its operations
instead of re-using finer-grained operations and classes that
may change in the future.
With this change, all changes in the EasymportWizard will be
cascaded to EasymportGitWizard without any integration, reducing
maintenance effort and ensuring a better consistency.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Auto-detecting projects doesn't work with jgit or egit repository, the import wizard only creates the parent project and doesn't find any of the projects contained in the repository, same problem with the change you pushed to master. Did the import wizard itself break ?

Patch Set 1:

Most likely an issue in upstream Smart Import mechanism. Can you please share which project(s) you used for testing and your expectation for each one of them? Also, were those projects imported as expected with previous Easymport version?

Patch Set 1:

yeah I think it worked yesterday or the day before

I tried to import jgit (https://git.eclipse.org/r/jgit/jgit) and import all the projects it contains, same for egit (https://git.eclipse.org/r/egit/egit). Both repositories contain at least a dozen projects but the import wizard doesn't find any and only creates a parent project in the root of the repository

Patch Set 1:

I tried vaious combinations and all worked for me.
Can you please share the versions of the org.eclipse.e4.ui plugin you're using? Can you try with the latest version?
If you think it's worth it, we can discuss that more synchronously on #eclipse-dev IRC channel.
