Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

- enter URL "https://git.eclipse.org/r/jgit/jgit.git
- enter credentials for this server and check "Store in Secure Store"
- select scheme "file" -> URL becomes "file:///r/jgit/jgit.git
- why is the host removed ? file URLs can have a host part [1]
- the checkbox "Store in Secure Store" isn't unchecked, I think it should be unchecked in this case since it's meaningless since the protocol doesn't support authentication
- switch back to scheme "https" -> URL becomes "https:///r/jgit/jgit"
- so if I selected the wrong scheme by mistake I have to type the host again

Patch Set 2:

I agree on the suggestion for the checkbox.
There seems to be an already existing problem that host parts are not supported in file URLs. That should be handled in a separate issue, because it requires more changes.

I think it is acceptable that the host is purged when changing the scheme.
This behavior is better IMO than not being able to delete the disabled host and being required to switch back the scheme.
