DESCRIPTION

Save preference stores in preference pages

On preference pages that use more than one preference store, these
extra stores must be saved explicitly in performOk(). The framework
(PreferenceDialog) only saves the store set on the page itself, but
not necessarily other stores set on individual field editors.
