DESCRIPTION

Blame annotations: Show start commit when opening editor

Before, the commit that was shown was the blamed commit from the cursor
position, which could be confusing to the user.

To solve this, two things needed to be changed:

The first time a selection changed event happens for the revision
selection provider, we ignore it as it is for the "initial" selection.
The confusing thing about this is that the user has not yet consciously
selected a revision. To fix this, we now always ignore the very first
selection.

When opening an editor with annotation for a start commit (e.g. for the
show annotations link in a hover), we now show this commit in the
history view.
