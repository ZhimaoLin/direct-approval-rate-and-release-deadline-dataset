Patch Set 1: Do not submit; No score

Please don't upload unnecessary merge commits.  It pollutes the history and makes things harder to follow.  We prefer to rebase changes onto the current branch, rather than merge with master, when updating our local working repositories.

In general I only like merges when moving from say the stable branch to master, where we can't rebase because the history is part of a released service revision.
