DESCRIPTION

CommitDialog: improve sorting of file list

This initially sorts the file list by status, project name, and
project relative path.
When clicking on either the status or file column header, the list is
re-sorted according to the clicked column ascending (in case of the
file column by project and project relative path).
The second click on the same column header re-sorts according to the
clicked column descending. The third click on the same column reverts
the original sorting (by status, project and path).

Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)



Line:919, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> I think we should sort outside the loop since then we only have to do it once

Line:1091, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> ordering could be improved to show most interesting states on top

Line:1113, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitDialog.java -> typo: wrong resource key
