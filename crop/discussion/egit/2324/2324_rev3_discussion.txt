DESCRIPTION

CommitDialog: improve sorting of file list

This initially sorts the file list by status, project name, and
project relative path. When clicking on either the status or file
column header, the list is re-sorted according to the clicked column
ascending (in case of the file column by project and project relative
path). The second click on the same column header re-sorts according
to the clicked column descending. The third click on the same column
reverts the original sorting (by status, project and path).
