Patch Set 2:

This is not nice. At first I thought it was a maven bug since I had an old maven 3.0.3 on my Mac. But the error persisted even after upgrading to 3.3.9...

The real culprit is:
1. The default property for <target-platform> is "egit-4.3" (Kepler)
2. This get overridden by the <activeByDefault> in the "platform-mars" profile.

So normally a mvn clean install will always build against the egit-4.5 (Mars) target platform.

With this change, however, we always activate another profile in the same pom: either macosx, or other-os. Hence <activeByDefault> has no effect anymore, and we build against the Kepler target platform (given by the default value of <target-platform>).

To validate this, I tried the following on current master (i.e., without this change):

  mvn -P platform-kepler clean install

And indeed I get exactly the same failure.

The Hudson build (8013) succeeded because it activates profiles explicitly. It does

  mvn clean install -P platform-mars,static-checks,other-os,eclipse-sign

So, the first thing to take away here is that we cannot build org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer against Kepler. That is *not* a problem of this change.

The second bug here is that this platform selection business is broken. Instead of <activateByDefault> I now just set the default value for the <target-platform> property to egit-4.5. I also wonder about the wisdom of using profiles for the platform selection at all. I find this a *very* roundabout way of doing things. Instead of

  mvn -P platform-kepler clean install
  
one can just as well select the target platform via

  mvn -Dplatform-version-name=kepler clean install

or via

  mvn -Dtarget-platform=egit-4.3 clean install

All three select Kepler and fail.

So, why not remove those platform profiles completely and use a simple property instead? All we'd lose is the automatic translation from names like "kepler" or "platform-kepler" to "egit-4.3".

What I still don't understand is why maven falls back to osgi.os=linux when building against Kepler.
