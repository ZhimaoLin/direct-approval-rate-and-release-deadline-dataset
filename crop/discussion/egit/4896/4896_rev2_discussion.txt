DESCRIPTION

Cache refs for the purpose of calculating branches in CommitMessageViewer

By only asking for refs when we change repo or if a refs change is
detected, we can shave another 1/10th of seconds for the time needed
to update the Branches line in the CommitMessageViewer.

Line:313, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitMessageViewer.java -> you should either log this or rethrow an exception (if we can't get branches we should maybe let the user know about this)
