DESCRIPTION

Use remote name as default value when synchronizing

Instead of using "origin" as remote name, we should determinate it
depending on the repository and only fall back to origin in case it's not
clear.

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> the method name is scrambled

s/setDefautlValue/setDefaultValue/

Line:149, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> wouldn't it be better to also return the first entry instead of empty string in case there are multiple entries but none named "origin" ?

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> But it had been scrambled already before. I would say that that should be fixed in another commit.

Line:149, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> I also thought about this but I think that no: If there is no obvious choice that user should be made aware of the fact that a decision has to be made.

Line:126, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> Actually Anabel Bass has already fixed an typo in SyncRepoEntity and I don't see any reasons why fixing this typo should be made in a separate commit.

Line:147, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> In my humble opinion we should break for if we find first occurrence of DEFAULT_REMOTE_NAME. I did not really get why we should iterate more and finding next one.

Line:149, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/synchronize/SelectSynchronizeResourceDialog.java -> fix code convention issue - we don't use brackets if there is only a single statement inside if, else, for and while
