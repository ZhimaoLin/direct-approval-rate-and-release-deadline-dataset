DESCRIPTION

Extract 'Create Patch' into operation for reusability

In order to reuse the create patch functionality, it was extracted into
it's own operation, purely depending on JGit and decoupled from
FileDiff.

Also moved functionality for generating a filename for a specific commit
into the operation to be reusable. Tests added for the operation.

Patch Set 3:

It looks like this change added trimming of a final newline at the end of the patch, causing this bug:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=406134

Any ideas why this was added here?

Patch Set 3:

As far as I remember (after 3 years), this was intended to just be a refactoring.
