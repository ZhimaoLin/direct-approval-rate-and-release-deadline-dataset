DESCRIPTION

Always expand remote branch node in branch selection dialog

This is a minor UX improvement that saves one click in many cases,
especially in case of rebaseing on origin/master.

Also this change split up setRootsToShow() method into four
independent methods to reduce confusion on parameter order.
