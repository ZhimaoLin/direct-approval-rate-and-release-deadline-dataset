DESCRIPTION

Monitor Eclipse editors changing workspace external text files

Editing files which are outside workspace (not inside any project or
inside closed projects) should trigger refresh of the index state. A
buffer listener is added to the ITextFileBufferManager which updates the
appropriate IndexDiffCacheEntry if the file is recognized as "external".
