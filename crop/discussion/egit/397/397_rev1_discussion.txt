Looks good, but do we really want the trace stuff as API? Shouldn't we mark it internal?

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.core/.options -> You may consider putting comments in this file to describe the type of output... but it is pretty evident by the name.

Line:31, org.eclipse.egit.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Do we really intend on this package being API?

Tracing seems to be something internal to the EGit plug-in.

Patch Set 1:

Remarks added.

Line:1, org.eclipse.egit.core/.options -> Good idea. Added to patch set 2.

Line:31, org.eclipse.egit.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is the import. The export in the EGit core plug-in is internal in fact, only allowing EGit UI to see this package.
