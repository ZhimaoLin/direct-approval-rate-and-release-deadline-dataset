DESCRIPTION

Workaround for bug in StyledText#addBidiSegmentListener(..)

Due to bug 400727, that listener is only called on Windows when an RTL
input language is installed. The fix is to detect this situation and
resort to a workaround: Restrict the maximum width of the message area
to MAX_LINE_WIDTH.

Bug: 400662

- the hudson job builds against jgit's master version which is already on 2.4-SNAPSHOT hence the verification fails, I deleted the wrong vote
- someone on Windows should verify this works

Line:407, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> style nit: we don't use braces around single line blocks

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I tried this on Windows, but the problem didn't occur there.


So I simulated the problem by changing the code, and the workaround works well. Looks good to me.


Matthias: Time is running out for 2.3.1, should we submit this anyway?
