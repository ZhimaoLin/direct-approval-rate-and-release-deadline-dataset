DESCRIPTION

Workaround for bug in StyledText#addBidiSegmentListener(..)

Due to bug 400727, that listener is only called on Windows when an RTL
input language is installed. The fix is to detect this situation and
resort to a workaround: Restrict the maximum width of the message area
to MAX_LINE_WIDTH.
