DESCRIPTION

[repoView] Add "Open With" menu for workspace files

Note Eclipse UI's OpenWithMenu class only works with IFile, so it's only
shown for files that are in the workspace.

Hi,

I cloned egit (with this branch) and jgit
also import all projects (except test) in a workspace
run a new runtime eclipse

=> but didn't got any new menu "Open with"

Did I missed something ?

@Benoit: Thanks for testing! Was the file you tried this with inside a project that was imported to the workspace?

As the commit message notes, the Eclipse API only allows us to show the menu for files that are in a project in the workspace, not for others.

@Robin

Indeed it's working fine when the file is in the workspace.

Sadly, my main use case is to bypass eclipse default editor on configuration files on the root of the repository (no an eclipse project) 

Still it's a good feature 
thx

Patch Set 1:

Have you considered importing the root of your repository as a general project? You can exclude any nested folders (e.g. other projects) using resource filters (project properties > Resource > Resource Filters).

Yep, but at this point I will prefer to just edit it in an other light text editor
