DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Use action decorators on top of content-type icons

Use the add and delete decorators on top of the content-type
icons for files displayed in the History view.

Previously 16 x 16 '+' and 'X' icons were used which hid the type
of file being added or deleted from the user.
