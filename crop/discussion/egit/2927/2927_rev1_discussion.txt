DESCRIPTION

[historyView] Use action decorators on top of content-type icons

Use the add and delete decorators on top of the content-type
icons for files displayed in the History view.

Previously 16 x 16 '+' and 'X' icons were used which hid the type
of file being added or deleted from the user.

Very good idea. See inline remark, though.

Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/FileDiffLabelProvider.java -> I think this case should be in the list of fallback cases (unfortunately, I don't know how to create a COPY diff)...
