Line:37, org.eclipse.egit.ui/pom.xml -> This will be soon replaced with com.github.spotbugs, as the Maven plugin moved under the umbrella of the SpotBugs project <https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin>

See <https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/8>

I expect the first version to be 3.1.0-RC5.
