DESCRIPTION

StagingView: improve reload job

StagingView now cancels an already running reload job before scheduling
a new reload job. This avoids unnecessary expensive calculation of
IndexDiffs.
Furthermore the selected repository is not changed if the reload job was
canceled. This avoids showing incomplete staging information for the
newly selected repository.

Line:1040, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Thinking about it more, this check could probably go in the done call directly so that the asyncExec is only scheduled if the result will actually be displayed.
