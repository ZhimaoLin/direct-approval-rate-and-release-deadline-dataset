DESCRIPTION

StagingView: improve reload job

StagingView now cancels an already running reload job before scheduling
a new reload job. This avoids unnecessary expensive calculation of
IndexDiffs.
Furthermore the selected repository is not changed if the reload job was
canceled. This avoids showing incomplete staging information for the
newly selected repository.
