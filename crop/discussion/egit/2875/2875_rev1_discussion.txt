DESCRIPTION

Show key bindings for copy/paste repository path
context menu action that appear in Git Repositories view.

Created a context for that view and added key bindings for those two
actions to the plugin.xml file.

This now allows those key bindings to appear and be configured in
the Keys preference page as well as have a context available for
"In Git Repositories View".

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

First of all, great contribution, thanks Kevin. There are just a few "style nits" here.
Feel free to contact me directly if I'm being unclear with anything.

Line:266, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Style-nit: no brackets around single-line blocks

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The first line should be short (70 chars max) and concise, like "Add scoped keybindings to RepositoriesView" or such (we also have a convention that suggests to start this first line with [repoView], but that's rather optional: "[repoView] Add scoped keybindings for copy/paste"). See contributor guide.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> We also need Change-Id and Signed-off. Normally, you can add them both via the commit dialog by clicking the check boxes, but since you have uploaded this already, you can not use the check box for the change id (as it would create a new id) but should add it by copy/paste the change id from this change. Wen you upload again, you should get a second patch set with the commit message updated.
