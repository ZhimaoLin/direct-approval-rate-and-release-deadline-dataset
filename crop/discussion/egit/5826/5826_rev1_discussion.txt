DESCRIPTION

Don't catch and swallow RuntimeException

Previously IndexDiffCacheEntry would go into a non-stop
scheduling loop if calculating the IndexDiff raised
any RuntimeException or IOException.

This change now only catches the IOException thrown by
IndexDiff and does not reschedule when this exception
occurs.
