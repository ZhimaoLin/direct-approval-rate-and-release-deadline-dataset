DESCRIPTION

Fix UI tests failing due to new clone target folder configuration

A couple of UI test were failing, partly due to 
1f972b32da0923e29f78476273b8205eda6051ec (Allow to configure a
default target folder for cloning Git Repositories).
Additionally the checkout job is joined to stabilize test execution.
