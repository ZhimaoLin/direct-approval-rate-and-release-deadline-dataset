DESCRIPTION

Fix compare input for local changes nodes.

GitModelBlob class was using compare() and hashCode() methods
implementation from GitModelCommit, therefore in some cases Compare View
was showing wrong files in comparison. It also fixes wrong headers in the
compare editor.

The previous patch version was working for me. I've compare it with my local version and there was no changes.

This is a rebased version of previous patch, Stefan please check it.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi Dariusz,

I still have the issue.

I uploaded both my test repository and a screen shot of what I see to the bug. You can do the following to reproduce:

- unzip the repo and import the project
- On the project, synchronize HEAD with local changes and HEAD
- In the synchronize view, double click on Calc4.java, both on the node below <working tree> and below <staged changes>

In both case I see the whole content marked as conflicting.

Stefan
