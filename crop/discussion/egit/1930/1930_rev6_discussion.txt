DESCRIPTION

Fix compare input for local changes nodes.

GitModelBlob class was using compare() and hashCode() methods
implementation from GitModelCommit, therefore in some cases Compare View
was showing wrong files in comparison. It also fixes wrong headers in the
compare editor.

Patch Set 6:

> * The comparison of the staged changes is not with HEAD but with the parent of HEAD (see inline comment in GitCacheCompareInput)

Done.

> * The compare editor for a file with both index and working dir changes shows conflicts in red

Done.

 * When a file is deleted I see the file with a normal decorator; the right hand side of the compare editor is just empty. I can see nowhere that the file is deleted.

I would prefer to have a separate patch for this since this issue appears also in commit nodes.

I still have this issue. I also could not see a corresponding change in the last patch set. Maybe you forgot to commit that?
