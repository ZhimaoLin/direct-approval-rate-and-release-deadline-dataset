DESCRIPTION

Fix compare input for local changes nodes.

was showing wrong files in comparison. It also fixes wrong headers in the
compare editor.

Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I do not see a difference between patch set 7 and 8. I still have the issue with the conflict-style compare editor.

If you do not find the reason we could submit this but track the issue in bug 326674.
