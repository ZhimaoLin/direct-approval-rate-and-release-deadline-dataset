The user should not have to go to the commit diff viewer. The message could be a link that one clicks to see the rest of the files instead.

Also, where is that problem? This smells more of a workaround than a fix. I don't see a measurable delay/freeze, even with hundreds of changed files.

Limiting the walk can be done using using more general means, like a filter on the treewalk, rather than adding an ad-hoc method in JGit.

Line:103, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/PluginPreferenceInitializer.java -> This is ridiculously low. I see no freeze whatsoever even when there are hundreds of changed files.

If we add this there should be no limit, or perhaps a timeout rather than count

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> No #-sign

Thanks for your feedback and the hint to use a filter instead. Unfortunately, I'll still need to touch jgit, as the StopWalkException is catched in TreeFilterMarker#getMarks ...

Your PC / HDD has to be slow enough, in order to observe the issue. And houndreds of files may still not be enough.

please retry with the latest nightly

I think this should be fixed by
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/31351/
which was merged recently

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> duplicate sign-off, usually sign-off is the last footer in the message
