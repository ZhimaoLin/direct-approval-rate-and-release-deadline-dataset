DESCRIPTION

Minor fix in Gerrit version check

According to the documentation,[1] one form of the output of Gerrit's
"gerrit-version" ssh command is "<tagname>-<n>-g<sha1>", where <sha1>
is defined by the documentation as "the seven-character abbreviated
SHA-1 of the commit."

Well, current Gerrit Gerrit reports at the bottom of that very same
documentation page at [1] its version as "2.15-rc1-577-g6b1fed0abe",
which is a 10-character abbreviated SHA1.

So relax the version check to match 7 or more characters.

(Such a long commit comment for adding a single comma!)
