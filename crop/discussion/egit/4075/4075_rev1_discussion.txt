Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskReferenceFactory.java -> can you point me to javadoc for LinkedTaskInfo ?

Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskReferenceFactory.java -> LinkedTaskInfo does not have any JavaDoc but I can write some if it helps? 
The timestamp is the posix time of the commit (in milli-seconds). It is used to match commits to comments on tasks.

Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.mylyn.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/internal/mylyn/ui/commit/TaskReferenceFactory.java -> that's what I was looking for, would make sense to write JavaDoc for this public class ...
