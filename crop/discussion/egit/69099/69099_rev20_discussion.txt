DESCRIPTION

Prepare Neon target platform

Use the Neon target platform as the default target platform and
explicitly set target platform for org.eclipse.egit.core.test.

Update org.junit to 4.12 since 4.11 is not available in the Neon orbit
version. Remove the unnecessary Maven dependency to junit declared in
pom.xml, it is already declared in manifests and available in the EGit
target platform.

Neon Eclipse platform requires BREE 8 so we have to use Java 8 for the
EGit build (for the compiler settings we still stick to source and
target 1.7 since we want to still support Java 7) otherwise unpacking
platform pack200 archives will fail since they have been built
using Java 8 and hence cannot be unpacked using Java 7's unpack200 [1].

This requires to update the findbugs maven plugin to the latest version
which supports Java 8.

Ignore a couple of tests in ResourceUtilTest which now fail since
bug 476585 was fixed in Neon M6.

I find the umpteen exceptions in the EasymportWizardTest worrying. Looks like that one runs only cleanly with Mars.

this is going to be replaced by https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68993/ which replaces the earlier experimental implementation by the one now part of Eclipse platform in Neon, I'll try to rebase that onto this change later today, hope this will fix these issues

will also put Mickael on cc, maybe he can do the rebase earlier
