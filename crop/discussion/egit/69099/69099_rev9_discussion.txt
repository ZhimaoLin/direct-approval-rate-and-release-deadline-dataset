DESCRIPTION

Prepare Neon target platform

Use the Neon target platform as the default target platform and
explicitly set target platform for org.eclipse.egit.core.test.

Update org.junit to 4.12 since 4.11 is not available in the Neon orbit
version.

Neon Eclipse platform requires BREE 8 so we have to also use
it for the EGit build (for the compiler settings we still stick
to source and target 1.7) since otherwise unpacking platform pack200
archives will fail since they have been built using Java 8 and hence
cannot be unpacked using Java 7's unpack200.

This requires to update the findbugs maven plugin to the latest version
which supports Java 8.
