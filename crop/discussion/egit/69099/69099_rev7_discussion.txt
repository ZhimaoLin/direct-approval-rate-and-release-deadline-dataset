DESCRIPTION

Prepare Neon target platform

Use the Neon target platform as the default target platform and
explicitly set target platform for org.eclipse.egit.core.test.

Neon Eclipse platform requires BREE 8 so we have to also use
it for the EGit build (for the compiler settings we still stick
to source and target 1.7) since otherwise the tests will fail.

This requires to update the findbugs maven plugin to the latest version
which supports Java 8.

Ignore a couple of tests in ResourceUtilTest which now fail since bug
476585 was fixed in Neon M6.

Temporarily remove linux/gtk/x86 environment from maven target platform
configuration until we know why we hit SWT native library loading issues
on this platform.
