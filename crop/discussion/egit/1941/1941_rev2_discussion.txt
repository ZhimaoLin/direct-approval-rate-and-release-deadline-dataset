DESCRIPTION

Git toolbar and menu using command framework

The old git toolbar and menu were based on actions and didn't use
icons consistent with the team menu. Also some tooltips were missing.
The git actionset can be used to enable the git menu and toolbar.

RepositoryActionHandler was enhanced to register for selection
changes so that command enabling also works for the git toolbar.

Patch Set 2:

I believe this now works properly on Mac OSX. Use the actionset to enable the git toolbar and menu.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

Used the approach in http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,1955 instead. As long as the Team API uses actions there is no real benefit in using the command framework here.
