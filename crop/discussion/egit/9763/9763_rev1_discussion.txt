DESCRIPTION

Add "History" Show In part in Git Repository Exploring perspective

Otherwise the Show In submenu only includes Git Reflog and Properties.
This was not necessary before I7d986900e713b581b7baa19a8e850a5ee37585a7
as the platform Show In support was not used.

The action is also not visible in the Java EE perspective.
Maintaining a white list of supported perspectives does not seem to be a good approach.

Right, a better approach seems to return it from getShowInTargetIds:
