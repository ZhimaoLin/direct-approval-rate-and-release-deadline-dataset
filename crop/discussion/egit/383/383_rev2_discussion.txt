DESCRIPTION

Use JGit from the nightly update site

It's not convenient to have JGit projects be opened when developing
EGit-only stuff. Extend target platform definition with a latest JGit
from the nightly update site [1] listed on 'EGit - Download' page [2].

Nightly update site used despite of the fact that it is intended to be
updated frequently and JGit's version here should be kept in sync.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I'm not sure I see the problem, to use JGit you just have to import the sources into your workbench, right?  Its not like JGit is huge or anything...
