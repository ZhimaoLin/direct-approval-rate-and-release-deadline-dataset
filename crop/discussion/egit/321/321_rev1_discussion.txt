DESCRIPTION

"Local file..." button for Repository import

A button is added to the "Import Git Repository" wizard in order to allow the user

Patch Set 1: No score

The problem is that the code formatter settings were changed in the meantime... What's your take on this?

Line:497, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> See comment above.

Line:138, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> Hi Matthias,
I'm aware of this, but the code formmater settings have changed, so Source->Format does introduce these changes.
What's your suggestion here?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:138, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> Don't run the auto code formatter on the whole file but only on those parts you edit. The pro of this approach is that we don't clutter history with pure formatting changes, the downside is that sometimes the formatting isn't 100% consistent.
