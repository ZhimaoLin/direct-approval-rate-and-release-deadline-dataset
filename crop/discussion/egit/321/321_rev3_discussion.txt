DESCRIPTION

"Local file..." button for Repository import

A button is added to the "Import Git Repository" wizard in order to allow the user 
to select a directory in the local file system.
After a directory was selected, the URI-field of the wizard is filled with a file-URI.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

While trying out I found the following problem: 

On the "Import Git Repository" page of our wizard ...
- select a "Protocol:" different from "file"
- press the button "Local file..."
... then nothing happens but you see exceptions in the error log. I expected that when I explicitly press the "Local file.." button then my previous protocol selection will be overwritten. Or at least a error message should pop up.
