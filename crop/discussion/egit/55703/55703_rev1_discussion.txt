DESCRIPTION

Deprecate unused and obsolete methods

As the experience with SpellcheckableMessageArea has shown, doing
syntax coloring directly in SWT is error-prone, especially in editable
text viewers. These two methods are now unused within EGit and should
not be used anymore.

Line:818, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/UIUtils.java -> 1. Didn't xxx@xxx.xxx because that would be displayed at the very bottom of the javadoc hover. I wanted it to be included in the deprecation message.

2. Is HyperlinkTokenScanner good enough to be made public API so that external clients have access and can use it? (Don't know if there _are_ any external users of these two functions at all.)

Line:818, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/UIUtils.java -> 1. ok

2. I'd wait until someone explicitly requests this, we don't block usage since the package is exported as x-internal so potential adopters can use it if they accept a discouraged access warning
