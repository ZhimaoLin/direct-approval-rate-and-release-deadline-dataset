DESCRIPTION

Fix selection problem in History View

Active menu selection is used instead of current selection.
This seems to be necessary since GenericHistoryView does not
implement a selection provider.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

As discussed: looks like the "active menu selection" is not aware of multiple selection. Guess we need to always ask the page directly.
