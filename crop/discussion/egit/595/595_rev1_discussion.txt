DESCRIPTION

Remove an extraneous border from 'Git Repositories' view

The view creates a regular TreeViewer using the basic constructor
that does not specify a style bit. Internally, the JFace code
will create a new SWT Tree widget using SWT.BORDER. This introduces
an unnecessary border around the tree which takes away precious
pixels from the user interface.
