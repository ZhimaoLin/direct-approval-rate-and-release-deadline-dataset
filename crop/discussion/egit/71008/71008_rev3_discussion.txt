Patch Set 3:

In checkout dialog of history view which just don't display the current branch from the list of branches the user can checkout, it's already checked out so it seems unnecessary to have it in this list. So why don't you do the same here ?

Patch Set 3:

I'm not sure which dialog you mean, but the CheckoutDialog (RepositoryView context menu -> SwitchTo -> Other) displays and marks the currently checked out branch. So does the RepositoryView. I'm not sure if that is better from a usability perspective, than what you are suggesting, but I wanted to make Gitflow consistent with the rest of EGit.
With the same motivation, if there is another dialog that does not display the branch, maybe we should change it as well.

yes, these menus show the current branch with a check mark, but they show it greyed out (action disabled), your proposed change shows the current branch with a check mark but not disabled, and when you try to check it out nothing happens. Hence I think you should also show it disabled

So the respective buttons should be greyed out. Got it now!
