DESCRIPTION

Enable "Push to Upstream" when default remote has push spec

In C Git "git push" also works when the current branch does not have a
upstream configuration, but the default remote ("origin") does have a
push spec. So behave the same in EGit's "Push to Upstream" action.

Also add tests for this and other "Push to Upstream" cases.
