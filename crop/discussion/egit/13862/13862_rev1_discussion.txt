we need you to answer the 3 contributor questions as a comment on this review or (hurray) you may file a CLA using the new process described here [1], as your change is already signed off filing the CLA is equivalent to the old process. With the CLA in place you don't need to answer the 3 questions anymore but only sign off each change you contribute.
