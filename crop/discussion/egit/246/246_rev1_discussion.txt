DESCRIPTION

Clean up description text for plugins

Our build process doesn't insert these tags anymore, so we
should drop them from the description of the feature.

Also make our provider name match other Eclipse.org based
plugins and use "Eclipse.org" rather than "eclipse.org".

Looks good. A small change to the discovery information in my patch comments, resubmit and we're good.

Line:22, org.eclipse.egit-feature/feature.xml -> Can we change this to http://www.eclipse.org/egit/updates

?
