- the text in the empty filter box should be "type filter text" instead of "find" since it filters the staging view
- the filter field should be placed above the unstaged/staged changes panes to make clear it filters these two panes
- alternatively we could use FilteredTree
- did you test performance with a very large number of changed files ?

Line:19, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewSearchThread.java -> s/Ix/Index/ this is more readable

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewSearchThread.java -> this method is used only once hence I'd inline it

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingViewSearchThread.java -> style nit: no braces around single line blocks

Line:766, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> couldn't the thread class be inlined as an anonymous class ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> this is filtering not search

Patch Set 1:

I didn't use FilteredTree because I thought it would be better if typing text in a single text field resulted in both Unstaged and Staged files being filtered. 

But I  didn't want to put the filter field above the unstaged/staged changes panes because that pushed the unstaged pane down lower than the commit message pane, which didn't look as pleasing since then the left and right headers don't line up any more, nor do the top borders of the widgets.

I have tested this with several thousand files shown in the view, and performance is still acceptable.

Couldn't the filter field be displayed at the right of the repository name just above the staged/unstaged pane, ideally right-aligned with these panes ?
I uploaded a mockup to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=407776.

I rebased this change onto your other proposal adding display options tree and packed tree and found that if filtering removes all files underneath a folder, the empty folder isn't filtered from the pane, but I think it should be filtered.

The unstaged and staged panes show the number of contained files, when filtering this should be enhanced to also show the number files matching the filter condition, e.g. if 3 out of 7 files are displayed due to a filter expression the number should be displayed as (3/7)

Displaying the filter field as shown in the mockup is challenging, particularly right aligning it with Unstaged Changes and Staged Changes sections, and handling the case where the vertical sash is moved, the selected repository changes, etc.  I have made the change to show "Filter files" as the search message rather than "Find".  Maybe this makes it more obvious what the control's purpose is, even if it is in its current location?

I've fixed the unstaged/staged panes to show <shown files>/<total files> in the section text, as suggested.

When I revisit the other change, adding the display options, I'll be sure to make sure that it behaves correctly with respect to filtering.
