Patch Set 4:

I like that this layout puts the filter widget closer to the panes it's filtering but
this wastes too much vertical space, so I propose to go back one step:

- go back to the previous layout with the filter widget as part of the toolbar since it consumes less vertical space

and try the following:
- try to find a way to put the view's title and its toolbar on the same vertical position which would save even more vertical space, if you don't find a way how to do that we could also defer this to a later change

this way we get more valuable vertical space for the important panes (unstaged/staged/commit message) which is more important than placing the filter widget close to the staging panes
