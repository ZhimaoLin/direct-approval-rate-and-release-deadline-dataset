DESCRIPTION

Test stability: clean up after config test

Several problems with this test:

* It used the real user config.
* It didn't clean up properly after tests, so that the user config
  contained left-overs from the test and accumulated more and more
  entries for the "testsection.testname" subsection with each run.

Fix by cleaning once before all tests, and then after each test. Also
remove the "testsection.testname" test section. And finally, do not use
the real user config but a temporary file instead.

Patch Set 2:

> the user config of the Egit HIPP user still needs to be
 > cleaned up manually. It has by now more than 4000 entries in the
 > "testsection.testname" subsection.

Did that myself now with https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/8989/ . Removed 4412 entries.
