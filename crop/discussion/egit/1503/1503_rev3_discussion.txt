Patch Set 3:

1. Text fields for merge result are rendered grey in Windows (->read only) but white on Mac. I removed the border around the text fileds.

2. I think the merge result should stay on top because it's the most important information of the dialog.

3. To show Branch / Tag in the input table MergeResult needs to be extended. Already discussed with Chris.

4. Changed column label from Id to Commit Id.
