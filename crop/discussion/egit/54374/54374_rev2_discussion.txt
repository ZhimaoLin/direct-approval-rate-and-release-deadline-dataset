DESCRIPTION

Fix EclipseAuthenticator which was breaking platform's authenticator

When EclipseAuthenticator didn't find a proxy configuration it returned
null which broke platform's NetAuthenticator which shows a password
dialog some other Eclipse bundles are relying on. Fix this by delegating
to NetAuthenticator if there is no proxy configuration.

Platform should enhance NetAuthenticator to respect proxy configuration
so that we can remove EclipseAuthenticator. Until then accept dependency
to an internal platform package.

Adapt auto-detection of Gerrit by sending a REST request to also use
Apache httpclient instead of HttpURLConnection. This prevents that
NetAuthenticator opens a password dialog since apparently
HttpURLConnection tries to get credentials from the JVM's default
authenticator before EGit has a chance to react on HTTP status code 401.
