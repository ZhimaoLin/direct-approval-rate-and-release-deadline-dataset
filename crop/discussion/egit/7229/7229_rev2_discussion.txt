Patch Set 2:

I was more concerned about the `handleOpen(selection, OpenStrategy.activateOnOpen())` logic being duplicated everywhere. But it's ok, this way one can more directly see what happens.

Sporadic build failure should be fixed by change I20c7a50b2034ce140396f0c639da082086ada510 (not yet reviewed).
