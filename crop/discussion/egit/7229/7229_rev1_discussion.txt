The implementation of linkToEditor, open and activate is the same everywhere -> create subclass and use that instead of OpenAndLinkWithEditorHelper directly?

Line:216, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushResultTable.java -> Delete empty line.

That's a style question. I personally try to avoid empty helpers unless the framework provides them, like e.g. SelectionAdapter. A better solution would be to make the method non-abstract in the framework. I filed bug 387567 for that.
