DESCRIPTION

Fix display of "Show Revision Information" in editors

The context menu was missing from editors opened from the history
view's file list (Context menu->Show Revision Information would
open an editor and show the annotations, but when these were then
hidden, they could not be re-displayed from within the editor).
Moreover, opening a file version from the history view (Context
menu->Open This Version) would open an editor that would have the
"Show Revision Information" context menu, but when invoked it would
open up yet another editor.

The root cause is explained in bug 505938, comment 2. Basically we
end up with different FileRevisionEditorInput classes being used for
editors, one from EGit, and an internal one from org.eclipse.ui.team.

Fix this by refactoring the blame machinery in EGit UI to work either
with IFile or with CommitFileRevision. and make sure to use
EgitEditorUtils.openEditor() instead of
RevisionAnnotationController.openEditor().
