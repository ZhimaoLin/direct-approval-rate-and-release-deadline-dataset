This works but I think it will be surprising for the user: cherry-pick was called but in order to resolve conflicts the user has to follow the rebase conflict resolution steps. This deviates from the steps needed for resolving a cherry-pick conflict using native git so I think we should explain that to the user.

Patch Set 1:

When starting to cherry-pick, there is now a dialog that asks for confirmation of the commits selected (Robin put that dialog in.) I'm now thinking about adding an additional text to that dialog, along the lines of:

"Note: EGit uses interactive rebase mechanics for cherry-picking, which is different from regular Git. If one of the selected commits fails to merge, you need to follow conflict resolve steps as if doing a regular interactive rebase."

What do you think about that?
