DESCRIPTION

[test stability] CompareActionsTest assumes resource model

The CompareActionsTest uses the synchronize view and expects the
resource model to be active. Other tests may have changed that
setting, though, and then these tests may fail.

Therefore set the active model provider explicitly. All tests using
the synchronize view must set the expected model provider(s).
