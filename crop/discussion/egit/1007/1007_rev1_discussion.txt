DESCRIPTION

Git Repositories View UI Tests III: remote configuration handling

Remote configuration handling in the Git Repositories view must
behave like the standard: it is possible to push to a remote repository
if only a "url" is present in the config, but no "pushurl". If both
url and pushurl exist, they are all used.
Accordingly, the "configure push" UI must show the (fetch-) URL
if it is present and make addition of "pushurl"s optional in this case.
Also the Repo View content provider had to be adjusted in order to
show the "push" node if only a "url" and a "push" but no "pushurl"
is defined.
