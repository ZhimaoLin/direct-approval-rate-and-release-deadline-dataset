DESCRIPTION

Remove session properties when disconnecting a project

Disconnecting a project left the session properties for the
RepositoryMappings still attached to the resource info in the Eclipse
resource tree.

This prevents timely garbage collection of no longer used repository
instances because the mappings contain hard references to repositories.

Moreover, potentially stale properties might become active again when
the project is re-connected.
