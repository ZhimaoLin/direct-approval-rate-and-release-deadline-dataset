DESCRIPTION

Enhance Eclipse save actions

Add the following Eclipse save actions executed when saving modified
lines. This should help to reduce manual work needed to maintain a clean
and consistent code style:
- organize imports
- always use braces around blocks
- add xxx@xxx.xxx annotations
- remove
  - unused imports
  - unnecessary $NON-NLS$ tags
  - redundant type arguments

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

I like the change, since it applies the "trivial" cleanups automatically, without big interceptions in the code. Did you leave out the "convert to lambda" on purpose, although you advised me in the other change to do that manually?

I suggest to additionally activate the "Java Code Style->Cleanup" project properties for the same bundles and to set the exact some preferences there. That allows us to run a cleanup action on all the bundles in one change to apply these settings to all existing code and to avoid "I did not change that" situations afterwards on patches.

I am not sure we always prefer lambda style

we try to avoid large cleanup changes since this may provoke many unnecessary conflicts when trying to merge or rebase changes

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Especially "always use braces" will help a lot with copy-pasted old code :-)
