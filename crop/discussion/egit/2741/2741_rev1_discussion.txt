DESCRIPTION

[sync] Improve performance after commit 6c5e2ea0

It appears that new implementation of
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.isSupervised(IResource) introduce an
performance issues in synchronize view. This change moves part of
logic from isSupervised method into members(IResource). In this
approach we don't include ignored resources in list members therefore
we don't need to check that resource isn't ignored in isSupervised()
method.

Dariusz, any toughts on how to have a performance test so we don't introduce this issue again? This issue seems to pop up sometimes and doesn't make our users that happy when it occurs.

Patch Set 1:

The main problem of testing synchronize view performance is to build a testing repository with proper history size and that could be created anaing for each test run.

I don't know how we could build such repository in test case, rest of this test case seams to be pretty simple. Any ideas how such repo can be created in test case?
