DESCRIPTION

[sync] Improve performance after commit 6c5e2ea0

It appears that new implementation of
GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.isSupervised(IResource) introduce an
performance issues in synchronize view. This change moves part of
logic from isSupervised method into members(IResource). In this
approach we don't include ignored resources in list members therefore
we don't need to check that resource isn't ignored in isSupervised()
method.
