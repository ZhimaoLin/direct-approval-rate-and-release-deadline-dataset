Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- fixed typo in test method name
- now tests are ok and opening compare from workspace model works

:)

- but opening compare from java workspace model doesn't work (double click has no effect), could not find errors in error log for that

Patch Set 6:

Strange ... I'm able to run those tests from eclipse on my linux box without any errors, they all are green. Maybe it is some how connected yours environment.
