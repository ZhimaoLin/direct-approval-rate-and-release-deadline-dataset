DESCRIPTION

Workaround CVS marking CVS directory managed by EGit team-private

ContainerTreeIterator.entries() didn't list members which are considered
team private by the platform. CVS seems to mark CVS directory
team-private even if the corresponding project isn't shared with the CVS
team provider. This leads to the effect that the CVS folder is marked
missing in IndexDiff despite the fact that its git status is clean.

Workaround this problem by changing ContainerTreeIterator to not skip
team private members and skip git team private members in our code.
