DESCRIPTION

Fix ContainerTreeIterator to not skip team private members

ContainerTreeIterator.entries() didn't list members which are considered
team private by the platform. This leads to the effect that e.g. CVS
folder is marked missing in IndexDiff despite the fact that its git
status is clean.
