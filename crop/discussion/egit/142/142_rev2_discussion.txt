Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this



Line:97, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/CommitAction.java -> I think this warning could be more precisely point to the reason why commit is not possible:

"No changed items were selected and no commit exists hence neither commit nor amend are possible."

How do I submit another patch? I can attempt a git push review, but that seems like it would just create a new Change altogether?
