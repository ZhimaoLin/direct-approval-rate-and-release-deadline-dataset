DESCRIPTION

Fix ignoring of files to be ignored in working tree root

Since AdaptableFileTreeIterator called the wrong constructor of its
super class FileTreeIterator the call to initRootIterator was skipped.
Hence no RootIgnoreNode was initialized which caused AFI to not respect
the ignore rules defined outside the working tree (exclude file,
ignore rules defined in home directory, system wide ignore rules).

looks good to me, but why do the tests fail?

Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/AdaptableFileTreeIterator.java -> What could explain the failing test we currently have? One hint: your change of course adds the execution of workingTreeIterator.initRootIterator() - that's what we want. But It also changes that we use the use repo.getFS() instead of FS.DETECTED.

Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/AdaptableFileTreeIterator.java -> The test failure occurs sometimes and is not related to this change.
