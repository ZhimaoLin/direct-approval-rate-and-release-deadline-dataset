DESCRIPTION

Commit editor branch handling fixes

 - don't wait for data from branch searching if the branch count exceeds
some high number, spawn extra job instead
 - don't show branch section next to files, move this above and collapse
initially to give more space for files
 - cancel started jobs on disposal of the widget

(6 comments)

Line:102, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorPage.java -> Stupid question: why have a limit? Why not do it asynchronously always?

Line:610, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorPage.java -> This job will forcibly run after the loadSections job because of the scheduling rule. Can't this be done in parallel?

Line:649, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorPage.java -> Unrelated to this change, but why is this package-visible? Seems to be called only within this class...

Line:662, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorPage.java -> loadSections is also called through onRefsChanged. The file diffs would be needed only when the page is loaded initially; they shouldn't change when branches or tags are added/deleted.

Line:692, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorPage.java -> Can these be null? (For instance,when the platform is shutting down.)

Line:692, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitEditorPage.java -> This will keep the scheduling rule while updating the UI. How about scheduling a WorkbenchJob here instead of the syncExec?

Thomas, I agree with most comments. My intent was to fix the "showstoper" bug for us without much overhead / possible regressions, so I let unrelated code "as is". The code isn't in the very good state, and can definitely be improved.

4 of my 6 comments were on code you just introduced. Only the comments on lines 649 and 662 are about pre-existing things. The code isn't getting better by adding quick fixes. We accumulate even more technical debt here, so I think it'd be worth to do the new additions as good as possible.
