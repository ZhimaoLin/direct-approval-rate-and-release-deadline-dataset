DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Commit editor branch handling fixes

 - don't wait for data from branch searching if the branch count exceeds
some high number, spawn extra job instead
 - don't show branch section next to files, move this above and collapse
initially to give more space for files
 - cancel started jobs on disposal of the widget
