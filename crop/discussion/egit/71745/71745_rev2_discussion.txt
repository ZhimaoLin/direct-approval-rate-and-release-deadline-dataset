DESCRIPTION

Test stability: avoid asynchronous SWTBotTreeItem.expand()

Sometimes tests do not find children of expanded tree nodes. The root
cause appears to be that expand() expands the node in an asyncExec.[1]

Add a utility operation that after expanding waits until the desired
node exists, and replace all calls to expand() that do expect children
by that.
