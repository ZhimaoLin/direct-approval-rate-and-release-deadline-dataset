DESCRIPTION

Test stability: avoid asynchronous SWTBotTreeItem.expand()

Sometimes tests do not find children of expanded tree nodes. The root
cause appears to be that expand() expands the node in an asyncExec.[1]

Add a utility operation that after expanding waits until the desired
node exists, and replace all calls to expand() that do expect children
by that.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Build 8444 failed in that way. Unfortunately, the screenshot is no longer available. It showed the create project wizard, "General" expanded, followed by an empty line. The test then failed because it didn't find the child named "Project".

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> And build 8455 for PS 1 failed with exactly this problem (different dialog, though) in the one place I had missed. See https://hudson.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/8455/artifact/org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer.tests/target/screenshots/test%28org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer.tests.EasymportWizardTest%29.jpeg

Should be fixed in PS 2.
