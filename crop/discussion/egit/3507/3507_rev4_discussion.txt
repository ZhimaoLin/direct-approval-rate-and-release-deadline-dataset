CommitMessageSection class that can be re-used outside the
commit dialog.

Looks nice. I think the toggles for amend, changeid and signedOff and preferences should be part of the view menu.
In change http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3503 I implemented committing from staging view. I also reuse the commit message part of CommitDialog, but the widgets are created outside the component. This provides the flexibility to have a different UI in Commit Dialog and Staging View.

nice :-)

I would prefer if the buttons would go into the view toolbar, hence I propose that you rebase this change onto Jens' change I4488d963d47a3b69945d4944b44c4dbd3938f390.

Sorry, didn't see Jens change, I will work off it now as the base for this change.
