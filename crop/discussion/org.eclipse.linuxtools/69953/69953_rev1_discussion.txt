Line:608, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> This hides all exceptions to callers that might not just be disconnection.  Perhaps the error should be logged or the exception still thrown.

Line:811, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> Same as for containers.

Line:72, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/views/DockerExplorerLabelProvider.java -> This should be a disabled version of REPOSITORY_MIDDLE which is simply a grayed out version.  You can do this via gimp.

I've fixed the icon for when connection is disabled locally. I'll look into logging the error in all cases but when the connection is actually down.
