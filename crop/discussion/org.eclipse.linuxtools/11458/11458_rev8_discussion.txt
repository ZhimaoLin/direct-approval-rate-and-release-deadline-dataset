DESCRIPTION

tmf: Switch event types statistics to a partial history

Using a partial history saves a LOT of space compared to
a full one, and statistics are a good use case for it.

However we will keep the straight event totals in a full
history, since the "histogram queries", used by the upcoming
histogram-based-on-statistics are unbearably slow in a partial
one...

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

Rebased this on latest master.

It currently "works" (passes unit tests and all), but the big downside at the moment happens at construction: the requests to index, build the histogram and build the partial history do not get coalesced, so initial loading is much longer. This will require the "fun bus" coalescing to be implemented first.

As for queries from the partial SS, they are a bit slower as expected, but it's very bearable.
