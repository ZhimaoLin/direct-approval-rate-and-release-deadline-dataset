DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split the statistics in two separate providers

Use separate state providers and backends (and so, two separate .ht files)
to store the statistics information. This will make it easier to eventually
swtich the event-types provider to a partial history backend - two one-liners
basically (or do we say one two-liner?)

Just some comments that need tweaks.

Line:63, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statistics/TmfStateStatistics.java -> This comment should mention totals to differentiate from the other one.

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statistics/TmfStateStatistics.java -> full not partial...for now
