DESCRIPTION

tmf: Switch event types statistics to a partial history

Using a partial history saves a LOT of space compared to
a full one, and statistics are a good use case for it.

However we will keep the straight event totals in a full
history, since the "histogram queries", used by the upcoming
histogram-based-on-statistics are unbearably slow in a partial
one...

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This does save space, but on my computer, it seems to be slower to move the range, we should discuss performance on monday.
