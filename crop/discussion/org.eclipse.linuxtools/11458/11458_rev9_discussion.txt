DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split the statistics in two separate providers

Use separate state providers and backends (and so, two separate .ht files)
to store the statistics information. This will make it easier to eventually
swtich the event-types provider to a partial history backend - two one-liners
basically (or do we say one two-liner?)

Re-scoped this commit a bit: I left all the refactoring to split the provider backend in two separate backends, but both of them still use the full history.

Once we want to switch the types one to the partial history, it will be very very simple to do.
