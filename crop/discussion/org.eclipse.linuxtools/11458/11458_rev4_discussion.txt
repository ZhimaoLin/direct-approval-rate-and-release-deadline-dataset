DESCRIPTION

tmf: Switch event types statistics to a partial history

Using a partial history saves a LOT of space compared to
a full one, and statistics are a good use case for it.

However we will keep the straight event totals in a full
history, since the "histogram queries", used by the upcoming
histogram-based-on-statistics are unbearably slow in a partial
one...

This also required fixing a small bug with the partial-state
backend: we must not include the events happening exactly at
a checkpoint in the event queries.
