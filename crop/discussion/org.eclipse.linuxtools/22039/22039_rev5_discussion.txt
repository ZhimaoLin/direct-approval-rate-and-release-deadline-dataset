DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Fix errors with opening .stp files.

Prevent editor errors caused by opening out-of-workspace .stp
files, or by using OpenFileAction to open any .stp file:

-PathEditorInput's getAdapter(Class) now returns a non-null adapter,
allowing out-of-workspace files to open properly with it.
(Resolves EBZ #428149.)

-OpenFileAction now behaves like Eclipse's OpenLocalFileAction,
meaning that it uses default behaviour to choose the appropriate
input & editor type. This also means that File->Open File... and
the "Open" button on the Systemtap toolbar now choose the same
kind of editor to use for a .stp file.
