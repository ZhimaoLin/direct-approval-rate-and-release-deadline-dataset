DESCRIPTION

ctf: Flatten fixed-size structs

This patch will unroll nested arrays and structs retaining only floats,
enums and integers in a 1d array. This means we won't need to create
"useless" definitions.

Patch Set 8:

Here's a suggestion of a bit of what I had in mind. While we do need to create a first StructDeclaration, we can instead pass it through a static "flattener" (name TBD) to get an improved struct or not.

With this, no need for a separate struct type. Both are still StructDeclaration's, just organized differently.

See inline comments.

This patch shouldn't depend on the "cleanup" one actually, I'll rebase (debase?) it.
