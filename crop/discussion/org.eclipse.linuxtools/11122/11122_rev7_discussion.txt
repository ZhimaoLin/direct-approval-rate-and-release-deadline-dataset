Patch Set 7:

This looks fine to me. All tests pass as well. The last thing to do, would be to make the Perf Stat View have only one instance being displayed at any given time. (remove the secondary id). This is because we can now have multiple comparison views, and because there is no menu available for views with a secondary id.
