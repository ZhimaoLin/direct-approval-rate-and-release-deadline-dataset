DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add the Tmf- prefix to the state system interfaces

In preparation with them being exposed into ITmfTrace, the
interfaces to the state system should wear the proper Tmf-
prefix.

The read-only interface that most views and users will see has
been renamed to simply ITmfStateSystem. The builder interface
that is used by the trace for its construction is now called
ITmfStateSystemBuilder.

This is really State System stuff so Alex should be the one give it a +2.

Thanks for the reviews Fran√ßois!

I'll push this branch, up to just before the Statistics view changeover. I still need to test that one to make sure the extension point still works.
