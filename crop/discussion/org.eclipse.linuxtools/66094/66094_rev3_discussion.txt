DESCRIPTION

valgrind: Stop using deprecated CDT API.

There is no noticeable difference which makes me think that the flag
didn't had the desired effect for long time. Just remove it for now.

Line:40, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.cachegrind/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/valgrind/cachegrind/CachegrindLabelProvider.java -> I'll try running this to see if there's any difference. According to the deprecation docs we might still be able to use the attribute from :

org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.viewsupport.CElementLabels.M_FULLY_QUALIFIED.

The question is whether adding this flag makes any difference at all.

You're right, as far as I can see, removing the M_FULLY_QUALIFIED doesn't change the output in any way. Tested with some classes and plain functions. Perhaps it's the default if not explicitly specified.
