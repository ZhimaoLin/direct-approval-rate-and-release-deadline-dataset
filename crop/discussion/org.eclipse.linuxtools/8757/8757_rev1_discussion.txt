DESCRIPTION

Update TMF Environment view to use tree with columns

The new implementation uses a tree to group environment 
variables per CTF trace (instead of one flat list). 
This improves the readability of this view.

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/environment/TmfEnvironmentView.java -> For the pack below to be effective on the value column, and also to avoid for the user the need to expand the trace items, I would suggest to set the expanded state to true for all root items here.
