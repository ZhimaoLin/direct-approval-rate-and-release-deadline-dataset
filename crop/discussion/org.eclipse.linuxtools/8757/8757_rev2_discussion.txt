DESCRIPTION

Update TMF Environment view to use tree with columns

The new implementation uses a tree to group environment 
variables per CTF trace (instead of one flat list). 
This improves the readability of this view.

Line:109, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/environment/TmfEnvironmentView.java -> The expanded state must be set before pack, otherwise pack has no effect on the hidden Value column. Could it be set at the end the outer loop above (after all subitems have been created, for each trace item)?

Line:109, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/environment/TmfEnvironmentView.java -> It seems to be different behaviour on Windows than on Linux. On Linux it works fine. However, I will change it since it works it Linux too if the expanding is done before pack.
