Ok, committed.  Don't forget to push this into stable-5.0 if it is meant for Neon.

Thanks for approving and merging this patch, Arianna Johns !
I wanted to 'cherry-pick' it and apply it on 'stable-5.0' branch but I get the following error message: 'merge conflict'. I don't remember what's the workaround in this case ?

Patch Set 2:

Hum, looks like another patch with changes on the DockerConnection class was applied on 'stable-5.0', which would explain the merge conflict when cherry-picking.
