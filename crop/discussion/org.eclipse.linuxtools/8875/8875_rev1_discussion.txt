Patch Set 1:

All tests pass locally with maven (mvn clean install and mvn test). However, I am prompted to choose a new configuration when running the tests through eclipse. I am currently looking at whether the problem is with the provider shortcut, or whether there is more than one configuration being created for the project in the tests.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

The problem was my testing configuration. I created a fresh testing configuration and all tests pass locally with maven and through eclipse.
