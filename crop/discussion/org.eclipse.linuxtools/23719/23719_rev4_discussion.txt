DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use ConcurrentHashMap in TmfStatisticsTreeNode

Since multiple threads can update the statistics when using
experiments with more than one trace the tree node structure needs
to thread-safe. Using a ConcurrentHashMap instead of a regular HashMap
avoids ConcurrentModificationException for the current way this class
is used in TMF.
