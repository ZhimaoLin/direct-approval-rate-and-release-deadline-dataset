DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove the TmfStateSystemBuildCompleted signal

Views should now use ITmfStateSystem.waitUntilBuild() instead.
Its behavior is much more predictable, both if the state history
is already built or not.

This also removes the need to pass the ID when building a new
state history. Only the trace will know the ID->statesystem
matching.
