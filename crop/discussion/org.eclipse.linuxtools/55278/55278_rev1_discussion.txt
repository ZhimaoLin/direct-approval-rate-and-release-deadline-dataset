DESCRIPTION

Bug 471663 - Let the user create/run a container from the File>New menu

Refactored the xxxPage and xxxModel classes constructor because in some
cases, there might be no selected connection or image
First wizard page now shows an connection combo to select the current
connection or add a connection if none exists (or missing)
list of images is refreshed when connection selection changes
(selected image remains if it exists in the newly selected Docker daemon)
Selected image or connection are initialized from ImageRun#init(IWorkbench,
  IStructuredSelection) when the wizard is called from File>New

Will this land for Oxygen? It's getting pretty late. Or it's due for abandoning?

Patch Set 1:

Looking at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=471663#c2 , I believe I closed this as WONTFIX because File -> New is more for creating new projects and not really things like containers.

Running images / creating containers from the Docker perspective, and even outside of it is fairly easy.

I would abandon this change.
