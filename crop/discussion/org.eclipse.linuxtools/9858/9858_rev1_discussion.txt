Seems good to me.

However, since API is broken, we need to change the version of the plugin (see comments on files).

Moreover, there is a bug opened about the "ST" prefix everywhere in the dataviewers/gprof/gcov plug-ins (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383587). We perhaps need to take it into account, at least for newly created classes.

Line:22, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.annotatedsourceeditor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/annotatedsourceeditor/STColumnToggle.java -> /**
 xxx@xxx.xxx 4.2
 */
=> and modify plugin version in pom.xml and Manifest.MF

Also see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383587 for the name of this class.

Line:67, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.annotatedsourceeditor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/annotatedsourceeditor/STAnnotatedCSourceEditor.java -> /**
 xxx@xxx.xxx 4.2
 */

=> And change the version of the plug-in in both Manifest.MF and pom.xml
