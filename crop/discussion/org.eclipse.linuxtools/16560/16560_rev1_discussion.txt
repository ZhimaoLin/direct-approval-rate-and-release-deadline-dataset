DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Allow the experiment to have a state system

Some modifications were required for an experiment itself to have a state
system.  Maybe a more general approach would be required instead of those
very local changes, so that experiments can have the same behavior and
functionnalities as the traces.

Also include unit tests of the functionnality developed by Alexandre
Montplaisir.

Isn't the plan to have the statesystems belong to an analysis, and have analysis support given types of traces and experiments?

Indeed!... That will have to be rebased eventually.  But old ways will still be supported.  I don't think it's lost work, Mohamad needs it in the meantime

Someone else like Alex needs to +1 but it looks good to me

Line:198, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/HistoryBuilder.java -> good flip, should speed things up.

Abandoned

There is an upcoming "state system analysis" that will build on top of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/14935/ . It will be the long-term replacement for the patch here.
