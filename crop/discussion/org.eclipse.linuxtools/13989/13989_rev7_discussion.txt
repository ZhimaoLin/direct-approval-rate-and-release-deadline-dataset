Line:38, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/utils/RPMHandlerUtils.java -> This class should be moved to internal package as this is something that is not API for sure.

Line:82, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/utils/RPMHandlerUtils.java -> Missing javadoc.

Line:52, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/utils/RPMUtils.java -> Few things here:
1. There is class RpmConsole which used different naming scheme rpmbuild(projectName) and we have to stick to current naming for the release.
2. The getConsole would better fit as static method in RpmConsole.
3. RPMExportOperation has findConsole method which does similar things and if the getConsole is moved as static method in RpmConsole, RPMExportOperation should be migrated to use this getConsole and it's findConsole dropped.

Line:28, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please stick to Require-Bundle in rpm plugin.

Line:38, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> If same text is used twice please use one key. If they are supposed to give slightly different aka tooltip being more verbose than label please edit it that way.
