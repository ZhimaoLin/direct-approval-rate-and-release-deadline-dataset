Minor comments on this one.

Line:238, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/analysis/AnalysisModuleHelperTest.java -> As mentioned in a previous patch, you could add the tests that the traceTypes list contains only the tracetypes you know it applies to and vice versa, that all trace types it applies to are returned by the list.

Line:47, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/TestRequirementAnalysis.java -> In the plugin.xml, you said TmfTraceStub and now you make the check for CtfTmfTraceStub, that is not coherent (even though I think it will fail elegantly).

Line:135, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> If this analysis applies to more than one trace types, it will return the list of requirements for the first one encountered (which is ok in its default form, we do not want to merge requirements for different trace types). Maybe this method should receive a trace type as parameter? What do you think?

Unless it is easy to do, it is ok for now (since most analysis apply to only 1 trace type anyway). But mention it somewhere in a TODO. Just to say that you are aware of it, but didn't implement yet for lack of time.
