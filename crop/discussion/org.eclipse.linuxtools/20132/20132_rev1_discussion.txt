Patch Set 1:

This should probably be added to the build, in lttng/pom.xml. Also, in lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.releng-site/category.xml.

What do I do in the releng-site? Should I add a category for TMF Analysis? It's not LTTng specific

"What do I do in the releng-site? Should I add a category for TMF Analysis? It's not LTTng specific"

Oh, I was under the impression that all the features under lttng/ where going in there but it looks like I might be wrong. So I guess this would go in Linux tools update site? or both? I added Meredith Scott and Alexandre as reviewers, maybe they can clear that up. Maybe it would make sense to have everything in the lttng update site and rename the category "Lttng" to "Tracing".

Genevieve, how do you feel about adding the plug-ins to the TMF feature instead? I don't think a lot of users would want to install the XML feature separately.

I don't have any special feeling about this. But would all the analysis plugins go in the TMF feature, or would it be case by case?

Patch Set 1:

I think it would be case by case. So for example, if we want a LTTng-UST-specific analysis, it would be provided by the LTTng UST feature.
