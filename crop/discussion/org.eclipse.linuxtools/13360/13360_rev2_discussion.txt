Line:971, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> "event type must be an ITmfEvent". I think it should be "must implement" because is-a is just a rule of the thumb not a java language term. 

Same thing for "It can be a TmfEvent". I think it should say "It can extend TmfEvent".

trace context vs trace location: It helped me to understand the difference to know that the trace context is ephemeral and the trace location is persisted. Maybe add a few words on that.

Line:1162, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Why is this empty? maybe put a comment in code to explain why
