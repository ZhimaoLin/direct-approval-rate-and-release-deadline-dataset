Thanks, looks good. I might change the patch in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/11065/ again, but I'll take care of rebasing this one this time ;)

Line:189, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/historytree/HTInterval.java -> Coding style here, should be a space after switch, and the { should go on the same line.

Line:251, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/historytree/HTInterval.java -> assert() is pretty much useless... there's still a bunch we need to remove, like the one in the case above...
