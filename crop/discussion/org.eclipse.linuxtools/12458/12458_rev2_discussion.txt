Change is looking good to me, makes the graphing feature a lot easier to deal with, just a few problems I found during testing.

Line:318, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> I see class casting errors being thrown here when selecting on the list of graphs. Stepping through this line reveals that the SelectionEvent is a TableItem.  Changing the type of selectedTreeItem to TableItem allows me to select the graph items and remove them.

Another issue that I stumbled upon was trying to update which graph from the list should be used. When I click on a graph in the list available from the launch config tab, the "Apply" button is not enabled and when it is enabled the change does not seem to register. At the moment it seems that the latest graph that was added is the one that is always selected for display.

Line:328, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> I see that the data set selection dialog is added here, but I don't see it appear when adding new graphs.

Line:318, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> I have fixed the casting issue.
As for the graph selection all the graphs that you add are added to the graph view you do not select one. Is that not happening for you ?

Line:328, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> You mean the Data set selection dialog which prompted you to select whether you data had separating lines or not ?
I am removing that. The feature will require that you output your data in columns with no unneeded stuff in between.

Line:318, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> Ah ok, I did not know this detail. Yes, all the graphs are added in the graphing perspective.

Line:328, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> Alright, makes sense. I couldn't think of a case where outputting data in table rows was any more useful than outputting single data rows.
