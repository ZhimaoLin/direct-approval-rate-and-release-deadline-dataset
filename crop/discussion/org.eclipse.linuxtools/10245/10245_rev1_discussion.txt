Patch Set 1: Fails

Make sure there are no Conflicts: line or anything after the "Signed-off" block. Gerrit only parses the last paragraph of the commit. As you can see, the Change-Id in the commit message and the Gerrit one don't match.

Make sure to correct the Change-Id (with the Gerrit one) before pushing a new patch.

Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEvent.java -> Any reason why this was moved out of the Factory? Couldn't we receive it at the constructor, and save the CtfTmfCallsite as a field in here?

If not, every time we call getCallsite we have to do the whole dance again ;)

I know right now it'll only be used when the user right-clicks and selects the Open Callsite action, but eventually we might want to add a (optional) column for the callsites, so it would call it for every single displayed event.

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfCallsite.java -> Should this really be called CtfTmf? There is no ITmfCallsite (and I don't think there should be, right?)

It sounds more like a CtfUstCallsite, since it'll be specific to LTTng-UST traces.

Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEvent.java -> Good point. But we would have to update the constructor with a new parameter though, and it would increase the processing every time we create an event, and slow down indexing. Is it worth it?

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfCallsite.java -> It's a wrapper class of CTFCallsite for use by TMF, so I think it blends well with the other CtfTmf classes of ctfadaptor?
I see UST as using the base CtfTmf. Nothing would prevent kernel from using callsites if they wanted to do so.
