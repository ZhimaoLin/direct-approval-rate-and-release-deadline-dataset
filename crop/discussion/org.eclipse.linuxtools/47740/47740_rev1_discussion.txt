Patch Set 1:

For what it's worth, without this patch, following a hyperlink of a non-existent file throws an internal error in Luna, and opens a blank file in the system default text editor in Mars. IDE.openEditor is what's used to open a hyperlinked file editor, which may explain why the behaviour is different for different Eclipse versions.
