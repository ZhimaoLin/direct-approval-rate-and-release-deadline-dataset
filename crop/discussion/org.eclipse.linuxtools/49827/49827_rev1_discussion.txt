DESCRIPTION

Bug 469734 - Missing public setter method for selectedDataVolumes property

Also fixed other problems in the Image Run wizard:
- if elelemts were selected in the Data Volumes or Exposed Ports tables, then edited, they would not be taken
  into account when building the image because the hash values would have changed. Using an UUID as the unique
  element to compute the equals/hashcode fixed that problem
- the code to mount data volumes was wrong, the data volumes
