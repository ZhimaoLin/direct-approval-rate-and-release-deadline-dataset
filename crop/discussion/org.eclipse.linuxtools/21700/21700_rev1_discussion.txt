As soon as Hudson builds, this is fine with me, except for that little comment that you may or may not fix.

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModule.java -> That last phrase is not relevant anymore, of course they will be set before now!

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModule.java -> Yeah I thought about that comment (I didn't just copy-paste, I swear :P)

It's still true that it has to be called before schedule(). That's the point at which things could break. Although now it could say "before calling schedule() in executeAnalysis() below".
