DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split "CTF adaptor" into separate plugins/feature

This allows using TMF without CTF, for more flexibility and
better separation of dependencies.

Surprisingly, the runtime code was quite independant already and
was quite easy to separate. The only problem were the tests. THE
TESTS! Many of them depended on CTF or LTTng traces, especially
the analysis ones. For now, those have been moved to tmf.ctf.core.tests
and tmf.ctf.ui.tests plugins (and disabled), knowing that we should
eventually bring those back into tmf.{core|ui}.tests.

looks good, but you have some wrong plugin IDs from copy-pasting Activator files.

Line:11, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/about.html -> Look at the file in gerrit, some red stuff, some of which can be removed

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf/pom.xml -> extra spaces

Line:10, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core/about.html -> here too a lot of red, well, some of that red is necessary, but you can remove the tab below and the space above.

Line:15, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf/epl-v10.html -> Extra tab that can be removed

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf/epl-v10.html -> red tab that can be removed

Line:106, lttng/pom.xml -> extra spaces

Line:32, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/ui/tests/Activator.java -> Wrong pluginID

Line:36, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/ui/tests/Activator.java -> Here too

Line:11, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.ui.tests/about.html -> another about.html with extra tab and space above

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> what is that? and x-internal package without internal in the package name? Inacceptable! :p

Those packages are usually just not exported in other junit test plugins

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is it ok that tmf.ui depends on tmf.ctf.core?  tmf.[core|ui] should not depend on those, but for swtbot, I guess it's all right? Just asking

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ctf/core/Activator.java -> Name clash with another plugin we know and love.

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf/feature.properties -> 2014?

Line:10, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core/about.html -> That same file was copy-pasted pretty much everywhere in the project. And the Eclipse text editor not doing any auto-formatting doesn't help...

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf/epl-v10.html -> in fact we don't need to have the license files in feature plugins, since we depend on Eclipse's centralized license feature. No idea how this got in here...

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> it's a test plugin, it's not API in any case.

Yeah many tests plugin don't have the "export all packages" warning enabled. I think they should, it's better to export it and specify which visibility we want, instead of not specifying anything.
