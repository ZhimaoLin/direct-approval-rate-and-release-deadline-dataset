Very very minor white space problem in a text file... but a white space is a white space :p Count my +1 when that is corrected in case I'm gone.

Line:11, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/about.html -> tab above can be removed and the space in the line above

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/AllTests.java -> Will those tests eventually be put back on the tmf.core.tests plugin? If so, either it is done soon before we forget, or else open a bug for it to remind everyone ;-)

Line:3, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf/p2.inf -> oops extra white space

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/AllTests.java -> Good point, I've opened #432960 in case we really want to port them back to TMF. Worst case, we'll just close it WONTFIX if we don't care enough in the future ;)
