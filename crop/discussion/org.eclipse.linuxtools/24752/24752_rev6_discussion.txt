DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split "CTF adaptor" into separate plugins/feature

This allows using TMF without CTF, for more flexibility and
better separation of dependencies.

Surprisingly, the runtime code was quite independant already and
was quite easy to separate. The only problem were the tests. THE
TESTS! Many of them depended on CTF or LTTng traces, especially
the analysis ones. For now, those have been moved to tmf.ctf.core.tests
and tmf.ctf.ui.tests plugins (and disabled), knowing that we should
eventually bring those back into tmf.{core|ui}.tests.
