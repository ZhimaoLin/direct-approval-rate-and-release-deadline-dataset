DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split "CTF adaptor" into separate plugins/feature

This allows using TMF without CTF, for more flexibility and
better separation of dependencies.

Surprisingly, the runtime code was quite independant already and
was quite easy to separate.

Patch Set 7:

I put the analysis unit tests in a separate patch, just so the functionalities are quite clear. I needed 2 trace types to make better coverage so I had to add a second trace class. It was worth its own smaller patch.
