We might want to hook this into an eventual preference. Also, we will have to go over all the views to make sure they honour this setting. Right now, the events list and Histogram view do, but the Control Flow doesn't.

But for now, if we just want to have everything show up in the local time zone (like Babeltrace), this does the job.
