DESCRIPTION

lttng: Fix Resources view event list

With the fix to the event iterator (42acdc2), it is no longer required
to add 'null' events in the zoomed event list for all empty ranges to
hide underlying events in the full range event list. This simplifies the
building of event list in the Resources view.

If required, 'null' events are added at the start or end of the list to
properly identify the time range that the list represents.

Adds an interface to TimeEvent to split an event while keeping it's
class type and value.

Some trace specific fields are moved out of the generic TimeGraphEntry.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

The changes in TimeEvent and TimeGraphEntry break the API (Removal of methods in TimeGraphEntry, and "The super interfaces set has been reduced for type org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.views.callstack.CallStackEvent", whatever that means...)

Time for the luna branch ;)

Patch Set 11:

I don't get any API error in my workspace. TimeGraphEntry is a new class in 2.1 so my changes couldn't break any API. The changes in TimeEvent only add a method, not sure about that reduced super set error.

Can someone else verify this?
