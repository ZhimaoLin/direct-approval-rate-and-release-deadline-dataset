DESCRIPTION

lttng: Fix Resources view event list

With the fix to the event iterator (42acdc2), it is no longer required
to add 'null' events in the zoomed event list for all empty ranges to
hide underlying events in the full range event list. This simplifies the
building of event list in the Resources view.

If required, 'null' events are added at the start or end of the list to
properly identify the time range that the list represents.

Adds an interface to TimeEvent to split an event while keeping it's
class type and value.

Some trace specific fields are moved out of the generic TimeGraphEntry.

Patch Set 10:

Regarding the "simplification", it started out a much simpler patch by removing all null events. But you found the problem at the edges of the zoom range, which required some extra code. So it's really more an "optimization" now because we only potentially add two null events to the list, but discard all the other null states. Hopefully the shorter list means faster handling/drawing.

But also the splitting of events was added, this is a noticeable improvement to the appearance of split events.
