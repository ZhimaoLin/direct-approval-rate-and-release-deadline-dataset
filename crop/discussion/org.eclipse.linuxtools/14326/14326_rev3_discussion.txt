DESCRIPTION

lttng: Fix Resources view event list

With the fix to the event iterator (42acdc2), it is no longer required
to add 'null' events in the zoomed event list to hide underlying events
in the full range event list. This simplifies the building of event list
in the Resources view.

Adds an EventList class to properly handle the full range split events
at the borders of the zoomed event list.

Adds an interface to TimeEvent to split an event while keeping it's
class type and value.

Patch Set 3:

New version more elegantly splits the events at the border of the zoom range, so that they keep their characteristics instead of downgrading to a plain (TRANSPARENT) TimeEvent.
