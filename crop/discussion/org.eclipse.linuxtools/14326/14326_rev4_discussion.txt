DESCRIPTION

lttng: Fix Resources view event list

With the fix to the event iterator (42acdc2), it is no longer required
to add 'null' events in the zoomed event list to hide underlying events
in the full range event list. This simplifies the building of event list
in the Resources view.

Adds an EventList class to properly handle the full range split events
at the borders of the zoomed event list.

Adds an interface to TimeEvent to split an event while keeping it's
class type and value.

Sorry, but I disagree. Good/safe code is more important than avoiding API breaks. "The list should not get modified" is not a solid guarantee, compared to a compile-time check for the right class.

An EventList object containing a List, and exposing it only through a Collections.unmofiableList(), that would be a safe guarantee.

If this has to break the API, then so be it. We have a 3.0 branch exactly for that.

No hard feelings ;)

I'm getting an API error anyway (it says it wants to bump tmf.ui to 3.0). I think it's due to TimeEvent, which is an API class, changing the interface it implements, but I'm not sure...
