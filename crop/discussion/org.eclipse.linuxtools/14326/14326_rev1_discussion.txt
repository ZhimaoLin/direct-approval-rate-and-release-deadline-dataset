DESCRIPTION

lttng: Fix Resources view event list

With the fix to the event iterator (42acdc2), it is no longer required
to add 'null' events in the zoomed event list to hide underlying events
in the full range event list. This simplifies the building of event list
in the Resources view.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Yay code removal!

However this exposes what was probably an existing bug: now if a "zoomed out" time event goes beyond the visible range to the right, it will still show its border when the mouse button is released.

This is easiest to see with the IRQ attributes of a kernel trace.

Patch Set 1:

The EventIterator needs to know the range that was used to collect the zoomed events, in order to properly split the full range events at the border of the zoom range. An EventList class is created for this purpose.
