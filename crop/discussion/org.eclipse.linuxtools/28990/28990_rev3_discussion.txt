DESCRIPTION

RPM: Prevent "RPM" menu item from disappearing.

On some platforms, placing the "RPM" item of the RPM Project
context menu before item additions (with a locationURI ID of 
before=additions) causes it to shift around & disappear when
opening the context menu multiple times. Place it after additions
instead to stop this behaviour.

Change looks fine to me. I'm going to push because the only thing that has changed is the commit message and first patchset succeeded.
