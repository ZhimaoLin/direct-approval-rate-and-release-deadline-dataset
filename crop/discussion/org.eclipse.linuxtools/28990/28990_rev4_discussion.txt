DESCRIPTION

RPM: Prevent "RPM" menu item from disappearing.

On some platforms, placing the "RPM" item of the RPM Project
context menu before item additions (with a locationURI ID of 
before=additions) causes it to shift around & disappear when
opening the context menu multiple times. Place it after additions
instead to stop this behaviour.
