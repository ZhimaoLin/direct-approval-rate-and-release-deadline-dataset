DESCRIPTION

Bug 447554 - gcov not handling linked files

- Fix number of runs counter to come from program summary
  instead of object summary as that has been obsoleted
- Fix logic to handle case where we end up with an IFileEditorInput
  and we want an IFileStore (don't return null and end up
  using a source-not-found editor)
- Add a method to get all projects we are tracking for gcov
- Add a visitor class to search a project for a linked-in
  resource we are trying to open from the gcov view

This looks fine to me, with just a few changes to be made :

- Extraneous whitespace in every file
- Old Code that can probably be removed rather than uncommented
- toArray usage

Line:134, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/view/annotatedsource/GcovAnnotationModelTracker.java -> I believe this can become 'return trackedProjects.keySet().toArray(new IProject[0])' . If the array passed in is not large enough, a new one will be created of the proper type to store the Set's content, so the size calculation isn't needed.

Line:135, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/view/annotatedsource/GcovAnnotationModel.java -> I think this can probably be removed.
