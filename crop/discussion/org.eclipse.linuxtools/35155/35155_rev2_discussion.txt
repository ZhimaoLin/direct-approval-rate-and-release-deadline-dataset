DESCRIPTION

Bug 447554 - gcov not handling linked files

- Fix number of runs counter to come from program summary
  instead of object summary as that has been obsoleted
- Fix logic to handle case where we end up with an IFileEditorInput
  and we want an IFileStore (don't return null and end up
  using a source-not-found editor)
- Add a method to get all projects we are tracking for gcov
- Add a visitor class to search a project for a linked-in
  resource we are trying to open from the gcov view

This looks fine to me. Just waiting for the result of the hudson test run, and we can push to master.

Marking as approved (Patch Set 2 changes some style-related things but runtime behaviour should be the same ).
