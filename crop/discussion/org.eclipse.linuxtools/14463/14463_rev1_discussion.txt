Good, this now shows properties of all trace elements, event those under experiments.

However, one thing that would be nice is to make sure the "Trace properties" sub-tree is always expanded by default. Right now it will be expanded if you go from an element with no properties to one with properties, but as you keep clicking on elements with properties, the tree is collapsed.

I see this even without this patch. I think it could be address in it's own review/bug.

Line:426, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Maybe you could use endsWith instead of matches? Then you wouldn't need that string.
