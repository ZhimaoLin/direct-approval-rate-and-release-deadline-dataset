DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update the suspend and resume handling of requests

The new implementation handles the event before suspending the thread
requested by the request executor. In the previous implementation the
thread is suspended before handleData() which causes unnecessary
handling of data if the request is canceled during the time the
thread is suspended.
