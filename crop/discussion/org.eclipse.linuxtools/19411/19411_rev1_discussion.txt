DESCRIPTION

ctf: Some little refactoring in the ctf lexer.

Mostly only moving rules aroung to ease the reading.

The rule to match c++-like comment do not need to
take care of '\r'. It's a caractere like the others,
and the comment will be tuncante to the '\n'.

lgtm.

Line:82, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.parser/src/main/antlr3/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/parser/CTFLexer.g -> I moved those rules above the integer literals
(which is common in grammars).
But, if you look below, it is not the case for the rest of the file.

fragments should always above or below.

Choose one layout and apply it to the file.
Any of them is fine with me.
