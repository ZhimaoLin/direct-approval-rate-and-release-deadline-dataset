DESCRIPTION

Bug 470577 - Docker Explorer does not show the latest image id after an image build

Refactored the method in the IDockerContainerListener and IDockerImageListener
to avoid erasure collision. This allows for a simpler "Refresher" inner-class
in the DockerExplorerView which refreshes the part of the treeviewer that
is concerned with the container or image change.
Also, the DockerExplorerView is properly registered as a listener.
