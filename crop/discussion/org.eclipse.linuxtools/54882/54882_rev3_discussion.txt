I haven't fully tested this out to see if it solves the issue, but the code looks fine to me and should resolve things.

I don't see this patch as changing the behaviour. If I search for the image so that it's the only one listed, and then proceed to update it by doing a build, the entry is not updated until I do a sort. This patch doesn't seem to change anything for me.

Adding Arianna Johns in case he's able to reproduce something different.

Arianna Johns pointed out this is mainly fixing the Explorer view and it does fix the refresh, so aproving.
