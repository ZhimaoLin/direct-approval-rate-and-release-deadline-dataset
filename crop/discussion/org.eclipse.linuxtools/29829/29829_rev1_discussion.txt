DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make TimeGraphEntry implementation less restrictive

A TimeGraphEntry's parent and children no longer have to be instances
of TimeGraphEntry. They can now be any type of ITimeGraphEntry.

The method addChild(int, ITimeGraphEntry) is added to insert a child at
any position.

Line:847, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Do we need an instanceof?

Line:220, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> something odd here

Line:847, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Not really, ThreadEntry is a private class and the only children added are CallStackEntry at line 829 above.

Line:220, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> I can't remove it now without breaking API.

Line:220, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> The thing is, we don't want users of the method to get a deprecated method warning because the fix is to keep their code as-is (we don't want to force them to cast to ITimeGraphEntry).
