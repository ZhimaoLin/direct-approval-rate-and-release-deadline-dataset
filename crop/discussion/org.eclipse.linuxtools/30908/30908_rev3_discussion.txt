DESCRIPTION

tests: In some tests check g++ is present or fail nicely

Some tests relies in g++ and any fail due its lack is not obvious.
Add assumeCpp() method in setup of any test that requires g++,
 it will throw a friendly message in failure case.

Patch Set 3:

While I agree with the approach in general there is one small problem with efficiency of the implementation - this assumption should be in method annotated with BeforeClass so it's executed only once for all the tests methods in the class instead of before running every test method (current implementation having them in method annotated with Before).
