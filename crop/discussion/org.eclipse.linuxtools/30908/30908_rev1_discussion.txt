DESCRIPTION

Add assumeCpp() method in setup of any test that requires g++,
 it will throw a friendly message in failure case.

Patch Set 1:

Hi Alexander,

The system lacks g++ which is a requirement for some testcases, that's why my patch come into place.

Something seems incorrect with build environment because all tests pass although it lacks on g++.

I've compared with another job (https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-gerrit/8040/console) and there are test cases failures not being reported. Take a look at Cachegrind tests, for instance, the error message indicate lack of valgrind into the system but all tests pass anyway.
