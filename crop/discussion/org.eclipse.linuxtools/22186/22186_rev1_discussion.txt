DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use public implementation of IElementFilter

Commit c4914576 (re?)introduced the use of IElementFilter, but it
imported the 'internal' version, which required a SuppressWarnings,
but also added a Deprecated warning somewhere.

The specific use of the internal version is not commented anywhere,
so I assume this was a misclick on the import pop-up?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

The non-internal IElementFilter was introduced in Luna only. Changing it breaks compatibility with Kepler.

Marc-Andre is right. We need to keep the reference to the internal API for a while. Please abandon this patch

Oh, so this was for Kepler compatibility after all, not a misclick.
