DESCRIPTION

Refactor launch provider to allow other plug-ins to extend its functionality.

This plug-in is a refactoring of the current snapshot launch provider
plug-in, removing all harcoded references of a specific profiling type
and replacing them with abstract getters. This allows for launch provider
plug-ins to extend the existing functionality and set their specific
profiling types.

Patch Set 3: (2 inline comments)

Just some minor things to address.

Line:32, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/AbstractProviderPreferencesPage.java -> This should be 'public static final'.

Line:14, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/ProviderPreferencesPage.java -> I wonder if it's possible to just remove this class, bringing its methods into the abstract class, and have the profiling type-specific preference pages extend the abstract class.
