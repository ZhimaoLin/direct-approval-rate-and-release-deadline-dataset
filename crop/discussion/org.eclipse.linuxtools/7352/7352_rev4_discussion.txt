DESCRIPTION

Refactor launch provider to allow other plug-ins to extend its functionality.

This plug-in is a refactoring of the current snapshot launch provider
plug-in, removing all harcoded references of a specific profiling type
and replacing them with abstract getters. This allows for launch provider
plug-ins to extend the existing functionality and set their specific
profiling types.
