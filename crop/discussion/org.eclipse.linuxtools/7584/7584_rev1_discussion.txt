Patch Set 1: Fails

(3 inline comments)

Minor comments.

Also when I try to use it (connecting to localhost which has LTTng git head from the daily PPA), I can connect but get the following error message when trying to create a session.


Command to create session failed

Command failed! Command:  lttng create mysession -o 

/home/alexandre/test

Return Value: 1

Session mysession created.

Traces will be written in /home/alexandre/test

Error: Command error

Nothing shows up in the Sessions tree in the Control view, but "lttng list" shows the session was actually created. Will try to debug it a bit more.

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ui.tests/testfiles/LTTngServiceTest.cfg -> 2.1's codename is "Basse Messe" ;)

Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/ui/views/control/messages/messages.properties -> Should we have a Major Version and Minor Version variables? Or is it not worth it at this point?

It works now! Apparently one must not use "localhost" for the address, but 127.0.0.1, to make sure RSE uses the SSH backend.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ui.tests/testfiles/LTTngServiceTest.cfg -> I'll change it to be consistent. The name itself is not used in the Eclipse Tracer Control, though.

Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/ui/views/control/messages/messages.properties -> This is for displaying the version of the remote target in the Properties View. No need to separate minor and major here.
