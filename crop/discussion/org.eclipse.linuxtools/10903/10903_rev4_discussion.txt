DESCRIPTION

Do not run report, record or annotate when running perf stat

The perf stat functionality does not depend on perf report/record/
annotate, so there's no need to run these. To reflect this change
options not related to perf stats are disabled accordingly.

(2 inline comments)

Just some small fixes. Looks fine overall.

Line:319, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfOptionsTab.java -> This should be merged with the conditional in chkShowStat's selection listener.

Line:165, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> title can be declared on this line as well.
