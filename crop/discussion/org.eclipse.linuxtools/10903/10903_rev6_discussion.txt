DESCRIPTION

Support events selection for perf stat.

* Added events field to StatData.
* Added test for events parsing.
* The perf stat functionality does not depend on perf report/record/
  annotate, so there's no need to run these during a stat run.
* Disable options not related to perf stat accordingly.
