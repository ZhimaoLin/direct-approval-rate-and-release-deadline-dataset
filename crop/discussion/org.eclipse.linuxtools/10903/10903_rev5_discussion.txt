DESCRIPTION

Do not run report, record or annotate when running perf stat

The perf stat functionality does not depend on perf report/record/
annotate, so there's no need to run these. To reflect this change
options not related to perf stats are disabled accordingly.

Line:301, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfOptionsTab.java -> are the statRunCount.setEnabled(*) required ? They'll be set in handleShowStatSelection anyways based on the value of chkcShowStat.getSelection().
