DESCRIPTION

Support events selection for perf stat.

* Added events field to StatData.
* Added test for events parsing.
* The perf stat functionality does not depend on perf report/record/
  annotate, so there's no need to run these during a stat run.
* Disable options not related to perf stat accordingly.

Just an issue in the delegate.

Line:90, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> We could avoid this if/else by checking if the return is null, and setting it to an empty array. StatData can handle an empty array the same as a null list. In the future maybe we should consider having the default value be an empty list rather than null.

Line:90, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> Without this check we would always be gathering the selected events, since these are available form the configuration even when "Default Event" is selected.

Line:90, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> Just a clarification; when "Default Event" is selected, the default "perf stat -r <count> <prog>" command is used.
