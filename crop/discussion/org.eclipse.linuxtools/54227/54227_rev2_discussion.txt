DESCRIPTION

Bug 475465 - NPE when image contains in tag in the Search dialog

Fixing the case where no value was put in the queue if a server
error occurred, which resulted in UI blocked for 10s (until
timeout) and then an NPE.
Added databinding validation support to validate the given
search term against a regex (as found in the CLI help)
