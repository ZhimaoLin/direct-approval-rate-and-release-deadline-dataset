DESCRIPTION

Bug 475465 - NPE when image contains in tag in the Search dialog

Fixing the case where no value was put in the queue if a server
error occurred, which resulted in UI blocked for 10s (until
timeout) and then an NPE.
Added databinding validation support to validate the given
search term against a regex (as found in the CLI help)

The change itself looks fine, but the regular expression should be a little more permissive.

Line:364, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/ImageSearchPage.java -> You're right about the search expression, but I think this should be just "[a-z0-9-_.]+"

For example, "_apache" doesn't match your expression, but it is a valid search term.

Changing to approved since it would seem newer versions of docker-client support a more restrictive regular expression. This should probably be used instead.
