I confirm that on my performance test branch which didn't build in maven because or missing org.eclipse.test.performance dependency (though it is in the target), it now works with this patch.

I rebuilt the releng, as you instructed on the linuxtools mailing list. Is that a one-time operation or do we have to rebuild each time we modify the target file?

-1 until you have a OK on the mailing list

It should need to be rebuilt every time it gets modified but that's not very often.

Also, is this project automatically built on Hudson each time? Or will it require a manual operation by someone when it is modified?

Line:2, releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.target/linuxtools-e4.4.target -> What is this file? Do we have to keep it up to date when we add a dependency for instance in the org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.target target files?

Line:2, releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.target/linuxtools-e4.4.target -> Yes. That's the target file for ALL of Linux Tools, that's the one used in the build. We could decide whether or not to keep the lttng ones. But I would tend to keep them as their are smaller and also still support older Eclipse versions. What do you think?

Sorry I missed this. On Hudson it will be built every time since it builds the whole Linux Tools repo. Only if you want to build a specific submodule (/lttng only for example) then you need to build the target module first. This behaves a bit like the license feature we had to build first a while ago when we only wanted to build /lttng

I'm ok with this.  I would like Alex to look at this and get his comments as well.

Patch Set 3:

Do I understand correctly, that we only can build for Luna target from now on? I don't know if it is necessary to build for older targets (kepler), though.

That's correct. Some parts on Linux tools don't build with Kepler anymore. We can add another .target file for Kepler but it won't work for all modules.

Kepler builds use the stable-2.2 branch.  We will eventually need to add a mars target file.

You need to update the README file under lttng/ to match the new build procedure.
