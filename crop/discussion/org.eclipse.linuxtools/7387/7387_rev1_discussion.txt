Patch Set 1:

We should change all Java files that have other encoding types than the default to the default to fix that issue once for all. However, be aware of all the merge conflicts people might have to solve.

Patch Set 1:

Agreed. But as I discussed with Patrick yesterday, maybe we should wait until we merge lttng-kepler back into master before re-writing all existing files, since this will completely break merge compatibility.

Until then, these settings will make sure are new files are created with the right encoding.
