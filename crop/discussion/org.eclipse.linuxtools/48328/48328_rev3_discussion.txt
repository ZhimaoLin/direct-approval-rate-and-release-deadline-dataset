DESCRIPTION

rpm: adjust handler enablement.

* Handlers of RPM commands that make changes to a spec file are now
only active in a spec file editor context.

* Adjust the commands themselves so that they do not throw a
ClassCastException when an unexpected editor type is active.

* Update changelog's FormatChangeLogAction to match the code style
of the adjusted RPM commands.

* In rpm.core, create a plugin definition for RPM file selections
and use it to condense various plugin.xml files in RPM projects.

Resolves auto-reported problem 54f3491ce4b0eb19d1a17116.
