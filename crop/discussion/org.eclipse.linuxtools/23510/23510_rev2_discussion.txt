genevieve, thanks for the surprise review, 
yes, a is included in b and b is included in a means a is equal to b. 

I prefeed to split it into two tests so we could see easier what went wrong.

I did say I was going to help sherriffing this sprint :p But you guys are too fast! Patches merged before I even look at them!

You still have a typo in the method name

Line:68, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/AbstractPerspectiveChecker.java -> "checks if all the views specified in the list are present in the perspective" would be clearer

Line:71, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/AbstractPerspectiveChecker.java -> testPerspeciveForViews -> testPerspectiveForViews
