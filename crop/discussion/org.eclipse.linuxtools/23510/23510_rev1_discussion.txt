Some nits. Also, is that the mathematical concept of coherent and complete (A included in B, B included in A). My math is really far away.

Line:32, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/AbstractPerspectiveChecker.java -> extra line :p

Line:56, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/AbstractPerspectiveChecker.java -> Here you check that all the views in the list are present in the perspective. 

Mathematically, viewIds included in perspective.

Line:64, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/AbstractPerspectiveChecker.java -> yes, let's all test perspecive. Below too

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/AbstractPerspectiveChecker.java -> And here you check that all the views in the perspective are in the list of views, right? 

Mathematically perspective views included in viewIds.
