DESCRIPTION

Bug 483680 - [docker image search] search results ignore repo when searching for repo/imagename

the searchImages method in the DockerConnection class filters the results
  returned by the client to only retain those that contain the exact term
  given by the user. So if the user input "jboss/wildfly", only this image
  will appear in the result list, but if the user input "wildfly", more
  results (25 at the time of writing this message) will be displayed in
  the list.

Refactored the unit test to avoid code duplication.

Line:819, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> I doubt you'll have 'jboss/wildfly' in the description, and I'm not sure it makes sense to check that. AFAIK, the search only applies on the image name.
