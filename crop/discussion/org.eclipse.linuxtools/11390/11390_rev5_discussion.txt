Patch Set 5:

I rearranged the buttons, and I added the uncheck subtree button so it doesn't look too retarded, even though "uncheck subtree" and "uncheck selected" have the same behaviour.

Patch Set 5:

"Uncheck sub-tree" should also uncheck its parents, recursively, but only if they have no child selected at that point.
