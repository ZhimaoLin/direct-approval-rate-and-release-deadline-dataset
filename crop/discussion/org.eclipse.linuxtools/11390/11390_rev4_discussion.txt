Patch Set 4:

Works well! Thanks for implementing this!

I originally imagined a right-click menu option, but tbh I think I prefer buttons now (as long as we don't get to 40 of them...) They are also touch-screen friendly! ;)

Would it be worth adding a "Uncheck tree" option too? For completion's sake, since we would then have a nice 2x3 button matrix.

Also, I would then swap the order of the columns, to not have "check all" in the middle. Maybe

  Check Selected  Check Sub-tree  Check All
  Uncheck ....

so we go from specific to general?

Patch Set 4:

I also thought of an "Uncheck subtree" button, but it is the same thing as just unchecking an item by clicking on its checkbox. We can add it I don't mind.

Good point for the button ordering.
