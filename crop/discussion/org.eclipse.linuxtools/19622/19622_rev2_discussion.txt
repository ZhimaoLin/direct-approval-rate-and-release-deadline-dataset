Patch Set 2:

If we have a get() which returns an immutable collection, then we don't need the lookup() method anymore, do we?

Patch Set 2:

It's always a choice of what you want to expose.
Do you want to expose the "mapping" (the data-structure) or the access to an environment.

What is the use case of an environment?

The use of an unmodified collection is the gray zone between the two others choices.

I'm not against in this case. But, it's a really well spread bad design in many of your classes to expose the raw data-structure. This tie the implementation and doesn't let the code evoluate. API should expose only what is needed, and be well defined. (No duck-tape).
