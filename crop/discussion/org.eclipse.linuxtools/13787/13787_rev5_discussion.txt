DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Add the possibility to define experiment types

* Added the element experiment to the org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetype
  extension point to declare experiment types, using the same handler and
  contribution items.
* Experiment elements are now instantiated with the given trace type.
* Copied class TmfWithFolderElement to TmfCommonProjectElement since this base
  class does more than just managing folder.  TmfWithFolderElement has been
  deprecated.
* Consolidation of code for opening traces and experiments in the
  TmfOpenTraceHelper class.

General comments:

For experiments that don't have an experiment type associated with should have the generic experiment type set automatically. This will make the upgrade for users that have already experiments defined in their workspace seamless.

In the batch import wizard the experiment types are shown in the list of available trace types. This needs to be removed.

After a restart while having an generic experiment open the error "Invalid IEditorInput" for this experiment is caused. Because of the error the Events Table is not created.

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> Update change log

Line:134, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/schema/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetype.exsd -> please remove trailing spaces

Line:140, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/schema/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetype.exsd -> We need to have an example for each element to be able to test. For the statisticsViewerType, I think we need to update the handling of experiments in TmfStatisticsView.

Line:104, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> We should use TmfTraceType class for handling and caching the trace types.

I know that TmfTraceElement does the same, because it had the initial implementation. TmfTraceType was enhanced when introducing the batch import. However, during the batch import implementation no clean up of TmfTraceElement class had been done. The clean-up is one of our tasks. I should write a bug about it to not forget.

Line:255, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> The header description is not correct. The method returns a TmfExperiment and not a ITmfTrace. Also the object is created based on the experiment type.

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/wizards/NewExperimentDialog.java -> should be called DEFAULT_EXPERIMENT_TYPE

Line:200, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/wizards/NewExperimentDialog.java -> default experiment type

Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> For experiments that don't have an experiment type associated with should have the generic experiment type set automatically. This will make the upgrade for users that have already experiments seamless.

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> I think the change should be part of Luna and not Kepler because it's a major feature addition and it won't be used soon. So, for Luna you can finalize this class and don't need to supress the warnings  for deprecation.

Line:267, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> For an experiment it should use experiment error messages than trace error messages (e.g. Messages.TmfOpenTraceHelper_ErrorOpeningExperiment).

Line:302, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> For an experiment it should use experiment error messages than trace error messages (e.g. Messages.TmfOpenTraceHelper_ErrorOpeningExperiment).
