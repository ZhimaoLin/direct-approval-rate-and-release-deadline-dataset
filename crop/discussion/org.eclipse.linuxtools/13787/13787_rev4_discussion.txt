DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Add the possibility to define experiment types

* Added the element experiment to the org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetype
  extension point to declare experiment types, using the same handler and
  contribution items.
* Experiment elements are now instantiated with the given trace type.
* Copied class TmfWithFolderElement to TmfCommonProjectElement since this base
  class does more than just managing folder.  TmfWithFolderElement has been
  deprecated.
