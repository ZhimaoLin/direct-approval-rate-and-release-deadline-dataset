DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Add the possibility to define experiment types

Added the parameter is_experiment to elements type and category of the
org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetype extension point.
Experiment elements are now instantiated with the given trace type.
Copied class TmfWithFolderElement to TmfCommonProjectElement since this base
class does more than just managing folder.  TmfWithFolderElement has been
deprecated.
