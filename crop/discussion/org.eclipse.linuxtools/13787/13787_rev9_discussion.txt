DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Add the experiment type to the trace type extension point

This will allow to define experiment types using the same extension point as
the trace type, so the same handlers and contribution items can be used.

Patch Set 9:

Hi Genevieve

after your rebase and before submitting a new version please verify if my comment of Sep 11 8:25 AM is addressed.

"For experiments that don't have an experiment type associated with should have the generic experiment type set automatically. This will make the upgrade for users that have already experiments defined in their workspace seamless."

Thanks
Meredith Scott
