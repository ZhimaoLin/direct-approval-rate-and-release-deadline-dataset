Patch Set 3:

Both Patch Set 2, and 3 builds were hanging on org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests.AllTmfCoreTests it seems., and were executing for much longer than the ~30min build average. Could this change be introducing that ?

Patch Set 3:

I can reproduce the hang locally (which is weird, it doesn't seem to happen in Eclipse, only with Maven). I'll try to find out the culprit, and at least add a xxx@xxx.xxx for now so it doesn't hang.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

When run with the custom Suite from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/18464/ , I found out it's TmfTraceTest#testGetModulesByClass that's hanging. I'll push a new version of the preceding patch, and add xxx@xxx.xxx to that class at the same time. Then we can debug this one.
