Patch Set 2:

Hmmm You know what, this would require removing the dependency of the kernel analysis module and state provider to the LttngKernelTrace, which is a good thing since the appliesToTraceType and the canExecute method should take care of telling whether the analysis can be run on a trace and if a custom XML trace can run the analysis, for instance, why not!

But that widens the scope of this patch, so either I push this and do the lttng2.kernel.core.test and all the rest in another patch, or require you or someone else to do a whole new review of this patch for something that may cause some discussions... what do you think?
