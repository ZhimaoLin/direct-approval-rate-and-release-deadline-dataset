DESCRIPTION

Remove Valgrind remote functionality that used RSE.

Valgrind has been using the Remote Proxy solution for some time so the
functionality that had a strict dependence on RSE can be removed.
This involves the removal of o.e.linuxtools.valgrind.launch.remote.

I don't think the functionality in this bundle is being used anywhere else, and as long as the proxy solution is in place, we can remove this code.
