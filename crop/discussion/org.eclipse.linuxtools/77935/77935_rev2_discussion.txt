DESCRIPTION

Bug 459549 - GCov plugin incorrect reports

- fix GcnoFunction.solveGraphFnctn for Windows MinGW compiler
- logic adds totals to block from entryArcs or exitArcs depending on
  whether numPreds or numSuccs is 0, but on Windows, a closing
  brace can end up with both being 0 and so cannot use if/else if/else
  logic clause since following the first 0 can end up with 0 total
