DESCRIPTION

tmf: Enable "Potentially static methods" warning

This will warn for public/protected methods that do not use any
class field, thus could be marked as static. This allowed finding
many utility classes that were offering instances when they didn't
need to (everything was static already).

Sometimes however, you may want to allow sub-implementations to
override a method whose default implementation is "return null" or
something of the like. For these cases, you have to suppress the
warning.
