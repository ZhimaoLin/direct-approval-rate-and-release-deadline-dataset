The idea behind this is good, but it seems to confuse the state system a bit: now if I open a kernel trace I get "Unknown" states in the Control Flow view, from the beginning of the trace until the first real state change.

This is actually better than expected. It will not work well unless there is a state dump though. maybe there should be a contingency for that case?
