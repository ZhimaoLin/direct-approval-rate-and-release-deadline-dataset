Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I'm not sure I fully understand the intent of the "fix". Is the reasoning that all ArrayDefinitions are like instances of the same ArrayDeclaration so isString will return the same value for all ArrayDefinitions of this ArrayDeclaration so might as well move the method to the ArrayDeclaration? Can you add a line in the commit message to summarize?
