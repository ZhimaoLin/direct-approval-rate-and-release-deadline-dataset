Patch Set 3:

This introduces warnings in the tests (because the tests plugins now honor the @Nullable annotations. Which is not a bad thing, but makes it slightly more annoying to use because the fixtures are not final because they are set in xxx@xxx.xxx and not a constructor etc etc zzZZZZ....)

A small rework of the TestTrace classes would fix it, but it could go in another patch.
