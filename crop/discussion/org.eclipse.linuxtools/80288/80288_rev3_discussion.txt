DESCRIPTION

Bug 499843 - Pull Image wizard pulls all images if tag is not specified

Adding the ":latest" tag to the image name if it was missing.
Refactored the ImageNameValidator class to provide a utility
method that can be called out of the validation context
Renamed the ImagePullPatternTest to ImageNameValidatorTest
since the class under test is ImageNameValidator
