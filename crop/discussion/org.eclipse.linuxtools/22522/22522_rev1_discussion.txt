DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add a view for the CPU usage analysis

This view contains a tree viewer to show all threads spending time on the CPU
in the time range, and an XY chart viewer to display the total CPU of all
threads and the CPU usage of the currently selected from the tree viewer.

Very interesting!
I'm just doing the same thing for power consumption over Kalray traces.

Patch Set 1:

Hi Genevieve,

Just for info, I try to generalize this approach:
- move the view in org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui
- create an extention point for "graphical analysis"
- implement this extension point for CPU usage in org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui
- plus this extension point in the view

Therefore, the framework will be available for any kind of graphic (CPU load, but also power consumption, number of context-switch per core, ...)

My objective is to sumbit a patch in the coming hours.
