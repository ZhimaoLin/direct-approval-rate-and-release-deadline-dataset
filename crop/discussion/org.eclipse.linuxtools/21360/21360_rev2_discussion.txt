Patch Set 2:

Good initiative! There's probably quite a lot more stuff to be moved to core to fully support a headless command line, but that's a good start. Every step gets us closer and no need to wait for all pieces to be available to accept them!

I haven't taken a close look at it though, will do on monday unless you merge it before then ;-) 

And I see the move of the tracetype extension point is really close behind, so my only potential objection does not stand.

This small comment.

Also are there any unit tests actually in UI that would be worth moving to core with this move?

Otherwise it's copy pasted code so nothing that wasn't there before (multicatch :p)

And I think the best approach for this would have been to deprecate the stuff in UI and add the code in core, but it doesn't make a big difference I guess.

Line:111, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> The selectTraceType method could probably get the TmfTraceType.getInstance() directly, that would avoid the tt variable at the caller and changing the signature of the method.
