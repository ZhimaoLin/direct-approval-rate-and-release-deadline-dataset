> Definitely! But that's for separate changes, this patch here is already big enough ;)

Of course, but having those unit tests separate as well would allow to make sure nothing is missing in the core to make it work. It looks ok, but maybe only because everything is used only in UI...

By the way, I'll hate you with all my heart when I'll have to rebase (yet again) the experiment types :p But I'll love you when time comes for a headless TMF. So all in all, nature is at a equilibrium.

Patch Set 4:

This patch shouldn't be too intrusive. The BIG one coming up is splitting the extension point in two. That will have all sorts of repercussions everywhere...
