DESCRIPTION

Perf: Add stat diff view toolbar actions to switch between old/new/diff data.

* Introduce PerfDataFile class to encapsulate file-to-string logic.
* Introduce BaseDataManipulator to reuse existing functionality.
	- Refactor handlers to use this base class where useful.
* Allow access to inspect/replace contents of stat-diff views.
* Store old/new data of specific stat comparisons in temp files.
* Add test cases.
