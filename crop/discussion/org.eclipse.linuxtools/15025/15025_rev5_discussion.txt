Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Not -1'ing on the code, but as per the previous comment:
Please give some example in bug 408747 of how it can be useful. Maybe code snippets, showing that it takes less code than with .unboxInt() to do the same thing.

Abandoned

The same thing can now be accomplished by using .unboxLong() on both Int and Long state values.
