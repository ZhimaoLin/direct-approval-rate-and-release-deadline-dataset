Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

This change looks fine to me and has been verified. Needed to make some additional changes to not break the API. Furthermore, I've actually been using an initial version of this patch in Fedora ( http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/eclipse-linuxtools.git/diff/docker-client-3.0.0.patch?id=691c4fa0f7d903623d0d52190892cd1640846385 ) which I can now push here.
