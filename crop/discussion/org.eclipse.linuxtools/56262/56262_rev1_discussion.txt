Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

We could push this for master as-is and continue improving the functionality, or I could add to this.

Currently missing :
- Extension point framework to support more than just 'Docker Machine'
- Only supports creating a single connection, which makes sense in the context of the New Connection Wizard, but I did say it might be nice to create > 1 . Still, adding this is a good first step.
