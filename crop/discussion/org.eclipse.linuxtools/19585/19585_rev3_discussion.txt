DESCRIPTION

ctf: tiny code refactoring in the metadata.

This pathch-set is a tiny cleanup before more refactoring.

The metadata are data and the "parsing/decoding/../" and
any actions on those data should be isolated in "internals"
and only accessors exposed to the user should be visible.

Patches to come soon.
