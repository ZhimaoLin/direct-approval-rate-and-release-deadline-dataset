DESCRIPTION

ctf: tiny code refactoring in the metadata.

This pathch-set is a tiny cleanup before more refactoring.

The metadata are data and the "parsing/decoding/../" and
any actions on those data should be isolated in "internals"
and only accessors exposed to the user should be visible.

Patches to come soon.

One small comment, rest looks good.

If we change the assert to an exception, +1 from me.

Line:296, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/Metadata.java -> Don't use "assert", it's not really useful (they only run if the JVM is started with -ea). If nbBytesRead != HEADER_SIZE then it could throw a CTFReaderException.

done.
PTAL.

Line:296, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/Metadata.java -> It was a code deplacement.
But, for +2 karma points, I did the requested refactoring.
