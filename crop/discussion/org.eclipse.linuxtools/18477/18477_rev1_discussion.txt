Patch Set 1:

Is this meant to be merged into the repo or is it just to help troubleshooting the state system analysis patch?

Patch Set 1:

No, I meant just as a temporary measure to try to debug the other patches.

However... this output turns out to be quite useful. Any reason we wouldn't want this in the log for all tests?

Patch Set 1:

IMO, it would create unnecessary noise when running the tests from inside Eclipse and other useful messages might go unnoticed. I like it as an option. But we can discuss this further.

Abandoned

This was just to demo how to use the DebugSuite. No intention of merging this.
