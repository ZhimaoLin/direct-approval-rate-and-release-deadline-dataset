Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

Looks good, but couldn't the same thing have been achieved by modifying setTimeGraphProvider so that it rebuilds the color map when it receives a new provider (or the same one but with modified color map)?

Difference is the owner of the provider would have to trigger the change instead of the provider itself.

Both alternatives will do the job anyways ;)
