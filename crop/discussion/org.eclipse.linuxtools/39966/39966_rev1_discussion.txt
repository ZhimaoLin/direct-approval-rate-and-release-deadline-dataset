DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Improve no-stap errors; allow projectless processes.

Using Systemtap IDE without stap installed causes too many error dialogs to appear.
Simplify/streamline the kinds of error dialogs that are shown when stap is missing.

Also allow RuntimeProcessFactory to launch processes that don't have a host project,
which is required for the above error dialog improvements.
