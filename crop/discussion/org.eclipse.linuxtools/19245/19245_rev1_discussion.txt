DESCRIPTION

ctf: Remove unused equals method in StructDeclaration.

This implementation is not efficient, and I think it is not used anywhere.
There is no other "Declaration" with an "equals" method.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Without this, two struct's with exactly the same content will not .equals() each other anymore, which I think is quite important...

see the unit test failing:
xxx@xxx.xxx
 public void testEquals4(){
     e1 = EventDeclaration.getLostEventDeclaration();
     e2 = EventDeclaration.getLostEventDeclaration();   
     assertEquals(e1,e2);
 }

Also, if a class re-implements hashCode(), it should also implement equals(), and vice-versa.

So we should probably kill HashCode here.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

EventDeclaration does have a equals() method. But it's indeed weird that the other compound types (enum, variant,...) do not.

If you wish to pursue this, please repush it to the master branch.
