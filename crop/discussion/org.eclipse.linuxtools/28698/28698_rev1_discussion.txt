Already done in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/26084/ (which was part of a chain, which introduced xxx@xxx.xxx in the other class. But that patch is taking longer to go through review.)

Useful in any case, if you want to push it go ahead, whichever gets in first ;)

I should have known you wouldn't have let such low hanging warning removal go unsolved. But I'll push it, to get those out of the way.
