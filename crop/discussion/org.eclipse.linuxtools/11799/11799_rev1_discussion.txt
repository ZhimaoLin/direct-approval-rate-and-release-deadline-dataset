Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Overall, this change looks fine to me. Do we have any swtbot tests that need to be update with the new structure changes ?

Also, there is still a reference to %page.name used in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/plugin.xml . This should be updated to the new name.

I wouldn't mind hearing other people's thoughts as well.

Change looks good to me as well. However, o.e.l.profiling.provider.tests.PreferencesTest needs to be updated to include this change.

Patch Set 1:

One change I'd propose is to rename "Profiling Categories" to "Categories" since the page now under the "Profiling". This would also affect the tests mentioned in my previous comment.
