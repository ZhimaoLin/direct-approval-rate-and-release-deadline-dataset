DESCRIPTION

lttng: Support live updating of Control Flow view and Resources view

- Update AbstractTimeGraphView to use a list as input element and to
support a time graph content provider.

- Update AbstractTimeGraphView to create one separate BuildThread per
trace in the trace set. Change buildEventList method to be called
independently for each trace in the trace set.

- Update AbstractTimeGraphView to use a CopyOnWriteArrayList for the
entry list of each trace, and stop exposing the entry list map to
subclasses. Add interface to add or remove a list of entries to/from the
entry list of a trace.

- Update AbstractTimeGraphView refresh method to refresh the time graph
combo or time graph viewer when possible and avoid calling setInput,
which resets all tree elements.

- Update AbstractTimeGraphView to perform packing of tree columns only
once.

- Add support in TimeGraphEntry to update the end time and to replace
the last event with an event starting at the same time.

- Fix TmfEventsEditor sending TmfTraceClosed with null trace.

- Update ControlFlowView and ResourcesView to build the event list for a
trace continuously in a loop until its state system build is complete.
Support continuous updating of the entry list and its tree structure,
and partial updating of the event list at each iteration.
