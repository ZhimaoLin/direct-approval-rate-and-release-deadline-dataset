I haven't noticed anything weird with GTK 3.10.8 (other than the huge memory leaks...) What version of GTK shows problems?

I don't have the handy, but it's the one that comes with our Ubuntu 12.04 installation. There seems to be an issue with dialogs containing trees. The initial window size is too big. This patch seems to work around the problem. For others like the custom parser wizards it's unfortunately not that simple.

Alexandre, I have seen this with 3.10.8 too but it's less frequent. Usually it appears after I resize the Control view a bunch.
