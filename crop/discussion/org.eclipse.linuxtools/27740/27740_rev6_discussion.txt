Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

This patch adds an Activator, but there is already one in this plugin, referenced by the Manifest. To minimize the changes introduced with this patch, for now the code should refer to the exisintign UI Activator.

Also, the new plugins are not exported (and hidden from other plugins) in the Manifest.
