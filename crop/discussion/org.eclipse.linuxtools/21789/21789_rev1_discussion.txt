DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move the Statistics tests to use the analysis module

This required using reflection to call the method from
TmfStatisticsModule, since that one lives in tmf.ui and this is
a core test. However, this is only temporary, as it's planned to
move all the analysis modules to core plugins whenever it becomes
possible.

Also, the TmfLostEventsStatisticsTest was not even run by default,
let's enable it!
