Patch Set 4:

please attach a test trace to validate this. 
On a design front, are you sure we want a tree style field instead of a flat array with longer keys?

Matthew, did you get the trace from Simon?

As for tree style vs flat array, I think if the eventField already supports tree style, it should stay that way, because it is tree style in Ctf itself and flat array wouldn't provide more usability/readability.

Looks good. I like the output in the events view.
