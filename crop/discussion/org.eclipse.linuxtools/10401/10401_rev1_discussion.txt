Looks good, now that we have a use case for sub-fields!

Some minor comments. Could you also please add a Signed-off-by line (git commit --amend -s)

Line:170, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> My OCD doesn't like that there are two spaces before "strDef" :P

Line:403, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> Double space before fields.

Also, the parameter should be of type CtfTmfEventField[]

Line:413, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> Here too, the return type should be <CtfTmfEventField> (cast should be safe if we only take CtfTmfEventField's at the constructor).

Also, any reason we can't return the array directly? (ie,  CtfTmfEventField[] for return type)

Line:161, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventFieldTest.java -> Note to other reviewers, here Gerrit doesn't print the unicode string (it's the same that's used in testParseField_string())

forgot to push commit message comments

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit titles should be in the present tense, "Add support...". Makes it easier to understand what's happening when we do reverts, rebases, etc.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> D-D-D-ouble space

Line:413, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> The return type must be an Object, the toString() function is called on it so it had to converted to a List or else the string doesn't look good
