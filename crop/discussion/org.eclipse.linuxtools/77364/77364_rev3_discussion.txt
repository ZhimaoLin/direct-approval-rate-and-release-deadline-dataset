DESCRIPTION

Bug 498166 - Add label filtering in Docker Containers view

- fix the DockerConnection getContaineIdsWithLabels code to account
  for a bug in docker client where multiple labels are not
  filtered properly (only the first one is)
- add ContainerWithLabels Viewer filter that takes a set of
  ids and passes any Container with matching id
- add ConfigureLabels wizard with page and model which allows user
  to enter labels to filter
- modify DockerContainersView to add labels filter dynamically
  and to call the new getContainerIdsWithLabels api to get the
  ids that should not be filtered out
- add new preferences to store and fetch the labels and whether
  containers should be filtered by label
