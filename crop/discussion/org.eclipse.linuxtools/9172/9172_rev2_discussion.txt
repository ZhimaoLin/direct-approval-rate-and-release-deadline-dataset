Works and looks good!

A bit sad that you have to do an extra state system request to get the labels. Wouldn't it be possible to reuse the ITmfInterval's that are first obtained when creating the rectangles?

We need to reduce the number of queeries though. Functionnaly it is great.

Reply to Alexandre's comments:
No, because it requires state system intervals from different attributes than the ones used to build the time graph model. If we were to get the label information at that time, the time graph model would take much longer to build. Instead we are doing the queries only for the current window, and only when the time graph interval is at least one character wide.
I will push another patch version that reduces the amount of if-clause nesting.
