DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Improve no-stap errors; allow projectless processes.

Using Systemtap IDE without stap installed causes too many error dialogs to appear.
Simplify/streamline the kinds of error dialogs that are shown when stap is missing.

Also allow RuntimeProcessFactory to launch processes that don't have a host project,
which is required for the above error dialog improvements.

Line:88, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tools/launch/core/factory/RuntimeProcessFactory.java -> Here, the current OS is used to determine whichURI when running a command without a host project. We need support for projectless commands to power things like the SystemTap Function/Probe Parsers and the Kernel Browser, and to be able to directly run *.stp files that aren't part of a project.

Basing whichURI on the running OS seemed like the best/only way to have projectless commands be multi-platform. If there's a better way of approaching this, let me know.

This change looks fine to me. I've tested by removing "systemtap" from my system and can confirm that errors are properly caught and appropriate messages are logged/displayed.
