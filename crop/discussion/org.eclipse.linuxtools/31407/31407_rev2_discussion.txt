DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce ITmfEventTableColumns and its extension point

Instead of accidentally specifying the whole event table, trace types
can now only define the columns they want. This allows more (most)
trace types to use the default TmfEventsTable, which in turn allows more
trace types to be "aggregated" together in one table when put together
in the same experiment.

The previous "eventsTableType" extension remains there, 1) for
compatibility purpose, but also 2) for trace types that do very specific
things with their event table and need to override the default one
(ie, GdbTrace). Those trace types however will not be able to merge
their columns with other trace types when put together in the same
experiment.

Patch Set 2:

After discussing with GeneviÃ¨ve, it could make sense to have epxeriment specify their own columns, but probably not their own tables (at least not now). So in a subsequent patch we could change the experiment extension point to use columns too.

What would be immediately useful would a column "Trace" in every experiment, indicating what trace this particular event is from. I will look into that next.

First review of the code. I haven't tested it yet or gone beyond quickly reading it in gerrit.

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/ITmfEventTableColumns.java -> Is this nullable? What does it mean if an empty collection is returned? fallback to default columns?

Line:10, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/custom/CustomEventTableColumns.java -> Again, credit when renaming file?

Line:10, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/viewers/events/LttngEventTableColumns.java -> Here too, it's a file rename so I think the original credit should stay

Line:10, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.btf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/btf/ui/BtfEventTableColumns.java -> Shouldn't some credit be left to Matthew? After all, you renamed the file and still use most of its content ;-)

Thanks for the comments.

About the renames, I actually created new files, and cut & pasted the column definitions in the new ones. Then git interpretated it as a rename. But I agree, if most of the code is still the same, we could keep the previous copyright header. I didn't mean to steal credit ;)

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/ITmfEventTableColumns.java -> Good point, we could make this non-null, if the trace doesn't want to define any columns they just don't use the extension point.

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/ITmfEventTableColumns.java -> and if an *empty* collection is returned explicitly, then that would mean the trace type does not want any column at all...  we assume they know what they're doing!
