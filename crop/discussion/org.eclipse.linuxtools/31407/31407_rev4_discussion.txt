DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce ITmfEventTableColumns and its extension point

Instead of accidentally specifying the whole event table, trace types
can now only define the columns they want. This allows more (most)
trace types to use the default TmfEventsTable, which in turn allows more
trace types to be "aggregated" together in one table when put together
in the same experiment.

The previous "eventsTableType" extension remains there,
 1) for compatibility purposes, but also
 2) for trace types that do very specific things with their event
    table and need to override the default one (ie, GdbTrace).

Those trace types however will not be able to merge their columns
with other trace types when put together in the same experiment.

Line:370, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> you could just do the cols.addAll() here

Patch Set 4:

things to discuss:
* extension points, should we support defining both at the same time
* default columns, should we put them on the left, or not care

Line:310, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> Ok I remember why I kept this separate createEventsTable(). By having this method static, we can use it from getExperimentEventTable() when we want to get the table type for one specific trace type.

Sorry, I haven't looked at it. But I wanted to point out that we should only merge it to master after stable-3.1 is created. I don't think we should have it in 3.1, right?
