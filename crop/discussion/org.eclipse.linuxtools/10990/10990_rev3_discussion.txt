DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add support for partial state system history

A partial history is like a shim between a trace's state system
and a "standard" history backend.

In a standard history, all state intervals are inserted into the
backend. With a partial history, only the intervals that cross
pre-determined checkpoints are inserted. To rebuild any state
between checkpoints, we load the previous checkpoint and re-read
the events in the trace between the checkpoint and the time of
the query.

Partial histories do not support single queries. While those
could be implemented by using a full-query, it seemed to cause
problems with range queries, where multiple state/event queries
happen in parallel (which is not so bad, range-query performance
would be absolutely disastrous!).
