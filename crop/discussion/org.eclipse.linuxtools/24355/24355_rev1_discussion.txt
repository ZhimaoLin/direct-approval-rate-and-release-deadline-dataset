DESCRIPTION

tmf: Refactor bookmarks file handling

The interfaces used to set or get the bookmarks file from an editor or
experiment are removed as they are not necessary. The bookmarks file is
the file in the FileEditorInput of an opened trace editor.

A convenience method is added in the trace manager to get the editor
file for an opened trace.
