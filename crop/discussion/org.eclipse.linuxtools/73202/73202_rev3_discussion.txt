DESCRIPTION

Eliminate need for bundle activators in man page bundles.

They were doing nothing that couldn't be done by directly interrogating
the Framework and Platform APIs directly. Eliminating pointless
activators helps to improve the start up performance of the platform.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

The changes look fine to me. It looks like man.core will no longer depend on UI components with the AbstractUIPlugin-extending Activator gone.
