Patch Set 2:

The code is not checking the status of current Containers.  I think that it needs to be notified of Container changes.  If I start a stopped Container and then go to the Docker Explorer View, it still shows I can start or remove the Container.  This is not true.  It should be allowing me to pause or kill the Container
