DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix empty trace properties when trace name has regex special chars

The trace properties (e.g. CTF environment variables) are empty when the
trace name contains regex special characters such as '(' ')' because
this causes failure of a replace of the trace name in the prefix of the
property descriptor key.
