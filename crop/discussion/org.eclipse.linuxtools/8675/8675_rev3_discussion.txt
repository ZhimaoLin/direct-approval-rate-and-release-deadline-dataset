DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add the Histogram query API to ITmfStatistics

See the added Javadoc for the complete description. This will
allow the Histogram view to easily plug into the trace's
ITmfStatistics object to get its information (so it can be
optimized for each trace type, etc.)

Patch Set 3:

After some testing, the event-based backend was way too slow, even for very small traces (it was starting/stopping as many threads as there are pixels in the view, sequentially!)

I've implemented a new version that does only one event request to the trace, then checks which "bucket" the result should go in by using TreeMap.floor(). It should scale better.
