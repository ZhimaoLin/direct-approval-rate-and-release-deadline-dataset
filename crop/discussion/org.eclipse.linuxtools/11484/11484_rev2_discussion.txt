DESCRIPTION

Avoid selecting non IOConsole interfaces.

When a C/C++ Application is launched, the corresponding CDT Build
Console will contain the launch configuration name but does not
implement IOConsole. These kinds of consoles should not be used by Perf
Stat to write the program's standard output.
