Patch Set 1: Verified-1

I can reproduce the bug after applying the patch.

I open org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/traces/kernel
then 
org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/traces/synthetic-trace/

and kernel trace is the one that gets activated. Let me know if you need help to reproduce it.

Patch Set 1:

It seemed to work in the Trace Compass repo and I thought it's just a matter to transfer it to Linux Tools. Maybe it's timing dependent and in Trace Compass it just happened to work.  I guess there is more to it to fix this bug.

Patch Set 1:

I'll abandon this change because it doesn't actually fix it. The fix will be on Trace Compass.
