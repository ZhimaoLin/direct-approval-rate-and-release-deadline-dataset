Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)

Just a code-related comment to address and style-related one.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think you need to use "This commit" to refer to what the change is actually doing. You can just state it. For example, instead of "This commit changes functionality X to do Y", you could say "Change functionality X to do Y".

Line:296, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/ProviderOptionsTab.java -> I haven't fully tested this yet, but it seems to me that if any tab is invalid, then false should be returned immediately. This code would only check if the last tab is valid/invalid.
