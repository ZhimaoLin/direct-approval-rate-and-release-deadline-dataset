not a -1 but a question

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> please elaborate a bit? I think it propagates refreshes to an experiment.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm talking about when you set a trace type to an experiment. If you run as an Eclipse application (not the RCP), you'll have the test experiment type, try to set it and it doesn't work.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The how-to reproduce the bug usually does not go in the commit message? Maybe I should put experiment type instead of experiment trace type, that would be clearer. And open a bugzilla for it?
