Patch Set 2:

How should this work?  I tried running an image, then deleting the connection.  When I open the Run configuration, I get a non-descriptive message dialog and a message in the dialog that the image is not found, try another.  When I use the combo, it still shows images from the previous connection which appear to be cached.  The connection name still shows the original connection name.

Did you try to run or to build an image ? My patch cover the "build" use case when the connection has been removed after the first launch.

Yes, I was trying to do a run instead of a build.  All is fine.
