DESCRIPTION

ctf: Remove a backward dependency into StreamInput to CTF-Trace.

This dependency is useless.
In fact, the creation of the indexes seems also to be useless.
I didn't find any use of it.

I think the notion of StreamPacketInputIndex should be an class
only use by StreamInput.

Patch Set 1:

This is an example of having a reference from a "lower" layer to an upper (stream -> trace).

A trace "own" the stream and give him the information to operate. A bad design is to give him a reference to itself and exposed the accessor to the needed information.

This kind of abstraction ease unittest/debugging/refactoring/...

More to come on this kind of refactoring.

Before Streaminputpacketindex was made public because we wanted to sync it up with the tmf index. that is a flawed idea and will not work, so this is a good dangling api fixup
