DESCRIPTION

ctf: Update paths in the CTF-Testsuite tests

The upstream CTF-Testsuite was updated, let's follow 'suite'.

This also changes the test mechanisms to use parametrized tests. This
way, we get one JUnit test per test-trace being run, so we'll know the
exact amount of tests that are failing (instead of bailing out as soon
as we get one failure).

Those tests are disabled by default to avoid build failures for now,
but they should be fixed/reenabled as soon as possible.

Line:127, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/ctftestsuite/CtfTestSuiteTests.java -> artefacte? or missing an assertNull? Maybe both

Line:127, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/ctftestsuite/CtfTestSuiteTests.java -> we shouldn't do assertNotNull, because if there are no events in the trace it would be null, right?

I figured doing getEventDef between advance's would simulate a "real" reading of the trace.

Line:127, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/ctftestsuite/CtfTestSuiteTests.java -> Ok, fair enough. that's a weird corner case but that's what this patch is all about.
