Line:118, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/hidden/KernelSourceAction.java -> Do we need this at all? I mean kernel souces will always be CEditor as it will find the CEditor. Also in the run method there is editor instanceof STPEditor, so either it should be removed or we can not give priority this way to CEditor as we wiil never get STPEditor at all (is there such case at all?).

Line:118, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/hidden/KernelSourceAction.java -> This to give it priority over other C editors not STPEditor for example org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.ui.editor.CEditor or the CDT's editor. Those editors are perfectly capable of displaying C code but they don't have special handling for gutter double clicks to insert probes into the script.

IMO this function is not needed at all and org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.systemtap.ui.ide.editors.c.CEditor is not find just error out. I thought maybe the original author wanted the functionality to degrade gracefully so I gave the CEditor the priority
