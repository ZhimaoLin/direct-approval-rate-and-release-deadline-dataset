DESCRIPTION

tmf: Avoid throwing exception in TmfTrace.buildStatistics()

Replace the exception with an IStatus return value, similar to what was
done with .buildStateSystem().

Also handle the actual values that are returned in the caller (the
traceOpened signal handler) so that any eventual errors are logged.
