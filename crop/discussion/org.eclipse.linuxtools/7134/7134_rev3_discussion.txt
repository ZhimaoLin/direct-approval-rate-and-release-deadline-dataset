DESCRIPTION

Drop the legacy LTTng 0.x plugins

Here comes the axe!

LTTng 0.x has been unsupported upstream for more than 2 years now.
The plugins themselves haven't received any new development since
then.

We plan to drop support for LTTng 0.x in Linux Tools 2.0. It will
remain supported in the Linux Tools 1.x branch.

This will open the door for some future improvements that were
impossible to make with this codebase still around. For example,
immutable timestamps in the framework.
