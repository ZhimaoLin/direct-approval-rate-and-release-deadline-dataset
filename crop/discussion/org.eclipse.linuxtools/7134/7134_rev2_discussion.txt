DESCRIPTION

Drop the legacy LTTng 0.x plugins

LTTng 0.x has been unsupported upstream for more than 2 years now.
The plugins themselves haven't received any new development since
then.

We plan to drop support for LTTng 0.x in Linux Tools 2.0. It will
remain supported in the Linux Tools 1.x branch.

This will open the door for some future improvements that were
impossible to make with this codebase still around. For example,
immutable timestamps in the framework.

As mentioned in the daily meeting, this will require an approval from the sponsor before proceeding. It should be a formality.

Also, a quick posting on the linuxtools-dev would be appreciated, just to let our huge user-base know that we will drop v0.x in LT 2.0.

It's been a week and nobody on the ML has brought up any objection so far, so I'll go a ahead and push this.

I've spoken with the product sponsor and they see no problem in dropping this either.
