DESCRIPTION

tmf: suppress warnings and add reminders to fix this later

The Autocloseable interface was slightly overapplied, so this is generating
potential resource leak warnings where there are none. This will be fixed
by removing the interface when it is possible. This will break apis so it may
be later.
