DESCRIPTION

tmf: suppress warnings and add reminders to fix this later

The Autocloseable interface was slightly overapplied, so this is generating
potential resource leak warnings where there are none. This will be fixed
by removing the interface when it is possible. This will break apis so it may
be later.

I'm all for depolluting the project from warnings that we know are false warnings. If it took you 5 minutes to do this patch, it won't take much longer to remove them later and in the meantime, we actually can care about other warnings because we'll see them.

A bit ugly, but if the 3.1 branch is to be long-lived, might be worth keeping it a bit clean.

I'd suggest not putting the TODO literally EVERYWHERE, but just in IAnalysisModule.

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/CTFStreamInputReaderTest.java -> This is not an analysis module warning, it's related to CTF.
