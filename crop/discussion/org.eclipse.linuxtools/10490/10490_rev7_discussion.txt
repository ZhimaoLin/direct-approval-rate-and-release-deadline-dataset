Line:123, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/types/EnumDefinitionTest.java -> Ok makes sense. But we shouldn't commit known test failures to master. Perhaps this line should //commented, and in a separate commit, we'd fix the behavior and re-enable this test.
