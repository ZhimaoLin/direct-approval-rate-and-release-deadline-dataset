DESCRIPTION

lttng rcp: add tracing rcp "file->open" buttons

there are two buttons added:
* File-> Open Trace File...
* File-> Open Trace Directory...

The traces will be openned into the default directory and
automatically select the trace type. If the trace viewer is
ambiguous, it will pop-up a window to help.

The trace is then opened.

The reason that we have open file and open directory is since
some traces are directories.

Patch Set 22: Verified-1

File open with custom text doesn't work well. In my case I have 1 custom text log. When opening it, then a dialog box for trace type selection opens with 2 entries of the same custom text. Also when selecting one of the 2, the result is that no trace type is set.
