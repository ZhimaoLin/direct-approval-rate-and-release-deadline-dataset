DESCRIPTION

rcp: add tracing rcp "file->open" buttons

there are two buttons added:
* File-> Open Trace File...
* File-> Open Trace Directory...

The traces will be openned into the default directory and
automatically select the trace type. If the trace viewer is
ambitguous, it will pop-up a window to help.

The trace is then opened.

The reason that we have open file and open directory is since
some traces are directories.

What happened to the suggestion to add the menu to the IDE? Was it decided not to do it?

Hi Marc-Andre

It was decided to not put it in Kepler. But for Luna is up for discussion. To allow it in the IDE the handler would need to be moved to TMF UI and provided as API. Any comments Matthew?

If this is added to the IDE, I think it should be only visible when in Tracing perspectives.

As was discussed, perhaps the handlers should go in tmf.ui, so that it can be re-used in the Eclipse Plugin version.

It could be linked into the Import dialog maybe? (Import Trace File and Import Trace Directory, which call the same functions?)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Use "lttng rcp" or "tracing rcp".  there could be more than 1 rcp in Linux Tools

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> "ambiguous"

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> RCP

Also, what happens with the auto-type-detection when opening from the command line? how are conflicts resolved?

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/messages/messages.properties -> "Directory" should be captialized. Or "file" should be uncapitalized

Line:111, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor.java -> only 1 empty line

Line:122, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor.java -> space after ,

Line:145, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/TracingRcpPlugin.java -> should be IStatus.ERROR

Line:108, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TraceTypeHelper.java -> remove one empty line

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/OpenTraceHelper.java -> same line

Line:142, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/OpenTraceHelper.java -> use List for the return type.

You could also use it for the declarations.

Line:162, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/OpenTraceHelper.java -> List<> here too

Line:181, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/OpenTraceHelper.java -> keep it on the same line

Line:215, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/OpenTraceHelper.java -> same line

I think it would work OK in keppler and luna, the big issue is we need a default project in the ide then.
