DESCRIPTION

lttng rcp: add tracing rcp "file->open" buttons

there are two buttons added:
* File-> Open Trace File...
* File-> Open Trace Directory...

The traces will be opened into the default directory and
automatically select the trace type. If the trace viewer is
ambiguous, it will pop-up a window to help.

The trace is then opened.

The reason that we have open file and open directory is since
some traces are directories.

Also, the code path of regular trace file opening has been re-routed
through this patch to unify code.

Patch Set 29: Verified-1

When trying to open a kernel trace it opens as a generic CTF trace if no custom text parser is defined (with custom text parser, there trace type selection dialog shows Generic CTF tace and custom traces). This was not fixed in this patch.
