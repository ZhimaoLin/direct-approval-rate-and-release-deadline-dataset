DESCRIPTION

Update project settings for CTF/LTTng/TMF

Remove the automatic line wrapping and unwrapping for code
lines. It had the tendency to absolutely destroy the formatting
if used on a complete file. The auto-wrapping of comments
remains at 80 columns.

Also enabled Javadoc warnings for protected fields and methods.
Since protected members in exported packages are part of the API,
those should be Javadoc-umented too.
