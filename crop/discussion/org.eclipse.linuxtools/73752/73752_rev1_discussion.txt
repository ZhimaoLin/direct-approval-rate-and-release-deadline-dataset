DESCRIPTION

Bug 491999 - Docker build fails when called via Quick Access menu

- make connection detection more robust to handle case where Docker
  Explorer View isn't up yet and a connection selected
- add some logic back into CommandUtils and use it instead of
  calling DockerConnectionWatcher directly
