Test looks fine to me. Just a small change I'd prefer in the view.

Line:53, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/SourceDisassemblyView.java -> I think it might be better to make a protected setter for this, and just mention that it's intended to be used for testing.
