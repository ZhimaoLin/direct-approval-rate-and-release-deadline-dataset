DESCRIPTION

Support mounting all classpath elements and better debug discovery.

- Add support for mounting files appearing under the classpath. This is
fully capable of supporting remote mounts, depending only on
ContainerLauncher to detect/handle the logic
- When attempting to connect to the JVM debug service within the
container, if the container IP is not reachable/fails, check the daemon
IP before resorting to a check on all active interfaces
