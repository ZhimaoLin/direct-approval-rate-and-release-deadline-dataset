DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a ITmfStateSystem.waitUntilBuilt() method with timeout

This allows callers to "unblock" after a specified delay has elapsed.
Extremely simple to implement, as CountDownLatch already has a method
to do exactly this!

Patch Set 2:

Yeah about the copyrights, I'll do a run of the copyright tool tomorrow to fix hopefully everything. We probably have a bunch from 2013 we haven't updated either.
