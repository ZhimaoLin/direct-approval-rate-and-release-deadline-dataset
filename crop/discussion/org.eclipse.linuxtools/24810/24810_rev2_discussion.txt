DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove the precision from ITmfTimestamp

Timestamp precision is a problem in tracers, not in a viewer.
We already have the notion of scale which kind-of does the same
thing (if a timestamp is specified up to milliseconds, we can
consider it precise up to milliseconds).

Not only this removes big chunks of unused code, it should speed
up timestamp comparisons a little bit.

Patch Set 2:

This looks good to me but needs to be tested vs our other code base. I suggest Meredith Scott or Patrick take a look.
