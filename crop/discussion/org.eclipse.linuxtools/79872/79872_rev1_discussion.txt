DESCRIPTION

Bug 499854 - Connection is not added(same parameters, different name)

Refactored the validators in the NewDockerConnectionPage
by adding  a search for connection with the same Unix/TCP settings when
the name is changed.
The page cannot complete if the user gives a new name for a connection with
known Unix socket path or TCP host.

Added SWTBot tests.
