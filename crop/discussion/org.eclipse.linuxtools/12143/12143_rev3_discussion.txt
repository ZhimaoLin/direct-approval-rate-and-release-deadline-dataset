Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(7 inline comments)

See comments. If you want to be stricter with warnings, you should enable them in the project settings (normally for all similar plugins in the tree) and fix all of them, in the same commit.

Line:169, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gdbtrace/core/trace/DsfGdbAdaptor.java -> same comments as in the other files

Line:128, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gdbtrace/ui/views/events/GdbEventsTable.java -> We don't warn for "unused parameters". The comment inside the method already explains what is happening.

Line:141, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gdbtrace/ui/views/project/dialogs/SelectTraceExecutableDialog.java -> This just clutters the code for nothing. We disabled the warning for "unused parameters" in the project settings for this reason.

Line:180, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gdbtrace/ui/views/project/dialogs/SelectTraceExecutableDialog.java -> I'm fine with documenting empty blocks, but the comment has to be useful... like why is this exception being caught and ignored here?

Line:37, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/gdbtrace/ui/tests/GdbTraceUIPluginTest.java -> This is a test plugin, NLS warnings are not enabled, so these annotations are not needed.

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/gdbtrace/ui/tests/AllGdbTraceUITests.java -> No, nothing should go here, this is the test suite declaration. 
The tests are enumerated in xxx@xxx.xxx above.

I think this is a case where this empty block doesn't really have to be documented, test suites kinda work this way...

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/dialogs/Messages.java -> This creates warnings for the two public static String's below. Please give them a Javadoc comment (even though it's internal, but the compiler doesn't seem to care...)
