Patch Set 2: Do not submit

Check your warning settings. We are using project-specific compiler settings, so everybody should see the same thing.

Some of these changes are quite harmless (like "undocumented empty blocks"), but others can be potentially dangerous and change the behavior (like "method can be potentially static").

Making stuff non-private because of inner classes is not the right way to fix it. Needed variables should be passed as constructor parameters, or by using public getters.
