DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a handler for UI refresh operations

To avoid having many many threads calling Display.asyncExec()
concurrently, offer a way to "coalesce" those UI operations.

Components can now call TmfUiRefreshHandler.getInstance().queueUpdate()
instead, which will accumulate updates coming from many components,
keep only the latest one from each component, and send them all to
the UI thread in one go after a timer has expired.

de-man-ti-buller: limit the amount of requests per second, why not?

Line:89, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/Activator.java -> It's a singleton, getInstance() always returns the same thing. It's called here to load and "init" the class.

I've tried to see if we could do away with getInstance() and make it completely static. Doesn't seem like such a good idea after all, since it has inner classes and starts threads and whatnot, it's much easier to control if we have an instance.

Line:89, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/Activator.java -> Ok,it's just a bit weird to have a getInstance that is not stored.
