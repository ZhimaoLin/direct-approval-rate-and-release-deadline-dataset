Line:743, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> "If the binary used for this step is different from the one used for taking the trace, make sure it is compiled with debugging symbols (-g)". I think if the binaries are different, it's pretty unlikely that the addresses will match. You'd need the same compiler, etc. I think we're better off saying that if the binaries are different, the function names might be wrong.
