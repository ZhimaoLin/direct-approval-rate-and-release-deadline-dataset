This change works fine for me and is an improvement over functionality. Just a few issues to address.

Line:25, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/core/datasets/row/LineParser.java -> This would be new API (not an internal package) so the plugin's minor version number needs to be bumped (1.0 -> 1.1) in the manifest and pom. Also the class needs xxx@xxx.xxx tag to reflect in what version it was introduced (ie. 1.1).
