Some comments. I also suggest that this patch should be split into two patches. One for the bug fix and one for the new properties. The bug fix is straightforward and could be cherry-picked to the stable branch (3.1) since this is a pretty important bug.

Line:467, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> The format looks different than the standard resource properties. I think it would be a good thing to make it the same.

Line:476, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> I'm not sure about displaying the size of folders. It can be a fairly expensive operation and it's running on the UI thread.
