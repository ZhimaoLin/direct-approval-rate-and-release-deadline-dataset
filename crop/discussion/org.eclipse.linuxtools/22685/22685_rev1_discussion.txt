This isn't very useful, those messages don't show up anywhere AFAIK.

The failure you got here is different from the one on HEAD, see comment.

Line:101, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/FunkyTraceTest.java -> You didn't just add a message here, you changed the expected value. Of course it will fail ;)
