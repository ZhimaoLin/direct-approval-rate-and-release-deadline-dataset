DESCRIPTION

ctf: Fix race condition in ctfiterator

You could advance an event while seeking, that is no longer possible
performance droped from 78000 events/s reading to 75000 events/s.
Potential hazard, threads can access the iterator and advance and seek
concurently. This is allowed by design, it's an iterator, it should be
wrapped in a safer candy coated shell so it doesn't melt in you hands.
