Looks good, a very welcome change! Some small comments in the code, and some comments about the preference dialog:

- The OK button doesn't implicitly click Apply (it does the same as cancel).
- Wouldn't a drop-down list for each category be better? There are so many radio buttons, the whole thing looks like a checkers game ;)
- I think the default sub-second delimiter should be none (or maybe space). Underline is a bit unexpected.

Line:47, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/ITmfTimestamp.java -> shouldn't those be public static final?

Line:692, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I think it'd be better to add Javadoc to these two methods, it removes the unused warning if the parameter is documented.

We should add the Javadoc warnings for protected methods at some point...

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfTimestamp.java -> Nice! Made me laugh out loud ;)

Wasn't it PROJECT_IS_CANNED ? hehe

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfTimestamp.java -> Code seems to use 'second' scale as default?

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfTimestamp.java -> Doesn't this depend on the scale?
