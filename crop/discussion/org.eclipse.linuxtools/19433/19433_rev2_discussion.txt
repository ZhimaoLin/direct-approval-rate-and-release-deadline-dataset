DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Add the concept of module source to the Analysis API

This allows for other ways to define analysis modules than having to describe
them in the plugin.xml file.  For example, an XML file can be the source of an
analysis module.

The source itself needs to be described in the plugin.xml, using another
element of the analysis extension point.

Each module source will typically have its matching helper class to create the
instance of a module when required and to be able to access available modules
for different trace types before the trace is instantiated.

A default implementation of the IAnalysisModuleSource interface and its helper
are provided for the modules advertised through the extension point: the
TmfAnalysisModuleSourceConfigElement and TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1 IP-Clean+1

This patch looks good to me, but I didn't work in this part of the code enough to have a strong opinion, I would recommend Braxton Mccarthy takes a look at it.
