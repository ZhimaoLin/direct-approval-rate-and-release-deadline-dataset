DESCRIPTION

tmf: Tweak ITmfStateSystemAnalysisModule

- Decouple it from TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule, rename it to
  ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems. An analysis module could
  expose state systems independently of using the abstract class
  or not.

- Change the Map return to separate methods. I'm not very happy
  about getStateSystemId(), but the State System Explorer currently
  needs it. Ideally, the ID could be stored in the state system itself,
  so that this method would not be needed.
