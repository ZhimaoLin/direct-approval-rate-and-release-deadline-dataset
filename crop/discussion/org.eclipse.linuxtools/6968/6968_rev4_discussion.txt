DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bump plugins version to 2.0 for Kepler branch

Since 1.2 is not yet released, we have to fake all the existing
"@since 1.2" methods to xxx@xxx.xxx 2.0".

When we merge this branch back into master (which should be after
the 1.2 release), these should be reverted to xxx@xxx.xxx 1.2".
