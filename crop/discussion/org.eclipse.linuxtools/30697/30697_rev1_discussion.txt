I don't know if this documentation is at the right place, as it fits more in the context of "Is Trace Compass Fast Yet". "Normal" developers who save data in a database and use it with other means may not necessarily need to do data mnagement. But it doesn't hurt, some will want a real clean database.

Line:3684, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> This will remove the scenario from the summary, but the sample and datapoint measured are still kept in the database, so results are still accessible using the org.eclipse.test.performance.db.View or other means to view the data.

If that is the intention of "deleting a scenario", please mention it so the user does not have the impression that deleting the scenario deletes all the data associated with it.

Line:3690, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Here you do delete the whole variation, along with its data.

Line:3713, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> "this is the X axis". You shouldn't mention it as it supposes ITCFYWebsite, which is not mentioned anywhere and not documented yet, and I'm not sure this developer guide is the place to talk about it.

Yeah. I didn't know where to put this. Maybe on the wiki? But the thing is, we only access the database through the java code, so it sort-of makes sense to put it in the repo. Or maybe in the wiki as it would apply to any projects that makes use of test.performance framework with a database.

Abandoned

Based on the fact that we haven't needed this in months, I don't think it's worth committing.
