DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bug 451240: Mouse wheel inactive on time graph scale and scroll bar

- Add a mouse wheel listener to the time graph scale to zoom

- Remove the mouse wheel event filter that was added when time graph
control had focus, and replace it with a listener to prevent horizontal
scrolling on mouse wheel events.
