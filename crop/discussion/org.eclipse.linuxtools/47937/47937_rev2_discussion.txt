DESCRIPTION

Fix various remove problems in Docker Toolings

- allow stateless Containers to be removed as they won't be categorized
  as "stopped"
- add new Container property "isRemovable" to support this
- for Remove Container and Remove Image handlers, don't use a new
  shell which results in a UI issue with a greyed out window behind
  the confirmation dialog.  Use the active shell instead
- this may fix: bug 467052
