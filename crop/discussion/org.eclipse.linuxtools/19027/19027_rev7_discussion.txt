DESCRIPTION

tmf: Cleanup TmfStateValue to remove 1-level of indirection.

This is a refactoring to diminush the memory usage of the
StateSystem.

In the current implementation, each TmfStateValue has a
"box" for an other object (i.e. Integer, Double, String, ...).
We propose to remove this indirection and use the raw type inside
the corresponding type.

As an example, IntegerStateValue now contains an "int" instead
of an "Integer".

I just added parentheses to the returns when it's checking a condition. Not technically needed but I prefer it that way ;)
