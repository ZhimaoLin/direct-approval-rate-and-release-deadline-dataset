DESCRIPTION

tmf: Cleanup TmfStateValue to remove 1-level of indirection.

This is a refactoring to diminush the memory usage of the
StateSystem.

In the current implementation, each TmfStateValue has a
"box" for an other object (i.e. Integer, Double, String, ...).
We propose to remove this indirection and use the raw type inside
the corresponding type.

As an example, IntegerStateValue now contains an "int" instead
of an "Integer".

Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1 IP-Clean+1

This looks correct in my opinion. However, I am not a domain expert. I would suggest if there is another commit, to add your name to the changelog. This is a non-trivial refactor. It is not so that people can contact you for support, it is just following the eclipse way of working, I think.
