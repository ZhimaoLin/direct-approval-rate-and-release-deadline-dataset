DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add TmfEventTableColumn class

Introduce the concept of "event table column" objects. This
object will contain:
- The initial column configuration (previously in "ColumnData")
- The getItemString() "functor" defining how to populate the cell
  in this column for a given event.
- The "field ID" to allow searching/filtering to keep working as
  before. Eventually, the filtering mechanism could be reworked
  to just use getItemString() directly.

The base framework now defines 5 columns, that are available for
all trace types (whose getter methods are currently in ITmfEvent):
- Timestamp
- Source*
- Event Type
- Reference*
- Contents (fields)

(* = could eventually be removed, subject to future discussion)

Every trace type can now specify which columns it wants to display,
which may or may not include the default-provided ones.

This is the first step towards decoupling the trace type, event table,
and column order and number. This will eventually allow displaying all
the possible trace type columns in an experiment of heterogeneous traces.

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> No event table stuff in this class.

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/widgetStubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/experiment/type/TmfEventsTableExperimentStub.java -> Searching on this column will look for a content field called "Trace". Might not work but this is a test stub, perhaps the searching is not required.

Would you be ok with merging this as is, then in the second patch we move the TmfEventTableColumn out?

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Ok, I'll update the second patch then.

This class used to use ColumnData, and TmfEventTableColumn is like the new ColumnData. I'd rather not also change this in the same patch.

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/widgetStubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/experiment/type/TmfEventsTableExperimentStub.java -> Yeah it's a stub, and I'm pretty sure it didn't work previously either.

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> No problem. Note that ColumnData is part of o.e.l.t.ui.widgets.virtualtable package, not part of o.e.l.t.ui.viewers.events. That was intentional ;)
