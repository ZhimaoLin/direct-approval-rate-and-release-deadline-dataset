DESCRIPTION

Remove check when creating control for Oprofile/Perf event tabs.

When creating control for Oprofile/Perf event tabs we do not need to
check for number of children in the parent composite, this condition
is only triggered when clicking on a snapshot configuration, which
does not require the resulting functionality of the condition.

Patch Set 3:

FWIW I don't see why the original if() was needed. There was mention of it being needed if the event tab differed among configurations (perhaps if a remote configuration had a different set of events), but from what I can see, the method to get the new set of events is being called.
