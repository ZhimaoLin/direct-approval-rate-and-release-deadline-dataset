DESCRIPTION

Remove check when creating control for Oprofile/Perf event tabs.

When creating control for Oprofile/Perf event tabs we do not need to
check for number of children in the parent composite, this condition
is only triggered when clicking on a snapshot configuration, which
does not require the resulting functionality of the condition.
