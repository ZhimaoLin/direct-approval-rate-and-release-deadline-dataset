DESCRIPTION

Bug 495600 - Improve UI for Docker reconnection use case

- make fixes to DockerExplorerContentProvider class
  - add new openRetry() method to DockerExplorerContentProvider that
    starts a job to continuously try to open a connection and ping it
    until successful; sleeping between attempts
  - add code to hasChildren() method to check if we have a connection
    and it isn't ESTABLISHED, check if we are currently running an
    openRetry job and if not, start one
  - fix hasChildren() to return true for an IDockerConnection,
    regardless of state
  - fix getChildren() to return a LoadingStub for an IDockerConnection
    that is not ESTABLISHED
