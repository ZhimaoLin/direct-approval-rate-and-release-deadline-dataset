Line:433, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/IDockerConnection.java -> You cannot add this as it breaks API for 5.1.0 release.  You can add it to the internal class or add a new interface that the class also implements with this new method added.

After trying it out, it would be nice to tie the selection in the Hierarchy View to the Properties view.  Perhaps a future RFE if you don't want to do it with this change.

Thanks for your feedback, Arianna Johns. Yes, this is a first iteration for this new view and I expect a handful of improvements in the future, but I did not want to grow this patch too big.

Line:433, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/IDockerConnection.java -> Damn, I missed that one. I'll remove it from the interface and add it again in version 6.0.0
