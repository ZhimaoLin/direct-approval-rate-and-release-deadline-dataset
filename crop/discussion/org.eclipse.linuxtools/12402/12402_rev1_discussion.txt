Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Very good catch, it was possible to open trace-less experiments, but it would throw exceptions in the console. Now in the console it's prevented.

However, would it be possible to keep the "Open" option visible but grayed-out? It's confusing if menu options switch around. (we have the same problem with the "Delete supplementary files" option atm)

I have no idea why I said "in the console" there...

Patch Set 1:

Yes it's possible. I can change that.

BTW, for deleteSupplementaryFiles I wanted to not show the menu item because I thought it makes sense for this type of command which the user usually doesn't use. However, we could always change it and just disable the menu item if no suppl. files are there.
