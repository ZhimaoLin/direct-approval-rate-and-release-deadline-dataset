Some small changes needed.

Line:41, man/org.eclipse.linuxtools.man.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/man/parser/ManPage.java -> Public API must have params documented properly.

Line:73, man/org.eclipse.linuxtools.man.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/man/parser/ManParser.java -> I would like to see params being properly documented.

Line:131, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tools/launch/core/factory/LinuxtoolsProcessFactory.java -> Please format params properly. Convention is after the param name to have a short sentence (starting with upper case) and longer sentences after that if needed. It easily can be viewed in javadoc view.

Line:163, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tools/launch/core/factory/LinuxtoolsProcessFactory.java -> Do we really need fully qualified here?

Line:163, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tools/launch/core/factory/LinuxtoolsProcessFactory.java -> I don't think so, and I can change it. I migrated this code from SystemtapProcessFactory, which did use that qualified name, and I kept it the same just in case it was like that for a reason.
