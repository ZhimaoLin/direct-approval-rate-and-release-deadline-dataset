DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Restore public TapsetLibrary.init().

Restore the public initialization method for TapsetLibrary,
so that tapset contents can be loaded as soon as the Systemtap
plugin is loaded. Also implement a better means of forbidding
multiple initializations than what was done before.

Other minor (but important) changes:
-Remove potential NPEs in TapsetLibrary's manpage caching operations.
-Prevent BrowserViews from disposing TapsetLibrary trees when they
are closed, which causes NPEs the next time they are opened.

Resolves EBZ #435979.
