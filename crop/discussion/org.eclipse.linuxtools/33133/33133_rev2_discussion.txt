Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Looks good, but as mentioned in the comments this will probably break the API. Should wait for 4.0/TraceCompass.

Line:83, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> final static -> static final

This will probably be an API break though... 3.1 is frozen now, so removing it would break the 3.0 API. (and we haven't set up on basslines on 3.1 yet)

Line:510, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> API break here too... will need xxx@xxx.xxx treatment, grrr.... or the TraceCompass treatment :D

Patch Set 2:

The initial change was pushed after the 3.1 branch was created, so it's not supposed to make it there *crossing fingers for no API break but will wait after release*

Oh ok, so maybe the existing 3.1 will have to be changed to 3.2 anyway.

Let's wait until the 3.1 release then ;)
