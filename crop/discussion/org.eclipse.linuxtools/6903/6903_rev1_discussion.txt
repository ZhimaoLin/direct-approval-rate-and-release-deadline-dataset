Line:104, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowPresentationProvider.java -> Because we can now have more than one item in the HashMap, it should be changed to a LinkedHashMap to ensure that the items are displayed in a non-random order in the tool tip.

This is really cool!

FranÃ§ois can you:
- Open a bug at bugs.eclipse.org/bugs (under Technology -> Linux Tools -> LTTng) describing this feature. In the first comment, link to this Gerrit page. You can look at bug 385535 for an example. You can use the same bug for this and your TID-in-resource-view change.

- Also in the bug, add the "I declare that I made this code from scratch etc." statement I sent you by email.

- In the commit message, add "References bug #XXXX", for complete two-way recursive cross-linking.

- I'd personally add "lttng: " in front of the commit title to identify the project, but it's up to you.

Thanks,
Alex
