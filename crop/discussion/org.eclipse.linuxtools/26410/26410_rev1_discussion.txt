lttng: Remove all unnecessary gitignore files

"bin" and "target" can be set in the top-level .gitignore, which
leaves no need to repeat such files in the plugins' directories.

Line:4, lttng/.gitignore -> FYI, The last line added once to avoid putting this file under version control when using the Eclipse Sonar plug-in. As I remember this file gets updated depending on some setting (I think it was the setting for the sonar server).

Line:4, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/.gitignore -> I guess xxx@xxx.xxx javaCompiler and build.xml were generated during builds before maven?

Line:4, lttng/.gitignore -> ok, should we remove this line from this file then?

Line:4, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/.gitignore -> I have no idea what those were.. xxx@xxx.xxx doesn't mean anything in the .gitignore format. Maybe a relic from an older VCS?

Line:4, lttng/.gitignore -> It doesn't hurt to be there and in case someone uses Eclipse sonar plug-in it won't be committed to the git.
