DESCRIPTION

RPM: remove unresolved urls as option B#414882

Eclipse by default attaches a hyperlink detector to the
specfile editor that does not resolve urls with macros in them.
RPM already has its own hyperlink detector that resolves macros
and ctrl + hovering on a hyperlink would show both resolved
and unresolved versions of the url.

SpecfileConfiguration now has a bit more control over what
hyperlink detectors are used on the specfile editor. For a start,
URLHyperlinkDetector (the one that didn't resolve macros) will not
be added when working on a specfile, rather,
URLHyperlinkWithMacroDetector will be used instead.
