DESCRIPTION

RPM: remove unresolved urls as option B#414882

Eclipse by default attaches a hyperlink detector to the
specfile editor that does not resolve urls with macros in them.
RPM already has its own hyperlink detector that resolves macros
and ctrl + hovering on a hyperlink would show both resolved
and unresolved versions of the url.

SpecfileConfiguration now has a bit more control over what
hyperlink detectors are used on the specfile editor. For a start,
URLHyperlinkDetector (the one that didn't resolve macros) will not
be added when working on a specfile, rather,
URLHyperlinkWithMacroDetector will be used instead.

Line:237, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/SpecfileConfiguration.java -> It is recommended to use entry set for iterating aka:
for (Map.Entry<?, ?> entry : targets.entrySet()) {

Line:243, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/SpecfileConfiguration.java -> Can't we use org.eclipse.jface.text.hyperlink.URLHyperlinkDetector in the instanceof ?
Relying on internal classes is strongly discouraged as they can be changed at any time. I see that the Open ... inbrowser is gone in this case but it's probably even better that way as there is only one Open hyperlink
