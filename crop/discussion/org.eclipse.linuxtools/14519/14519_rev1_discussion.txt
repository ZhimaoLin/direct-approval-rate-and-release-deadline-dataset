DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update statistics providers to handle TmfLostEvents

We do not want to count the "lost" events in the events total,
but it's interesting to show them like any other event type.

refs bug #408373.

Patch Set 1:

Bumping this to indicate it's still good/ready for review.

It does not depend on the other TmfLostEvent patches too, and wouldn't break anything if it's merged before or after (in theory!)
