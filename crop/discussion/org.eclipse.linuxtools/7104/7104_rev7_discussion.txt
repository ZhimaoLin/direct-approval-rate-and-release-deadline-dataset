Patch Set 7: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Some comments from PS6 were missed...

Although, with PS7, I'm having the test failures I had before with older patchsets (timestamps are offset by ~70 ns). I swear this doesn't happen with PS6! That's... weird...

You can try running them, it in lttng2.core.tests.stateprovider.StateSystemFullHistoryTest

Line:61, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> Sorry I forgot to mention this earlier, but the comment block should be auto-formatted too (wrapped to 80).

Line:768, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> you forgot here :P

Line:773, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> and here
