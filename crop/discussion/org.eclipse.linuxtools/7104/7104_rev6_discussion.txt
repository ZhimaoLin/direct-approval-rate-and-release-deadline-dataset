Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(9 inline comments)

Some style comments, will test it next.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Useful

Line:30, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIterator.java -> ?

Line:62, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> I think .equals would handle it anyway, but to be safe you should put a L at the end of the literal.

Line:63, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> There should be a space after (Long). auto-formatter will fix it.

Line:65, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> you can delete this block too if there's no attributes left.

Line:740, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> extra space

Line:756, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> Spacing is incorrect. Auto-format will fix it.

Line:772, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> here too

Line:777, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> extra space, auto-format, etc.

Patch Set 6: Verified

Seems to work fine, I do not have the ~70 ns offset problem I had with a previous version. Very nice!
