DESCRIPTION

Fix provider tests to pass when run with tycho-surefire.

Our test framework (o.e.l.profiling.tests) has methods for building a
specified C/C++ project. This succeeds when run locally in Eclipse as a
plugin test but fails in an execution of tycho surefire because
o.e.cdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui is not on the classpath. The bundle
provides some necessary extension points.
