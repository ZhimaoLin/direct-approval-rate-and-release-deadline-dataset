DESCRIPTION

Bug 474606 - Allow for search and pull images from the Docker Explorer view

Added a view in page in the SearchImage wizard to specify the image tag to pull:
- the list of image tags is retrieved from a new class called DockerHubRegistry (in the core module)
- the DockerHubRegistry#getTags(String) sends an HTTP request to list the tags for a given repository on Docker Hub, using a specific/known endpoint
  (this is not part of the docker-client because the Docker client deals with CLI commands on the Docker daemon/engine and this operation is out of scope)
- this might need to be refactored/opened in the future, when support for third-party registries will be implemented

Other bits in this commit:
- refactored the DVMessages class to support varargs instead of an array of arguments, which makes the API more convenient to use
- removed unused classes
- reformatted blocks of code badly indented
- removed author name in some classes/added copyright where found missing

(6 comments)

The change mostly works for me with just a few minor edge cases that need to be fixed (specifically canFinish()).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should be wrapped to be no longer than 72 characters. (See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Git#Commit_messages )

Line:57, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/ImageSearch.java -> The ImageTagSelectionPage doesn't override ispageComplete(), and the default implementation from WizardPage will always return true;

As an example, I tried searching for an image called 'rgrunber'. None existed, and the UI correctly warned about this, but still let me click 'Finish'. The result was :

Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.docker.ui.commands.PullImageCommandHandler.execute(PullImageCommandHandler.java:50)
	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.HandlerProxy.execute(HandlerProxy.java:295)

canFinish should only be returning true when an image is slected and when a tag is selected (or technically when a tag is selected since that implies an image was selected). You would need to implement isPageComplete for ImageTagSelectionPage.

Line:806, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/plugin.xml -> right clicking on IDockerConnection could still support pulling an image.

Line:1012, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> I'm assuming this result isn't actually used yet since the corresponding boolean field in ImageSearchResult is never passed to the ImagePulledColumnLabelProvider.

Line:91, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/IDockerConnection.java -> There is no 'name' parameter. I guess you mean 'repository'.

Line:82, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/ImageSearchPage.java -> Is this necessary ? isPageComplete() is overriden anyways to check for a selected image and should always be checked.
