DESCRIPTION

Bug 474606 - Allow for search and pull images from the Docker Explorer view

Added a view in page in the SearchImage wizard to specify the image
  tag to pull:
- the list of image tags is retrieved from a new class called DockerHubRegistry
  (in the core module)
- the DockerHubRegistry#getTags(String) sends an HTTP request to list the tags for
  a given repository on Docker Hub, using a specific/known endpoint.
  This is not part of the docker-client because the Docker client deals with CLI
   commands on the Docker daemon/engine and this operation is out of scope.
  This might need to be refactored/opened in the future, when support for third-party
  registries will be implemented.
- Pull image command is available at the connection level in the Docker Explorer view,
  too.

Other bits in this commit:
- refactored the DVMessages class to support varargs instead of an array of arguments,
  which makes the API more convenient to use
- removed unused classes
- reformatted blocks of code badly indented
- removed author name in some classes/added copyright where found missing
