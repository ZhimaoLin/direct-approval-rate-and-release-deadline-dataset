Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I agree with your idea Genevi√®ve, the Comparator<T> interface would be better for this type of things.

However, since you are always comparing the values, perhaps just making the ITmfStateValue Comparable would be even easier. Comparators are nice if you have multiple ways of comparing the same objects, so you can use different comparators depending on the situation. But Comparable allows you to define one way (or one default way) of comparing objects.

Also, I don't know if it would be worth it, but perhaps it would be better to allow comparing "similar" types together (like a Int and a Long state value). In each compareTo implementation, you could do a switch/case on other.getType(), and if it's a similar type to this one, handle the comparison, instead of just doing return false.
