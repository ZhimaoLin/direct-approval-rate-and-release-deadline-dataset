DESCRIPTION

Bug 477808: Use the same E.P. filesystem class from org.eclipse.remote

	The ssh.proxy plugin was implementing a class from the filesystem
	Extension Point (as the org.eclipse.remote does) and it was having
	a weird behaviour in sync projects when setting the correct remote
	includes. It was asking for a "ssh password" when trying to expand
	the includes and even when typing the correct password it was not
	able to expand them.
