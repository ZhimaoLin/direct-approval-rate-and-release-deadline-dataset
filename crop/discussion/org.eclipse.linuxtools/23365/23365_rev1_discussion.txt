DESCRIPTION

Remove dataviewers feature.

It's definetely not something our users should install standalone as it
gives no functionality nor its documented so it can be used as something
to build on.

Hi Alex,

For info, I use this feature in a commercial product.

However, I agree with your statement in the commit message.
Therefore, I'm OK if you remove it.

Hi Xavier, I would let you remove it yourself if you decide. If you don't do it I would take it as you signing for documenting how these things can be used as building blocks. :)
