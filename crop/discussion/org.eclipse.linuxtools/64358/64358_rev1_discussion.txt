Line:21, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/IDockerConnection.java -> You should not import this as the Interface should be client neutral and not require DockerClient.  Just refer to the underlying Docker Client in the docs.  Other than that, please feel free to merge in this patch.

Thanks for the feedback, Arianna Johns. I will fix the IDockerConnection in a new version of the patch then I'll merge it into master.

Line:21, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/IDockerConnection.java -> Right. This is a side effect of the Javadoc and actually, I should not have mentioned the client implementation at all. I'll fix that.
