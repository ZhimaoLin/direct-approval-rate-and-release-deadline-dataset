Will a more thorough review/test once we get closer to merging this one.

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> the view could go in the same package as the analysis module, they go together

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> When we add the possibility to hook a view to an analysis through another extension point, the analysis will go in core, so I'd rater leave it as is
