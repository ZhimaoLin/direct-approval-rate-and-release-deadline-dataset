Minor questions, nothing earth shattering.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> do we need more info? I don't know, I'm asking.

Line:120, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/views/memusage/MemoryUsageViewer.java -> Why divide by 1000? It seems rather arbitrary.
If we want to be in kibibytes should we be using 1024?

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> We don't "need", but do you want more?

Line:120, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/views/memusage/MemoryUsageViewer.java -> I guess the ideal would be to have a scale that depends on the values, in some cases bytes are ok, in others, megabytes would be necessary, but indeed 1024 should be the value here, which should be a class constant and not written here.
