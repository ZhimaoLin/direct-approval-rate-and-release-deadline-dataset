DESCRIPTION

Bug 401638 - Fix missing function tag error on valid gcda file.

Do not attempt to interpret the next four bytes of an unused level
(tag labelled as zero) as the corresponding data length. These
actually represent a seperate tag.

Just some small typos to fix. Am I correct in assuming that this fix need not go into GcnoRecordsParser because in that case the parsing only begins reading the data length for tags that actually match one of the listed types (and not 0) ?

Line:88, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/parser/GcdaRecordsParser.java -> Small typos here, should be  'unused', and 'encountered'.

@Roland: yes, that's why I omitted the fix in the gcno file parser.
