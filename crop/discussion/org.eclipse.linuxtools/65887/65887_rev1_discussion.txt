DESCRIPTION

Lookup for docker-machine and the VM driver should consult PATH first.

Don't wipe out the PATH set by the system when setting user-specified
PATH entry preferences. Instead append additional entries to it.

Patch Set 1:

To be honest, I would be fine with not backporting given how late it is.

This fixes Docker Machine mainly on Linux with VirtualBox, because by default when using the Virtual Box rpm, VBoxManage is not in /usr/local/bin, but in /usr/bin , so I ended up having Docker Machine discovery fail. It's unlikely the user would figure out that they need to make the path '/usr/bin', but all these paths are on the system path by default for Linux, hence the motivation for this change.

As for Windows/Mac, We should probably keep whatever was on the original system path anyways.
