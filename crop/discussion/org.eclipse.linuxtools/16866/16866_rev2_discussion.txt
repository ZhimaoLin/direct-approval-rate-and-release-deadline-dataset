DESCRIPTION

Specify target runtime environments in build

This gets rid of the warnings "No explicit target runtime environment
configuration. Build is platform dependent".
This also allows cross-compiling. The Linux tools p2 repo can now be
built on Windows and Mac.

> Do we really want/support Linux PowerPC?

It doesn't really matter anyway since we don't have anything specific for powerpc but I removed it since it seemed out of place.

Looks good to me, but someone else must approve. (<- trailing space)

Patch Set 2:

We do have additional ppc/ppc64/arm/s390/s390x and soon even aarch64 builds of Linux Tools, I haven't tried building on these archs now but rebuilding from source on them should still be supported.

Wainer, no ppc/ppc64 will be a problem for you, right?

Give it -1 so it doesn't get committed till the situation is cleared.

Patch Set 2:

ppc/ppc64/arm/s390/s390x can still be built. We would only need to add them to the targets if the repo had features, plugins or fragments specific to those architectures. 

The way I understand it, the target runtime environments act as a mask to match with the Eclipse-Platformfilter, etc. But we only have linux and linux+macosx (valgrind) filters. So, as long as we have a linux target environment, it matches everything. As a test, I built the p2 repo on Windows and tested if I could still install TMF on Windows and it worked.

Also, since there is no architecture specific artifact in the repo I tried this

<environment>
    <os>linux</os>
</environment>

but this resulted in a NPE.

I've faced heap out-of-memory issues to build linuxtools on ppc64 with this patch although I don't believe it is related with. I am going to find another machine to give it a try and let you posted

Patch Set 2:

I do get a heap out-of-memory issue with or without the patch on OSX (64 bit). I always had to increase it with MAVEN_OPTS.

export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m

Let's get it in to not block others and if a problem arise I would have to fix it myself as a penalty for not finding time to check now :).
