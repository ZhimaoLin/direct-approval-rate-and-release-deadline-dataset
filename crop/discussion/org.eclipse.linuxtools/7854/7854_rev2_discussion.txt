DESCRIPTION

Make sure a launch provider exists for a plug-in when using a plug-in id.

If a plug-in id is acquired from the preferences, it's possible that
the plug-in corresponding to that id is not present. To prevent that,
a simple check is done, given the plug-in id, to make sure the launch
provider exists for the corresponding plug-in.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

Just a small fix but everything else looks fine.

Line:40, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/launch/ProviderLaunchShortcut.java -> There should probably be a space between ':' and 'type'.
