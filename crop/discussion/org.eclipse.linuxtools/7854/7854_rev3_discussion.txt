DESCRIPTION

Make sure a launch provider exists for a plug-in when using a plug-in id.

If a plug-in id is acquired from the preferences, it's possible that
the plug-in corresponding to that id is not present. To prevent that,
a simple check is done, given the plug-in id, to make sure the launch
provider exists for the corresponding plug-in.
