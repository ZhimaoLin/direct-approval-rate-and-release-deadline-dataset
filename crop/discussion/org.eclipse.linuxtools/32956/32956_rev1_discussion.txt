It works fine. Small comments

Line:25, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.releng-site/category.xml -> I would prefer to have in a separate category than the main category, e.g. "LTTng Extras" or similar. Later on we could add an example feature there.

File Comment: lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.testing/p2.inf -> Do we need that? We don't have that feature on the Linux Tools update site?

File Comment: lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.testing/p2.inf -> Thought about this one. We'll need one later for Trace Compass. So, maybe keep it in.
