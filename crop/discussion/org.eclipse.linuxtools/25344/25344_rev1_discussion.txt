Looks good.

It's the same either way, but should the "lttng2" feature include lttng2.kernel and lttng2.ust, instead of tmf.ctf directly?

Patch Set 1:

I see what you mean. I don't have a strong argument for and against it. The only reason I'd like to keep tmf.ctf in lttng.kernel and lttng.ust is that is more explicit that it depends on TMF than including lttng2 only.
