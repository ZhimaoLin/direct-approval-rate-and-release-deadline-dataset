Line:256, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> Seems like a very long explanation for a tool tip, almost like a user guide. Here is my suggestion for a shorter tool tip: "Prefix with '/' to enter a path where subfields are separated by '/'. For an uninterpreted slash use '//'."

Line:155, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/filter/model/TmfFilterTreeNode.java -> There is already a method, ITmfEventField.getSubField(String...)

Line:183, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/filter/model/TmfFilterTreeNode.java -> If you would have a field that starts with slash like '/a', I guess it would work with '///a' but would we want it to work with '//a' instead?

Line:193, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/filter/model/TmfFilterTreeNode.java -> I'm not sure I understand the complexity. Could you not just check if next char is also a '/' then add a '/' to the sb and increment i, otherwise split?
