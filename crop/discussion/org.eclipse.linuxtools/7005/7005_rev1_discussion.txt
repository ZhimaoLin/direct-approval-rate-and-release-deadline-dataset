Patch Set 1: Fails; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

(2 inline comments)

Check the inline comments, they're not stoppers, but might be good to keep in mind for afterwards.

Looks very refreshing!

Unfortunately it fails to merge at the moment, we'll just have to wait for the dependencies to get in first.

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/util/TmfFixedArray.java -> Unrelated to this cleanup commit, but Eclipse Juno requires Java 6 anyway, so there is no need to support versions earlier than that.

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/util/TmfFixedArray.java -> This comment could be on its own line with a FIXME in front, not very important though.
