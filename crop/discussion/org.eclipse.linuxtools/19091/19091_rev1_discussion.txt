DESCRIPTION

ctf: Throw CTFReaderException in the BitBuffer API

Instead of the hard-to-catch BufferOverflowException. This ensures
that users of the library handle cases where the trace reader fails
to read correctly (corrupted traces, twisted test traces, etc.)

The "return null" part bothers me a bit, but I haven't managed to make it blow up yet.

Line:447, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> I'm a bit uncomfortable with this. Before, this method was guaranteed to return non-null. And its only caller doesn't check for null.
