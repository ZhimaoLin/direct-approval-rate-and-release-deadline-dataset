DESCRIPTION

This code is used buy subsequent commits of Gcov/Gprof.
 - CProjectBuildHelpers.java :
    Contains methods to programtically enable project settings,
    also methods to identify project types
    also methods to rebuild projects. (needed after enabling settings)

 - MessageDialogSyncedRunnable.java:
 	Extended MessageDialogue to work from background threads.

 	Message Dialogue with radio options. Neat way to seperate
 	GUI and functional code.
