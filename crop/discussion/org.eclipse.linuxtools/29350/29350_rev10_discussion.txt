DESCRIPTION

Bug 408543 - Implemented Shared api for enabling checkboxes programatically

This code is used buy subsequent commits of Gcov/Gprof.
 - CProjectBuildHelpers.java :
    Contains methods to programtically enable project settings,
    also methods to identify project types
    also methods to rebuild projects. (needed after enabling settings)

 - MessageDialogSyncedRunnable.java:
 	Extended MessageDialogue to work from background threads.

 - TitleAreaDialogWithRadioButtons.java:
 	Message Dialogue with radio options. Neat way to seperate
 	GUI and functional code.

Line:12, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/ui/ProfilingMessages.properties -> Probably better to say Error getting project type

Line:13, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/ui/ProfilingMessages.properties -> I don't think the user will know why you are capitalizing Option (I presume because it is a class).  I would suggest using lower-case.

Line:16, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/ui/ProfilingMessages.properties -> Again I would suggest you don't capitalize Tool in this context and perhaps explain a little more if appropriate: Failed to find compiler tool name for project (if you are looking for compiler tool).
