DESCRIPTION

tmf: Merge history builder to state system analysis module

The state system analysis module acts as kind of a state system
factory. There is no need to have a separate TmfStateSystemFactory
and HistoryBuilder class. 

Merging the history builder functionality to the state system
analysis module also allows for better handling of requests to
analyze the trace. Now it's possible to cancel the analysis job.

Later on, when all state systems (e.g. statistic state systems) are
built using the state system analysis module the TmfStateSystemFactory
and HistoryBuilder can be removed.
