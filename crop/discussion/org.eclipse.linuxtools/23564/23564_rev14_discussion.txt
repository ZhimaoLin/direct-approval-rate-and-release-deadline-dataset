Patch Set 14: Code-Review-1

Small fix to actually make the 'ILttngRelaydConnector relayd' instance to get closed (the warning was only visible with the "potential leaks" setting enabled, which we should enable eventually...)

Please check the comments on patch set 13 (size + the enum comment), they still apply.
