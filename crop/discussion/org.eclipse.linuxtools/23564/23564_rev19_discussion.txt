Just two small things (version number in Manifest and NewStreamsRequest).

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/core/relayd/lttngviewerCommands/ListSessionsResponse.java -> Just a note, if you mix up different Immutable* types in the same file, don't import the Builder's, it would get confusing. Safer to use Immutable*.Builder every time.

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/core/relayd/lttngviewerCommands/NewStreamsRequest.java -> How does this field get set? You .putLong() it in a bytebuffer below, who knows what gets put in there! The field should be final, which would expose the not-set error.

Also this class isn't used by anything, expected?

Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/core/relayd/lttngviewerCommands/TracePacketResponse.java -> At least you say "please" ;)

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Remove the version number. Eclipse just puts it by default because that's what we had when we imported it, but it's arbitrary. This code would compile fine with Guava 11.x, and we just artificially prevent it from working.

Unless we actively research which exact version is the minimum that works, we should not put anything.
