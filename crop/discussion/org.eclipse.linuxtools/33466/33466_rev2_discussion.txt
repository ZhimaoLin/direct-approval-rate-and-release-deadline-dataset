Not yet in master. I will cherry-pick it right after it's in 3.1.

Patch Set 2:

Also just a note, it would probably be safer to delete the Change-Id from previous commits when creating a new one. It might confuse Gerrit it two of those commits end up in the same branch.

Patch Set 2:

gerrit gives the same change-id to patches that one cherry-picks via gerrit so it should be ok.  It seems to only take the last change-id as the one for the patch.
