DESCRIPTION

TMF: New abstract time graph view when entries are not per trace

In the default abstract time graph view, the entry list is linked to a trace
but in some cases, it should be linked with an object of a trace, modified
after an action on another view.  The new abstract class
TmfAbstracTimeGraphPerObjectView should be used for those cases.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

This is an override of A behavior of the abstract time graph view. Other overrides will come, for instance, a possibility to fetch entries' data in other ways than line by line.

Instead of having an abstract class for all of those behaviors and others to sum those behaviors, we should have a way to override those behaviors with code snippets that could be registered to the class. This way, no abstract class is necessary, but we would have a few little classes to provide different behaviors.

Abandoned

With recent changes to abstract time graph view, we should be able to use what is there to have this behavior.
