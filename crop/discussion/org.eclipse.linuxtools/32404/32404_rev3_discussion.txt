DESCRIPTION

TMF: added support for process filter in the TimeGraphFilterDialog.

On top of the filter dialog a text field enables filtering over the
tree of process names.

A node of the tree is shown if:
- the node matches with the search pattern
- one of the children of the node matches with the search pattern
- one of the parents of the node matches with the search pattern

The buttons check-all and check-subtree check only the visible items.
The button uncheck-subtree unchecks all the children (the hidden
children too, since it makes no sense a checked child with an unchecked
parent).
The button uncheck-all unchecks everything, except the hidden roots
(and corresponding subtrees).
