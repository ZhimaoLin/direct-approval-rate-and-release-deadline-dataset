DESCRIPTION

TMF: added support for process filter in the TimeGraphFilterDialog.

On top of the filter dialog a text field has been added, enabling
filtering over the tree of process names.

A node of the tree is shown if:
- the node matches with the search pattern
- one of the children of the node matches with the search pattern
- one of the parents of the node matches with the search pattern

The buttons check-all and check-subtree check only the visible items.
The button uncheck-subtree unchecks all the children (the hidden
children too, since it makes no sense a checked child with an unchecked
parent).
The button uncheck-all unchecks everything, except the hidden roots
(and corresponding subtrees).

Thank you for the contribution.

We would like you to explore further the possibility of using a FilteredTree to wrap the CheckboxTreeViewer. It seems like it already does a lot of was is required, such as the handling of the filter text control and the pattern matching.

It might require some small modifications or extensions so that it behaves in the same way as your proposal, but in the end if it can be achieved, there would be less code to maintain.

Line:306, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> You might be able to use FilteredTree with a PatternFilter instead.

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TreePatternFilter.java -> To be able to use PatternFilter, we could instead modify or wrap the TreeLabelProvider so that it implements ILabelProvider.
