Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The current behaviour of the 'New' wizard was implemented by Alex to prevent failures when attempting to save to the system root directory[0]. Also, if you save a script somewhere in the file system it will not be added to your workspace automatically; you'll have to manually import the script folder.

Marking -1 for further discussion.
