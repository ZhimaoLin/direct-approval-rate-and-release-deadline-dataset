Mainly TmfTraceStub3's constructor I'm wondering about.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> elements

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfTraceStub2.java -> this is done automatically by the compiler, no need to call it. Doesn't hurt, in any case.

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfTraceStub3.java -> same

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfTraceStub3.java -> nobody calls this, what is it for?

Line:140, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> Not sure if it's worth changing this, once we remove AutoCloseable from IAnalysisModule, this will become an _error_! *gasp*

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfTraceStub2.java -> Actually, since it is now a tracetype in the plugin.xml, it is mandatory to have a real default constructor, or else the class cannot be built. I guess the compilers don't do it right!

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfTraceStub3.java -> Here too, to be in the plugin.xml, it needs to be there, or else it won't work.

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfTraceStub3.java -> Might as well have a constructor that actually does something, right? Copy pasted from TmfTraceStub2, but it is not required. Somebody can add it later when/if it is needed

Line:140, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> And we'll go back to the original version then! :D
