Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

The number of changed lines shown in Gerrit exceeds 250. However, a new class was introduced (TmfWithFolderElement) and code was moved from an existing class (TmfTraceElement) to this new class. Considering this the actual change is far below 250 lines and it can be submitted without CQ.
