DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add supplementary folder to experiments

Just like traces, experiments can save information in supplementary files
on disk (see bug 400949).
* TmfExperiment constructors are modified/added to receive a IResource as
  parameter
* Call to constructors are modified in the .ui code to add the resources

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There a few things to add to your solution:
1) a trace and experiment could have the same name -> in your current solution the supplementary folder for trace and experiment will have the same name. This will cause a problem. Maybe a solution would be to add a suffix to  experiment supplementary folder name.
2) Deleting of an experiment doesn't delete the supplementary folder -> please add this
3) Copying of an experiment doesn't copy the supplementary folder -> please add
4) Renaming of an experiment doesn't rename the supplementary folder -> please add
5) Consider having an Experiment with traceA and traceB. The experiment has a suppl. file created using traceA and traceB. What happens when deleting traceA or removing traceA from the experiment? Should we remove the experiment suppl. file too because it's invalid after deleting traceA? That's a tricky one.

I hate copy-pasting 10 functions to change nothing in them.  Could TmfExperimentElement inherit from TmfTraceElement, or have them both extend an abstract TmfWithFolderElement who itself extends the TmfProjectModelElement?  That would prevent copying so much code...

I haven't looked at this in detail, but copy-pasting code is bad. Consolidating code is good!

I'm consolidating!
Unfortunately, that'll be more than 250 lines... :(  But reusing code doesn't count right?

Patch Set 1:

Correct, the 250 line soft-limit applies only to new code/comments that the contributor writes. Just renaming a 8000-line file doesn't mean you wrote 8000 lines ;)
