Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

The number of changed lines shown in Gerrit exceeds 250. However, a new class was introduced (TmfWithFolderElement) and code was moved from an existing class (TmfTraceElement) to this new class. Considering this the actual change is far below 250 lines and it can be submitted without CQ.

Patch Set 4: (4 inline comments)

I added some pedantic comments, feel free to push it anyway if you feel they're not worth it ;)

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> There should be a small description of this constructor. Can be a couple words, it's just so something shows up for this method in the generated Javadoc.

Line:117, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> Here too, missing description. The whole comment should be Ctrl+Shift+F'ed too.

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfWithFolderElement.java -> To be pedantic, I wouldn't remove the copyright from the original file, since the contents hasn't changed. So it would become:

Copyright (c) 2010-2013 Ericsson, École Polytechnique de Montréal

You could keep the original contributors too and add yourself to it.

Line:242, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> one \n too many
