This is implemented as popup menu action while it should be either a quick fix or hyplerlink listener proposing to create it when activated. No such menu should appear.

Line:46, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/tests/actions/CreatePatchesTest.java -> I think it's not needed to override here.

Line:59, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/actions/SpecfileEditorCreatePatchesActionDelegate.java -> Please don't write such things in message console. THis is just distraction for no added value.
