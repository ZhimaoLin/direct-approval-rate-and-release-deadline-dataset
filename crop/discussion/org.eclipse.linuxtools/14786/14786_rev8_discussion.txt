Line:142, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/hyperlink/SourcesFileCreateHyperlink.java -> Please remove this method. Having methods in our classes useful only for test cases is not wanted.

Line:41, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/tests/hyperlink/SourcesFileCreateHyperlinkTest.java -> This test is about SourcesFileHyperlinkDetector so it should be in SourcesFileHyperlinkDetectorTests together with other tests for this class.
