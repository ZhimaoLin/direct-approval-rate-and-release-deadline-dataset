Patch Set 12: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

The functionality for creating a non-existent patch file works for both rpm layouts.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think this is needed in the final commit message. If you have patchsets on top of the original commit that introduce new functionality you feel is important, then you can mention it in the summary message (above). Most of the things listed here can be tracked by comparing the previous patch sets.

Line:21, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/tests/hyperlink/SourcesFileCreateHyperlinkTest.java -> This should be added to the HyperlinkAllTests suite.

Line:84, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/hyperlink/SourcesFileHyperlinkDetector.java -> The general convention is that patches are created locally, and sources are often taken from some remote location, so downloading sources, and creating new patches is acceptable for now.

In the future it might be nice to decide whether to show the download/create action depending on the value of the SOURCE/PATCH macro.

Line:121, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/hyperlink/SourcesFileHyperlinkDetector.java -> According to the javadocs of IContainer, findMember will return null if the resource does not exist, so the second check should not be needed.

Line:125, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/hyperlink/SourcesFileHyperlinkDetector.java -> See above.
