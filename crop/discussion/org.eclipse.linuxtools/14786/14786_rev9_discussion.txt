Line:101, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/tests/hyperlink/SourcesFileHyperlinkDetectorTest.java -> Now we go reverse order. If we have one test method that tests SourcesFileHyperlinkDetector it has to be here. But if the test method tests SourcesFileCreateHyperlink it needs to be in SourcesFileCreateHyperlinkTests.
Aka the two test methods you add will have to be in two different test classes.
Also this test doesn't call SourcesFileCreateHyperlink at all but some method here, this is not viable test as if someone changes SourcesFileCreateHyperlink implementation he might not change it here too and the test will give us false assuarance that things are still working.
