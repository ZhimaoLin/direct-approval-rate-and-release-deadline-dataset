Real implementation should be in SourcesFileHyperlinkDetector.detectHyperlink method where existence of the file should be checked and if it doesn't exist "Create patch $name" should be displayed on activation instead of the current "Open $name".
Also the test as it is now requires one to click on it for the test to continue this is not an option for running the test on automated systems (please keep that in mind). With the different hyperlink action this would be workarounded.

Line:22, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/tests/actions/CreatePatchesTest.java -> Test class should match the name of the class it tests. Aka this should be org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor.tests.hyperlink.SourceFileHyperlinkDetectorTest

Line:91, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/hyperlink/SourcesFileHyperlink.java -> This class shouldn't be touched at all.
