Line:225, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/resources/ResourcesPresentationProvider.java -> The event time is the start of this USERMODE or SYSCALL state. The TID can change many times during the same state event. We would need to know and use the time that corresponds to the current mouse position. This may require an API change.

Patch Set 1: Fails

Very good idea.

Unfortunately it's a bit more complex with the Resource view, since you could have a sched_switch that switches from one process in syscall state to another process in syscall state, for example. The resulting sub-attribute of the CPU won't know about it and will contain only one long "syscall" state. See Patrick's inline comment. We could help you with this if needed.

The comments from I101d05b4 also apply here.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Since this requires an API-breaking change, it has been implemented with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/7714/ in lttng-kepler branch.

This change should be abandoned.
