DESCRIPTION

Bug 493752 - Docker Machine preferences page causes all other Docker preference pages to be invalid

Preference page is now valid if path to Docker Machine and
VM driver are empty. If the Docker Machine directory is valid
but does not contain the expected 'docker-machine' executable,
a warning is displayed.
If the directory paths are invalid, an error is displayed.
