DESCRIPTION

Bug 475883 - Add "Refresh" commands in the containers and images categories

Removed the 'Refresh' button in the Docker Explorer view toolbar
 as it was confusing and somehow misleading (it would reload
 the connections, that's all)
Added a single 'Refresh' command handler on the 'Containers' and 'Images'
  The 'Refresh' command associated with this handler
  is the default Eclipse 'Refresh' command, so the user can invoke
  the command from the 'File>Refresh' menu.

Refactored the IDockerConnectionManagerListener to specify the
 actual connection that was changed
Remove IDockerConnectionManagerListener implementation in both
 DockerContainersView and DockerImagesView since those views
 already respond to selection changes in the Docker Explorer view.
Changes above fix the problem where a connection with the same hash
 (eg: a connection was removed and then added back) would end up
 with the old DockerExplorerView$ContainerRefresher instance being
 registered instead of the new one.

Added groups for commands and specified the order in which commands
 should appear in the context menus (some declarations in plugin.xml
 were moved to ease the reading of the chaining between commands)

Added tests to verify that the list of containers and images changes
  in the Docker Explorer after calling the command.
