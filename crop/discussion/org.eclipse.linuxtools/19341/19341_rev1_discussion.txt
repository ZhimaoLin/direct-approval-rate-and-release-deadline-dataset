DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix concurrency issues in histogram view

- Make sure signals sent to itself with the signal throttler are
executed in the UI thread, so that Histogram.clear() doesn't
concurrently set fScaledData to null

- Clear the drag state when Histogram.clear() is called so that
subsequent mouse operations don't need to protect from clear during drag

- Prevent the trace updated signal from constantly resetting the
histogram range so that trace indexing doesn't interfere with drag move
and drag zoom

Line:585, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramView.java -> Removing these 2 lines causes the mouse wheel zoom not to work anymore.
