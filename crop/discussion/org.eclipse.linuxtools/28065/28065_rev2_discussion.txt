One comment:

Maybe we should decouple the concept of "common base classes to make views" from "views implemented using SWTChart". Perhaps the section you added could be called "Base implementation for views" or similar, and within it mention SWTChart.

The timegraph view for instance is not using SWTChart, but it's a core feature that is often used!

Line:741, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> This package is not specific to SWTChart though.

Hi Alex

good point about having a section about common view implementations and list other base class (time graph or tree).

I'll see what I can come up.

Line:741, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> I know, but it is relevant to the chart support
