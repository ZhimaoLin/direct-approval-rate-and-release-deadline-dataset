DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add Variant field class to CtfTmfEventField

A variant field class was necessary to not lose the name of the variant
field.  The output of a variant field type is now identical to that of
babeltrace.

Modified some comments and added the getFormattedValue to CTFStructField
to correctly handle empty structs.

Removed overriden toString functions that are not overridden anymore.

Looks good, it may need to be improved later when more exotic traces arrive but for now, I say gogogo!
