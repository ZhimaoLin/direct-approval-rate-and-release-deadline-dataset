DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add Variant field class to CtfTmfEventField

A variant field class was necessary to not lose the name of the variant
field.  The output of a variant field type is now identical to that of
babeltrace.

Modified some comments and added the getFormattedValue to CTFStructField
to correctly handle empty structs.
