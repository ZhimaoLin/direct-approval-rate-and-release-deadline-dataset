DESCRIPTION

tmf: TmfStateSystemOperations tweaks

Some tweaks to the new State System Operations class:
- Made it a full static class, with static methods only.
- Throw relevant exceptions back to the user (blame where blame is due!)
- Handle other exceptions accordingly.
- Use switch/case blocks, so we get warnings here if we ever add
  new state value types.
