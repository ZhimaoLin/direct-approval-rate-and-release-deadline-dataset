DESCRIPTION

Fix buffering issues for the Perf Source Disassembly View.

When running perf stat, the standard output stream contains the
program's output which can be of any size so it should be read first.

When running perf source disassembly the standard output stream contains
the relevant data and since it can be rather large in size, this stream
must be consumed first.
