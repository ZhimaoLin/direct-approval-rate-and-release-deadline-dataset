Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I don't like where the JtlWriter is. After our little performance test hack-a-thon, we'll have a clearer idea what to do with it, maybe contribute it to the org.eclipse.test.performance project? Or find another project that implements JMeter already? Or leave it as is?

No problem, this was a proof of concept and your comment is exactly IMO what reviews are for. :)

Abandoned

We're not going to use JMeter, for now at least.
