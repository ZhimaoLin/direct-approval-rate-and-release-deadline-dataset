Patch Set 9: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

This looks good to me. Just some comments to address, and remove extra whitespace. If you do a 'git show' on the commit you should be able to see them more easily.

Line:210, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/launch/provider/launch/ProviderFramework.java -> currentType doesn't seem to be used, so it can be removed from here. 

Line:46, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/launch/CProfilingOptionsTab.java -> This class and ProviderOptionsTab are almost identical except for a few small differences. (one deals with a particular "type" while the other deals with all types (preferring timing), some methods removed, and some methods modified slightly). Would it be possible to define some abstract class and have these inherit override just what they need?

Checked out and tried this change, looks good me. In addition to Roland's comments, there's a description that needs to be defined in plugin.properties.

Line:423, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/plugin.xml -> This description has not been defined in plugin.properties.
