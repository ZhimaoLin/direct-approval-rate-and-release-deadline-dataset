InstanceOf A on Lis<A> makes no sense.

It can only be false if the element is null.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Unfortunately Java allows  you to store any type in a generic
collection. Just cast it to an untyped array and store whatever.

If you use only generics all the way it will hardly happen, but Eclipse is full of raw collections.

E.g. this code does "works"

		List<Integer> v = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		List vv = v;
		vv.add("x");
		System.out.println(v);

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sorry, I missed this comment and approved the commit. I did not know that that is the case, but in this particular patch the lists are declared with correct generic type only a few lines above the changes.
