DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add XML state provider analysis module and XML utilities

This patch adds an analysis module for an XML-defined state system. It does not
actually build the state system, the details will come in another patch.

It also contains the [stripped-down] XML schema definition and the methods to
read an XML file and validate it.

Just rebased it and moved the TmfXmlStrings file to the state provider package (the .model one will become internal).

ready for review

Patch Set 9: Code-Review+1

I'm running out of things to whine about! That's a good sign ;)

"common" for the package name was actually better than "stubs". It's traces that go in there, it's not really implementation stubs.

I didn't notice before, but the name XmlUtils is used in many many many other places, even with just a base Eclipse installation. The name makes sense though (and you haven't namespaced with Tmf* everyting else anyway), so I guess we can live with it.

If you want to change the package name, consider my +1 on that too.

I take your comments into account and will do another patch to correct them later. But now that this one is +1, I'll just merge it ;-)
