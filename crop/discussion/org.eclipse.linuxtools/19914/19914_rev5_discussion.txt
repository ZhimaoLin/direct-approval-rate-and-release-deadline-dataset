DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add XML state provider analysis module and XML utilities

This patch adds an analysis module for an XML-defined state system. It does not
actually build the state system, the details will come in another patch.

It also contains the [stripped-down] XML schema definition and the methods to
read an XML file and validate it.

Still some nits (d'oh!), but after those are corrected, it's ready for the next level of reviews.

Alex, after all, I put the xsd (and test file) for the state provider in its own patch to be reviewed alone, so this patch is really just about code.

Line:166, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlStateProvider.java -> Looks useless, but this method will be filled in upcoming patches ;-)

Line:24, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/model/TmfXmlStrings.java -> Align the =

Line:46, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlStateSystemModule.java -> Oups, I have a feeling Alex will say to override getTrace/setTrace and manage the trace type there ;-)

Next round of review...
