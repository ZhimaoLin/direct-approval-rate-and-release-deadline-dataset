DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add XML state provider analysis module and XML utilities

This patch adds an analysis module for an XML-defined state system. It does not
actually build the state system, the details will come in another patch.

It also contains the XML schema definition and the methods to read an XML file
and validate it.

I corrected a few things, but Florian, I have a question about XmlAbstractProvider vs XmlStateProvider (see below). I'll wait for your answer before pushing again.

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Use NLS.bind instead

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/plugin.properties -> ah non, ce fichier, c'Ã©tait bien 2013...

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlAbstractProvider.java -> Florian, why do you need an abstract state provider? Is it because you expect some other way of expressing a state system?

Could this class be merged with the XmlStateProvider?

Answer

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlAbstractProvider.java -> We can merge it together. The abstract class exists because I use it for the filter. At the beginning, I tkink that the filter must also be a state provider, but with the new progress in the state system query, I thinks that it's better to use directly the existing state system. So the abstract is no necessary anymore.
