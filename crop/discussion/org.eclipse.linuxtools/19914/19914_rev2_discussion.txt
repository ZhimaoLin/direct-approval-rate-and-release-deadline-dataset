DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add Xml state provider analysis module and xml utilities

This patch adds an analysis module for an xml-defined state system. It does not
actually build the state system, the details will come in another patch.

It also contains the xml schema definition and the methods to read an xml file
and validate it.
