DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add XML state provider analysis module and XML utilities

This patch adds an analysis module for an XML-defined state system. It does not
actually build the state system, the details will come in another patch.

It also contains the [stripped-down] XML schema definition and the methods to
read an XML file and validate it.
