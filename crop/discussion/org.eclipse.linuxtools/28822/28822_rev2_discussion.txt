Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> If you are using the AbstractTreeViewer.ALL_LEVELS, then these constant just should not be there. Or else people don't know which one to use, and there's the non-zero chance that someone eventually decides, for some reason, to change the value of this ALL_LEVELS constant and not of the other ones.

Line:958, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Fair enough for the viewer vs tree levels. This is all internal processing anyway, so the user does not need to know all the workings underneath.

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> I believe the user should be expected to use the ALL_LEVELS constant from the class on which the method setAutoExpandLevel() is called. The user should not be concerned about the value or where it comes from. If we (the framework) decide to change the value of any constant in a way that is inconsistent with the three timegraph classes and/or the tree viewer, then that is a change that would not be approved (unless the value is correctly mapped internally between classes).

Unfortunately for you guys, I'm reading a book on Effective Java and I think I'll be getting worst than Alex on API stuff ;-) These classes shouldn't all have made it to the API. If they were internal only it wouldn't matter as much.

But now it's adding 3 public API constants to 3 classes that can all possibly be used interchangeably in calls.

Anyway, we cannot go back and hide these classes, so let's trust future developers/reviewers to not mess things around too much.

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Counting on the programmers's and reviewer's knowledge of the existence of those 3 constants to correctly change something that should in theory never be changed anyway... risky...
