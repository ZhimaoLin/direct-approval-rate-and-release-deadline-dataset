DESCRIPTION

tmf: Mark ITmfEventRequest.handleData's parameter as NonNull

It seems every single event request implementation out there does
a null check on the event it receives in handleData(). TmfEventThread
already does a null check before sending the event to this method,
so it can be xxx@xxx.xxx which avoids a bunch of redundant checks.
