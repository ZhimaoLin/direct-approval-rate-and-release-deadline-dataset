DESCRIPTION

releng: Remove wrong check in promoter.xml

It is checking explicitly for Ant 1.8 which breaks if one has Ant 1.9. As we would better keep this scripts
to the minimum and Ant 1.8 being a commodity nowadays I simply removed the check.

This change seems fine to me. There's no need to force one particular ant version.
