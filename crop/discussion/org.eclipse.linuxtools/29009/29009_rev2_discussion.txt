DESCRIPTION

ctf: Cleanup StructDeclaration

No need to keep separate lists for the fields and values of structs.
A LinkedHashMap preserves the insertion order, and Iterable defines
a specific iteration order.

No apparent performance impact, both versions hover around 975-980 ns/ev
on my machine.

Patch Set 2:

New version doesn't change the behavior anymore (we keep the getFields().put(...) for now). I agree, we'll need some tests to see how to handle that case, then we can revisit that part.
