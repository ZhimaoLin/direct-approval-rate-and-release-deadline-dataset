DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update master branch against the 1.1 baseline

With a baseline installation updated with Linux Tools 1.1, one can now
track which APIs were actually part of 1.1, and which ones should require
bumps to 1.2/2.0.

Some protected fields in CtfTmfEventField were actually not part of 1.1,
so this adjusts their annotations and plugin versions correctly.
