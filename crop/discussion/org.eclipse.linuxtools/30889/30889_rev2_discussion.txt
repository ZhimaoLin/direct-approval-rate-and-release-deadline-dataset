I believe that to fix my review comments you would end up with the original code. Abandon?

Line:106, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/btf/core/trace/BtfTrace.java -> So why do we need the transient keywords?

Line:307, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/btf/core/trace/BtfTrace.java -> Seems less efficient because you have to read the same growing partial line until the '\n' at every iteration.

Also spacing.

Line:106, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/btf/core/trace/BtfTrace.java -> It apparently helps the jdk optimize memory... but I am not convinced.
I won't be pushing this patch any time soon. :)

Line:307, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/btf/core/trace/BtfTrace.java -> yeah. It is.. I was musing.
