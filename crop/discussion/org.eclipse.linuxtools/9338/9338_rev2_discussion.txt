DESCRIPTION

Implement dispose of CTF traces

Dispose method is implemented for CtfTmfTrace and its contained objects.
File streams are closed and references to MappedByteBuffer objects are
cleared. The trace manager is cleared when a trace is removed from the
iterator manager and the trace iterators are disposed.
