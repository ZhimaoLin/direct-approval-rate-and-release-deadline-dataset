DESCRIPTION

TMF: Added the possibility to define analysis outputs in extension point

A new element is added to the o.e.l.tmf.core.analysis extension point to be
able to associate an output to either an analysis (identified by ID) or an
analysis class. That will allow the analysis to be in the .core plugins and
views to be registered to them in the .ui plugins.
