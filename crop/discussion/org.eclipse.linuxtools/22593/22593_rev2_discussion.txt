Patch Set 2:

One thing to consider is whether it's better to grey out an option that isn't supported on some perf versions, or to make it invisible.

If it's greyed out a user knows the option might be available if certain conditions (version) are satisfied. If it's invisible, that could make a user think an option isn't supported at all.
