DESCRIPTION

[TMF] add public getters for fields used in TimeGraphControl.drawState

TimeGraphControl.drawState() is protected, and therefore can be overridden.
Unfortunately, this method uses two private fields: fEventColorMap and
fTimeGraphProvider. Therefore, in order to be able to override this method,
these two fields must have accessible getters.
