DESCRIPTION

tmf: Refactor TMF statistics

Merge TmfBaseStatisticsTree into AbsTmfStatisticsTree. The abstract
version required both total and per-event-type statistics values
anyway, so there was no need to have a separate class that basically
implemented the required stuff.

Also renamed TmfStatisticsTreeNodeFactory to TmfStatisticsManager,
since it's more a manager for the complete stats trees.
