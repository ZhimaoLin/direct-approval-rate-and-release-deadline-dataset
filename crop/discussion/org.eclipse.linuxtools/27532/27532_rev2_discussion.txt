Line:309, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> First sentence: "... a trace type has to be associated" instead of "... a trace type as to be associated"

Line:321, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> "... can be open" -> "... can be opened"

Line:325, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> We never talked about the persistent index. The index is also available for other trace types that implementing that relevant interface (e.g. Custom Parsers). Also, the state system is specific to LTTng Kernel, but there are also other state systems: statistics, Memory usage for UST (non automatic), call stack, cpu usage. Shall we mention these here, too or be here more generic and talk about supplementary files and give some examples.

Line:325, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> As I re-read the paragraph I feel this is internal stuff that is not relevant in this section.
