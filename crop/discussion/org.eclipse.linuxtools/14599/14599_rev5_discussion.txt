DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix Call Stack view event list

With the fix to the event iterator (42acdc2), it is no longer required
to add 'null' events in the zoomed event list to hide underlying events
in the full range event list. This simplifies the building of event list
in the Call Stack view.

If required, 'null' events are added at the start or end of the list to
properly identify the time range that the list represents.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

Looks simple enough. I guess we will see the benefits when we have a specific implementation of the callstack view.
