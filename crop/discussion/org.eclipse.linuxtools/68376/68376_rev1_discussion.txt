DESCRIPTION

Bug 489112: Fix NPE in BuildDockerImageLaunchConfigurationMainTab.

Directly modify boolean value that determines whether the path is
relative or absolute. This also has the added side effect of eliminating
NPEs occuring due to the uninitialized AtomicInteger. Also remove unused
private methods.
