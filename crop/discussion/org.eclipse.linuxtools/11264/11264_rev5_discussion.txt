that other trace extensions can use it.

Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Quick suggestion, I just moved the call to tmf.core.tests.event.lookup.AllTests to the top-level AllTmfCoreTests (which calls every package). This mimics how it's done in tmf.ui.tests.
