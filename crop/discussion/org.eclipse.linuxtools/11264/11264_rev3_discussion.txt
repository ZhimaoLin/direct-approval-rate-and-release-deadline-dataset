that other trace extensions can use it.

Looks good, seems to work fine. I just have some minor comments left.

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/event/lookup/TmfCallsiteTest.java -> It's not necessary to suppress "nls" warnings in tests anymore ;)

Line:185, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEvent.java -> We wouldn't need javadoc if the method is overriden (other than xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/event/AllTests.java -> Shouldn't we have a separte AllTests in tmf.core.tests.event.lookup?

I don't really mind (especially if there's only one), just wondering if it's a common practice or not.
