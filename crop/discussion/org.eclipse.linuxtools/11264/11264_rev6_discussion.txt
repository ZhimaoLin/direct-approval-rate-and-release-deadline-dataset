tmf: Generalize the support for call sites and model URIs

The support for source code and model element look-up had been
specific to CTF. This commit generalizes the implementation so
that other trace extensions can use it.

Line:158, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/event/lookup/TmfCallsiteTest.java -> filename should not be null according to interface (or do we want to allow it?)

Line:46, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> Should we use "Call Site" here?

Line:184, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> I would put line number before function name, to match toString

Line:192, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> useless null check (not supposed to be null, and anyways it would be ok to return null)

Line:647, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> should call displayException

Line:650, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> should call displayException

Patch Set 6: (6 inline comments)

Alex: Change for unit test doesn't change anything. I prefer to keep the hierarchy according to the packages.
Patrick: see comments below

Line:158, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/event/lookup/TmfCallsiteTest.java -> I'll change the constructor so that it throws an IllegallArgumentExeption when filename is null.

Line:46, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> Done

Line:184, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> Done

Line:192, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> I would keep that because if some other extension than CtfTmfEvent returns null there would be null pointer exceptions all over the place when selecting a event in table

Line:647, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Done

Line:650, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Done
