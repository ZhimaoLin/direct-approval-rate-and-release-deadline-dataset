DESCRIPTION

Bug 493863 - Opening a volume in Docker explorer silently fails

- add new VolumePropertyTester class which has hasHostPath property
  that means there is a local host path for the volume (false
  when connection is remote or volume is not linked to host path)
- change the handler for Show In->System Explorer to be enabled
  only when there is a local host path as determined by the
  VolumePropertyTester
