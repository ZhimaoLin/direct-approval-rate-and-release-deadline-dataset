DESCRIPTION

Lttng: smoke test

This is a sample of how to make a test using SWTBOT.
It should be a useful stepping stone to gain test
case coverage and control what we're reading.

The test features:
* opening a trace
* navigation in a trace
* testing lttng kernel perspective

What would be nice to have:
* closing a trace
* test views more thoroughly
* all the other functional test on all the trace types!
