DESCRIPTION

tmf: Support tool tip for arrows in time graph

The tool tip will show the time link event information of the closest
arrow to the mouse position, provided that it is within 5 pixels.
Holding the Shift key will disable the arrow tool tip so that the tool
tip can show the information of the underlying state.
