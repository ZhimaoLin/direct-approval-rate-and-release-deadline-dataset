DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a debugging test Suite

When a test suite is run with the new DebugSuite runner, the name
of every test being run will be printed to stdout. It's not used
by default, but it can be manually switched to. This can help debug
unit tests, especially when run from Maven.

Patch Set 2:

I still haven't managed to make a suite/runner that can add a xxx@xxx.xxx (like a timeout) to all the tests it runs... but this should be a start!
