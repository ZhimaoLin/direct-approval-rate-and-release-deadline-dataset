Only this smallish comment, while you're working on the previous patches.

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseWheelZoomProvider.java -> I was about to write the same comment as in previous patches, but here you don't do the if clause in the deregister() method. For sake of unification, it should be the same way as the other classes, either this or remove this method and add the if statement in the deregister.

And another thing. Would it be possible to center the zoom on the mouse position, like it is for the control flow view?

I will also change the implementation to center the zoom to the x position as it is done in the control flow view
Thanks,
