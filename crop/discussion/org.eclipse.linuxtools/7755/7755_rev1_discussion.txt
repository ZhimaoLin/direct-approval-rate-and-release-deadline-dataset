DESCRIPTION

Fix BZ #389293 by making launch shortcut behvaiour consistent.

When launching a shortcut using a provider type (eg. memory, time,
snapshot), the user will be prompted to select any launch configuration
that may apply. The user should also be given the option to select a
launch configuration corresponding to the provider listed in the
preference page.
