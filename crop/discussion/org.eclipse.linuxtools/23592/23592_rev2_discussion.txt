Patch Set 2:

"However, it doesn't warn that the Session Path is empty, and if that is empty, it fails to start the session. Anything planned on that front?"

Something is weird with your environment, it should default to $HOME/lttng-traces

Nice improvement.

About the session path. If it not set in the dialog box no path will be passed to the remote (-o option won't be used) and the tracer on the remote will use its default and that is $HOME/lttng-traces. So, as Marc-Andre said something must have been wrong on your remote setup.
