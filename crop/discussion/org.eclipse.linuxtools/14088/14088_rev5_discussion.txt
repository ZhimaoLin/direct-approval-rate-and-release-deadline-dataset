DESCRIPTION

ctf: Fix buffer overflow traces from crashing batch import

Buffer overflows are caused here by synthetic traces that aim to
behave maliciously. The parser already handles these attacks, but
the BufferOverflowException will cause the batch import trace wizard
to stop scanning. This fix catches buffer overflows in the validation
and warns that the error is serious.
