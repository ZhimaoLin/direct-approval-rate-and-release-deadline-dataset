DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add an Eclipse builder for the doc plugin

Splitted out the download-from-Eclipse-wiki task into a
separate target, which will only run manually.

Also did some small changes so that no user-editing of the
build file is required.

Patch Set 2:

It works. However, everytime the workspace is built (e.g. after code change) the help plug-in is built, too, regard if there are changes or not. I'm not sure if this is wanted.
