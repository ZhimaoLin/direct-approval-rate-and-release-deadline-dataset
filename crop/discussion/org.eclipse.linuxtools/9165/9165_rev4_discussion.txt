DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add an Eclipse builder for the doc plugin

Removed all committed .html and .xml documentation files
from the tree. Those can now be built either from Eclipse
(with right-click -> Run As -> Ant Build), or with Maven.

Splitted out the download-from-Eclipse-wiki task into a
separate target, which will only run manually.

Also did some small changes so that no user-editing of the
build file is required, except if you want to use a proxy
for the download.
