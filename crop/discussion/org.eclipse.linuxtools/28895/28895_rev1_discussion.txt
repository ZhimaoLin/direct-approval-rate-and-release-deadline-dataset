Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

What calling the super() does in this case is call the TmfComponent constructor and add the modules to the signal manager.

Alex implemented this, are those 2 modules meant to be registered to signal manager or not (since they are submodules of the TmfStatisticsModule)? If not, then they should be de-registered after the super() call.

Alex, can you confirm?
-1 until then

"are those 2 modules meant to be registered to signal manager or not"

They will need to be registered for Live reading. I still think it makes sense that they call super until then. But Alex can comment.

Patch Set 1:

As long as they are de-registered in the dispose() it should be fine (and here, the superclass's dispose() does super.dispose() until it does so).
