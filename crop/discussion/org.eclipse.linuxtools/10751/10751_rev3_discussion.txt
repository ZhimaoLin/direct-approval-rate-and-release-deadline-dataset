Line:481, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> This method is never called, is it needed for another feature?
Normally it is the TmfNavigatorContentProvider that creates the instances.

Line:481, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> It is indeed needed for another feature, but I actually need the trace right away after that.  I'm not sure how I can postpone what I need to do to the trace (set a synchronization formula) to when it is actually cleanly and fully created by TMF...

Line:481, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Probably not... the copy will trigger a resourceChanged event which will be handled by the TmfProjectElement to trigger a refresh in an asyncExec.
