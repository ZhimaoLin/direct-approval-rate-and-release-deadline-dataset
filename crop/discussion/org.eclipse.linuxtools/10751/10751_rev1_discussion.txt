Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> We don't need to close a trace when we remove it from an experiment. But anyways this code will not do anything because the bookmarks file for an experiment trace is different from the bookmarks file for a trace folder trace, while opening an experiment trace will always open the trace folder trace. So the editor input can never match.
