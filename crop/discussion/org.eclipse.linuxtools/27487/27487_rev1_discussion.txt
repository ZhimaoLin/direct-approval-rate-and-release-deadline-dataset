Line:174, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> You either need to add a default message here or rethrow the Exception so that you aren't passing back a null msg for the dialog.  My suggestion would be to rethrow the error and note that this should never happen.

Line:12, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> You still need to note that the data files for Gcov are missing.

Line:14, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> Awkward.  How about something like: "Please enable Gcov support in the Autotools Configure Settings or optionally add the required compiler flags: -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage to your compilation and linking.   The Autotools Configure Settings can be found as follows .....  You will need to rebuild with these options and then re-launch Gcov."

Line:19, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> You could have something similar here to the Autotools which would be: "Please enable the Gcov support in your Build Settings or optionally add the required compiler flags: -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage for both compilation and linking.  The Build Settings for the compiler can be found as follows: ..... You will need to perform a rebuild of your project and then re-launch Gcov"
