DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move default tracing project name to common constants

Currently, the default tracing project name "Tracing" is defined
in the RCP only. It makes sense to also create a default project in
other cases such as when importing a trace with no projects in the
workspace so the name needs to be accessible to other plug-ins.

Patch Set 2:

Are we sure we do not want the project name to be externalized?

Makes perfect sense to move it to TMF though. We'll also be able to update the Remote Control import to use that same project name.

Patch Set 2:

The plan was to create a preference for that later on so that it can be adjusted by the user either by plug-in customization or through a preference page (if needed). 

So, for the import/export package implementation a constant is ok.
