DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move default tracing project name to common constants

Currently, the default tracing project name "Tracing" is defined
in the RCP only. It makes sense to also create a default project in
other cases such as when importing a trace with no projects in the
workspace so the name needs to be accessible to other plug-ins.

Patch Set 3:

I externalized the project name again but left it as a constant. That way the constant could be assigned to something else (preference?) later.
