No objections just a question

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> are you sure you want to do this... 
it would mean 
"1 hello world" would have a confidence of 1.75 but "1\nhello\nworld\n" would have a confidence of 4.5

A way to keep it in the  same order of magnitude would be to divide the 1.0 by validationPatterns.size()

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> I think so. I want to support 2 use cases:

a) 2 or more patterns match the same line
b) 2 or more patterns match different lines 

Case a) could be used to increase the confidence for a more specific trace where 1 pattern (e.g. first line of event) would match the same number of times and the same group count. For this case, your comment is applicable, but that would cause the case b) to fail

Case b) is that you have events that have multiple line were line 2 and more have timestamp+content format that would match another trace type.

Are you ok with solution after this explanation?
