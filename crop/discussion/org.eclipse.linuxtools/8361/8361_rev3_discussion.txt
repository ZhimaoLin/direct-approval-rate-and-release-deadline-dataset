DESCRIPTION

Move methods that access the provider framework into separate class.

The ProviderFramework class is created to contain the methods that
access information from the provider extension point. In some cases
certain methods may not be moved/removed as this would break API or
cause o.e.linuxtools.profiling to depend on o.e.linuxtools.provider.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The o.e.l.profiling.provider plug-in depends on functionality provided by o.e.l.profiling.launch to access launch provider extensions points. However, this functionality is redundant in the case where the provider plug-in is unavailable. Taking the functionality of the provider plug-in, and moving it to o.e.l.profiling.launch, would remove this dependency and save the time for creating a separate feature when we are ready to ship.
