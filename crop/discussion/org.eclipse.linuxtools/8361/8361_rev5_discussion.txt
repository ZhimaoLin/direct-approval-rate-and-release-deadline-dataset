DESCRIPTION

Move o.e.l.profiling.provider into o.e.l.profiling.launch.

Move packages, and extensions from the provider plugin into the
profiling launch plugin. Update references as needed.

The ProviderFramework class is created to contain the methods that
access information from the provider extension point. In some cases
certain methods may not be moved/removed as this would break API.
