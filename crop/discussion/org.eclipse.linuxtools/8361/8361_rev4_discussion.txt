DESCRIPTION

Move methods that access the provider framework into separate class.

The ProviderFramework class is created to contain the methods that
access information from the provider extension point. In some cases
certain methods may not be moved/removed as this would break API or
cause o.e.linuxtools.profiling to depend on o.e.linuxtools.provider.

I've removed o.e.l.profiling.provider plugin and put the code as well as extension points in o.e.l.profiling.launch plugin, keeping the package names the same. I've also kept o.e.l.profiling.provider.tests. Let me know your thoughts and any changes I should make.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'll need to update the message to reflect new changes.
