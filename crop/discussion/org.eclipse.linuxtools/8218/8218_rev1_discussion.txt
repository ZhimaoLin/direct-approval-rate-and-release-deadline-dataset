DESCRIPTION

Make profiling unification launch shortcuts appear at top of menu.

Place profiling unification shortcuts (coverage, memory, timing) into
their own group (/linuxtools/category) as defined by the path attribute
of the launch shortcut extension point. This will also ensure they
appear above other standard launch shortcuts.

Temporarily disable provider tests.
