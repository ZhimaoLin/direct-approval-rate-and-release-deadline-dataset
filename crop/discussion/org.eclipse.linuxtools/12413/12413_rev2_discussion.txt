DESCRIPTION

lttng2: Update lttng2 feature dependency to require RSE feature

The lttng2 feature now requires the feature Remote System Explorer
End-User Runtime (org.eclipse.rse) instead of certain RSE plug-ins.
This causes p2 to automatically install the all necessary RSE
features (e.g. ssh shell) features needed by lttng2. Before this
commit the RSE runtime feature had to be installed manually.
