DESCRIPTION

Support for multiple events for same timestamp at checkpoint

If a trace has multiple events with the same timestamps before
a checkpoint and at the checkpoint, the seek to this timestamp 
used to return the event at the checkpoint. The implementation
was changed so that the first event in the trace with this 
timestamp is returned.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

Good test case, one small comment.

I'm a bit concerned about adding yet another 600K binary file though. Couldn't we port the existing TmfCheckpointIndexTest to this new one?

Line:172, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexTest2.java -> Why not use the more simple:

assertEquals(seekTs, event.getTimestamp());

Patch Set 2:

TmfCheckpointIndexTest is testing different this. I didn't want to change this test. I should have created a smaller test file for the new test. I'll upload a smaller binary file.
