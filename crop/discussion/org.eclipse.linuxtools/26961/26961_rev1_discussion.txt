Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review-2

This patch causes the "Profiling Tools" entry in the popup menu to be separated from the "Run/Debug/Profile As" ones. This should be fixed in a future patch set.

Also, the "Run/Debug/Profile As" context menus are still provided by the popupMenus extension point despite it being deprecated. Once those menus are updated with a non-deprecated alternative, the "Profiling Tools" entry should use it as well. Until then, the non-standard implementation used here should suffice.

Abandoned

Leave abandoned until the Eclipse Platform migrates from popupMenus for its own context menu items. (See comment from May 27.)
