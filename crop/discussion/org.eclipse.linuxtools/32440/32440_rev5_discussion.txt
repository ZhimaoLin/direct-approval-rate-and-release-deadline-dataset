Still one small thing I'm not clear on.

Line:847, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/LTTngControlServiceMI.java -> So that is really what is expected here, to use MIStrings.PROBE_ATTRIBUTES for both FUNCTION and PROBE event types?

In that case, MIStrings.FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTES is not used anymore, so could be removed.

Line:847, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/LTTngControlServiceMI.java -> I quickly checked the lttng-tools code. And it looks like that regardless of probe or function-probe the mi will use probe_attributes as attribute string. However, the string function_attributes exists in lttng-tools but is not used when executing lttng list session

function_attributes is used in session profiles, though. 

I'll test it and then we should merge this patch.

Patch Set 5:

I've just tested it and for both probe and function_probe the attribute name is probe_attributes and enabling probe and function_probe events work.

Are you ok that we merge this patch as is?

Ok then, if it was on purpose then it sounds good.

Try to see if you can push it as is ;)
