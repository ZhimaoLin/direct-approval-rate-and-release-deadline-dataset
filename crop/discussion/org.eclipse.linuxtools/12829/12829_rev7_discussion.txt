This won't actually be 2.0, but 2.1. "-2" until 2.0 is out, so we don't merge it by mistake until then.

We might even want to put it in the 3.0 branch, since it should be followed by a complete removal of the old Environment Variables view, which is an API break.

Line:194, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/wizards/Messages.java -> This will xxx@xxx.xxx 2.1, so we will need to wait until 2.0 is out to merge it.
