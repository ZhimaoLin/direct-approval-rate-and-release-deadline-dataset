Patch Set 2: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

You also need to consider the experiment case where we have a collection of traces. The Environment Variables view prints all env. variables for each trace in the experiment.

Also, I would prefer that "Info" is on top. By default the properties view uses alphabetical order. There is small trick to change the order. Patrick can help with that.

Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> "Info" is not a good name. We should find a better name. Also, you should externalise the string.

Line:89, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> You should call it "Environment variables".
Also, you should externalise the categories.

Line:479, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> the 2nd check should be !envVariables.isEmpty() (negate!)
