Patch Set 10: Code-Review-1

Please re-push Patch Set #9 as it was (take it from Gerrit, not from your local branch). It included important fixes, like using a new messages file in the same package. And it was ready for merging too...

The added functionality for traces under experiments could be added in a separate commit.
