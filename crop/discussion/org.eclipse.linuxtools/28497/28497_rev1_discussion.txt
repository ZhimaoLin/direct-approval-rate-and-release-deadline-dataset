DESCRIPTION

ctf: Introducing the FixedLengthStringDefintionThis patch introduces the fixedlength string that will make sequencesand arrays read faster when it's a string, as the ctf spec specifiesthat they are aligned on 8 bits and always 8 bits wide per character.Sequences and arrays can either be ArrayDefinition2s or FixedStringDefintions.This patch gives a 20% acceleration in sequential reading.Change-Id: I7933268b7f9271f74f7d59339ea9b8343fdb021eSigned-off-by: Ivy Mitchell xxx@xxx.xxx
