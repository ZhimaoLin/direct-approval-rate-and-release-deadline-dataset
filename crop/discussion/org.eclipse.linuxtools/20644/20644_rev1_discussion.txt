Seems good to me. Roland, do you want to double check it? There is a sample C file that can be used to show the wrong percentage when profiling attached to the bugzilla.

I haven't tested this out yet but it looks fine to me. I would also push this to our stable-2.2 branch for inclusion in 2.2.1. Thanks for fixing this.
