DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix IndexOOB exception in HT node with concurrent read/write

Similar to bug #432191, but with the History Tree backend. It's possible
for an attribute to be created, sent to the backend, and written to a
node, all while a query is ongoing. (That's a race condition where you
race a Formula 1 against a turtle, but the turtle somehow arrives first).

Simply ignore those new attributes, since their value at time 't' would be
null anyway.
