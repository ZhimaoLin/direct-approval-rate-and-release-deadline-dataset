DESCRIPTION

TMF: Allow XY line chart classes to change the resolution of the viewer

While a resolution of 1 point per pixel shows a good level of precision for
charts showing absolute values at time t (like memory usage charts), it is not
the case when the data to show is a marginal difference with preceding point
(like CPU usage view). In those cases, a lower resolution makes better looking
graphs, so the viewer should be able to set the resolution.
