DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Trace synchronization using network events

* Event matching infrastructure allow to create dependencies between 2 events.
* Network events (TCP packets) are matched for LTTng 2.0 traces, using one of
  two techniques: fgiraldeau's dynamic probe addon module, or an experimental
  branch with additional data on net_* tracepoints of lttng-modules.
* Traces in an experiment are synchronized using the Fully Incremental Convex
  Hull algorithm.
* A trace's timestamps can be modified using Timestamp Transforms classes.
  TmfTimestampTransformLinear takes a slope and/or an offset.
* Once synchronized, the trace is copied, without its supplementary files
  so the state system is regenerated with synchronized time.
* A new synchronization view shows statistics about the synchronization.
* The synchronization information is kept at the experiment level to be able
  to view synchronization's statistics after first sync.
* Synchronization formula for a trace is saved in supplementary files.
* Unit tests for trace synchronization.

(9 comments)

Some minor comments.

Line:249, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> remove this method and use (your) new TraceUtil.displayErrorMsg().

Line:23, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/IMatchProcessingUnit.java -> The author will be part of the generated Java doc. I think you should use your full name instead of an abbreviation (user ID). It's up to you. If you decide to change it, then change it in all the files.

Line:159, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> Please move constructor to the rest of the constructors (above the comment line of ITmfTimestamp)

Line:169, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> We shouldn't use e.printStackTrace(). It should be logged properly. 
I said "we" because it was done right above :-(

Line:72, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/synchronization/TmfSynchronizationView.java -> When opening the view after the synched experiment is opened the view is empty. Could be done in a subsequent commit.

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SynchronizationManager.java -> mention the algorithm name since it is the default algorithm

Line:62, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SynchronizationManager.java -> typo: algorithm

Line:62, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SynchronizationBackend.java -> typo: opened

Line:204, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SynchronizationBackend.java -> shall we log to the error log (see Activator class)?
