DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Trace synchronization using network events

* Event matching infrastructure allow to create dependencies between 2 events.
* Network events (tcp packets) are matched for lttng 2.0 traces, using one of
  two techniques: fgiraldeau's dynamic probe addon module, or an experimental
  branch with additional data on net_* tracepoints of lttng-modules.
* Traces in an experiment are synchronized using the Fully Incremental Convex
  Hull algorithm.
* A trace's timestamps can be modified using Timestamp Transforms classes.
  TmfTimestampTransformLinear takes a slope and/or an offset.
* Once synchronized, the trace is copied, without its supplementary files
  so the state system is regenerated with synchronized time.
* A new synchronization view shows statistics about the synchronization.
* The synchronization information is kept at the experiment level to be able
  to view synchronization's statistics after first sync.
* Synchronization formula for a trace is saved in supplementary files.
* Unit tests for trace synchronization.

very good, careful with the link to gpled code, it's ok, I'm just saying we need to say it's not used while linking to it.

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/TcpEventStrings.java -> interface please?

Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> link please. I think people need to read this to understand what's going on.

Line:30, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpEventMatching.java -> please mention that no code from that is used for the iplog?

"Linking to GPL code" refers to when we link a program to a library (#include, compile with -lsomething, etc.) Putting a URL reference in comments has nothing to do with this ;)

Yes, I want to make sure it's clear. It's not against the contract, but I want to avoid ambiguity.

Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> It is not published yet :(
But I can send it to anyone who's really interested in it in the meantime
