DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Trace synchronization using network events

* Event matching infrastructure allow to create dependencies between 2 events.
* Network events (tcp packets) are matched for lttng 2.0 traces.
* Traces in an experiment are synchronized using the Fully Incremental Convex
  Hull algorithm.
* A trace's timestamps can be modified using Timestamp Transforms classes.
  TmfTimestampTransformLinear takes a slope and/or an offset.
* Once synchronized, the trace is copied, without its supplementary files
  so the state system is regenerated with synchronized time.
* A new synchronization view shows statistics about the synchronization.
* The synchronization information is kept at the experiment level to be able
  to view synchronization's statistics after first sync.
* Synchronization formula for a trace is saved in supplementary files.
* Unit tests for trace synchronization.

* Limitations:
  * only lttng 2.0 traces with a certain module can be synchronized for now.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Hold on before reviewing this.  I'm adding events used for synchronization and also to allow traces to use the same method (eg. TCP packets) but different events/fields (eg. send(a) and recv(b) or send1(b') and recv1(a'))

I'll also take advantage of this rework to preemptively correct some things I know alex will comment on ;-)  Finals, privates, etc :p

Good! Now I don't even have to go out and do it, the reviews happen by themselves! :D
