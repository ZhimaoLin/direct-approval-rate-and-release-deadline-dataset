Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Updated, renamed "offset" to "index", since this isn't really used as a timestamp offset but more as a index (for many events having the same timestamp). Updated the test accordingly.

In some places we still refer to offset instead of index. CWe should change this. Otherwise it looks good.

Line:45, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfLocation.java -> We should also rename offset to index in this class

Line:131, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIterator.java -> we should also rename offset to index here
