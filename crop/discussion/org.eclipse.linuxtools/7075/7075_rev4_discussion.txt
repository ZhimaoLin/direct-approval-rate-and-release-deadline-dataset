Patch Set 4: Fails

Uploaded new patchset with fixes, and added unit tests for CtfLocationData.

Although right now it fails in one place: when comparing the following two LocationData objects:

loc1: timestamp = 1, offset = 0
loc2: timestamp = 5, offset = -4

Shouldn't they be equal (compareTo returns 0)? Or is there some subtlety I'm missing?
