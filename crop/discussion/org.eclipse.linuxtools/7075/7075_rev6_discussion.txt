Patch Set 6: Verified; IP review completed

Thanks Meredith Scott, I hadn't checked in other files. I changed the nomenclature to "index" in CtfIterator and CtfLocation too.

In one place I left the offsetTimestamp, since it was actually about the trace's offset, so even better reason to choose a new name!
