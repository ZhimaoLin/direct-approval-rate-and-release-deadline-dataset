Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

The implementation looks good. However, some of the test cases were not updated and there a compilation errors. Maybe you forgot to commit the test cases update.
See:
CtfIteratorTest.java
CtfLocationTest.java
CtfTmfTraceTest.java

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfLocation.java -> version is 2.0

Line:58, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfLocation.java -> Move this variable up before the methods and constructors
