(3 inline comments)

Some minor fixes and suggestions about handling state of widgets.

Line:34, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptLaunchConfigurationTab.java -> These strings should be marked as not needing externalization. (NON-NLS)

Line:121, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptLaunchConfigurationTab.java -> This should probably be just updateLaunchConfigurationDialog().

Line:209, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptLaunchConfigurationTab.java -> I think this checkbox selection logic for the two groups should be placed in a separate method that is called both in initializeFrom and in the relevant listeners. This should keep the selection state of the widgets correct initially and as they are being selected/de-selected.
