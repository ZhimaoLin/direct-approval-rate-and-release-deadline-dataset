DESCRIPTION

Fix OSIO Rest model to use username in task id

- change OSIO Rest code to always integrate the username in the
  task id (username/spacename#widnumber)
- add getExternalSpaces() method to OSIORestConfiguration to get
  Map of externally owned Spaces that aren't owned by the logged-in user
- add code everywhere to look first for Spaces in
  the main cached list, but then to use the external list
  to handle the case where the work item is in a space not owned
  by the current logged-in user
- if the external space list does not have the Space id, use the
  Space id from a work item to fetch the Space and its associated
  Area, Iteration, etc.. subsequently in OSIORestGetTaskData and
  OSIORestGetSingleTaskData
- change OSIORestClient to expose the methods that get
  WorkItemTypes, WorkItemLinkTypes, Areas, Iterations from the
  Space as public methods
- fix OSIORestSearchQueryPageSchema to use a different label for
  the Assignees field that doesn't refer to removing items
- make Version field of OSIORestTaskSchema read-only
- fix getURLSuffix() method of OSIORestConnector to look for
  "/api/" instead of "/api" which might match for the first 3 chars
  of the URL host
- add componentType field to WorkItemTypeFieldType class
- add new classes AbstractQueryPageSchema, QueryPageDetails,
  QueryPageFilter, QueryPageSearch, RepositoryQuerySchemaPage,
  SimpleURLQueryPageSchema to reduce internal Mylyn classes used
  and to allow tweaking of the Query form page UI
- add new classes SingleRestResponse, SpaceSingleResponse,
  and UserSingleResponse
