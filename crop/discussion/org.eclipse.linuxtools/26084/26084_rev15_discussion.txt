DESCRIPTION

ctf: Introducing the ByteArrayDefinition

This patch introduces a special acceleration that will make sequences
and arrays read faster when it's an array of bytes or a  string, as the
CTF spec specifies that they are aligned on 8 bits and always 8 bits wide
per character.

Sequences and arrays can either be ArrayDefinitions or
ByteArrayDefintions.

This patch gives a 20% acceleration in sequential reading.
