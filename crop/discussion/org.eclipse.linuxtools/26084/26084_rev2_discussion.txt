DESCRIPTION

ctf: Introducing the FixedLengthStringDefintion

This patch introduces the fixedlength string that will make sequences
and arrays read faster when it's a string, as the ctf spec specifies
that they are aligned on 8 bits and always 8 bits wide per character.

It also offers a cleanup to struct and variant as they now are
ScopedDefintions and sequences and arrays can either be
CompoundDefinitions or FixedLengthStringDefintions.

This patch gives a 20% acceleration in sequential reading.
