DESCRIPTION

tmf: Eliminate lesser constructors in TmfTrace

It's becoming very hard to figure out which exact constructor
is being called, and the resulting program flow. Remove the
intermediate constructors in TmfTrace and redirect implementations
to the full one.

Improved the Javadoc at the same time, to mention which default
values can be used.
