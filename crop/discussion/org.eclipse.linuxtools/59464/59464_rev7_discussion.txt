DESCRIPTION

Bug 474196 - Add options to Image build launcher

Added options to
- quiet build
- no cache
- remove intermediate containers on successful build
- always remove intermediate containers
- repo/tag

Build configuration name is generated after the image name (repo + tag)
 when available, or falls back to default "DockerFile[<projectName>]" pattern.

Moved ImageNameValidator in a separate class to reuse across wizards
Moved pattern to match image name in DockerImageName for reuse accross
  classes
