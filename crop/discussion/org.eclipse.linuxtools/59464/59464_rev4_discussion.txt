DESCRIPTION

Bug 474196 - Add options to Image build launcher

Added options to
- quiet build
- no cache
- remove intermediate containers on successful build
- always remove intermediate containers
- repo/tag

Build configuration name is generated after the image name (repo + tag)
 when available, or falls back to default "DockerFile[<projectName>]" pattern.

Removed unused createContainer() method in IDockerConnection.
Moved ImageNameValidator in a separate class to reuse across wizards
Moved pattern to match image name in DockerImageName for reuse accross
  classes

Line:1186, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> Again, don't remove these because they are exposed as public API in the IDockerConnection.

Line:193, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/IDockerConnection.java -> Do not remove any APIs for this release since it is a minor release.  Removal has to wait until Neon which will be 5.0.0 and a major release boundary.
