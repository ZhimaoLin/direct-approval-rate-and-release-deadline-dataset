DESCRIPTION

lttng: Enable "potential resource leak" warnings

These warnings were disabled, because they often were a bit annoying
to fix with pre-Java 7 syntax. Now that we can use try-with-resources,
those should be as straightforward as the "definite resource leak"
warnings. So we should enable them, and eventually work on fixing them!

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

This was approved previously (no-change rebase), but I'll wait until the warning-fixing patches are merged before merging this one, so the number of warnings in the tree doesn't explode.

After the 3 following patches, we're down (up?) to 35 warnings, which is quite manageable. Most of them from CTF!
