DESCRIPTION

lttng: Enable "potential resource leak" warnings

These warnings were disabled, because they often were a bit annoying
to fix with pre-Java 7 syntax. Now that we can use try-with-resources,
those should be as straightforward as the "definite resource leak"
warnings. So we should enable them, and eventually work on fixing them!
