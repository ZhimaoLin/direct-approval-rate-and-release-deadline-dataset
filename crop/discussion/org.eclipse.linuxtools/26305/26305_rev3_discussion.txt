DESCRIPTION

lttng: Enable "potential resource leak" warnings

These warnings were disabled, because they often were a bit annoying
to fix with pre-Java 7 syntax. Now that we can use try-with-resources,
those should be as straightforward as the "definite resource leak"
warnings. So we should enable them, and eventually work on fixing them!

Bump

We should really merge this in quickly, I see patches left and right that introducing more of these warnings...

Yes, it also adds ~270 warnings to the existing code, but I think it's better to know about them, rather than closing our eyes on it...

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

I'm scared, cause that may well mean to change some API, like how modules are handled, though the AutoCloseable may be moved to some internal classes... who knows. Anyway, I'll +1 it, just so you can point the sheriff for approving this :p

Yeah, fixing them all correctly would not only require API breaks, but a big refactoring of TmfTrace etc. Not something we can do in a couple days ;)

I do feel bad about re-introducing warnings, after being "clean" for so long now... But at least if we have something that prevents us from adding more of these problems, it will keep the task of fixing everything easier.

Patch Set 3:

Well... it won't prevent us from introducing new warnings, since we have to live with the actual faults (we won't stop using analysis modules the way we do now, just because it adds a warning, it IS the way to do for now), but yeah, it will prevent us from introducing new preventable leaks.
