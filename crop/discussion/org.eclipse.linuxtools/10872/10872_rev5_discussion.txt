Line:263, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> Not sure why a StringBuilder is used here, it probably dates to when we first discovered it and got over-zealous with it...

  String value = formatNumber(getValue(), base);
  return new String(getName() + '=' + value);

would do the same thing.

Line:3, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/messages.properties -> The trailing space here should go in the code, and not in the translatable string (somebody working on just translating these strings would not notice it).

Patrick hates it when I say that :P

Line:263, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> I don't mind it, I think it's a good practice and findbugs agrees with me!

Line:291, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> Here return getName + '=' + formatNumber(getValue(), base); // trailing space 
it would be nicer.
