DESCRIPTION

Fix some bugs and expand support to cover virtualbox differences.

- Don't perform ssh-config queries if no VMs exist, and permit VMs with
  no ssh-config info as this might happen when a VM is brought up
- Use the ssh port specified in ssh-config instead of hard-coding it
- Add '-f' option to forcibly destroy a VM without backend prompt
- 'poweroff' (virtualbox) is the same as 'shutoff' (libvirt)
- Fix logic in key destruction
