DESCRIPTION

[ctf] Fix binary search for a long sequence of same timestamps.

The binary search algorithm do not need a third case (when values are equals) if there is a guarantee to remove one element in the search space at each iteration.

In our case, we produce many events at the same timestamp (debugging information for a loaded module).
The actual binary search implementation performs a sequential search on element with the same timestamp to find the first one
