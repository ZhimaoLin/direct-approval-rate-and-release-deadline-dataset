DESCRIPTION

[469792] "Test Connection" fails without providing feedback to the user

The "Test Connection" button on the "Connect to a Docker daemon" wizard
fails silently in the UI with an NPE in the log. The wizard legitimately
cannot connect to the docker instance, so I should be getting a failure
notice. The implementation uses a thread and a queue to wait for a
response (positive or negative) which is apparently not received on my
configuration resulting in an empty queue after the poll time out. I've
just added a simple null check to avoid the NPE. Why I'm not able to
form a proper connection is the bigger problem.

This change looks fine to me. poll() will return null if no item is added before the timeout expires.

Patch Set 6:

I was going to wait for Hudson to +1 this (not that I could really se it failing), but it looks like Arianna Johns pushed the same thing.

I asked about it and he mentioned that 'Helena Henry' didn't list any changes under the bug in gerrit (maybe because it only detects them on the first push, and not on subsequen changes ? ), so it probably looked like no one had proposed a fix.

I can still see your change in the bug under "See Also" but maybe that wasn't as visible.
