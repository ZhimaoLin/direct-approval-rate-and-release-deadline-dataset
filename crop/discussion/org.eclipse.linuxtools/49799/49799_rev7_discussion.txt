DESCRIPTION

[469792] "Test Connection" fails without providing feedback to the user

The "Test Connection" button on the "Connect to a Docker daemon" wizard
fails silently in the UI with an NPE in the log. The wizard legitimately
cannot connect to the docker instance, so I should be getting a failure
notice. The implementation uses a thread and a queue to wait for a
response (positive or negative) which is apparently not received on my
configuration resulting in an empty queue after the poll time out. I've
just added a simple null check to avoid the NPE. Why I'm not able to
form a proper connection is the bigger problem.
