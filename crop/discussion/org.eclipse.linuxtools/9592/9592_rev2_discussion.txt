DESCRIPTION

Changing LinuxtoolsProcessFactory to use all environment variables instead of just PATH.

This was causing an error when exporting an RPM project, since it needs the HOME variable to be set.
It's also more coherent to include all env variables since that's the ProcessBuilder's behavior
