DESCRIPTION

TMF: Added a method in UI tests to delay main thread until trace is opened

In o.e.l.tmf.ui.tests, the main thread often need to be put to sleep while a
trace element is being opened. The sleep time was put to 500 ms because that's
what showed best results. But sometimes, unit tests fail because it takes a bit
more than that. Instead of putting longer delays, we loop a certain number of
times until the trace is opened or after a certain timeout.

Line:216, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/shared/ProjectModelTestData.java -> that's even nicer than what I was thinking. :)
