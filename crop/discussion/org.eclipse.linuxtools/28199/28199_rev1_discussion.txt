small things

Line:64, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/cpuusage/CpuUsageView.java -> I'm assuming "event.getSelection()" can change between the two calls... you'd have to be very unlucky, but it could happen! It should be extracted to a local variable before the instanceof check.

Line:173, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/cpuusage/CpuUsageComposite.java -> fSelectedThread is mutable and nullable, and this method is not synchronized, which means it could change after this check and still throw a NPE.

It should be extracted to local variable.

Line:179, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/cpuusage/CpuUsageComposite.java -> you juuust set list to something, it cannot be null here
