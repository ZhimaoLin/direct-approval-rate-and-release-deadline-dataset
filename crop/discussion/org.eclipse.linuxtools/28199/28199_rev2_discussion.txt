Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Line:180, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/cpuusage/CpuUsageComposite.java -> why null check here?

... oh, it's because super.setSelection() takes xxx@xxx.xxx

Just declare list xxx@xxx.xxx instead. Then suppress the warning, because we know that Collections.singletonList() returns a nonnull, even though the compiler doesn't.

(This looks uglier, but it's the better long-term solution.)
