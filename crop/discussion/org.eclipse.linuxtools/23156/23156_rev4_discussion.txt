Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/ITmfXmlTopLevelElement.java -> I'm wondering if getLocations should be moved to IXmlStateSystemContainer. Isn't TmfXmlLocation only about state systems? Would it make sense to have to implement this method for a top level element that does not interact with the state system?
