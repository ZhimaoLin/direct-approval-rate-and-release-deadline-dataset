This is an API break (removing a public static method in CtfTmfEventField), although a justified one, but it will have to go in the lttng-3.0 branch.

-2 because it will have to be resubmitted for the new branch anyway.

Line:174, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDefinition.java -> This will not be 2.0, but rather 2.1 or 3.0
