Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove space before CTF, don't use _. Could refer to bug 408046 in title or in comments after a blank line.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove trailing whitespace to have true blank line otherwise Change-Id becomes part of title.

Line:206, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDefinition.java -> could be simplified to bigInteger.add(BigInteger.valueOf(1).shiftLeft(64))
