DESCRIPTION

tmf: Avoid a string copy when reading state intervals

HTInterval's constructor calls computeStringsEntrySize(), which
does a string copy (getBytes()) to get the real size of the string.
When reading an interval from disk, we already have this size since
it's written in the file, so we can avoid this extra copy.
