DESCRIPTION

Bug 483769 - DockerExplorerView flickers when container info is
displayed and refreshed

Added a map to track containers by id and re-use the previous container
  info when creating a new instance of DockerContainer for a given
container,
  so that associated containerInfo does not need to be initialized
again.
Making sure that containers are sorted by name.

Refactored the listContainers() method based on
  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/54209/3
