DESCRIPTION

Bug 527138 - Starting gdbserver from CDT sometimes stalls indefinitely

- fix RunConsole.attachToTerminal to verify that any finishDate
  is not before the start date
- also add a pause before attempting to attach as well as an
  additional check to ensure that the Container is running
- add a log of any error that occurs and notify all console
  listeners with a zero-length string that there will be no more
  output
- add similar logic to attachToConsole except for the console
  listener stuff which isn't applicable
