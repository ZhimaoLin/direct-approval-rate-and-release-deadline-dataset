DESCRIPTION

Bug 477912 - Mock the Docker daemon in unit tests

- Refactoring the code to move the logic of discovering
  connection settings into a new interface/implementation.
- Added a hierarchy of connection settings classes for
  Unix sockets vs TCP
- New pluggable utility class to discover connection settings
- Refactored the ConnectionManager by moving the storage logic
  (load/save connections) in an external class that implements
  the new IDockerConnectionStorageManager interface
- In unit tests, the interfaces mentionned above are mocked to
  return anything needed (no connection, valid socket, etc.)
- Added a bundle to wrap the org.hamcrest dependencies and expose
  a single exported package for Mockito.
