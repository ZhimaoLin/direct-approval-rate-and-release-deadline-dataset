DESCRIPTION

Bug 477912 - Mock the Docker daemon in unit tests

- Refactoring the code to move the logic of discovering
  connection settings into a new interface/implementation.
- Added a hierarchy of connection settings classes for
  Unix sockets vs TCP
- New pluggable utility class to discover connection settings
- Refactored the ConnectionManager by moving the storage logic
  (load/save connections) in an external class that implements
  the new IDockerConnectionStorageManager interface
- In unit tests, the interfaces mentionned above are mocked to
  return anything needed (no connection, valid socket, etc.)

Thanks for starting this off. I haven't fully looked at everything else, but the main thing we need to change is the bundling of mockito and assertj. We should use what is being shipped in Orbit.

Mockito seems to be in Orbit. Assertj is approved for us in Orbit (CQ #9238) but I don't see it in any builds yet. We must use the exact versions approved, or submit CQs for our own versions.

Line:20, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We'll need to change this in our target platform to point to these libraries in Orbit. Mockito is there but I'm not sure about assertj.
