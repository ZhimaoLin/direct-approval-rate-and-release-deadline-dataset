DESCRIPTION

Bug 477912 - Mock the Docker daemon in unit tests

- Refactoring the code to move the logic of discovering
  connection settings into a new interface/implementation.
- Added a hierarchy of connection settings classes for
  Unix sockets vs TCP
- New pluggable utility class to discover connection settings
- Refactored the ConnectionManager by moving the storage logic
  (load/save connections) in an external class that implements
  the new IDockerConnectionStorageManager interface
- In unit tests, the interfaces mentionned above are mocked to
  return anything needed (no connection, valid socket, etc.)

Patch Set 2:

Have a look at http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/assertj/ . This should contain assertj-core 1.7.1. I could get 3.2.0 in as well as we've been approved for this. This would need to be added to our target definition file.

Also, we'll need to file a uses-CQ to indicate we'll be using mockito from Orbit.
