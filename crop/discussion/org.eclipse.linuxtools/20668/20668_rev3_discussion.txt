Line:393, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> In the Properties view, when selecting a generic experiment it shows as type [no category]:Generic Experiment.

I would be good to show just Generic Experiment. What do you think?

Line:393, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> I think it's a bit useless to have the [no category]: part, but it is the same for the trace type. Unless there's objection, I'll remove it.
