DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add support for a state history stored in memory

For very small state systems, or for test purposes, it might
be useful to store state histories completely in RAM. This is
now possible to do, using StateSystemManager.newInMemHistory().

It's really not optmized at the moment (it uses O(n) array
iterations for queries) and could probably be improved if
there is a need.
