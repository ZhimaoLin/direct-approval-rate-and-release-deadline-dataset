DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a new package for state history backends

Added two new simple backends:
- Null backend, which discards all intervals it receives.
- In-memory backend, which is like a full history but keeps
  everything in RAM. For use with small state systems only!

Also renamed the existing *.historytree package to
*.backends.historytree.
