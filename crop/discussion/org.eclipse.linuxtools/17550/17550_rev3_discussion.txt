DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add advanced trace tests

Using a more exotic test trace.

I'm not exactly sure why a string field ends up in-between the variant
selector and its value, but this is how they are printed by Babeltrace,
so I assume we're doing the right thing.

Had to be rebased because the synthetic trace was also added to CtfTmfTestTraces in the meantime.
