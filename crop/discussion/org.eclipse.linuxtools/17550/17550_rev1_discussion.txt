DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add advanced trace tests

Using a more exotic test trace.

I'm not exactly sure why a string field ends up in-between the variant
selector and its value, but this is how they are printed by CTF so I
assume we're doing the right thing.

Looks good. Only very minor cosmetics comments.

Line:46, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/FunkyTraceTest.java -> trace -> fTrace

It looks like other classes in this package are not doing it but a lot of other test classes do.

Line:174, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/FunkyTraceTest.java -> retEvent -> fRetEvent
