Line:193, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Instead of having two methods, you could add only the public removeIterator() one, which would do those two lines.

Line:196, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfContext.java -> No need for a separate method, if it's only called in one place. You could do this line in dispose() directly.
