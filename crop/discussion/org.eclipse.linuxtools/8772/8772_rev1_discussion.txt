Also getActivePage may be need to be null checked in:
TmfProjectElement
LoadersManager
TmfUml2SDSyncLoader

Line:174, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/OpenExperimentHandler.java -> experiment must be disposed

Line:175, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/OpenTraceHandler.java -> trace must be disposed

Do we really need to add a check in those classes too? The problem seemed to be with views at load time only, I don't think the checks in the handler are needed even...

Perhaps not, I'm ok to abort the changes in all the handlers, but please add it to the 3 files mentioned in my last message.
