DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix reload of the same trace for statistics

Bug : 387639

Avoids to delete the statistics tree if the global request gets
canceled. Also, the update signal is sent from the view event if the
same trace/experiment has been selected.

Bonus:
-Migrates the management of the tree viewer input from the view to the
viewers.
-Changes the statistics node reset behavior to avoid useless
operations.
-Remove unused stuff
-Updates some javadoc

Patch Set 3: (5 inline comments)

You know the code is good when the only comments consist of using a different verb tense or correctly aligning bullet points ;)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you say "Fixes bug 387639" or "References bug 387639" instead, with no ':'? Gerrit's regexes will pick it up and will correctly add the link.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Avoid deleting

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> cancelled

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> The "clean" way of doing bullet lists is:

-<space>Migrates the management...

<space><space>viewers

-<space>Changes the statistics...

etc.

Line:552, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> You shouldn't mix comment styles in the same file (ideally it should be uniform per project, but oh well...). Either use // or /* */.   You know which one I prefer ;)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I was wondering why it was not a link. Thanks. Done.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> As an american, I say canceled, not cancelled.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:552, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> In this case, I should do another patch to change all the comments in the statistics packages.
