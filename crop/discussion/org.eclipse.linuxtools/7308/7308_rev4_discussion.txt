DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix reload of the same trace for statistics

Fixes bug 387639

Avoids deleting the statistics tree if the global request gets
canceled. Also, the update signal is sent from the view even if the
selected trace/experiment has not changed.

Bonus:
- Migrates the management of the tree viewer input from the view to the
viewers.
- Changes the statistics node reset behavior to avoid useless
operations.
- Remove unused stuff
- Updates some javadoc

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The refactors/cleanups are appreciated, but they should be split in a separate commit from the bug fix.

In fact, I wouldn't say it's a bugfix since I'm not sure there is a bug in the first place. See my comment on bug 387639.
