Some comments on the javadoc. I haven't tested it yet, will do that soon, but from the RFC patch experience, it looks all good to me!

Line:58, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseSelectionProvider.java -> It implements a few interfaces, maybe you could put a 

// -----------------
// interface name
// -----------------

above the methods from each of those interfaces. I know very few classes do that and I myself never did it, but as I review code, I think it would make it more understandable

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> I don't think I understand what "scales" mean here. The javadoc could compensate my poor english.
