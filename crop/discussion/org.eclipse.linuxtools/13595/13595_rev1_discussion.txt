This looks fine to me. Just a minor difference.

Line:46, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/handlers/PerfStatDataOpenHandler.java -> Note that when perf stat data is displayed as a result of a profiling run, the title still appears in the text and the content description (ie. appending it to the contents as well).
