DESCRIPTION

Fix for bug 456247 - gcov not working on Windows/Cygwin

- old code was looking for the name of the compiler tool being
  "GCC C Compiler".  This does not work because Cygwin's C compiler
  tool has a different name, as does MacOSx's gcc compiler
- change code to look for the base gnu compiler id which never changes
  and all gcc-compiler tools superclass eventually to this tool (C
  or C++ compiler)
- deprecate the public APIs that were exposed to take the tool name
  instead of superclass id so we can remove them in next major release
