DESCRIPTION

Fix for bug 456247 - gcov not working on Windows/Cygwin

- old code was looking for the name of the compiler tool being
  "GCC C Compiler".  This does not work because Cygwin's C compiler
  tool has a different name, as does MacOSx's gcc compiler
- change code to look for the base gnu compiler id which never changes
  and all gcc-compiler tools superclass eventually to this tool (C
  or C++ compiler)
- deprecate the public APIs that were exposed to take the tool name
  instead of superclass id so we can remove them in next major release

Code does not affect Linux support that it was initially tested for.  Need someone to test it for Windows, but should work.  I will push it so it will be part of a nightly build.
