DESCRIPTION

Bug 500973 - Push image to local registry fails

The problem came from the concatenation of ':' with
the port number which resulted in 'localhost5058'
instead of 'localhost:5000' because the ':' was
interpreted as a number and not a Character (':'
is 58 in the ASCII table)

Added a JUnit test and improved SWTBot tests.
