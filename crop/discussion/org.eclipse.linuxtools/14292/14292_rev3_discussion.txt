Some code comments.

Really not a fan of the SuppressWarnings("deprecation"). The single time vs time range concepts are really different. Existing code using ITimeDataProvider(1) might continue to compile, but we'll stop using it and testing it, so it might not even work. Not sure if that's a real gain...

My vote goes to "let's push this to lttng-luna instead".

Line:73, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramScaledData.java -> fields should be private, with a public getter (and setter, only if needed)

In fact the existing fields should also follow this, but it's another story...

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceContext.java -> perhaps renamed fTimerange to fVisibleTimerange or something similar to avoid confusion with the new selection time range.

Also any reason to not use a TmfTimeRange object for the selection too? just wondering

Line:145, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> fields should be private, with protected getter/setters as needed.

Line:73, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramScaledData.java -> Let's not try to be more Catholic than the pope ;) If it's good enough for GridData, it's good enough for me...
