It works as advertised and it's a great addition.

Line:268, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> I think we should keep the notion of events in current time range and have additional column for the events in selected time. What's the general opinion of the rest of the team about that?
