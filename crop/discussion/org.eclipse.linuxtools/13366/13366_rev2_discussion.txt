Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Rebased on latest master + some formatting fixes.

This looks very good! Very useful options too. My only concerns are the icons, perhaps they're a bit too generic to represent what they... we can probably re-use something either from another TMF view or from the Eclipse Debug view.

Also, I'm wondering if the "highlighting on change" should even be an option, or if it could be always enabled, and have only the filtering be toggleable?
