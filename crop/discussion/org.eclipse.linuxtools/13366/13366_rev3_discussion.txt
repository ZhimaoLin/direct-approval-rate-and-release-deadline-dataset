Nice feature, very useful to track the exact state changes of a given event.

However I can get some exceptions thrown, I'll send you the trace in question.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Perhaps mention the now two separate changes:
- Highlight on state changes
- Add a filter button to filter out non-changes completely

Line:168, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> What if 'ts' is bigger than the startime, or than the trace end itself?

I have a trace here which throws the TimeRangeException here, I can send it to you.

If we don't strictly use ss.getStartTime() here, then the TimeRangeException should be handled for real below.

Line:517, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> You should use File.separator here, to make sure it works on "alternative" platforms ;)

Also, I wonder if this should be defined here, or elsewhere...

In fact I think it can happen with any trace, just start a fresh Eclipse (with many traces previously opened), the first one should load fine, but if you close it (and it auto-opens a previous one) it should throw the exception.

Line:63, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/Messages.java -> also forgot to add, these two entries will xxx@xxx.xxx 2.1.

Make sure you update your baseline with the 2.0 plugins, so you can see this error.
