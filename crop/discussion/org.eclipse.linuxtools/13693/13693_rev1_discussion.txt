Line:21, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I think this will probably work, but it might be enough to just define a minimum version for the "org.eclipse.linuxtools.man.parser" package without requiring the full bundle.

Line:21, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Ignore the above comment. It seems like you'd need to make a change in the man.core bundle as well for that to work. (Export-Package defaults to 0.0.0)
