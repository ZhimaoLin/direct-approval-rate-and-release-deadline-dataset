DESCRIPTION

Do not call the doSave() in a plugin, unless for testing.

The purpose of doSave() is to save the changes made to an
ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy to the underlying ILaunchConfiguration.
This is done automatically in most cases. The main callers of doSave()
are methods that set values for a launch configuration (performApply,
setDefaults), but these methods should not perform this functionality.
