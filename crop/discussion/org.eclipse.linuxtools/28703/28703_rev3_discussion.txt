DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Data Table context menu controls.

Setting "auto resize columns" and "jump to newest entry" from
Preferences->Graphing->Data Table is now just for preparing the
default settings for a newly-created graph. Control of those
settings for an active data table is now fully available in the
table's context menu.
