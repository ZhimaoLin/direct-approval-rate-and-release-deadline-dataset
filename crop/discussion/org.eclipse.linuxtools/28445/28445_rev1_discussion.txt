Wow, nice, I didn't know about the plugin spy!

It works when running as Eclipse Application, but not as the RCP, is that the point? since it's mostly a developer tool, it would make sense...

Very mild -1

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.target/lttng-eStaging.target -> Do you want all sequences to be the same? Then 4.3 should be 24 as well, otherwise this one should be 23. But it doesn't matter much

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.target/lttng-eStaging.target -> Yeah, I think it will be less error-prone this way.
