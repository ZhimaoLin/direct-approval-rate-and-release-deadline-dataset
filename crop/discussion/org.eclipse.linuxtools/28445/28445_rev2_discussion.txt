"Wow, nice, I didn't know about the plugin spy!"

Really? It's not the first time I hear someone didn't know about this. I think this is a must have tool for any Eclipse developer. We should make sure to get the word out about it.

"It works when running as Eclipse Application, but not as the RCP, is that the point? since it's mostly a developer tool, it would make sense..."

It should work if you add it manually in your launch configuration. It most likely doesn't add it by default because we don't explicitly depend on it.
