DESCRIPTION

oprofile: fix error when multiple executions

When executing oprofile multiple times, it has to pass "--append"
parameters from second run on. However, that was passed in the end
of command string (e.g. operf myApp --append), which is wrong.

I tested this patch and it worked. Before the patch the --append was recognized as the application parameter. Now it is ok.
