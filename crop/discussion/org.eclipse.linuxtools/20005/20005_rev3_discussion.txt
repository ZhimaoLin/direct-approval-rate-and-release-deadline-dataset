DESCRIPTION

tmf: Callstack: Import name mapping from a binary with debug symbols

Using CDT's core binary parsers, we can read the binaries and
extract function name mapping without the need of an external
command-line program. This patch adds an action to the callstack
view so that the user can browse for a binary file and import the mapping.

Patch Set 3:

Meredith Scott, are you OK with the changes in the RCP? This adds about 5MB to the size. Eventually, the CDT binary parser code could be split and we would use only that.

Patch Set 3: Verified-1

I'm ok with the size increase (+1)

-1 because if fails to run from with my Eclipse Development envrionment due to an unresolved required bundle org.eclipse.cdt.core.native. I have to manually select org.eclipse.cdt.core.native in the run configuration.

Another note (just a idea, not needed to be updated in this patch): There are 2 buttons to import the symbol mappings. We could combine this in a menu or one dialog.

"is that when running the RCP?"

Yes, it was. To reproduce 
1) delete an existing run configuration for the RCP
2) Launch the RCP using the tracing.product file
