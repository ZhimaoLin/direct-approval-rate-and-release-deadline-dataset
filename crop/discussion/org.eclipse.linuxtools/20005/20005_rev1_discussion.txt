DESCRIPTION

tmf: Callstack: Import name mapping from a binary with debug symbols

Using CDT's core binary parsers, we can read the binaries and
extract function name mapping without the need of an external
command-line program. This patch adds an action to the callstack
view so that the user can browse for a binary file and import the mapping.

-1 for now. We need to figure out how to depend on CDT core in the RCP without including the whole CDT platform feature.
