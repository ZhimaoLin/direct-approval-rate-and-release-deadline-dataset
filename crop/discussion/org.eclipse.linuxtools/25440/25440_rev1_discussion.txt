Line:148, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.java -> it should be getProject(project, true) to make sure that the project element is in the registry. Otherwise there is a race condition of handling resource change event (which puts it in the registry) and this line of code
