DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix and simplify State System Explorer viewer

- Simplify code and reduce the number of private methods
- Wait for initialization of state systems	
- Make the viewer always detect new attributes on update
- Indicate refresh needed on visible range update only if new attributes
found
- Keep root, trace and state system entries on update in filter mode
- Avoid recomputing list of traces, analysis modules and state systems
at every update
- Highlight changed attributes in filter mode
- Implement toString() for tree viewer entries
- Expand tree to auto-expand level after refresh to show changed items
in filter mode

Line:167, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> start time is 0 when opening a trace and no now event or time has been selected yet. This is the reason that the children of state system are not shown when opening a traces the first time or when opening the view after a trace is already open

Line:190, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> so, we return null to not update the display. I'm ok, since it documented and it was done before your change too.

Line:258, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> shouldn't changed to be set to true here?

Line:267, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> After opening a trace and selecting the first event in the events table all entries of type StateEntry are marked as modified and hence have yellow background. Is this ok as behaviour?

Line:349, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> You could mark it xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:352, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> You could mark parameter ss it xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:357, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> You could mark it xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:167, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> I will set the selection from the trace manager's selection begin time when selection parameter is false

Line:258, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> There is something changed but we can't display it yet. So it doesn't request a refresh. We haven't actually changed our 'model'.

Line:267, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> I will mark as modified only the non-null states when filtering is off.
