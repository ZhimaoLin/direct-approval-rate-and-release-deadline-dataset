DESCRIPTION

tmf: Replace ITmfTimestamp by long in ITmfStatistics API

Some methods in the statistics imlementations can call each
other, and having to create new wrapper objects every event
is not very interesting... The normalization already happens
in the Statistics view anyway.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

The only disadvantage is that the user has to normalise before using the ITmfStatistics.

Patch Set 1:

Indeed. But for now the "user" is only the Statistics View, and it already normalizes anyway.

If we want to keep this abstraction we could always add new wrapper methods that take ITmfTimestamps as parameters. Do you think it'd be worth it?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I'll push this, if we eventually want to add wrapper methods with ITmfTimestamps parameters we could always add those in a separate change.
