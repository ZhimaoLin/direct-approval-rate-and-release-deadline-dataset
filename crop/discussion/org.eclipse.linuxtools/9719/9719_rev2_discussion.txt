DESCRIPTION

Separate opcontrol and ui functionality in oprofile's event config tab.

Created abstract class to contain all ui code, leaving opcontrol
dependent functionality to be provided in a separate class and
allowing for better mocking during testing.

The change looks fine, but this class needs to be rebased now that IOpcontrolProvider has been merged with IOpcontrolProvider2.

Line:27, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/OprofileEventConfigTab.java -> This class has been merged into IOpcontrolProvider. This will need to be rebased.
