Line:347, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> I noticed that both menu items show up when selecting any file or folder in the project explorer (e.g. the Project or experiment) and presssing right mouse button. I think we should restrict that to the traces folder (and maybe project, too?)

Line:47, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/commands/OpenDirHandler.java -> if project == null (which should not happen) the projectName is the default name. However, if the project doesn't exists then the open operation fails. Maybe we should create the default project in that case (by using TmfProjectRegistry.createProject())

Line:347, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> My intention was to only show it under the Trace folder. So I added a visibleWhen.

Line:47, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/commands/OpenDirHandler.java -> This bug was there before. I think it would make sense to address as a separate patch. I created Bug 422619.
