Some code comments.

I verified that it partially works for me. Now TMF can actually open the trace and display events and views. But soemthing seems wrong with the timestamps.

The example trace in bug 389002 spans 200 years!! The control flow view seems to bug out a bit too: if you click the Home button then try to zoom *out*, it then zooms *in* somewhere. Maybe this is only due to the weird timestamps.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> whitespace

Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/headless/ReadTrace.java -> no no no no no ;)

Line:124, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDefinition.java -> auto-format please

Line:313, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> \n

Line:322, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> \n

Line:328, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> Please auto-format the contents of this method, the spaces/braces are wrong.

Line:261, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> IMO, it's more readable to just leave this on the same line. If you think it's too long, you could do:

final CommonTree value;

value = (CommonTree) .....

to save some space. Same above.

Line:443, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> This Javadoc here is useless (doesn't add anything). It's not necessary for private methods, so I'd just remove it.

Line:1293, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> Here too. Many lines in this file go over 80 columns, so I'd just leave this on one line too.

Line:2346, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> Here however it's starting to get a bit long ;)

You could split it at the ||
