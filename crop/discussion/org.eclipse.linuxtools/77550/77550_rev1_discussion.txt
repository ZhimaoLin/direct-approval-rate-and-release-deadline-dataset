DESCRIPTION

Restore equals() and hashCode() methods for DockerConnection.

104b675 remove equals() and hashCode() because they originally took the
connection name into account. As a result, changing the connection name
would generate new refresh threads since the map that stored these used
the connection as the key.

The equals() and hashCode() methods should be determined by the host
path / certificates used and not on any given name. Therefore delegate
to the TCP/UNIX implementation of IDockerConnectionSetting as these
ignore the name.
