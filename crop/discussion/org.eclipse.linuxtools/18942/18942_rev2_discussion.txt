DESCRIPTION

tmf: Disable scheduler executionOrder test

That unit test has always been prone to multi-threaded uncertainty,
but recently it has been failing a lot more, which is very annoying
for the CI. I suspect it's because of the recent changes to the CTF
parser, some requests may end up finishing faster than they did before,
and before another request could be scheduled.

I suggest disabling it until we rewrite it to be more permissive (or
better, add testing mechanisms to the scheduler, and test the order
of requests being *sent*, not the order in which they finish).
