Is this really required in the target definition? It's not needed to compile...

Patch Set 1:

About the target file... by doing this, do we force a dependency to the apache derby plugin when people install TMF through the "Install new software..." option? And is it included in the RCP? If so, we may need multiple sets of target files depending on what we are building.

org.eclipse.test.performance and derby are unit tests only and not required for the RCP or the official plug-in.

Patch Set 1:

It shouldn't be included unless we include the tests in the repo (category.xml). I can double check that.

Patch Set 1:

test.performance and derby don't get included in the linuxtools repo, the lttng repo and the tracing rcp. So it's all good.
