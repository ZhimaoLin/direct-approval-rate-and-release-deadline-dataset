Line:133, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectSeriesWizardPage.java -> Please rename this variable. Names that start with set get and is are generally used for functions rather than variables.

for example:
setVisible(boolean visible)
boolean getVisible()
boolean isVisible()

Line:145, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectSeriesWizardPage.java -> Don't forget the add braces around single line if statements. The reason is someone might edit this code in the future, add another line to the statement and forget to introduce braces.
Although this code here can be replaced by setVisble = (index > 0);

Line:170, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectSeriesWizardPage.java -> braces

Line:300, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> Very nice. Commenting code while reading it is a good idea.

Line:27, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphWizard.java -> Please write this as two lines
edit = (gdata != null);
if (edit)
It is more readable that way

Line:42, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphWizard.java -> If you can set the window title in the constructor you won't need the boolean 'edit'
If not then this is fine.

Line:48, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphWizardPage.java -> It is generally preferred that member variables be made private and are not accessed directly but throw an accessor.

For example isEditing() {return this.edit}

If old code is doing that we can ignore it for now but let's not introduce more of it.
