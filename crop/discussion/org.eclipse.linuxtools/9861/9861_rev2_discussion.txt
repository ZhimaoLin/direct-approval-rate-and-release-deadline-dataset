Patch Set 2:

I could not do what you were asking for in the first review.

The issue is that we need to observe the /active/ console not all consoles. I tried to remove and add the observer to the currently active console but there is no good way to get notified about the active console changing.

This patch set combines all the static (code that applies to all consoles) in a ScriptConsoleManager. Then I added an observer to tell use about console activation there.
