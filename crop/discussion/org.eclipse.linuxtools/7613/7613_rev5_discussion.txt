MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:9, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.time/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/time/TimeProviderPlugin.java -> This class doesn't have to be an Activator. It should be possible to make it just a basic class with some public static final fields defined, and renamed to TimeConstants. Same was requested on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#change,7633 .
