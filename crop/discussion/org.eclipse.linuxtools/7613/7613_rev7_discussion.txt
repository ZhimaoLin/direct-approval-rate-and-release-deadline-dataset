Just some minor fixes to address.

Line:27, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.time/pom.xml -> According to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#change,7633 , this workaround is no longer needed so a build should be fine without it.

Line:6, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.time/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/time/TimeProviderPlugin.java -> This should be renamed to TimeConstants to confirm with our naming convention.
