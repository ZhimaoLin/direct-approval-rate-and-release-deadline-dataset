Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

The workaround was only the part dealing with the "<resource>" tag, but looking at the build, it seems the source bundles were generated anyways. In fact, according to http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Reference_Card#Source_Bundles , as long as tycho-source-plugin is declared in our top-level pom, all eclipse-plugin/eclipse-test-plugin packaging types will have generated sources.
