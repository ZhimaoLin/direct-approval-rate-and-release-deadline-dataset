DESCRIPTION

tmf: Statistics provider based on event requests

This patch adds a TmfEventsStatistics, which uses trace event
requests and counts the instances of each event types to
provide statistics information. This is useful for trace types
that cannot use the default implementation using the state
system (traces where events are not chronologically ordered,
for example).

The previous TmfStatistics has been renamed TmfStateStatistics,
to better differentiate between the two alternatives that are
now available.

A non-negligible caveat of this new approach is that the event
requests do not get coalesced with the histogram's requests. Since
this is meant to be used with small traces it's probably not a
big problem, but some additional work would have to be done if
we want to correct this.
