DESCRIPTION

tmf: Correctly export xychart packages in tmf.ui

Some packages were still marked as internal when they weren't supposed
to be. This was giving some warnings, because some classes in one of
those was being used in API methods.

I thought Meredith Scott made them internal on purpose? Maybe I dreamt that.

I put them internal till the APIs can be seen as stable. Right now, I think, they are not. Things are still being moved around (see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22029/).

Patch Set 1:

If they are to be internal, then there should be "internal" in the package name. That's what the guidelines say. Perhaps this is what we should do instead?

The danger of keeping such a half-way situation is that we forget about it, and it ends up being shipped in Luna.

Genevi√®ve, do you foresee a lot of changes in the XY charts on your end?

Of course there will be changes to the API :) but I don't foresee anything major though... I'm using it in a couple of view and it makes sense.

I have no strong opinion on this. Just that whether or not it's internal, we ARE going to use it and have xxx@xxx.xxx on the class using it...

Patch Set 1:

OK. It sounds like it should stay internal for now. In that case, I think the packages should be named accordingly. If we change our mind before the Luna release, it won't be a hard change anyway.
