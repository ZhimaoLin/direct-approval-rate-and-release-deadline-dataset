Don't eat the exceptions silently. If you are 100% sure it should not happen, you can throw a *drum roll* IllegalStateException!

Line:147, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/Definition.java -> input.position(), position and pos... this is getting confusing! Maybe re-use pos or use different names.

The comment in the code will be solved by the performance patch for alignment found here https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/18589/. It would be best to merge that one first.
