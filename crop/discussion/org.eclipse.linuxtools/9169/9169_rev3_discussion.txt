DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a tmf.help plugin for the User Guide

Initial version taken from the current contents of the Eclipse
wiki. This should build both with Maven and from Eclipse itself
(although it won't auto-build from Eclipse, one has to right-click
the build.xml file and choose "Run As -> Ant Build").

Patch Set 3: Verified; IP review completed

The build works fine (PDE and maven build). 

The TMF statistics section is totally outdated. Shall we remove or update it before submitting this patch?

Probably, I'll push a new patch with that section removed.
