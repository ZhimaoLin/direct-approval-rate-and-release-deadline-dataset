DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a tmf.help plugin for the User Guide

Initial version taken from the current contents of the Eclipse
wiki, minus the outdated Statistics section.

This should build both with Maven and from Eclipse itself (although
it won't auto-build from Eclipse, one has to right-click the build.xml
file and choose "Run As -> Ant Build").
