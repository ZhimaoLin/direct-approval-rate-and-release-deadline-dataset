Patch Set 1: Fails

build fails for me. Problem with the installed JRE. The build should not require any specific JRE installed.

Patch Set 1:

After changing the JRE settings in the builders property to default JRE, I get the following error:

/home/eedbhu/git2/org.eclipse.linuxtools/lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/build.xml:21: /usr/share/eclipse/dropins/mylyn-wikitext/eclipse/plugins does not exist.

It looks like that the eclipse-home variable is not correctly set for me. This has to be addressed too
