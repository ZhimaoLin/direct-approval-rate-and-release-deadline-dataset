Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The generated HTML files need to be under source control because the maven build won't build them. 

Also the generated HTML files have incorrect reference to home.gif, next.gif and prev.gif becasue they need to be in doc/images.

Line:100, lttng/pom.xml -> I think you need to build TMF plugins/feature first so that lttng2 can reference it correctly.

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/.gitignore -> The maven build doesn't build the HTML files. Therefore we need to have it under source control

Line:100, lttng/pom.xml -> wup, my bad, I didn't think the order mattered here ;)

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/.gitignore -> I'd like to avoid having generated files under SCM. I'll try to make Maven build them.
