Line:34, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/oprofilelaunch.properties -> I think this should be 'Profile with:'

Line:131, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/launching/AbstractOprofileLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> opcontrol sets up the daemon to listen for a binary, so we can run a binary an arbitrary number times and have the daemon aggregate those results.

I believe operf can mimic the same functionality if the --append option is specified after the first run. So the first run will clear out the previous data, and all subsequent runs will append.

Line:50, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/OprofileSetupTab.java -> I noticed that when creating an OProfile Manual Launch Configuration, the combo for selecting operf/opcontrol is still displayed but it should be disabled as the manual functionality is meant to work only with opcontrol.

One way to do this would be to use config.getType().getIdentifier().equals("org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch.oprofile.man") and if this holds true, then to disable the combo box. Additionally in LaunchOptions.saveConfiguration, another check could be added to ensure that the OProfile Manual Launch Configuration has a default value of opcontrol, and not operf.

Line:131, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/launching/AbstractOprofileLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Just to clarify. Right now operf is just run an arbitrary number of times and the previous result is simply cleared out
