Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Why do we need to introduce the DockerConnectionWatcher utility class ? Why not simply adding the 'currentConnection' in the DockerConnectionManager class, and set the new 'current connection' when the selection changes in the Docker Explorer ? Wouldn't it be simpler ?

Patch Set 4:

We need a separate class because there is a requirement to use PlatformUI to watch the DockerExplorerView.  If put in the core class, then core relies on ui which is a very bad thing to do.  You want to have core installable without ui being present.

Patch Set 4: -Code-Review

That's right, I did not realize that, but my point was: let the DockerExplorerView implement the ISelectionListener interface and set the current connection in the DockerConnectionManager upon changes. In that case, there's no need to introduce the DockerConnectionWatcher.
But if you want to keep the current selection apart from the DockerConnectionManager (to separate the concerns), then I guess that's fine.
