DESCRIPTION

Fix some more issues with OSIO Rest Connector

- fix regression with query page no longer filling in any fields
- make sure only space and assignee fields are filled in
  a query page by default and this should also occur
  if the space field is unselected
- make all query fields dependent on Space, but set
  a default option for assignees field being the
  current username in OSIORestTaskAttributeMapper
- add new userName field to OSIORestConfiguration constructor
  and add new getUserName field to fetch it
- make assignees field in OSIORestTaskSchema dependent
  on SPACE
- do the same in OSIORestSearchQueryPageSchema
- fix NLS messages in RepositoryQuerySchemaPage
- add a mapping for work item status in Space class
  (set to default values for the time-being)
