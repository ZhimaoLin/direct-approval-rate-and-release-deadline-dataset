Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I am experiencing trouble with the Push dialog.  I am seeing a Browse label where the Add... button should be.  My previous patch added a direct Add... button to both Push and Pull that brings up a dialog to add a new registry account entry (rather than manage them in Preferences).  The Add button is still there for Pull and it works fine.  The Push Browse label does nothing and cannot be pressed.

Line:24, vagrant/org.eclipse.linuxtools.vagrant.ui/.project -> I'm guessing this changed can be left out since it shouldn't do anything different.

Line:24, vagrant/org.eclipse.linuxtools.vagrant.core/.project -> This is just reversing the order. I'm guessing this is unintended ? Could probably be removed.

My fault, I merged and verified that there were no regressions in the SWTBot tests, but I should have run manual tests as well. I'll also add tests on the new feature you added in your previous commit, Arianna Johns.

Right, these are unintended changes, I'll revert them.
