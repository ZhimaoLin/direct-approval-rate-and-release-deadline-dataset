DESCRIPTION

Bug 482947 - Valgrind Message API's: get rid of launch dependency

- Instead of returning ILaunch object use ISourceLocator object
- Changed all the place where it was used, in practice the only places
it is used ValgrindStackFrame object is used not its parent, where
launch object is declared
- Removed hack in restoring participant in double click listener, note
that it only worked if source lookup was set to null because otherwise
it is not restored properly from memento to be any useful. Now it is
done in message parser where it creates clone of source lookup director
which won't be disposed when launch object is cleared up
- Created internal API for parser to accept ISourceLocator
