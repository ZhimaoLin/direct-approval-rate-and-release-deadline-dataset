Patch Set 6: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

This kind of works, and we need to divide and conquer now.
Things to fix: 
* Copy trace links traces right now. 
* NLS message for loaded trace. 
* Progress bar not visible during scan. 
* API cleanup
* Warnings
* Javadoc
* check that back<->next really allows proper updating.
