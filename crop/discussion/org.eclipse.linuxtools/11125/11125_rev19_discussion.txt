Patch Set 19: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Looks good!

I feel comfortable pushing this now (with feature freeze looming...), but before the final release I think we should discuss the following points:

- Cancelling the recursive search in directories
- Have the "status bar" in the scan dialog show the current directory actually being scanned. As in, the end of the blocking queue, not the start. I think the progress bar follows the start of the queue too.

Another minor easy to fix comment that can be changed later:
- Add directory -> Add Directory (everything else uses Capitals in that dialog)

woot!
