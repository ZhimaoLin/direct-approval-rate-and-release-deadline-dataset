DESCRIPTION

ctf: BitBuffer improvements

Minor performance improvements. Simplified the API a bit:
Removed the 'index' parameter from the public API in read()
and put() methods. All reads/writes can be done from the
current position, and this position can be set with position().

Updated the tests accordingly.

Patch Set 6:

After discussing with Philippe, we found out the test was depending on an incorrect behavior which was fixed in the commit (now both read() and put() will increment the current position, as it should).

We also removed the 'index' parameter from the public API, as it duplicates the functionality of position() + read()/put().
