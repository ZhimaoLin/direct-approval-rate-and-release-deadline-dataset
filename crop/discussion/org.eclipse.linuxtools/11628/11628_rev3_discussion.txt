DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a state system explorer view

This view displays raw state system information, synchronized with
the currently selected timestamp. This is amazingly useful for
debugging, but could also be useful for end-users trying to get
more low-level information.

For this reason, it's shipped with the runtime plugin, but not
present in the default perspective.

Based on initial implementation by Ayanna Reed.

Patch Set 3:

Now correctly handling the case where you have an experiment whose traces don't have the exact same time ranges (ie, most of the time).
If we query a timestamp that is invalid for one of the traces/state systems, the view will display "Out of range" for all its values. Thanks Matthew for this awesome idea!
