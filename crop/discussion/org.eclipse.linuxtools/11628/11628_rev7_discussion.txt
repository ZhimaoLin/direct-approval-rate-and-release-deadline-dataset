DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a state system explorer view

This view displays raw state system information, synchronized with
the currently selected timestamp. This is amazingly useful for
debugging, but could also be useful for end-users trying to get
more low-level information.

For this reason, it's shipped with the runtime plugin, but not
present in the default perspective.

Based on initial implementation by Ayanna Reed.
