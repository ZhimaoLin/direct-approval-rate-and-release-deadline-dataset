Patch Set 1:

I had another approach in this patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/29701/3. Your is much smaller but does it cover all the cases mentioned in the commit message?

Patch Set 1:

Mine doesn't cover the experiment analyses. Also, I realized that in mine that there are BuildThreads foreach trace and each BuildThread do create the event list for all traces. I think yours takes care of that if I'm not mistaken.

I'll try your patch and if it works for my use case then we should use your fix.
