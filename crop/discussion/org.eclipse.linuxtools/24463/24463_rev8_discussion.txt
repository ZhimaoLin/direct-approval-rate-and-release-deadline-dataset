DESCRIPTION

Linuxtools: Standardize saving graphs as images.

Make SaveChartAction provided by dataviewers public,
to allow other plugins to use it instead of each
needing their own implementation of chart saving.

Also, replace the plugin-specific implementations of
chart saving in Massif and Systemtap with this one.

for SystemTap, migrate the
save action from using Actions to Commands.
