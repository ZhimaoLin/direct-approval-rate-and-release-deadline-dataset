DESCRIPTION

Linuxtools: Standardize saving graphs as images.

Make SaveChartAction provided by dataviewers public,
and allow other plugins (such as Systemtap and Valgrind)
to use it instead of using multiple implementations of
a commonly-used feature.

Also, for SystemTap, migrate the save action from using Actions
to Commands, and make some minor fixes to GraphSelectorEditor
and GraphDisplaySet.
