DESCRIPTION

Linuxtools: Standardize saving graphs as images.

Make SaveChartAction provided by dataviewers public,
to allow other plugins to use it instead of each
needing their own implementation of chart saving.

Also, replace the plugin-specific implementations of
chart saving in Massif and Systemtap with this one,
and for SystemTap, migrate from using Actions to Commands.

Patch Set 9: Verified+1

I can confirm the valgrind chart functionality is working as expected, and I assume you've tested the systemtap functionality.I can take a look at the code in further detail, but the main issue would be to rebase as there will be conflicts to resolve with the many changes that have gone into master since.
