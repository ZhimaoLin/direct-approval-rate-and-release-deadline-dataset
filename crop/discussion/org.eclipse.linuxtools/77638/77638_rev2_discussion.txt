DESCRIPTION

Bug 497460: When no active connection exists, disable Pull and Build.

When no Docker daemon connection is active, the Pull Image and Build
Image handlers should be disabled. This prevents users from clicking on
them and increases likelihood of going to create/select an active
connection.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I just forgot that in the case of Building from the launch shortcut menu, the Build option will still be there. I think in this case, hiding/disabling it is the wrong approach, so for this case I'll restore what I had before. A prompt to ask the user if they'd like to create a connection
