Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi GeneviÃ¨ve, welcome to the wonderful world of Eclipse contributions ;)

Couple things:
* There should be an empty line between the commit title and the description
* There should be a Change-Id line, see the commit hook on http://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit
* Make sure your API baseline is set up correctly, as Matthew mentioned there should xxx@xxx.xxx annotations in new methods/APIs. See http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/LTTng_Eclipse_Plug-in_Development_Environement_Setup#Define_an_API_baseline

As for the contents itself, I'm not sure if we want to wait until there is some implementation (or tests?) done, since the actual organization might change as it goes.

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/ITmfEventMatching.java -> All method names should start with a lower-case letter.

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventDependency.java -> We use 'f' prefix for field (member) variables, but the automatic getter and setter generation from Eclipse doesn't handle this well... The method names should not have the 'f', neither should the method parameters.
