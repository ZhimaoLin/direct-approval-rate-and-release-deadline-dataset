I am OK with this + 1 minor nit that even is not in the patch per se. 

That being said, I am very uncomfortable with no names in the copyright header. Etienne, you don't need to change your code, yet, I may submit a patch later, I will consult with the team to see if I am being to harsh.

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketIndex.java -> asserts can be flat out removed. This was coded back when I though java and C are the same thing. :(

My opinion on authors is: add them when they contribute a non trivial piece of code and will maintain it.

For the copyright, I believe I give my rights to the project by adding the "signed-by" and signing the CLA.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

Hi Etienne and Matthew

Some general comments about author and copyright.

> For the copyright, I believe I give my rights to the project
> by adding the "signed-by" and signing the CLA. Correct me if
> I'm wrong.

By adding the "signed-by" and signing the CLA you indicate that the contribution is in compliance with the Eclipse Foundation Contributorâ€™s Certificate of Origin (see http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CoO.php)

The Copyright line in the copyright header indicates who are the copyright owners. (see http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php). For your case you have to know if it is you or your Employer. 

Adding yourself to the Contributors in the header, indicates that you wrote the contributed code but doesn't mean you are the copyright owner. 

This particular contribution fixes coding style and typos. I don't think it is copyrightable. 

Since you don't see the need to add you name to the name of contributors for these files I'm ok to push it as is.
