I think we have a difference of opinion, I think time is greater or equal, you seem to put time is above or equal... I don't think one is inherently wrong, I think someone else needs to settle this, bushido style!

Line:309, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> greater not above please

good catch.
I'll fix it tonight.

Line:309, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> Here again, it was a comment fixed by Mathieu.
I'll replace it. I really don't care for the difference between greater and above.

Not worth a -1, but for future ref, try to add the "ctf: " prefix to the commit message. "Fix multiple issues" is quite general ;)

I agree with the [ctf] tag. This patch was done a week before you tell me the same thing in an other patch-set. Now, I'm always adding the prefix in all the new patch-set.
