This is more for ourselves for now, since performance testing is not yet fully production-ready and we may still improve the methodology.

But you're welcome to read and see if it makes sense

Patch Set 1:

Could you wrap the text manually, at around 80 lines, plz? It's probably not worth going back and changing EVERYTHING now, but for the new or edited text it's probably worth it. It makes it more readable in source form, and makes the diffs much smaller (one-word change won't change a whole paragraph).

The only place where you can't really wrap is within a <li> (list item), or else that would break the list.

Patch Set 1:

Manually wrap text? I'm not all for that.  

That's all good when the text is final, but what if I add a word (or a few words) and the line is now 110 characters instead of 80. We'll have to wrap recursively. It would be much easier if the wikitext editor provided a word wrap preference. In the meantime, you can just adjust your editor window :p

Patch Set 1:

I remember using a LaTeX plugin that did have some kind of auto-wrapping... it was a bit slow though, so they were probably doing their own thing.

For our doc, well, I don't see why doc code shouldn't be treated like Java code. We format the Java code to make it easier to read, maintain etc. If I add a condition to an if () and it ends up with a long line, I have to wrap it manually too.

Or we could always edit the files in an external editor that does auto-wrapping, it would make it less painful ;)
