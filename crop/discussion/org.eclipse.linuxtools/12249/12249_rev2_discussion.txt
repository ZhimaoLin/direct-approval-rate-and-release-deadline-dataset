DESCRIPTION

tmf: Insert null values for newly-created attributes

Instead of requiring every state provider to explicitely insert
a value when creating a new attribute, we can have the attribute
tree do it for them. Then, if the provider wants to set it to
something else, it's just changing a variable in memory.

This fixes a potential problem in the LTTng-kernel state provider,
where a value could get reset to null if no new attributes are
created between two sched_switch events.
