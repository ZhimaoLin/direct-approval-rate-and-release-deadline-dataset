Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> hehehe

Line:421, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> I'm sorry, I don't get it, could you explain  why when I call getAnalysisRequirements() twice I get two different ArrayLists()

Line:421, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> The objects will have different instance ids, but the equality test shows that they should be the same since the're empty.

Did you call it from an analysis that overrides this method or from  another that doesn't?
