Some comments

I'll look at the XML patch as well.

Matthew, Alex, any advice to give on the requirement type comment (see my comment below in TmfAnalysisRequirement.java)?

Line:153, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> Either do me, or return a suitable default. Idem for all such TODOs

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/IAnalysisModuleHelper.java -> This interface should extend IAnalysisRequirementProvider instead.

Line:65, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> You don't need to add the authors if they are the same as the file's

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> This is really LTTng specific. DOMAIN wouldn't apply for say a gdbtrace... 

See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6511453/extending-a-enum-in-java for an approach to still be able to have a finite set of values for different trace types.

I personnally thought the String more flexible, especially with the XML analysis where you wouldn't know which requirement to select using the approach I mentioned above.

Maybe someone else has other advice to give on this?

Line:65, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> doesn't hurt, doesn't harm IMO.

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> How about something like "scope" String it's a very ctf like notion, but used in languages too. 

So you can have domain.kernel/ eventName.tracepoint

internally you can use super-fast enums and whatever you want though.

TLDR: Strictly formatted String are another half-half solution

TLDRTLDR: Strings

Line:65, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> doesn't hurt to do it, doesn't hurt not to. sorry for the ambiguity.
