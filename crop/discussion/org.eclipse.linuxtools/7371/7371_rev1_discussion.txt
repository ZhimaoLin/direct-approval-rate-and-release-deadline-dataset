DESCRIPTION

Don't use empty new String().

Creating a new java.lang.String object using the no-argument constructor
wastes memory because the object so created will be functionally
indistinguishable from the empty string constant "".  Java guarantees
that identical string constants will be represented by the same String
object.  Therefore, you should just use the empty string constant
directly.
