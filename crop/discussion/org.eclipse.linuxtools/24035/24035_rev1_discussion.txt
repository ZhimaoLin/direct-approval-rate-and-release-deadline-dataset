DESCRIPTION

lttng: Speed up the lttng.ui tests by reducing a delay

waitForJobs checks every second if the job manager is idle.
I could check more frequently. With this change, the test
runs in 90 secs instead of 240 secs.

Ideally these tests should use SWTBot, and not depend on arbitrary timers. Still, very good improvement in the meantime. 1m30s vs ~4min for me here.

I'm also ok to push that even if I'm not 100% sure if we get into the situation when a job was scheduled but not started yet. Is it then seen as idle? Let's see. 

Since the tasks that are done before before waitForJobs() is done in a job, I think it's a good way to verify if this task is actually finished.

Patch Set 1:

"when a job was scheduled but not started yet. Is it then seen as idle?"

The javadoc says:
The job manager is idle if no jobs are currently running or waiting to run.
