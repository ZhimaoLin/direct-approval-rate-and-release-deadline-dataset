DESCRIPTION

lttng: Handle threads in statedump events

In the statedump of a kernel thread (tid), we used to only check the
'ppid' field to get the paren thread. This works only for *processes*,
not for threads.

For threads we should use the 'pid' field to indicate which is the
parent TID.

Thanks to David Goulet for pointing this out!
