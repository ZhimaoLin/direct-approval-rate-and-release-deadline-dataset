DESCRIPTION

Bug 508405 - Fix copy to container to support stopped containers

- fix ContainerCopyToCommandHandler to issue cause of any
  DockerException to the user
- fix CopyToContainer wizard to pass whether the container is
  stopped or not
- fix CopyToContainerPage to override the destination controls
  when stopped to just add a single Text widget and no browse
  button
- fix ContainerDirectoryDialog invocation to include a message
  which contains the container name in it
- fix CopyFromContainer as well with regards to displaying the
  cause of any DockerException rather than the top-level message
- fix the copyfromcommand handler enablement to be if the container
  status is not unknown
