DESCRIPTION

tmf: Simplify streams opening in the HT_IO constructor.

A created file doesn't need to specify the "append-mode" when
opening a stream to be at the end.

Hoists the file opening statements outside the "if/else".

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

"if (newFile)" means we want to create a new file. It's possible a file currently exists with this name, but we want to squash it (it could be a leftover from a previous run that failed to build completely, fox example). I think we should keep the "false" call.
