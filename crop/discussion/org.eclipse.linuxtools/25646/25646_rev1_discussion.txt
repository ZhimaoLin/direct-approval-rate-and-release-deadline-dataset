Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Have you been editing this file with Windows? It added \r on every line, that makes for a quite ugly review :p Could you repost the patch with end of line being just \n instead of \r\n?

Also, take a look at the file in gerrit. It will highlight in red every place where there is a trailing space or a space where there shouldn't be. Please edit the file to remove them.

Thanks
