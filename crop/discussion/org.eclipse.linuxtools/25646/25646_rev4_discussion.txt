small typos, one question

Line:3453, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> the abstract class returns

Line:3457, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> automatically select the required events.

Line:3459, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> The term "information" is a bit generic. Would "help text", or something similar make more sense? I realize this isn't just related to the doc, but the implementation too.

Line:3459, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> We wanted to add another attribute that would give more details about something related to the requirement and the analysis at the same time without being a help text (which we thought would be specific to the requirement only). But I guess help text defines it more at the end.
