Last round of comments. I'll take care of updating these.

Line:3453, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> of an analysis. For example, an analysis could need an event named...

Since IAnalysisModule extends the IAnalysisRequirementProvider interface, all...

or not, (comma) and add "(no requirements)" at the end.

last sentence is redundant.

Line:3457, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> a type,  that sentence could be reworked a bit

In the earlier example...

so do -> like

LTTng Control

select -> enable

making a call from -> calling

mention in which class ValuePriorityLevel is (TmfAnalysisRequirement)

Line:3459, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> at the [...] level

general help information o.O

"information" is not quantitative, you cannot say "one or many information". Perhaps the method name should be reviewed ;) (getHelpText() was mentioned in an earlier review)

Line:3475, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> say TmfAnalysisRequirement.ValuePriorityLevel. It will help the auto-fix-imports find it. And it's not terribly good to import inner classes directly.

Line:3506, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> trace -> trace session
