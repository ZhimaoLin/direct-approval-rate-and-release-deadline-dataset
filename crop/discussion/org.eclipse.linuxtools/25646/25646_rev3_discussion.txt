Thanks for writing documentation! :)

Some comments now

Line:3457, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> You could add a sentence saying what could potentially be done for a requirement type, like "with an 'event' type requirement, a trace generator like the LTTng control could automatically select the requirement events".

Line:3463, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> I'm not sure about the "It is recommended..." sentence. Is it really recommended? Maybe if it's static. But the lists of events should definitely be static (they will be used both for the requirements and the canExecute methods). But I'd leave out that sentence.

Line:3505, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Could you add 

* Generate a trace from requirements

Line:3463, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> I was referring to the fact that it would be irrelevant if that method is called multiple times. But I'll remove it and let it at the developers discretion.
