DESCRIPTION

TMF: Fix behavior of XML time graph views with experiments

Expected behavior:

* Show the content of analyses when the trace contains those analyses.
* If experiment, show the content of analyses if any of the trace or the
experiment itself contains those analyses.
* Empty if no trace contains the required analyses.

Quick comments

Line:250, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> Why a List? Does the order matter? And, while I don't think we do that now, but what if one analysis is shared by more than one trace? You'd want to have it only once? Set might be better here.

Line:256, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> you can use .addAll()

Line:259, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> here too, I think? (can it really return null? won't it just return an empty set?)

Line:270, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> (I think I said that in another patch...) We should move this to the ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems interface eventually.

Line:532, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> specified

this comment should go inside the if clause

Line:536, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> you could merge these two if's together with a &&

dumb copy-paste from other parts of the code...

actually, it's not dumb copy-pasting, you're commenting code I haven't touched in this patch :p just moved back 4 spaces
