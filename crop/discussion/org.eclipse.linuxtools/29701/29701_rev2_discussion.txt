DESCRIPTION

TMF: Fix behavior of XML time graph views with experiments

Expected behavior:

* Show the content of analyses when the trace contains those analyses.
* If experiment, show the content of analyses if any of the trace or the
experiment itself contains those analyses.
* Empty if no trace contains the required analyses.
