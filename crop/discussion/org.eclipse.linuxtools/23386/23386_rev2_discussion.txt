DESCRIPTION

tmf: remove open trace directory and use open trace file instead

For directory traces like CTF the user has to select one of the 
files of the directory trace. The open procedure will first verify
that the parent directory is a valid directory trace. If yes, then it
will be opened with the corresponding trace type. To cover the index
file of CTF which is in a subdirectory of the trace directory, also
the grandparent directory of the selected file will be checked for
a directory trace type. If neither parent or grandparent directory
is a valid directory the file will be imported as before.

This looks good, I am not sure about the grandparent test, but it's the best answer so far.
