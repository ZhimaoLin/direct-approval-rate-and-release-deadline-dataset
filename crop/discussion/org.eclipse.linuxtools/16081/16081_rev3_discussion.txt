DESCRIPTION

RPMStubby: remove most feature project stub option

This removes the "Stub out an RPM specfile" option from
every type of resource except a feature.xml inside a
feature project. The option was showing up for anything within
the feature project, including .html, .txt, and everything else.

This change looks fine to me. It's worth noting that this also disables the Stub command from showing up when the selection is a feature project, but the StubifyHandler currently only deals with file selections so this isn't removing any functionality.

Maybe in the future it might be worth supporting 'stubifying' from the context of a project selection. For example, given a project selection, determine the file(s) of interest (getInputType could do this) and create the generator accordingly.

This change seems to depend on another (though it doesn't seem like it should). Either way I'll wait until the previous change is approved.
