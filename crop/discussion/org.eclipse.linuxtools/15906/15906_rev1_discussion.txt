Warning: lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java uses 3.8 API (SWT.MENU_MOUSE).

Therefore, I'm not sure that targets 3.6 and 3.7 are still relevant.

We might want to fix that and still support 3.6 and 3.7 but I'm not sure yet. Stay tuned ;)

Helpful addition.

I see some additional problems with targets < 4.3:
- some tests in org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests.trace don't compile because they us JUnit test API's that is only included with 4.3 and later. I'm not sure how to address this.

- MANIFEST.MF in org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui has errors. This can be fixed easy by removing the minimum version number from org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk and org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk
