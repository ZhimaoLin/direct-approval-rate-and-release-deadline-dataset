DESCRIPTION

Bug 476598: Validate the directory chosen for the image build.

The directory chosen for the image build must have all of its content
readable as the build must generate a compressed archive stream of this
content. Perform a simple check that the folder is readable in the
wizard page, and do a more thorough check in the handler.
