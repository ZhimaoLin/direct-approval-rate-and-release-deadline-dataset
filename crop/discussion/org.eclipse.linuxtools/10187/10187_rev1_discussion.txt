DESCRIPTION

Use transparent color for unknown states in ControlFlow/Resources view

The TRANSPARENT value is used for unknown states. When many states occur
in the same pixel range, the pixel now takes the color of one of the
states within the pixel range. The selected state color for a pixel
can change with regards to the current widget size and time range. The
tool tip information may or may not be related to a transparent state
which does not match the visible color under the cursor.

I just tried this branch, it's pretty cool!

One concern though: if one looks at a zoomed-out Resource View for example, we see a lot of IDLE color, but the tooltip on them says "State: UNKNOWN".

I think it's fine to show the idle color, because that's what gives a good high-level view. I also think it's fine that we DO NOT say "State: IDLE", because the tooltip is for drilled-down information, and we know it's NOT idle for the whole pixel.

However, it's not that we don't know what the states are (we do in fact), but it's that there is too much information to show in only one pixel. Maybe we should use something like "State: Multiple" or something similar?
