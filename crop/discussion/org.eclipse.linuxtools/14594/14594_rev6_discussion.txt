DESCRIPTION

RPMStubby: Python Egg template

Simple parser to parse a setup.py for its
setup properties to be put into a python specfile
template.

Not complete but can be tested to see if following
python packaging guidelines.

LocalFedoraPackagerPageThree.java within
eclipse-fedorapackager needs to modify btnStubbyBrowse
selection to allow InputType.PYTHON_EGG to bring up
file dialog for egg when creating new Fedora RPM Project.

Todo:
    o test cases
    o ignore function calls
    o support triple quotations
    o cleanup some values (e.g. surrounding brackets)

Amend:
    o added javadoc
    o fixed case of setup(...) function being 1 line
    o handles empty files
    o handles incorrect setup(...) function
    o added StubbyLog.logError in catch statements
    o added as popup action when right-clicking setup.py files

Looks good overall, just a few small bits and it's ready to enter.

Line:48, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/parser/PythonEggParser.java -> Common code style in Linux tools is to have {} around if statements. Please fix it everywhere.

Line:70, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/parser/PythonEggParser.java -> Missing {}

Line:67, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/StubbyEggGenerator.java -> Please don't generate BuildRoot. It's not needed for long time. Looks like Python template is a bit outdated.

Line:169, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/StubbyEggGenerator.java -> No need to clean the buildroot either, rpmbuild handles it internally.

Line:185, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/StubbyEggGenerator.java -> No need to generate clean section at all. Handled by rpmbuild internally.
