Line:225, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> I'm surprised that method public String[] getAvailableTraceTypes(Comparator<String> comparator) is in the baseline. I wrote that method as part of a patch but I removed it before the patch was merged. Nothing to change for you. I'll remove it in a separate patch an merge it back public String[] getAvailableTraceTypes().

Line:411, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> Here you assume that TmfExperiment is always an instance of ITmfTrace. It's ok for now, but we'll need to change it when this is not true anymore (probably will never happen)
