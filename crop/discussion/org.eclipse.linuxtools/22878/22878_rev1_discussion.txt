Looks good. I'd just like more documentation in the javadoc to explain what this root entry is and is not.

Line:425, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/AbstractTmfTreeViewer.java -> Since this is an abstract method that concrete classes will need to implement, maybe add some more documentation about the root entry here. 

At least mention that this entry will not be displayed and that its children are the first level of entries that will appear in the tree.
