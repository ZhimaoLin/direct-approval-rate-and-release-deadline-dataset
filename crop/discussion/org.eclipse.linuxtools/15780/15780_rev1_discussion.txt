DESCRIPTION

Revert "Check for number of counters on '/dev/oprofile/stats/cpuN'"

This reverts commit 41db326e1ff11ae11d44e66ed662678f4cfa9472.
This is completely wrong, and not the same as the number of hardware
counters.

I cannot reproduce the previous issue anymore. Counters are showing up correctly and profile works as expected.

I'm also unable to reproduce the previous issue, but it's clear that the hardware counters should not be determined by /dev/oprofile/stats/cpuN as this just lists statistics about the processors.
