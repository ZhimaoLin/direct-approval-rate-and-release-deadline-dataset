Some small comments

Line:135, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisModuleTestHelper.java -> Here a Set could be used instead of ArrayList

Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> Here you could use HashSet instead of ArrayList, unless the insertion order is important.

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> These could be made static final.

Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> The names are not really explicity. Is any of them meant to have any special meaning? If not, you may keep those generic names, but maybe add some javadoc, for example, in getRequirement1() /** Returns a requirement of type 'type1' with values 1,2,3,5 */

Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> No they have no real meaning. It's only to make requirements available for tests. I will add some javadoc though.
