Some explanatory comments.

Please ensure everything is still as expected.

Line:128, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisModuleTestHelper.java -> my brain melted

Line:28, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> To define "static" classes (like utility classes, or abstract factories), mark the class final, and add an empty, private default constructor. This prevents anyone from instantiating the class (or extending it to do so).

Line:38, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> Those aren't meant to be public, right? If they are, feel free to change them back.

Typically private fields would go after public fields, but here they are used in the public fields below.

Line:65, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> static initializer block, it will run with the other static declarations whenever this class is loaded.

I just found out you can have more than one such block, they will all run in order. noice

Line:38, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/AnalysisRequirementFactory.java -> They are meant to be public. Unit tests in the following patch use those values in the asserts. Patch coming in a bit.
