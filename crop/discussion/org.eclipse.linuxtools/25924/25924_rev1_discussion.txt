DESCRIPTION

ctf: [rfc][wip][omg] replace slow hashmaps with fast arraylists for
events

This is not yet yielding performance improvements asside form in the
profiler, however, at this point, we are spending 10% of our time
blocked by IO in the best case scenario... this is good for a trace
READER.

(this was still a draft comment, not sure if it is still applicable)

Line:264, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> why not use a int directly instead?

If it's because of "muh API"... then at least check the value before casting.
