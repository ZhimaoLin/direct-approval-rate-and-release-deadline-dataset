Line:255, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> I fail to see any reason why an ImmutableList would be needed here. You know it's just an ArrayList internally right?

Line:315, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> What about very large index? Do we really want to allow a GB-sized list?

Line:324, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> use ensureCapacity() instead

Line:344, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> It does not consider the case where it is a singletonList due to unset id.

Line:348, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> use ensureCapacity() instead

Line:315, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> When a performance problem arrises, we should fix it, but I would make it clean in the first pass.

Line:324, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> ensure capacity ensures the capacity, not the size. You cannot do 
list.ensureCapacity(1000); list.get(400);

Line:344, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> Done
