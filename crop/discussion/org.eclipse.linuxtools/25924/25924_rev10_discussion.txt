Line:254, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> that is awesome

Line:318, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> Indeed! However, reading about it, I believe using ensureCapacity() once before the loop may be more efficient because it could avoid growing the list many times at the add(). May not be worth it though?

Line:345, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> <=
