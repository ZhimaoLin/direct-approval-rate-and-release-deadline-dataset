Line:356, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> ensureCapacity requires arraylists. So fEvents as a list won't work, I need to cast it.

Line:185, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/EventDeclaration.java -> how about deprecating this method, and adding a new one that takes a (int id) ?

Line:82, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/EventDeclaration.java -> you don't need this anymore do you?

Line:356, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> If you will always 100% of the time be using an ArrayList (not a different type in the case of unset id, for instance), and you WANT to use methods specific to ArrayList, then declare the field as an ArrayList too (instead of "List"). This way you won't need to do instanceof checks.
