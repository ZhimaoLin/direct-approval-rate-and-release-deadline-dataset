More questions than comments, but putting -1 to get some attention ;)

Looking very good, the possibilities are promising!

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmldefinition.xsd -> What determines the type of the value here? In the example you use "-1" "0" "5" etc. but how do they get converted to integer values?

Shouldn't there be a 'type' attribute here too, to link to the different kinds of TmfStateValue's?

Line:147, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmldefinition.xsd -> just to be sure, "delete" here maps to removeAttribute, right? (which should be called "nullify recursively" or something of the sort, anyway).

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmldefinition.xsd -> The definedValue can be anything, it's just a map of name => value.

It's when you use them with $my_defined_value in state values or state attributes that it takes the type defined for that state value. 

But this element just allows to define constants to use in other places in the XML.

Line:147, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmldefinition.xsd -> yes indeed.

When it is all approved, I'll add xs:documentation to this XSD

Oki, that answers my questions. I still think 'delete' might be a bit ambiguous, but "removeAttribute" is ambiguous already, so no loss there...

Since this patch relates closely with the next one, I'll wait for both to be approved before submitting.
