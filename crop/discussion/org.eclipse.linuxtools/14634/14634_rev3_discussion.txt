DESCRIPTION

tmf: Clean up tmf.core.trace package

Move some notions out of this packages and into their own:
- tmf.core.trace.indexer (for the ITmfTraceIndexer interface)
- tmf.core.trace.indexer.checkpoint (for the checkpoint indexer)
- tmf.core.trace.location (for ITmfLocation and its gang)

This will prepare the grounds for the upcoming on-disk B-tree indexer.
