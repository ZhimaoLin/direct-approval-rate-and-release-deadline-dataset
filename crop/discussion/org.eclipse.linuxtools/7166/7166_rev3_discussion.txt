Line:40, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.snapshot/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/snapshot/SnapshotPreferencesPage.java -> What's the point in having this property change listener which doesn't do anything?

Line:77, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.snapshot/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/snapshot/SnapshotPreferencesPage.java -> Can't we use ConfigurationScope.INSTANCE
  .getNode?
