DESCRIPTION

Add preferences page to launch provider.

Use ScopedPreferencesStore to store preferences.

Added preferences page for launch provider in order to specify a default
plug-in for the specific profiling type. An IScopeContext instance is
used to create an IPreferenceStore where preferences are stored and
retrieved.

I've confirmed everything else works. Just a minor modification needed.

Line:41, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.snapshot/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/snapshot/launch/SnapshotLaunchShortcut.java -> This if statement should be moved into the above one. At least this way we're only doing fewer unneeded comparisons.
