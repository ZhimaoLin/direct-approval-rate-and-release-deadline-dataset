DESCRIPTION

ctf: Fix decoding of an invalid packet id type.

When an event id is not present, it is assumed to be zero.
Otherwise, it must be a _valid_ integer.

The current implementation accepts a "struct" as an id and map to the event id zero.

This fix throw an exception on an invalid id.

LGTM, makes sense.

However the added test in the CTF-testsuite seems unrelated to this change (it passed without this patch already). Is this normal?
