By the way, this is a benchmark, right? Not meant to be executed in unit tests, right? I wonder if it could not be the first official benchmark using the org.eclipse.test.performance plugin.

That said, I'd say push it for now (with the variable name java-style) and when I start with the performance test, I'll move it there. To be discussed later (thursday?)

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/headless/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> Pretty c-way of writing variable names :p

Sounds perfect, I have a few more benchmarks in the tree.

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/headless/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> D'oh!
