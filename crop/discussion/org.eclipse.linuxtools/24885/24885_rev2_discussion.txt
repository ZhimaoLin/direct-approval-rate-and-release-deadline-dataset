Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

I haven't tested it, but here are some comments reviewing the code.

Line:60, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/traces/get-traces.xml -> extra tab here

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/headless/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> private? public? protected?

And does it have to be static? In an eventual world where we have automatic benchmarks, this class would extend PerformanceTestCase and there the class will be instantiated, so it would be good to minimize to work to be done once that happen (soon hopefully)

Line:59, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/headless/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> blank line to remove

Line:68, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/headless/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> what? will that not cause and infinite loop on an invalid traces[i]?

Line:145, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/headless/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> You could add a text here to show what the output means. You probably know, but me running this benchmark, I'd need something more verbose ;-)
