Patch Set 5:

I've reduced the set of features to just :

org.eclipse.tm.terminal.connector.ssh.feature.feature.group
org.eclipse.tm.terminal.connector.local.feature.feature.group

This should include everything necessary for vagrant, and docker terminal support, while still including slightly less than org.eclipse.tm.terminal.feature.feature.group.
