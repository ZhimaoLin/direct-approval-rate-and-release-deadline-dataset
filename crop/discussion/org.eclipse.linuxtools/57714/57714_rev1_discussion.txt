Patch Set 1:

Do we really need *all* of terminal.tm in the target platform ? From the early investigation I did, we might at best need 'org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control', org.eclipse.tm.terminal.view.core  and some of the ui classes. I think we'd know for sure once we replace our use of the main console with it.
