Here's my stab at it.

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> I object to these imports ;)

That works too. I though about not having TmfEventsTable have to know about TableColumn (so it could be a TreeColumn or a TableViewerColumn underneath, etc.) But either way works, it would be a small change in both cases.
