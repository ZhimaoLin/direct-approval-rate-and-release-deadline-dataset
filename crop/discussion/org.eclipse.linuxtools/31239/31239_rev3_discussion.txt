DESCRIPTION

tmf: Do not expose TmfEventTableColumn in TmfVirtualTable

The "filter ID" doesn't make much sense to put in TmfVirtualTable
either, but that eventually won't be needed after we rework
the filters.

tbh, I preferred the first version, "create a new column and give it to me so I can mess with it" isn't really nice encapsulation.

That's how it works with Table which this class attempts to mimic.

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> no event table stuff in this class

Line:925, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> It's ok to set it even if it's null. Also, wrong alignment.

Line:929, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> This part really belongs in TmfEventsTable. Easily done if this method returns the newly added column.

Line:938, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Not sure if this class should try to guess what the user wants to do with the column width.

Ok, if we used a Table (or TreeViewer or whatever), we'd have to do it this way.

Would be nice to have the TmfEventsTable not have to handle TableColumn objects directly (just passing style arguments and such). We can look at that later.

I think it's fine to have viewers access directly the widgets that they control.
