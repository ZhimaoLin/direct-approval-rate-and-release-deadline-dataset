Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This is a problem for the case where the standard import wizard is used. There is no (nice) mechanism to remember the dialog size for part of a wizard; we would have to remember the size manually in the preferences and resize the dialog midway through the wizard which would be confusing behavior. Unless someone feels strongly about it, let's not do that for now.
