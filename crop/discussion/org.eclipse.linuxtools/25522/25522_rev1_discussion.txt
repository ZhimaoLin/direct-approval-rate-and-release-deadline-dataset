DESCRIPTION

tmf : changing the way to build the Timegraphview.

This patch removes the notion of resolution of the state system (a fake) to make a real resolution of the view.
Then we can change the way to build the view to make it faster.

Wait for PS2 to review.

Line:1104, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Keep this fonction and propose a implementation in the abstractTimeGrapView. Remove the useless code in the over views.
