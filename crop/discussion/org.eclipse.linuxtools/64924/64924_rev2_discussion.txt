DESCRIPTION

Bug 485973 - clicking test connection does not behave as expected

Removing the part of code that blocks until the Docker daemon
  responded to the 'ping' request (or time out occurred)
Also, fixed side problem where the client is null when creating
  the connection, so the ping would fail immediatly o_O
Also fixed problems in SWTBot tests where the Docker Explorer view
  was closed during some previous tests, leading to an error.
