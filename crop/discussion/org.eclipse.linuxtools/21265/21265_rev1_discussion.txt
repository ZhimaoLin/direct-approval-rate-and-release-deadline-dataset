DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add XML-defined CTF-like trace class for unit tests

As a developer, I want to unit test some complex analysis on very specific
scenarios, mostly for CTF traces. Even the simplest tracer-generated trace is
too complex to provide unit test material, we have to manually inspect it and
find a place where the scenarios happen and that is error-prone.

This patch provides a class that uses the customXmlTrace functionnalities, with
a pre-defined format definition and XSD to generate XML traces for it. But the
events this class returns are transformed so that the customXmlEvent parsed by
the trace (with a unique name and fixed fields for all events) are more
CTF-like, with fields different for each event.
