DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add development trace for TMF unit tests and XML analysis development

This development trace uses a custom XML definition and converts custom XML
events to TmfEvents, where the fields and their values are defined through the
XML fields. To illustrate, here is the content of each type of event:

CustomXmlEvent: fields = "a | b", values = "1 | abd"

would transpose to this

Development trace: a = 1, b = "abd"

This type of trace will be useful to unit test analyses involving LTTng kernel
and UST traces for instance.

Patch Set 16: Code-Review-1

Sorry for starting late into the conversation. In my opinion, extensions for testing purposes should not be part of the main plug-ins that are going to be delivered as part of products. I would suggest to put this extension into the example plug-in. 

If you want to add the possibility to install the example for users (without having to use the source code) then we could add a example feature that users could install.

Patch Set 16:

That would be like the "developers tools plugin" proposal of patchset 3, but at least, the example plug-in already exists. But that needs to be installable by the users who now become developers!

So I would leave the public Development Trace Stub in xml.core.tests plugin so we can write specific unit tests for CTF trace analysis. And add the actual trace to the examples plugin.xml?

That would require adding the "Examples [and tools]" feature to TMF.

Patch Set 16:

God, this is patchset 16 and I still have no idea where to put it! If it doesn't go into tmf.analysis.xml.core, there is no reason to put the unit test part in tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests, since, except for the xml extension of this trace, it has nothing to do with data-driven analysis.

So I,ll just move it as a stub in tmf.core.tests, for use by all tests plugins, and forget about the help for XML development trace. It's not a usecase we have now anyway.
