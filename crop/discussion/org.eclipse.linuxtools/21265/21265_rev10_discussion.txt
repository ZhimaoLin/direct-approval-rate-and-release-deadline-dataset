DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add development trace in the TMF developers tools

This development trace uses a custom XML definition and converts the custom XML
event to a TmfEvent, where the fields and their values are defined through the
XML fields. To illustrate, here is the content of each type of event:

CustomXmlEvent: fields = "a | b", values = "1 | abd"

would transpose to this

Development trace: a = 1, b = "abd"

This type of trace will be useful to unit test analysis involving LTTng kernel
and UST traces for instance.
