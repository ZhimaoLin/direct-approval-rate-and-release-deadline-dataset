DESCRIPTION

tmf: call all signal handler before handling nested signals

Signals that are sent within a signal handler used to be sent before
the original signal is handled by all relevant signal handlers. This
can cause some unwanted behavior.

With this patch the signal manager ensures that each signal is handled
by all relevant signal handlers before dispatching a nested signal.

Unit tests were added for the signal manager.
