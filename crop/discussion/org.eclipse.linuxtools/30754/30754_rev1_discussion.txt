At first sight, I have no major objection, especially that all traces we have so far are eventParser. Maybe some of the people who originally made the trace not a parser may have more valuable insight on the subject? Would that be Meredith Scott or Patrick?

Line:63, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomXmlTrace.java -> is that an extra white space I see between implements and IThingy? :p

Line:453, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> what if fParser != this? shouldn't this be fParser.createTimestamp

Line:453, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Nope, there should be no actual offsetting as it is a relative time range.
