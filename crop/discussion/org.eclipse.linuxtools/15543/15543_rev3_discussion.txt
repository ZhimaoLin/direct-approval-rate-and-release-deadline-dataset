DESCRIPTION

lttng: improve import from control view (bug 412337)

- Import dialog selects by default all traces
- Import dialog selects default project with name Remote. It will
be created if needed.
- For Kernel traces trace type "LTTng Kernel" will be set
- For UST trace trace type "Generic CTF Trace" will be set
- Trace name in project will be constructed with information about
session, kernel or ust, ust buffer type (UID or PID) etc by
concatenating the names of directories within a session.
- For network traces now the Batch Import Trace Wizard will be opened
instead of the legacy trace import wizard
