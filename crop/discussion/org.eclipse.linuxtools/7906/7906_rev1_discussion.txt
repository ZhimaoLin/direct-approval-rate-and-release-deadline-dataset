Patch Set 1: (3 inline comments)

Just some minor nitpicks.

Line:31, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.coverage/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/coverage/launch/CoverageLaunchShortcut.java -> Comment not needed.

Line:78, profiling/pom.xml -> Though things aren't in alphabetical order with tools at the top (they should have been at the bottom), we should put coverage either above/below profiling-feature. I think either would be fine.

Line:16, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.coverage/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this import needed ? Nothing seems to depend on it, and removing it causes no errors for me.

If change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/7948/ passes through, the only thing needed to create a new profiling type will be the extension points in this plugin.xml, and changing all the Coverage* class references to Provider*.
