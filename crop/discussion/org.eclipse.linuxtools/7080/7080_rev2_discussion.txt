Patch Set 2:

The addFilter method triggers a refresh call, which calls performApply for the counterSubTabs. addFilter method was being called before the counterSubTabs were instantiated, causing the NPE in the 1st time the Event tab was called.

The solution was to separate the creation of the filter from the creation of the tabs and call it after the  counterSubTabs are instantiated.
