DESCRIPTION

ctf: add Event header data types and extract IDefinition

This is a composite datatype described in the examples of the ctf spec.
Right now, the chances are that many people will re-use this pattern so why not
enhance its performance.

The IDefinition is a step towards having a much leaner api for CTF.
