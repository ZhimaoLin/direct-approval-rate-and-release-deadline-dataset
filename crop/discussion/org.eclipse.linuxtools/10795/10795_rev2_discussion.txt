DESCRIPTION

lttng: Don't throw irrelevant exceptions in state system tests

Some tests expect exceptions, so these have to keep the "throws"
clause. For everything else, handle the excpetion in a try/catch
which will fail() the test if they happen.

This makes it simpler to extend the test cases, since the throws
may or may not be relevant in the subclass.
