DESCRIPTION

Bug 481218 - DockerImages view shows same repo name instead of all variants

Using the 'repo()' instead of 'repoTags()' method to retrieve the actual
 repo name for the Docker Images.
Making sure that there's one DockerImage per repo name
Changing the equals/hashcode implementations in DockerImage to distinguish
 2 images with the same id but with different names (otherwise, a single
 tree item was displayed in the Docker Explorer view).
Also preventing exception if image id is less than 12 characters.
Added SWTBot tests to verify the number of items in the Docker Images view
 and in the Docker Explorer view.

I did some research.  There is a bug with Table on MacOSx and Windows.  The cell height cannot be changed.  On Linux, the cell height is dynamic and expands as needed to show the text with multiple lines.  There apparently are Table alternatives such as KTable, but there isn't time to get these passed into Orbit.  A solution that works for all three would be use a TableEditor to add a drop-down Combo which shows all the tags in their full form in the DockerImages View.  How you handle the DockerExplorer View is your call.

So I spoke to Eric for a bit and I like his suggestion of turning our tables into trees. It should be possible to preserve the look/feel as-is with one slight change : There would be a drop-down arrow to the left of the 'ID' label.

We could do the following :
- If an image has multiple repo/tags, we have a child item called 'Repo/Tags that' lists the entries under it.
- If an image has a parent image, we could have a child item called 'Parent' and list the image ID that was used as a base.
