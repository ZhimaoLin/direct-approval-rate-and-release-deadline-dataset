DESCRIPTION

Bug 481218 - DockerImages view shows same repo name instead of all variants

Using the 'repo()' instead of 'repoTags()' method to retrieve the actual
 repo name for the Docker Images.
Making sure that there's one DockerImage for all repo/tags in the Docker
 Images view, but one Docker Image *per repo/tags* in the Docker Explorer
 view
Changing the equals/hashcode implementations in DockerImage to distinguish
 2 images with the same id but with different names (otherwise, a single
 tree item was displayed in the Docker Explorer view).
Also preventing exception if image id is less than 12 characters.
Added SWTBot tests to verify the number of items in the Docker Images view
 and in the Docker Explorer view.
