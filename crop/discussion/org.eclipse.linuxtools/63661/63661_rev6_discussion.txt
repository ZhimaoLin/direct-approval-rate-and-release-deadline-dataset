DESCRIPTION

Bug 481218 - DockerImages view shows same repo name instead of all variants

Using the 'repo()' instead of 'repoTags()' method to retrieve the actual
 repo name for the Docker Images.
Making sure that there's one DockerImage per repo name
Changing the equals/hashcode implementations in DockerImage to distinguish
 2 images with the same id but with different names (otherwise, a single
 tree item was displayed in the Docker Explorer view).
Also preventing exception if image id is less than 12 characters.
Added SWTBot tests to verify the number of items in the Docker Images view
 and in the Docker Explorer view.

Xavier, can you try out https://git.eclipse.org/r/64811/ on MacOS to see if this provides multi-line cell support ?

Roland: using your patch, I have this result (without my patch applied): https://www.dropbox.com/s/uuck2wi1yx4qfrq/Screenshot%202016-01-21%2011.46.23.png?dl=0
So technically, the "Repo Tags' columns effectively shows all values, but the vertical alignment is incorrect amongst all columns. Is there a way to fix this ? How does it render on Linux ?
In the mean time, I'll rework on my patch to remove the DockerImage duplication but still make sure they all appear in the Docker Explorer view.

Patch Set 6:

It looks like all the entries are still fixed size, only that size is now for 2 entries. What happens if you have a DockerImage with 3 different repo tags ? Do all the entries grow to 3 ? If all entries have just one tag does it shrink to 1 ?

I'm guessing it really might not be possible to have a variable width table on MacOS/Windows in this way. I can ask Alex and see what this means since the snippet of code was taken from JFace.
