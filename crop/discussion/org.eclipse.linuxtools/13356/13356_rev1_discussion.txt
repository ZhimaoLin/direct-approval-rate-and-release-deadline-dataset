DESCRIPTION

Improvement to pie chart slice colours.

First 15 slices still use the statically-defined colours from
IColorsConstants.java, but later slices are now given randomized colours
so as to make adjacent slices more visually distinct.

Looks good; a few issues. See inline comments.

Line:27, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> Do not add trailing white space. You can configure you editor to remove trailing white space as a save action.

Line:83, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> This should probably be called getSliceColor

Line:91, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> I am curious why have a mix of static and generated colours ?
If your algorithm is good at generating colours why not use it exclusively ?

Line:73, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChartPaintListener.java -> I think an accesser should be used here instead of accessing colorList directly.
In fact just make sliceColor protected

Line:63, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/IColorsConstants.java -> Please remove commented out code.

Line:91, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> I found that using random colours for all slices tends to make drab-looking pies. I kept the static colours for the first few slices to make pies a bit more pleasant to look at.
