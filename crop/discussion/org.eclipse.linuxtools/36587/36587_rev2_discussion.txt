DESCRIPTION

ctf: Lock the CTF test-suite to an older known commit

New test cases have been added to the upstream CTF test suite.

the older version of the testsuite.

Line:101, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/traces/get-traces.xml -> how about just a git fetch instead of checkout+pull?

Line:101, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/traces/get-traces.xml -> fetch would not update the local "master" ref. "pull" is actually fetch+merge (or fetch+rebase, depending on how it's configured).

Maybe it's not needed in any case... but just mentioning that the behavior wouldn't be exactly the same.
