DESCRIPTION

Add 2D queries support in the HistoryTreeBackend.

We allow to make automatic range 2D queries in the History Tree.
For the standard HistoryTree, it means that we query the complete branch that intersects a time.
The result is a TmfStateIntervalList that contains the intervals list, the begin and the end time of this query.

2D query will populate the view by asking the backend a list of intervals that suits its.
This method is a thread safe adaptation of "dynamic cache" implements in the patch : https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/19330/.
For the history tree backend, the range is the size of the leaf for the query's time.
