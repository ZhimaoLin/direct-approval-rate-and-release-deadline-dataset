DESCRIPTION

Bug 494574: Prevent refresh from running when connection disabled

- by setting imagesLoaded, containersLoaded to true on an innactive
  connection, we prevent any logic from triggering further refreshes
  when we know they'll fail
- the refresh job in the docker explorer content provider should run
  asynchronously
