DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix histogram label background to be theme-friendly

The histogram text controls are now labels and no longer have their
background color set so that they can naturally inherit from their
parent's background whenever the color changes due to active/inactive
view part according to the theme.

The histogram filler area now takes its color from the parent
composite's current background color whenever it is redrawn.
