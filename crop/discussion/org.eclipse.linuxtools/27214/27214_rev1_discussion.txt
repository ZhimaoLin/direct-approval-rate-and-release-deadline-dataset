DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix histogram label background to be theme-friendly

The histogram labels no longer have their background color set so that
they can naturally inherit from their parent's background whenever the
color changes due to active/inactive view part according to the theme.

The histogram filler area now takes its color from the parent
composite's current background color whenever it is redrawn.
