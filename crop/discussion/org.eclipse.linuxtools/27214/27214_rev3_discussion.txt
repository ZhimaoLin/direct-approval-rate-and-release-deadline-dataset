DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix histogram label background to be theme-friendly

The histogram text controls are now labels and no longer have their
background color set so that they can naturally inherit from their
parent's background whenever the color changes due to active/inactive
view part according to the theme.

The histogram filler area now takes its color from the parent
composite's current background color whenever it is redrawn.

Patrick, getMaxNbEventsText was public and I had to change it when I changed for using label. I made it package visible instead but this breaks the API. Therefore, we should try to get this in soon if we want to go with that approach.

Line:372, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramView.java -> It seems like it would be a better design to have a method that tells the Histogram widget what is the lost event state and let it do the update and layout itself.

Line:173, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> Should they all be renamed?

Line:378, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> Not sure if this is needed anymore, can Label have focus?
