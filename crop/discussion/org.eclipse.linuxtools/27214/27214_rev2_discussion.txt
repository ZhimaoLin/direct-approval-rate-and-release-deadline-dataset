DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix histogram label background to be theme-friendly

The histogram labels no longer have their background color set so that
they can naturally inherit from their parent's background whenever the
color changes due to active/inactive view part according to the theme.

The histogram filler area now takes its color from the parent
composite's current background color whenever it is redrawn.

On GTK2 (Ubuntu 14.04) the labels are still the wrong color. I will investigate.
