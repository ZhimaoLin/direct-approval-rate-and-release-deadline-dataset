You need to add this test to AllTmfUISWTBotTests.java

The test case hangs (see inline comment)

Would it make sense to have a common base class for test classes TestCustomXmlWizard and TestCustomTxtWizard. They have a lot of similarity.

Line:124, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestCustomXmlWizard.java -> Maybe to make it clearer, have a different constant for the custom txl parser than the project name.

Line:161, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestCustomXmlWizard.java -> Test hangs here, because the dialog was closed a few lines above. Remove this line and add the selection to the parser.

Line:168, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestCustomXmlWizard.java -> This method is a copy from TestCustomTxtWizard.java.
