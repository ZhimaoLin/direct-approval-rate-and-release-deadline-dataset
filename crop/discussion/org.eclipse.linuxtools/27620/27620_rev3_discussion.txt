Patch Set 3:

Oh snap, sorry Genevi√®ve, I cherry-picked the version I had pushed to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/27825/ . But yours is better actually since it fixes the test.

We should cherry-pick from master to stable-3.0 in general though, doing it the other way around makes no sense.

So should I push my version to the master version of this patch? Cherry-picking a patch to another patch also makes no sense to me ;-)
