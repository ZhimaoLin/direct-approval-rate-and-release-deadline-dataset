Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Here is my take on this patch: 

Without this patch, users might not be able to analyze existing traces in the Control Flow View (CFV) and Resources View (RV) as they were used to. Especially, if they only miss the state dump. So, they might not appreciate that when they upgrade to Luna.

So, I'm leaning to support this patch for the Luna release and after Luna we should implement a way to notify the user if a trace doesn't have all necessary events in a trace, while still allowing to open the trace and show the available data in the CFV and RV.

Patch Set 1:

Allowing just sched_switch is completely arbitrary. If anything, requirements should have been removed altogether from this analysis.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Requirements are a new concept that we haven't had time to fully embrace yet. 

So for this analysis, I'd lean to put it all optional for now, until they can be made more expressive, like "at least one of events Sched_switch, syscalls or sched_wakeup", or "one of event sched_switch or context pid".

But help messages can be written from requirements and soon we'll be able to select analyses and automatically generate the traces for them, then requirements will be very important.

So -1 to try an empty mandatory set for now.
