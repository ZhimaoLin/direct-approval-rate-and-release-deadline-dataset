Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

This patch seems to be missing a AnalysisRequirementFactory, which should be in the commit. Question is, how did this pass Hudson validation??

Still, don't depend too much on CI, you should always test patches locally for warnings/errors before pushing them (especially warnings, like Javadoc warnings, those wouldn't fail Hudson builds).
