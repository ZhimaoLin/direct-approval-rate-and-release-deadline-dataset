DESCRIPTION

Bug 494585: Don't query an inactive connection for property information.

The connection information query for the properties view will wait as
much as 2 seconds to retrieve a value. Make this entire process
asynchronous to avoid UI hangups. In the case of a disabled connection
there is no need to even query for connection info.
