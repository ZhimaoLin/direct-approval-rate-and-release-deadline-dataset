so you want to merge the two patches? Why did it fail? Was it picking up an outdated pcap.core.tests from the reactor? It should work as long as the actual version number of the plugin is higher than what alltests requires.

Yeah, we might as well merge the 2 patches, for what that first patch is worth :p It was trying to get an unexisting version of the plugin. See log https://jenkins.dorsal.polymtl.ca/job/PerformanceTests/50/console

Patch Set 11:

It was not finding pcap because it was installed in another maven repository. You probably had the first mvn build set to not use a private repo and the alltests one was set to use a private maven repository. Here's a summary of what happened:

mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Installing ....pcap.core.tests-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to /var/lib/jenkins/.m2/repository

...

mvn mvn -f alltests/pom.xml -Dmaven.repo.local=/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/PerformanceTests/workspace/.repository

can't find pcap.core.tests in /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/PerformanceTests/workspace/.repository !! It's actually in /var/lib/jenkins/.m2/repository

So you think this can work even if there was never a pcap.core.tests 3.0 release? If so then, push it and let's try, day is young, we have time to recover the jenkins job before the 4AM run ;-)
