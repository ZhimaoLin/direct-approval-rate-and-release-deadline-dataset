I'd say let's push it and see how it goes!

Line:256, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.alltests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng/alltests/PerfResultsToJSon.java -> Just asking, shouldn't we handle those exceptions ourselves and act on it? Or would the throw just make the build fail and we'll receive an email for it?

Line:256, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.alltests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng/alltests/PerfResultsToJSon.java -> I think it's better to let the build fail. The output would most likely be wrong and we should be made aware of that quickly.

I just thought about this... we need a CQ to use something in orbit (org.json). I will do that.

Patch Set 10:

If it's in orbit, the CQ has already been done and it's accepted in Eclipse, no need to do that, or else I misunderstood, but we had no CQ for any other orbit addition

We add one for guava. Maybe we forgot for other ones. But according to the poster https://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf we have to.
