Line:463, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> I think we should do something with the exception. Perhaps log it? Activator.getDefault().logError ?

Line:463, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> Probably... Like many wizards of the kind, there could be a button at the end "See log" displaying all messages generated during the import.  I'll let you guys decide what would be the best way to handle this.

Line:463, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> my proposal : 
make a multi-status (multi-pass) 
add all "failed" in there
if multi-status !empty show an error box.

I'm not going to implement this anytime soon.  I could either add a TODO comment in the code to remind someone to do it later, or else leave this patch open for anyone to take it up sometime later
