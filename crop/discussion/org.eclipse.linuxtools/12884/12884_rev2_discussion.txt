Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

See inline comment. We shouldn't mess with Exception.

Also typically, we don't externalize messages in logs, this is only for messages in the UI.

Line:462, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> We should avoid doing this. This will also catch RuntimeException's, (like NPE, ArrayOutOfBounds, etc.), and those should be checked with null checks and the like in the code, not by catching them.

Sonar agrees, don't bother him about it. ;)

Abandoned

It's been sitting there for too long.  The bug report shows there is a bug and "somebody" will correct it cleanly later.
