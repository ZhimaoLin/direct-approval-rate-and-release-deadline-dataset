DESCRIPTION

Changed the TimeGraphCombo's filter to a blacklist rather than a whitelist.

This should better support views that modify the list of entries dynamically.

Doesn't really matter, but for future commits, the title should be in the present tense "Change the TimegraphComb..."

The idea is that if we revert or merge this commit, it wouldn't be very clear reading "Revert: Changed something". Is the thing changed or not at that point?

Line:291, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> "should not be shown" or "should be filtered out"

Line:292, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> "will be shown"

Line:650, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Either remove the comment or fix it? Did you mean to update the dialog so that the result is the filtered list instead of the non-filtered list? I'm ok with that. Then if the dialog result is an empty list we can do setFiltered(null).
