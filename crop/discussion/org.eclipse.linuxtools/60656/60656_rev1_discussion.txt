DESCRIPTION

The VM creation wizard should support using box files.

Instead of requiring that the user 'add' the box through the Box View UI
before being able to use it, automatically do this if the user specifies
a valid path to a box in the 'Box Name' field.

The only assumption required is that a box file is a readable file path
and ends in '.box'.
