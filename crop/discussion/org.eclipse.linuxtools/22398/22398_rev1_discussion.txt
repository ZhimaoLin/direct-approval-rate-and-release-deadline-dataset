DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix most Number unboxing problems

Based on the patch at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/19470/
Don't enable the new warnings, but at least fix the most obvious
problems that the patch exposed.

This won't prevent similar errors from creeping in again, but
at least the current code should be somewhat improved.

You will need to rebase to the latest master and you'll have to update it because the TimeStampFormat class was changed heavily in master. 

Since have to update this patch anyways, make sure that year in the copyright headers are updated to 2014 where applicable.

Line:1009, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I would prefer not to change the interface. Use a local variable Long localLong = rank; which achieves what you want to achieve (only one creation of an Long object)

Thanks for the review!

About the copyright years, I'll push a separate change for a pass of the copyright tool. The way I see it, if both patch A and B change the same file in 2014, and we revert patch A, we don't want to revert the year to 2013 too.

Line:1009, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> IIRC, the improvement here was to have callers use a Long directly. If breaking the API is problematic, then I'll just revert it as to how it is in master.
