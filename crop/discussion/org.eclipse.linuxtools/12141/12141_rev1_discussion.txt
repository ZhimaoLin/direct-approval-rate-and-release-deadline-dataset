DESCRIPTION

tmf/lttng: Remove unneeded (non-Javadoc) comments

Those comments are not needed anymore. With Java >= 6,
overriding classes marked xxx@xxx.xxx also inherit
the Javadoc from the base class.

Also some auto-formatter actions, to remove those pesky
tabs.

Patch Set 1: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

I like the change. I thought to do it once but I was overwhelmed about the amount of files to change. Hopefully you had an automated way to do it.

-1 because you need to fix the copyright in all touched files and add year 2013. Even if these changes are not code changes, the files still changed content.

Patch Set 1:

It was kind of semi-automated, creative use of Find and Replace... I didn't trust my sed skills enough to do it 100% automated ;)

Ok I will run the copyright tool on top of this commit, it should catch all the year changes.
