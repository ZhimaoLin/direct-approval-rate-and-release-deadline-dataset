DESCRIPTION

tmf/lttng: Remove unneeded (non-Javadoc) comments

Those comments are not needed anymore. With Java >= 6,
overriding classes marked xxx@xxx.xxx also inherit
the Javadoc from the base class.

Also:
- Some auto-formatter actions, to remove those pesky tabs.
- Ran the copyright tool. Might have updated unrelated files.
