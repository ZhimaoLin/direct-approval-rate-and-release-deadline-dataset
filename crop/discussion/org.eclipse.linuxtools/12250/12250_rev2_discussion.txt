DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove ITmfStateSystem#isLastAttribute()

This method was meant to be used as a kind of
"wasThisAttributeJustCreated()". But, if no new attrbiutes are
created, the last attribute would still return true, even if
it has been existing for a while!

So remove this potentially confusing method from the API
completely.
