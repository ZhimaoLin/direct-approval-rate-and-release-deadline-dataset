DESCRIPTION

Do not repeatedly inform user about insufficient permissions.

When a launch configuration for OProfile is created there should not be
repeated attempts to inform the user that they have insufficient
permissions to run opcontrol. It is enough to bring up the error dialog
when the configuration is launched.
