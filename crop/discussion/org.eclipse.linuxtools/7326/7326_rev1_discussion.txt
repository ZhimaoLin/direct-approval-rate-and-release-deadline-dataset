DESCRIPTION

Updated Enum handling for a CTFTmfEventField

This change provides a way to extract the Enum long value and Enum 
value name from the CTF EnumDefinition and store it in a
CtfTmfEventField object. Before this change the CtfTmfEventField
only contained the Enum value name.

For this change, the class Pair<A,B> which was part of the legacy 
LTTng core is now integrated in TMF core.

Patch Set 1:

This review is to agree on the way Enums are handled in TMF/CTF. If it is agreed on then we need to update all references to it.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good to me.

Side note, imo we should rename SimpleDataTypeDefinition.getIntegerValue() to getLongValue() imo, since its return value is a long.
