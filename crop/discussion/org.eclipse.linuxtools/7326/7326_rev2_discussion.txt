DESCRIPTION

Updated Enum handling for a CTFTmfEventField

This change provides a way to extract the Enum long value and Enum 
value name from the CTF EnumDefinition and store it in a
CtfTmfEventField object. Before this change the CtfTmfEventField
only contained the Enum value name.

For this change, the class Pair<A,B> which was part of the legacy 
LTTng core is now integrated in TMF core.

trailing white spaces need to be fixed, Looks great though.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> trailing white spaces?
