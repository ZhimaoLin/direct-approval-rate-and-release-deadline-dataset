DESCRIPTION

Updated Enum handling for a CTFTmfEventField

This change provides a way to extract the Enum long value and Enum
value name from the CTF EnumDefinition and store it in a
CtfTmfEventField object. Before this change the CtfTmfEventField
only contained the Enum value name.

For this change, the class Pair<A,B> which was part of the legacy
LTTng core is now integrated in TMF core.

Added JUnit tests for Pair class.
