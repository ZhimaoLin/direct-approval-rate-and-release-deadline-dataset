DESCRIPTION

Add perf comparison feature [WIP]

This feature consists of collecting perf data files, generating
tree models from these files (using current perf functionality),
and building a result from these two models that is displayed
in a new view.

The logic for comparing the two tree models is located in PMSymbolMatcher,
matching PMSymbols are stored in a PMSymbolMatch object. Furthermore, all
classes extending Action have been moved to o.e.l.internal.perf.actions.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Overall, I'm happy with this change. Just some comments to address/consider. Also given that this change introduces ~1000 LOC, we must have some test cases for this.

Line:31, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/PerfDataCollectionView.java -> I'm a little unsure about this view. Does it make sense to use a view to display just two pieces of information ? i think you're right that the only way to select the items is by clicking on the two sessions, but is there another way to display what the user has selected ?

Line:57, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/model/PMSymbolMatchUtils.java -> This would seem to refresh the "Perf View" for each of the two perf data files. Ideally the Perf reporting should be isolated so that it's possible to get back the entire tree structure without it also updating the UI. This way, you can get rid of the createDefaultConfiguration method here.

Line:22, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfDefaultLaunchConfig.java -> This class seems almost identical to PerfLaunchShortcut but it isn't being used. Can this be removed ?
