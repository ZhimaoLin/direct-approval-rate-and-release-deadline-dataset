DESCRIPTION

Add perf comparison feature [WIP]

This feature consists of collecting perf data files, generating
tree models from these files (using current perf functionality),
and building a result from these two models that is displayed
in a new view.

The logic for comparing the two tree models is located in PMSymbolMatcher,
matching PMSymbols are stored in a PMSymbolMatch object. Furthermore, all
classes extending Action have been moved to o.e.l.internal.perf.actions.

Simplified functionality.
