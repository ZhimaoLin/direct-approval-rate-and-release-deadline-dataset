DESCRIPTION

Bug 480401 - Create a launch configuration when running an image from wizard

Creating a LaunchConfiguration when the container starts, adding
  a creation_date attribute to be able to find the latest launch config
  for a given image name, when the user selects the image again to run
  another container.

Protecting the domain class initialization by checking that retrieved
  info from the client are not null.

Retrieving last launch configuration for the selected image name
  to prefill the wizard (some refactoring was required to pass
  the last launch configuration and fill the page models)

Added SWTBot tests
