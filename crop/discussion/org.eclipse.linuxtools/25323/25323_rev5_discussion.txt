DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix deadlock in analysis module

Deadlock occurred when renaming a trace while its analyses are ongoing.

The refresh of supplementary folders is now done outside of the analysis
synchronization lock.

It is not necessary to trigger the refresh when cancel() is called,
since it will be triggered when the analysis execution is completed
(whether it was cancelled or not).
