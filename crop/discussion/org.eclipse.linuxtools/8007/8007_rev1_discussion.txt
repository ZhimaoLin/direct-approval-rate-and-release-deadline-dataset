DESCRIPTION

Oprofile: Moved calling createEventsFilter() from createCounterTabs to initializeFrom.

This was causing the LaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy to be saved before loading the
configuration, which caused events to appear as disabled in the first time the tab is
loaded, even if they were enabled.

I can confirm the bug, and this fixes it. It seems that creating the filter was triggering a performApply from inside initializeFrom.
