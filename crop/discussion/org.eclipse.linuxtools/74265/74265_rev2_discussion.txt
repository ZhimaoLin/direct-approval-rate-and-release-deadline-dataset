DESCRIPTION

Bug 495075: Don't force re-typing password on registry account changes.

Attempting to modify the registry account brought up the old values
(server name, user name, email), but set the password empty so that
users would have to re-type it to confirm identity. Since the secure
storage framework authenticates the user anyways, the password should be
populated like everything else.
