DESCRIPTION

Fix oprofile launch tests.

Refactored oprofile launch configuration ui components in order to
mock these in the launch tests, avoiding any opcontrol functionality
to execute. Doing this fixes all the failures that occurred from not
providing root password.

Additionally, some nested test classes were extracted, as their
functionality is useful in the rest of the tests.
