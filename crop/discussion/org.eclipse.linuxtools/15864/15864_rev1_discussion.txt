DESCRIPTION

RPMStubby: eclipse template uses tycho if possible

it exists, and build using tycho and using the pom.xml;
otherwise, RPMStubby will use the feature.xml file as before.

I have a mixed feelings about this. I don't like the totally separate generator for tycho and for feature with so much of the code duplicating. Also that way if one generates using feature.xml feclipse-maven-plugin will not be used which is something that should not happen. Probably one generator with if/else tycho would be better. 
My main concern is having to update in two separate places when changing eclipse packaging guidelines.

Line:59, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpmstubby/RPMStubbyUtils.java -> Don't overuse static fields. This is done once per run so just create it and let it die when done with it. It's very rare for someone to run stubby few times in a row so caching(static field) makes no good.
