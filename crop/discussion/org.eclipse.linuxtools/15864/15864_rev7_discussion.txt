DESCRIPTION

RPMStubby: eclipse template uses tycho if possible

RPMStubby will find the parent pom within the project if
it exists, and build using tycho and using the pom.xml;
otherwise, RPMStubby will use the feature.xml file as before.

The change works as expected. Signed-off-by present to indicate Neil has made the contribution in compliance with Eclipse contribution guidelines.

There's just a small change to be made since this is contributing API.

Line:34, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpmstubby/RPMStubbyUtils.java -> Currently this class is going to be part of API. It is however, only used from an internal package, but if this is the intent, then the minor version number needs to be bumped to 1.2.0 for this plugin (in the manifest) as well as for the pom.xml. The class also needs xxx@xxx.xxx annotation.
