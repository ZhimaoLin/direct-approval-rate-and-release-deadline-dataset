DESCRIPTION

Bug 497100: Add extension point for Docker Connection settings.

The following methods that provide default settings for docker
connection settings are converted to classes that implement
IConnectionSettingsProvider, and that contribute to the
o.e.l.docker.core.connection extension point :

defaultsWithUnixSocket() -> DefaultUnixConnectionSettingsProvider
defaultswithSystemEnv() -> DefaultSystemConnectionSettingsProvider
defaultsWithShellEnv() -> DefaultShellConnectionSettingsProvider

DefaultTCPConnectionSettingsProvider is also created which checks the
default TCP location (127.0.0.1:2375) if it exists.

This is still a work in progress. Ideally I'd like to add some tests and clean things up a little.

I also still haven't ported over the DockerMachine settings, which I may end up doing in a separate patch.. we'll see.
