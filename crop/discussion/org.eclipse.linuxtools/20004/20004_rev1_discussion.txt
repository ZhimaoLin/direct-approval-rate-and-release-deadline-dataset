DESCRIPTION

TMF: Fix a bug in UI when refreshing analysis elements under traces

As it was, each time we would get the available analysis of a trace, it was
constructing new objects and those objects were not the same as the trace
element's children.

Also, while implementing the XML analysis source, the analysis were not
refreshed when the trace didn't already have children.

This patch makes sure that returned analysis elements are also trace's children
and when the project is refreshed, all analysis will be refreshed as well.
