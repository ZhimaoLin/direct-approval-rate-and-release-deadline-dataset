Looks good.  Just fix up the messages.  For messages with dynamic content, you need to use {0} {1} {2} for each dynamic  parameter.  You then use:

			MessageFormat.format(YOURMESSAGE, new String[] {parm1, parm2, parm3, etc...) to fill in the dynamic parameters and create the final String.

The format is standard so that translation can occur properly.
