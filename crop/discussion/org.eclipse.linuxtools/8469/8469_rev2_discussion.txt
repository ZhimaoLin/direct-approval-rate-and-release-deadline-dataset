Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Having a few problems.

I had an OProfile set up for an executable.  I then set the project settings to Perf.  The dialog comes up as expected.  If I say No, it runs the OProfile.  The OProfile failed but not sure if it was due to this.  Next time, I said Yes and it ran Perf fine.  I then set the project to use gprof.  Ran it again with Timing and it popped up a message regarding Perf (not gprof).  I said No.  I tried Callgraph instead and said no.  I was presented with a list containing a profile with Callgraph in the name.

Now, regardless of my problems, I would like to see the Dialog message fleshed out more.
e.g.
"This project has one or more Profile Timing configurations set up for the executable selected, but none of these profiling configurations use the current default tool for Profile Timing which is set to use Perf.

Do you want to create and use a new profiling configuration that uses Perf?"

You will need to dynamically fill in the tool and profiling category in the message.

Patch Set 2:

Thanks for the review. The problems you encountered happened because I missed passing in the required configuration to getProviderIdToRun, from where project properties are extracted. This means the current change is only looking at the workspace settings, which is incorrect when project settings are enabled. I will update this patch set to fix this problem and the dialog messages.
