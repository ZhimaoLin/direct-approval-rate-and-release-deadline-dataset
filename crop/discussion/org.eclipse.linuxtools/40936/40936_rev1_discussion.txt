Patch Set 1:

Important note: manually disposing TreeNodes often causes hard-to-track NullPointerExceptions to occur, so I opted for a design that lets the garbage collector take care of discarded TreeNodes (which seems to work fine). So if you are wondering why I removed the calls to TreeNode#dispose(), that's why.
