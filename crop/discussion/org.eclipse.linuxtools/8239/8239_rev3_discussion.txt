This looks fine to me, but just a minor chance to be made.

Line:241, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/launch/provider/launch/ProviderLaunchShortcut.java -> I think this expression is correct except for the fact that the round brackets with the digit contained inside would only match a single digit, whereas I think it should match 1 or more digits.
