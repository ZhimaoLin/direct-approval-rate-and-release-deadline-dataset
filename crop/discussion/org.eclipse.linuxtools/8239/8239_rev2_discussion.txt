Just one other bug brought about by the change.

Line:234, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/launch/ProviderLaunchShortcut.java -> There's one small issue with this. This will work when a particular shortcut doesn't apply any defaults from a CMainTab (or any tab that ends up calling generateName()). Unfortunately, many other tools use a CMainTab, and this calls that method. So calling rename on the generated name will print the tool twice (eg. Foo [Perf] [Perf]). (In both cases using our own dialog's generateName()).

I think the easiest solution is just to check if the configuration already contains "[ toolName ]".
