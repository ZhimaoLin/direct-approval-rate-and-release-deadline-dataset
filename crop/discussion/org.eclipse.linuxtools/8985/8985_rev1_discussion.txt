DESCRIPTION

Fix time scaling problem in Histogram View

If scale of TmfTimestamps of a trace is not nano-seconds
the start and end time of a trace have to be scaled when comparing
with entered time values.

Additionally, a NPE was fixed that was happening when clearing
the histogram while executing asyncExec() to update the display
