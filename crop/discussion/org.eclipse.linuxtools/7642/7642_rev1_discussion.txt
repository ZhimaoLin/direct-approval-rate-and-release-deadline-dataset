DESCRIPTION

Apply plug-in specific shortcut attributes only when launching shorcuts.

Since shortcuts do not set the "provider" attribute in their respective
configurations, a provider id is needed to get a shortcut and apply
plug-in specific attributes. Configurations that have the "provider"
attribute set are not shortcuts, and therefore do no need plug-in
specific attributes to be applied.
