DESCRIPTION

Bug 496515 - Add privileged support to ContainerLauncher class launch method

docker ContainerLauncher: Add privileged mode support to launcher

Though the back-end and docker perspective supported privileged mode
it was not supported by the ContainerLauncher used by CDT. Fix this
by expanding the argument list to the launcher.
