Good idea!

What would you think about centering the buttons vertically with the box on the right? Right now it looks a bit weird when the window is very small.

Line:161, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/dialogs/SelectSupplementaryResourcesDialog.java -> I would add the btComp to the contextGroup. By doing that the top of the first button is aligned to the top of the white background of the tree.

Line:194, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/dialogs/SelectSupplementaryResourcesDialog.java -> To address Alex's comment, you could increase the height of the minimum size to 200 or more.

Line:194, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/dialogs/SelectSupplementaryResourcesDialog.java -> I ended up centering the button composite. Let me know if you prefer the other way.
