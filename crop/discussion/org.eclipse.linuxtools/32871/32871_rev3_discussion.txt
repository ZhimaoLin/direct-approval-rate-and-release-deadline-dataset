DESCRIPTION

TMF: Move synchronization supplementary files to a folder

This way, analysis on experiments can put synchronization-related supplementary
files in this folder and they will be preserved once the traces are updated
after synchronization. By default, the synchronization file was preserved, but
all other supplementary files were deleted. Now the entire folder is preserved.
