DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add function name mapping to the Callstack View

Initial version of the "function name mapper" for the Callstack View.
It currently only supports a text file listing addresses followed by
names, like the output of "nm [binary] > out.txt".

The next steps will be:
- Add support for reading the binary directly, by tapping into the
  relevant CDT components.
- Add a separate dialog that shows the currently imported file name(s).
- Add support for dynamically-loaded libraries. This will require some
  work on the tracer side.
