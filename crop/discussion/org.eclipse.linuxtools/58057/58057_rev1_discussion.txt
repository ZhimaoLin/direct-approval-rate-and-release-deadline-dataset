DESCRIPTION

perf: Reduce usage of org.osgi.Version.

Version was used for parsing and comparing perf tool version but it
doesn't follow the convention thus preventing from use. This commit is
to reduce usage before replacing with another implementation.
Enable warnings for unused parameters to keep the codebase leaner.
