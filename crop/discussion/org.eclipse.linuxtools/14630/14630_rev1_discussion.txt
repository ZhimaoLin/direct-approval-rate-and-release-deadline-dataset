DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make TmfTrace.buildStateSystem() abstract

This removes the need for the SuppressWarnings("unused"), since
we want to be able to throw a TmfTraceException, but we won't
in an empty method. An abstrat methods solves this (and sub-classes
can decide to not throw the exception if they want).
