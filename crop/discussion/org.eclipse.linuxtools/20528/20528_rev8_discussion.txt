Line:46, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChartPaintListener.java -> This constructor doesn't match the previous version so how is it deprecated?...it is missing the legendArea and seriesNames parameters.  Removing those parameters is an API change that requires a major bump which I think you already have done, but you need to clean this up one way or another.
