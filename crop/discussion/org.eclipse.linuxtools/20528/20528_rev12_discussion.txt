Line:89, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> This method was added to fix problems that occur when a PieChart is created without a PieChartBuilder managing it.

Pie titles are now set by PieChartBuilder (like how series names of axis charts are set by their respective Builders), and PieCharts now use a category/discrete x-axis by default. Unless each category in a category axis has a non-null name, though, it won't appear on screen, so this method makes sure each pie has at least a blank name.

Pies will always be named properly if the chart is drawn by a PieChartBuilder, but since PieChart is public API, I made this change so as to not break "plain" PieCharts.

Line:11, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/charts/BarChart.java -> I changed the modifier from public to default because only Systemtap Graphing should really ever be using this class. If you disagree with this, I can change it back to public.
