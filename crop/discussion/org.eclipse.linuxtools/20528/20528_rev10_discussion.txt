Patch Set 10:

Noticed a possible regression. A piechart is showing the first X access element at the bottom of the pie-chart.  I have set up a pie-chart to graph Count for each Exec.  In the bar-chart it correctly shows Exec on the X axis, but on the Pie-chart, it is showing SpiderOakBlue which happens to be the first exec name in the list of names in the data view.  Everything else is correct.
