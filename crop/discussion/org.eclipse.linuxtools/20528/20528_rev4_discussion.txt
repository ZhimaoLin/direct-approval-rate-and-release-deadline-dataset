Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Looks good, but a few fix-ups are needed.  The + and - buttons on the graph do not do anything when pressed.  Perhaps a handler needs to be hooked up or can these be optionally left out?  As well, when the chart is full-size, the scroll bars should either be removed, disabled, or should expand their size to take up the entire scroll-bar distance.  As they are, they can be moved fully but do nothing when the graph is full size and showing all elements.  I like how the names are trimmed to fit and expand as the chart is resized.

> The + and - buttons on the graph do not do anything when pressed.

Those are actually labels, not buttons, so they won't do anything when clicked. But the fact that you thought they were buttons means that they should probably just be buttons, so I'll fix that.

> the scroll bars should either be removed, disabled, or should expand their size to take up the entire scroll-bar distance.

Duly noted. I'll change the scroll bars' thumb sizes to update with the zoom ranges of the chart.
