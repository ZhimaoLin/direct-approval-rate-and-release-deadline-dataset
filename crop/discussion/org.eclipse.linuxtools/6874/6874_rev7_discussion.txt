Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Very interesting feature, it often happens that one wants to look at only a subset of the entries in the CFV. The Select All/Deselect All buttons are a nice touch!

It would be interesting also if the view could then prioritize the requests to update the rows that are shown first (with this patch, it continues updating in the regular order, even if entries are hidden). But for a first iteration I think this is a good start.

Patch Set 7:

Another comment, if I switch to a different trace, then come back to the first one, the filters are lost. Would it be possible to keep them in memory (in the view object) or something?

I'm thinking about the upcoming pin-and-clone feature: it would be nice to be able to set two different sets of filters for two Control Flow views showing different traces side by side.

I had noticed as well that the filtered entries were not kept if another trace was selected. I agree that this would be an interesting feature to add. My only concern is that the entries would not be "equal" between two openings of the same trace.

Even without this feature, I feel the pin & clone feature could still work. As long as the opened CFV is not closed, the filter would not get destroyed.
