DESCRIPTION

Fix PieChart to handle different swtchart versions

- swtchart 0.9 changes the title from being a Control to
  just being a PaintListener that is positioned in the Chart
  layout
- when title is a Control, we position it using its setLocation
  method
- when title is a PaintListener, we alter the title to add
  trailing spaces and we force the listener to follow the
  PieChartPaintListener
