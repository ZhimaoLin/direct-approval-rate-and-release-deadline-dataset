DESCRIPTION

Fix PieChart to handle different swtchart versions

- swtchart 0.9 changes the title from being a Control to
  just being a PaintListener that is positioned in the Chart
  layout
- when title is a Control, we position it using its setLocation
  method
- when title is a PaintListener, we alter the title to add
  trailing spaces and we force the listener to follow the
  PieChartPaintListener

This change looks fine to me. I would clean up the whitespace usage.

Line:123, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChartPaintListener.java -> I would make the usage of whitespace consistent with what this document is currently using, along with removing extraneous whitespace.
