DESCRIPTION

tmf: Don't use ITmfEventField in TmfEventsTable

TmfEventsTable used ITmfEventFields to transfer what it calls
the "fields" of an event row in the table. These are simple Strings
at their heart though, ITmfEventField is used for event payloads only.

This removes many unnecessary object creations.
