DESCRIPTION

Bug 483680 - [docker image search] search results ignore repo when
searching for repo/imagename

the searchImages method in the DockerConnection class filters the
results
  returned by the client to only retain those that contain the exact
term
  given by the user. So if the user input "jboss/wildfly", only this
image
  will appear in the result list, but if the user input "wildfly", more
  results (25 at the time of writing this message) will be displayed in
  the list.
