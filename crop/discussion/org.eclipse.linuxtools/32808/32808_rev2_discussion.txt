noob question

Line:115, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> I'm not an expert on the syncrhonization/event-matching, but now that there  can be more than one type of "match event definition" per trace, shouldn't we also check that that type is the same on the two sides?

Line:115, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> which 2 sides? And probably not. Actually, now there can be more than one event definition, but they are all of the same type so far: network. And really, I wonder if we even need that concept of type, or if that was over-engineered in the first place.

anyway,  you can have one trace use one event matching definition and the other use another one, as long as the key between the events are the same.
