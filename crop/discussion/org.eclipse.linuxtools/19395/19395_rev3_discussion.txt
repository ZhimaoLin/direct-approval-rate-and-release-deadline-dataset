DESCRIPTION

ctf: Some little refactoring in the ctf lexer.

Mostly only moving rules aroung to ease the reading.

The rule to match c++-like comment do not need to
take care of '\r'. It's a caractere like the others,
and the comment will be tuncante to the '\n'.

It seems to be failing ctf parser test cases, please verify.

Line:102, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.parser/src/main/antlr3/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/parser/CTFLexer.g -> I really prefer the ':' collin on the same line as the declaration. Do you object?

missing semi-colon. Bad git rebasing.
Should be fine now.

Line:102, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.parser/src/main/antlr3/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/parser/CTFLexer.g -> Nop, I do not object.
It's the way I'm use to read grammar.
Otherwise there is an strange indentation with "choices"

rule :
  a
  | b c
  | d e
  ;

By inserting space, it's not consitant

rule :
    a    // why adding 2 space here?
  | b c
  | d e
 ;

An other frequent way to indent is:

rule :
  ( a
  | b c
  | d e
  ) ;


Choose your poison.
