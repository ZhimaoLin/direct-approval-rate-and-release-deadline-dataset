Nice addition. Looks good.

- On my Linux machine, the first column of the tooltip is not wide enough. Hence the string "> Hover Time" is slightly chopped. Maybe increase column width or make it dynamically determine the width.

- I 'm not sure if the string "Hover Time" is very intuitive. Maybe we can find something clearer. But, nothing clear has come into my mind.

For the truncated text, the tool tip handler has now been modified to use a composite with labels in a grid instead of a table. This seems to have fixed the problem. Refer to Change I2eaf701f (bug 389328).
