DESCRIPTION

Bug 501175 - Build and Pull Image buttons enabled/disabled improperly

  for the DockerConnectionWatcher based on the DockerExplorerView
  selection
- change the ConnectionPropertyTester to use the DockerConnectionWatcher
  when given an empty list (i.e. no selected object)

  toolbar icons are enabled/disabled properly when no Image is
  selected and when no Connection is selected
