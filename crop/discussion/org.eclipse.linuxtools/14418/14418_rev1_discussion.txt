Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I had done this patch after a discussion with Patrick about the styles of the elements in the tree of the abstract time graph.

I don't have time right now to finish the patch, but thought I might submit it anyway in case someone wants to take over or want to share ideas.

Main problem:  All items in time graph view have the same height, the TimeGraphControl height should match the tree item's height.  That class would need to be refactored so height is per element and not global.

Patch Set 1:

In Windows, the table item height does not seem to be affected by the font and the text might not fit.

In Linux, each table item height is affected by the font and we can have misalignment problems with the time graph control.

Either way we could leave the responsibility to the implementer to use fonts that display properly.

We already have a similar issue if the implementer overrides getColumnImage and returns images that affect the item height.

Patch Set 1:

Should this be dropped now or rebased to master ? 
We should not keep dangling reviews.

Abandoned

Abstract Tmf tree viewer will bring that functionality soon anyway, so let's drop this
