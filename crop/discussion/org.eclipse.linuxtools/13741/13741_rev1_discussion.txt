DESCRIPTION

callgraph: make callgraph runnable with the current systemtap

- Move escaping of characters to the final stage of writing the launch script.
- Use --runtime=dyninst to work around missing return probes.
- Remove the use of probefunc() as it is not supported in dyninst mode.
- Replace the use of -o with redirecting the output as dyninst does not support -o.
- Update tests to expect the new command output format.
- Save actions:
  Organize imports.
  Add braces.
  Remove trailing white space.

This is a combination of two patches commited to master.
