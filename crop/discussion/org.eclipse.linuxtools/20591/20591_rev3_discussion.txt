DESCRIPTION

tmf: Send relevant signals in a separate thread

This reverts commit be7fc7f31ae52da752bf021e828b9992ebfc44e4.
Instead the TmfTraceUpdatedSignal is sent using the
broadcastAsync() method of the TmfComponent in the case
that the trace index already exists. This ensures that the
the TmfTraceRangeUpdatedSignal is handled by all signal
handlers before handling TmfTraceUpdateSignal.

Also, the TmfTraceRangeUpdated signal is sent using the
broadcastAsync() method instead of spawning an own thread.
