DESCRIPTION

Bug 415710: 'perf' check should explicitly handle a null process.

The RuntimeProcessFactory depends on the 'which' command to determine if
a command exists, and prevents its execution if it does not. If the
'which' command itself does not exist then the command may still be
executed. The reasoning behind this is that although the 'which' command
may be sufficient to decide that a command is not present, the lack of a
'which' command should not be sufficient to halt execution.
