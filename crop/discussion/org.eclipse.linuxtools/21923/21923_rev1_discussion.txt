DESCRIPTION

tmf: add initial place for default custom text trace types

This will allow to add default parsers to custom_txt_default_parsers.xml.
If they are edited, a shadow copy is made.
If the shadow copy is deleted, the default one returns.
These parsers can be exported, but of course, you cannot import to
the default zone.

Patch Set 1:

Hi Matthew. In he end, we need to be able to have the default file packaged with an RCP. With your patch, it looks for the default file in the workspace's plugin area. Is your intention to copy the default file to that workspace location by other means in a future patch? I think there could be a few other alternative. We could hardcode it to look for the file in the installation folder (eclipse/custom_txt_default_parsers.xml) and optionally we could use a hidden preference to specify the location in plugin_customization.ini. In both cases, we need to figure out the release engineering details (how do we get the extra file in the RCP?).
