DESCRIPTION

tmf: add initial place for default custom text trace types

This will allow to add default parsers to custom_txt_default_parsers.xml.
If they are edited, a shadow copy is made.
If the shadow copy is deleted, the default one returns.
These parsers can be exported, but of course, you cannot import to
the default zone.

The default text file is now stored in the ECLIPSE_HOME directory
