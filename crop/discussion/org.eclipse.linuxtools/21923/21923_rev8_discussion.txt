DESCRIPTION

tmf: add initial place for default custom text trace types

This will allow to add default parsers to
custom_txt_default_parsers.xml.
If they are edited, a shadow copy is made.
If the shadow copy is deleted, the default one returns.
These parsers can be exported, but of course, you cannot import to
the default zone.

The default text file is now stored in the eclipse install directory
under the templates/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core directory

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

It looks good and it seems to work. 

The only thing is that I'm not sure if we should store the default under templates/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core instead of templates directly. Please check with Marc-Andre (and others) what they think.

I'll lift the -1 if the others are ok with the current implementation.

Glad to get a -1.

The reason for adding more directories is that I see templates getting big. I see default txt, xml, json later, custom analysis, custom chart types... lots of stuff.
