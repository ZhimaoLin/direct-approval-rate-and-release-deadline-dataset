DESCRIPTION

profiling: Retire ProfileLaunchConfigurationDelegate.

It was serving no point but to add one exec method which is better to be
together with the other similiar methods in CdtSpawnerProcessFactory.

Just one small issue to fix. It might be good to wait a bit as our builds are having issues.

Line:69, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tools/launch/core/factory/CdtSpawnerProcessFactory.java -> New method in API class xxx@xxx.xxx Also, there were 3 exec methods removed from this class in a previous commit, so the bundle should have its major version bumped (2.1.0 -> 3.0.0) .
