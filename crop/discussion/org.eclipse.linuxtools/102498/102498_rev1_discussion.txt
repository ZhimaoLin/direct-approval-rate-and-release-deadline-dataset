DESCRIPTION

Bug 520536 - Running C/C++ applications on remote Docker not working

- fix ContainerLauncher runCommand method to add trailing slash
  to containerDirectory before hostDirectory as hostDirectory is
  used to index the containerDirectory in the volumes collection
- fix remote logic in runCommand to add directories to the
  remoteDataVolumes map in addition to the remoteVolumes set
  as the map is used by the CopyVolumesJob, not the set since
  the map allows the user to map a host directory to a different
  container directory if desired
