DESCRIPTION

Parse the number of samples as a double.

The number of samples can grow very large depending on the hardware so a
double should be used to store them. Samples larger than
Integer.MAX_VALUE should be represented in scientific notation.

Looks good to me, samples greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE are properly displayed. Ran successful local build and tests for good measure.
