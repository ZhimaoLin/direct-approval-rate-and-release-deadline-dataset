DESCRIPTION

(WIP) Parse the number of samples as a double.

The number of samples can grow very large depending on the hardware so a
double should be used to store them.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We don't want '.0' for integer values, and we should define beyond what value scientific notation is used.

Line:15, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/model/TreeParent.java -> I think we should add a method here to return a formatted number of samples (ie. getFormattedSamples()) and use this in the various toString() calls in the label provider. values under INTEGER.MAXINT can appear as regular integers, and scientific notation can be used for values greater.
