DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bug 428432: A trace moved to an experiment loses its trace type

- Updated all setting of trace persistent properties to use the common
method in TmfTraceTypeUIUtils, which refreshes the trace type.

- Updated the method to accept the resource as argument and to be able
to set the trace type of a trace element under an experiment.

- Added getExperiments() method to TmfExperimentFolder, and cleaned up
some code to use it.

is needed and pathString needs to be passed to the createLink() method below.

That's why the Unit test fails.
