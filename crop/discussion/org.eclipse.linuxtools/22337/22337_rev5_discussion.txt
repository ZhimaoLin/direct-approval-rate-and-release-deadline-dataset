DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bug 428432: A trace moved to an experiment loses its trace type

- Updated all setting of trace persistent properties to use the common
method in TmfTraceTypeUIUtils, which refreshes the trace type.

- Updated the method to accept the resource as argument and to be able
to set the trace type of a trace element under an experiment.

- Added getExperiments() method to TmfExperimentFolder, and cleaned up
some code to use it.
