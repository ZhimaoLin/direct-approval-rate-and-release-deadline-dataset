DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bug 428432: A trace moved to an experiment loses its trace type

- Updated all setting of trace persistent properties to use the common
method in TmfTraceTypeUIUtils, which refreshes the trace type.

- Updated the method to accept the resource as argument and to be able
to set the trace type of a trace element under an experiment.

- Added getExperiments() method to TmfExperimentFolder, and cleaned up
some code to use it.

I'm not too familiar with these parts of the code, but I confirm it solves the bug.

And a good part of this patch will come in conflict with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22341/
