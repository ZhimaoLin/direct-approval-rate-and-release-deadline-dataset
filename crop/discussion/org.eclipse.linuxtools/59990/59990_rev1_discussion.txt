Line:424, vagrant/org.eclipse.linuxtools.vagrant.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/vagrant/core/VagrantConnection.java -> This isn't ideal because we need to be sure about the path to vagrant on other systems (Windows, Mac, Linux distros where it might be at /usr/local/bin).

The nice thing about exec() was that it just required 'vagrant' to be on the path. I should either create some logic to resolve 'vagrant' wherever it may be on the PATH, or find a way to just call 'vagrant'.
