DESCRIPTION

tmf: Change to timer based coalescing of background requests

Coalescing of foreground requests are still based on signal
synchronization using start and end sync signal. Foreground requests
are meant for short and higher priority requests and need to be
processed right a way.

Seems to work well! Some small comments.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> away

Line:227, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/component/TmfEventProvider.java -> even though it's not technically needed, I think it helps readability to add parentheses in cases like these:

  boolean startTimer = (getNbPendingBackgroundRequests() == 0);

Line:435, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/component/TmfEventProvider.java -> Does this need to be protected, couldn't it be private? The "number of background requests" is really something that is specific to the internal implementation (just as the notion of foreground and background, but that's another story ;) ).

Line:435, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/component/TmfEventProvider.java -> private makes sense. No need for a new API
