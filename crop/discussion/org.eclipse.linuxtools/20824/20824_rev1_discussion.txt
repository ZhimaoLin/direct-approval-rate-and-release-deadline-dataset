DESCRIPTION

tmf: Change to timer based coalescing of background requests

Coalescing of foreground requests are still based on signal synchronization
using start and end sync signal. Foreground requests are meant for short
and higher priority requests and need to be processes right a way.

Patch Set 1:

PartialHistory uses 2 requests that must not be coalesced. That's why test hangs. A separate patch will be provided to fix that and this patch will be rebased on it.
