DESCRIPTION

Bug 393811: Prompt user on configuration creation when no config is available.

Modify ProviderLaunchShortcut#findLaunchConfiguration logic to only prompt
when there are configs available for the project being profiled, but none
for the default tool set in the project's properties/preferences.

Add null check to resources acquired from a launch configuration working copy
before attempting to access them. This is to avoid a null pointer exception in
ProviderLaunchConfigurationDelegate#getProviderIdToRun.
