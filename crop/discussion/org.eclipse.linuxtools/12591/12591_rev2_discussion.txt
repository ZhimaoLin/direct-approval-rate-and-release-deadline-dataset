Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Oh noes, the end lines were changed in the mediawiki to Windows end lines...

Well it's kind of our fault, we didn't set the encoding and end-line project settings for lttng.help and tmf.help (and quite honestly it's one of the places where it's the most important...)

We'll fix that, afterwards you should be able to just rebase this patch, and modify+save the mediawiki file, and the end lines should be fixed.
