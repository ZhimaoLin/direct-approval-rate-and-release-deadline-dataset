Line:115, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/ui/view/OprofileViewSaveDefaultSessionAction.java -> These methods are duplicated here and in OprofileViewDeleteSessionAction. I guess we could move them into SessionManager itself.

Patch Set 8:

The OprofileManualLaunchConfigurationDelegate as far as I understand was only ever meant to allow the user to have more control over the 'opcontrol' way of doing things. It would let you :

- start the daemon
- run any program(s) as many times as wanted
- dump samples out
- stop the daemon
- reset by clearing all samples

This was all done through 'opcontrol'. Now with 'operf' none of that is possible as everything is done automatically. So do we even need the "Manual" launch shortcut/deleate/type/etc. ?
