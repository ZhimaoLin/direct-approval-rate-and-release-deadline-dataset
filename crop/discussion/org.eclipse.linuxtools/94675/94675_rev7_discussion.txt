Ok, I think I see how we supported this to begin with.

There are methods in LinuxOpcontrolProvider that don't actually depend upon 'opcontrol' at all. Looking at saveSession(..), it simply updates SessionManager, which is our own xml file regardless of whether we use operf or opcontrol. Then it does a copy of the data and writes the session file back out. You can even see in the original code in OprofileViewSaveDefaultSessionAction that saveSession happens before we even determine of we're using 'opcontrol' or 'operf'.

I'll take a look at fixing this.

FYI : I have a fix for the problem I mentioned (just brought back some ode that was deleted) but I just have to figure out where to place the code, and then I can get back to reviewing.
