Patch Set 6:

I can definitely confirm through Eclemma (attempting to activate most functionality) that the deleted runtime clases are not needed. In fact there may be more things that could be up for deletion as well once this gets in.

Patch Set 6: Verified-1

This breaks the ability to save and delete oprofile sessions.

Run oprofile and some project and attempt to save the default session from the Oprofile view dropdown menu. The named session never appears.

The problem seems to be in OprofileViewSaveDefaultSessionAction. The current session is being deleted but never saved to the new name. The OpControlProvider was doing this so now we need to see if operf/opreport has anything to do this for us, or if we have to figure out some way to do it manually..

If opcontrol is not available how was that working ?

Patch Set 6:

I'd have to look at how we supported multiple sessions. My guess is it was easier when we had a central location (eg. /var/lib/oprofile) but should be more difficult to do now.
