DESCRIPTION

lttng: Disable partial-state-system tests

The partial state system tests leave many lingering threads running.
This is due to a bug in the SS analysis module, since partial state
histories need two separate state providers, and one of them is
probably never stopped.

Since partial state system are not in wide use atm, disable the
misbehaving tests until this is rectified.

Patch Set 1:

This doesn't (completely) fix the GC out-of-memory error when running all tests, but it does keep the number of threads from becoming too damn high.

This isn't for permanent merging btw, just to test running the tests without the leaking threads.

Abandoned

Not needed anymore, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/33221/ is the correct fix.
