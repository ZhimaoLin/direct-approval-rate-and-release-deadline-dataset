Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFactoryTest.java -> These last two are testing the same thing, it's just proving that 0 s = 0 ns which is not the scope of this test file. Maybe you meant to do transform(tn0) for the first one?

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFactoryTest.java -> What I mean is, do we really care if the factory creates equal-looking transforms with different constructors? What matters is that the result transform gives the right timestamp. The transform functionality of offset1 is not verified. Also, this test is not testing composeWith() so is the method name correct?

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFactoryTest.java -> I was testing the composite offsetting works but also that it returns something that is "scale" independent.

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFactoryTest.java -> what I am trying to do is exercise all code paths in an all paths lead to rome strategy.
