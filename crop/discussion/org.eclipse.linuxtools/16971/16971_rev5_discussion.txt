Works for me, just a few issues.

Line:18, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui/OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties -> The purpose of listing strings in this file is so that they may be translated to other languages (internationalization).

I don't think it makes sense to change the mnemonic value based on language, and buildType values hard-coded so they should not be translated.
