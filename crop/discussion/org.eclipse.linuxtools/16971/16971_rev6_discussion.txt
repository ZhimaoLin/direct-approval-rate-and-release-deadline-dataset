Patch Set 6:

How are the icons licensed ? Are they from the platform itself (they look a bit different than the standard package icon). Were they just modified ?

Patch Set 6:

I took an existing JDT icon and modified it to look unique for RPM. I think this should be licensed under EPL.

I plan on creating new icons from scratch to resemble the CDT build icon (a hammer) to let it be easier for users to understand at first glance to what it does.

Sounds fine. You may even consider looking through the various icons already shipped in the platform and perhaps see if there are any that suit our need.

This change looks fine to me.
