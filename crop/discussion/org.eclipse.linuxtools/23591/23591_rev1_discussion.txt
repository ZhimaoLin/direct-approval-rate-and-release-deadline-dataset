Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I looked a bit closer in this implementation and I realized that the SessionParameter class has the same content than the SessionInfo class. So, I understand that the SessionParameter class is a subset of SessionInfo class, but couldn't we just use SessionInfo for that (or even ISessionInfo in the methods)? For enabling channels I used the IChannelInfo as paremeter too (See enableChannel). As compromize you could use ISessionInfo in SessionParameter class).

(I know we talked about it and I agreed with you initially).

What do you think?
