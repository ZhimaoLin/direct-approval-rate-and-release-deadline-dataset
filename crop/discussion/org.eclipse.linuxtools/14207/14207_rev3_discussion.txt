DESCRIPTION

tmf: Consider compilation warnings to be errors in tmf.ui

Now that we have eliminated all compiler warnings in the code,
we could turn on "-Werror" to make sure no new warnings are
introduced (Brenden Conley would fail building any Gerrit patch that
has warnings).

NLS warnings remain as warnings, so that they can be suppressed in
Messages or constants classes.

This patch landed one week too late to prevent deprecation warnings
from entering the code... so usage of deprecated methods methods remain
as warnings in tmf.ui.
