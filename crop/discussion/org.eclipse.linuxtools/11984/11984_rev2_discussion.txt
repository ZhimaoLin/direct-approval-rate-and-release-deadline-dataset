DESCRIPTION

Use a read-only TextPropertyDescriptor for event properties

Use a custom, read-only TextPropertyDescriptor to use the cursor
in the value column to scroll for long property strings. In the
previous implementation, long value strings couldn't be read properly.

Patch Set 2:

I really like the idea, but it was a bit weird to have the fields to be editable by the user (even though no changes were saved).

Here's a small propostion that uses a re-extension of PropertyEditor so that we have selectable/scrollable text fields, but we can't edit them.
