Looks good to me, only minor nitpicks as comments.

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/plugin.properties -> I think this should now say "Ericsson and others"

Line:143, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/plugin.properties -> Why plural ("connectionsName") in the ID but singular ("Connection Name") in the label ?

Line:92, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/handlers/NewConnectionHandler.java -> Is it guaranteed at this point that we will be called again later ?
How would the consumer that called the command know that it might not have been executed ?

Line:92, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/handlers/NewConnectionHandler.java -> Obviously there is not such guarantee, how could there be one?
The workaround basically fails, when the rse-plugins are not present. The situation is equivalent to calling the handler with a connection that is not defined. In both situations the handler simply ignores the request.
==> It's the callers responsibility to provide correct id and name.
