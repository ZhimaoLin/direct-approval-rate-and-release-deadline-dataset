DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Make improvents to graph display.

1) When capturing a script's output to display it in a graph,
don't attempt to plot null or invalid values so as to
avoid causing an error.

2) Add labels on individual pie charts to signify which series
each pie represents. Also show a "No data" label when all pie
charts are empty.
