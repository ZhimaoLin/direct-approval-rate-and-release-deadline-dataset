avoid causing an error.

Line:172, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/charts/AbstractChartBuilder.java -> You have changed the return type to Double but below you act like you are still returning double.  For example, when the value is Double, you are getting its doubleValue() instead of just returning the object cast to Double.

Line:135, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/charts/AbstractChartWithAxisBuilder.java -> I did not know you were allowed to just equate a double with a Double as you are doing by assigning an all_valx array item to valx.  Should this be more explicit?

Line:296, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/datadisplay/DataGrid.java -> Add a comment that you are ignoring null items.

Line:42, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChartPaintListener.java -> Would it make sense to print a label saying no data to chart as opposed to leaving the graph empty or do feel the user should look at the data list?
