DESCRIPTION

Bug 499954 - Container with TTY doesn't display log or remove logs

 - add [shell] to title for exec shells for a Container 
 - add code to RemoveContainerLogHandler to handle terminals using
   closeTerminal
 - add org.eclipse.tm.terminal.view.core as Docker ui dependency
 - fix RunConsole.attachTerminal and RunConsole.attachConsole so that
   the wait for running loop doesn't run infinitely if the Container is
   already finished
 - add LOG_PTY as data for openTerminal properties
 - fix a regression in the Command column in Docker Containers view
