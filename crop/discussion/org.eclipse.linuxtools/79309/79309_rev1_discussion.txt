DESCRIPTION

Bug 499954 - Container with TTY doesn't display log or remove logs

- close existing terminal if a new terminal is not desired
- add [shell] to title for exec shells for a Container
- add code to RemoveContainerLogHandler to do a closeTerminal for
  Containers using Terminals
- fix RunConsole.attachTerminal and RunConsole.attachConsole so that
  the wait for running loop doesn't run infinitely if the Container
  is already finished
