Line:203, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> This class should be moved to the tmf.core.tests package instead of here. unfortunately there are timestamps that depend on those lttng kernel traces. Either they can be changed to use one of the stub traces that already exist. Or when the development trace is accepted, traces with those exact timestamps can be written!

Ok, it's less confusing now. Some new comments ;)

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> don't put a version number

Line:225, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> Collections.EMPTY_SET

Line:230, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> we should really fix experiment.getTraces() to not return an array ;)

Line:203, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> testGetTraceSetWithExperiment() ?

Line:208, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> You can just do

  assertEquals(expected, actual)

it will make sure they contain the same elements.

Line:215, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> same

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Eclipse does that! I don't

Line:230, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> API breaker :p

Line:208, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> But it does not make sure of the order of the element. We do want the experiment to be either at the end or at the beginning (here at the end) so that an experiment does not appear in the middle of traces. I'll leave it like this, the test is more complete.
