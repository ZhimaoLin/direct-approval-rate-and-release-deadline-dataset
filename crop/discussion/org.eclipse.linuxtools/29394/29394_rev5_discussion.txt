Line:208, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> Set doesn't specify an order though, only the fact that elements are present or not (LinkedHashSet and ImmutableSet happen to conserve the iteration order, but that is specific to those implementations).

If the order of elements is important, you should use a List then, not a Set. But then my question is, is this order really important?

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

See comment. I'd prefer we keep it a Set, but just make the unit test check Set.equals(). I don't think it matters where the experiment is in the returned collection, a view may want to put it at the top, but another one at the bottom, so you can't please everyone (and they're probably gonna have to throw in into an array anyway, so they could as well custom-sort it).
