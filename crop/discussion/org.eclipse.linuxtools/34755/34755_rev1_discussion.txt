Patch Set 1:

I cannot reproduce this problem in master as the gprof code now will ask to rebuild the project with the proper flags so the dialog in question no longer comes up.  Even so, I wonder if the correct solution would have been to change the caller who passes in the shell.  The code in question is using PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().getActiveShell(); running the code in a Display.getDefault().syncExec block.  I wonder if the call should instead be:  Display.getCurrent().getActiveShell() which should get the shell created for the default Display.
