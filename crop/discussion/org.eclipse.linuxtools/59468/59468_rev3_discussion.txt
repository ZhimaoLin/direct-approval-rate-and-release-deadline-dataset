DESCRIPTION

Bug 481217 - Tag Image command in Docker Explorer is unbound

Fixed problems where Tag/Untag images would not be called
  from Docker Explorer view
Refactored the "createControl(Composite)" methods in
  ImageRemoveTagPage and ImageTagPage classes to using
  GridLayoutFactory and GridDataFactory. As a result, the
  wizards consumes less vertical space.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

This looks fine to me. The refactoring in the handlers is the right way to go.
