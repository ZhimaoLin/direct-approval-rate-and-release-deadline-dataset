It seem like overkill to have an entire preference page just for setting the installation directory when we can add '/usr/local/bin' if it's not already in PATH.

If the user has to go into windows->preferences just to get things working then that seems like too much.

what about Windows users ? They may install Docker tools in whatever directory of their choice, and we also need to add the path to VirtualBox or VMWare (or whatever local virtualization tool is supported by Docker Machine).
I'm fine with moving this in an existing preference page, though.
If I may add, the preferences for logging are on a separate page, too.
WDYT ?

Even on windows, there's an installer for Docker Machine that would guarantee that it would be on the PATH ( https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/ ) .

If we end up adding this, then we should at least add '/usr/local/bin' by default to the path if we're on linux/macos since that would solve the problem most of the time.

Right, I'll add default sensible values for each OS so it could work out of the box for most users if they did not use custom installation paths. Works for you ?

Ok. Also, I'm guessing there's an error thrown when docker-machine can't find a driver (eg. virtualbox) on the PATH ? I'm fine with these two options being their own preference page as long as the code makes some effort to add "known defaults" on the various platforms.
