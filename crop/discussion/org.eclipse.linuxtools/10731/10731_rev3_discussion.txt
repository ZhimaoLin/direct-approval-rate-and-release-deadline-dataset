DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add clear() call before add elements to list

In various LTTng Tracer Control core model classes, the relevant 
array list is not cleared when the setter is being called. For
example, the method DomainInfo.setChannels(List chans) doesn't
clear the channel list before filling the channel list with the
new channels passed as parameter.
