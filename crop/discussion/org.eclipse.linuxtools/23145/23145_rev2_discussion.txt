Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/IAnalysisOutput.java -> will be or should be or could be? If I look the the upcoming patches, only the TmfXmlAnalysisOutputSource calls this. When first reading this sentence, it sounded to me that any output would get this called automatically but it is only the case when the Xml module gets created (and actually not when the output is requested). Also, since those are arbitrary properties, shouldn't clients be free to call this anytime? So, maybe that second sentence could be removed...

For now, we could support output parameters in the extension point as well.

And yes, clients can call this anytime, even the analysis itself can call this on all its output at a given point. The concrete output class can do what it wants or needs with it. Right now we only have the view, so when the view is requested, those properties are set as PartProperty and the view decides what to do.

And now that you mention it... there are properties (like the XML file/view ID) that should be set only when the output is requested (or else it's always the last created view that will be displayed), and others (like, says, a status) that should be sent right away to the output if it is active. I can add a boolean parameter to the setOutputPropery for those 2 cases.
