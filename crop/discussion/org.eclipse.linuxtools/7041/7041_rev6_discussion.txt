DESCRIPTION

tmf: Generalization of the statistics view

The creation of the statistics view is now based on the type of the
trace selected and his plugin definition. Thus, it is easier to provide
a new implementation of the statistics for a different kind of trace.

Patch Set 6:

patch 6 cancels patch 5. There is nothing different between patch 6 and 4, except the rebase on top of lttng-kepler branch

Looks good, minor comments.
Doesn't seem to break anything at first glance.

I think the message.properties should be per plugin, and not per package, I'll have to verify.

We'll have to see how we feel about unit tests too. Yes it's in the UI plugin, but at least minimally covering any new code might be a good idea...
