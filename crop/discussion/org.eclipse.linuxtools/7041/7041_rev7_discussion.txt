DESCRIPTION

tmf: Generalization of the statistics view

The creation of the statistics view is now based on the type of the
trace selected and his plugin definition. Thus, it is easier to provide
a new implementation of the statistics for a different kind of trace.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Ok, all other code in tmf.ui has its messages.properties at the package level (which imo makes more sense). So keep those as it is.

Comments from patch set 6 still apply though.
