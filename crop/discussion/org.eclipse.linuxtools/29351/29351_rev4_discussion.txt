Line:68, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xychart/XmlXYViewer.java -> (moving to the latest patch set)

If you insert the keys in sorted order, the TreeMap will do only one comparison every time. And I don't think that with very few keys the performance will change notably. It's more a philosophical debate at this point :P

Anyway, leaving tree Tree/Hash discussion aside, you have 3 maps here, that I assume are supposed to stay in sync? (same keys). How about creating a new class that holds the Y-Values, quark and series name, and in here only having one Map<Integer, MyNewCompoundClass> ?
