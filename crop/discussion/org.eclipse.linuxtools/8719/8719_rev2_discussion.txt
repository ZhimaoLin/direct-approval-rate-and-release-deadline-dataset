DESCRIPTION

Remove seek(time) from CtfTmfTrace and use parent implementation

The implementation of CtfTmfTrace of seek by timestamp worked 
correctly to seek within the CTF trace. However, the returned
context contains an incorrect rank of always 0. 

This incorrect rank will cause a wrong selected event in the
TmfEventsTable if the trace is used directly and not through an
experiment.

The solution is to use the TmfTrace implementation of seek(time)
instead which is handling the rank correctly.
