Everything works as expected, just a small comment regarding the naming of the launch configuration.

Line:1, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/plugin.properties -> This plug-in's launch configuration name should be "Gprof" . This is in order to keep a similar naming convention between the current profiling providers.

Line:1, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/plugin.properties -> This comment was done because all of the current timing plug-ins (Oprofile, Perf, Callgraph) give similar results and do not need descriptive names. On the other hand,  the memory plug-ins do different types of memory profiling, requiring more informative names.

Line:1, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/plugin.properties -> Agreed, I noticed this in my testing.  For the Memory plug-ins, the tasks are different (e.g. Memory Checking vs Memory Usage), but I wanted to add the tool that was being used in case others wanted to contribute a similar task.  For timing, yes, we know it is Timing.  I will change and submit a new patch set.
