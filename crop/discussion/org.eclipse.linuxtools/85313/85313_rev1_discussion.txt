DESCRIPTION

Update to docker-client 3.6.8.

- Update the Docker Client stack to 3.6.8
- Bundle-SymbolicName change 'jnr.*' -> 'com.github.jnr.*'
- The underlying input stream, that supports writing seems to be nested
under an additional layer. This likely happened due to some upstream
change between Jersey 2.18 and 2.22.2.
- Remove workaround for lack of Guava 18.0
- Remove workaround for lack of proper ExecStartParameter.TTY value

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Still a few things to do :

- Decide how strict to be with the version constraints in the manifest (should we mandate that the latest version of the stack be used ?)
- Add bug # to commit
