DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix Synchronize Traces handling

- Refresh supplementary files for each element as soon as they are
created.

- Dispose traces and experiment instances when they are no longer
needed.

- Update the experiment element traces only after instances have been
disposed.

- Fix TmfTraceElement.copy() to use the correct resource according to
its element path.

- Fix TmfTraceElement.copy() to avoid manually creating a new
TmfTraceElement and return the one created by the navigator resource
handler instead.
