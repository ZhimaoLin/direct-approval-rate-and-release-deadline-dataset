DESCRIPTION

Bug 479856 - Add "Show in>Web Browser" and "Show in>File Browser"

Added a menu entry in the popup for the "Show In" group
Added 2 menu contributions, one for the Web browser when
 a DockerContainerPort is selected, and the other one
 when a DockerContainerVolume is selected

Opening in the System Explorer reuses some code borrowed
 from org.elipse.ui.ide with some adaptations because
 the host directory for the container volume is not
 necessarily a file or a folder in the workspace, hence
 it cannot be adapted (as in IAdaptable) into an IResource
