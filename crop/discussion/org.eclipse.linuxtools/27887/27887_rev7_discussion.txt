DESCRIPTION

tmf: Initial commit of Pcap Parser

This commit is the first step toward adding pcap-reading abilities to TMF. It only adds the parser, and as such it is completely independent from TMF. The parser supports four protocols (Ethernet, IPv4, TCP, UDP) and both microsecond and nanosecond pcap files.
