DESCRIPTION

tmf: Initial commit of Pcap Parser

This commit is the first step toward adding pcap-reading abilities to
TMF. It only adds the parser, and as such it is completely
independent from TMF. The parser supports four protocols (Ethernet,
IPv4, TCP, UDP) and both microsecond and nanosecond pcap files.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

I did some spacing/alignment fixes.

Watch out, it seems the auto-formatter still xxx@xxx.xxx on a separate line when it's for a local variable.

See comments on Patch Set 8. The string-externalizing stuff could be quite big, so I'd be fine with doing this in a subsequent patch. But the hashCode/equals thing in ProtoclEndpoint would have to be addressed first.
