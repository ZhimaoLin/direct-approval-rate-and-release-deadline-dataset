DESCRIPTION

tmf: Initial commit of Pcap Parser

This commit is the first step toward adding pcap-reading abilities to
TMF. It only adds the parser, and as such it is completely
independent from TMF. The parser supports four protocols (Ethernet,
IPv4, TCP, UDP) and both microsecond and nanosecond pcap files.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review+1

Can't find anything else to nitpick about ;) I'd be fine with merging it now, as long as we don't forget to:
* Add the tests!
* Internalize everything that can be (this will be easier to do once we have the tmf.pcap part in).

Very nice work!!
