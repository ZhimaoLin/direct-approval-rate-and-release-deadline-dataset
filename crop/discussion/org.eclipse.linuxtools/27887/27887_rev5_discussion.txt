Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/pcap/core/packet/Packet.java -> If a Packet is invalid, a BadPacketException is thrown. This could happen if some fields does not make sense, or if the packet was truncated, for instance (although very unlikely).

At the TMF level, the packet is simply ignored when a BadPacketException it thrown. The exception could be catched during the construction of the parent packet so that it would instantiate a InvalidPacket. That way, the packet as a whole would not be lost.
