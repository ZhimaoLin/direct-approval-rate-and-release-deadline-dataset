DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add abstract XY line chart viewer on top of SWT chart

* Provides a viewer for line charts. With this viewer, all series will use
the same X axis data.
* It automatically creates series as values are provided for a key.
* A tooltip shows the values for each series at the selected x position.
* Series can also be manually added and the returned series can be modified,
so while "line chart" is the default representation, it can be used in other
ways.

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Packages that are internal should have 'internal' in their names, as in:
 org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.tmf.ui.viewers.xycharts.linecharts

The other two existing packages could be updated later, but this one should be fixed before merging.

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Even if it's temporarily internal until we are sure of the API? At least here we don't need to rename the package...

If you know for sure sure sure that you will make the package public soon, then ok. But I don't think it'd be a bad idea to have all these remain internal, for maybe one release cycle at least, just to indicate that this is "experimental" API.

Developers of external plugins can still use internal APIs, they just get a warning when they do so.

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Hi Alex

you don't have to have the string internal in the package for internal APIs. x-internal is enough. Since we want to make the API public eventually it's simpler to do it like that because we don't need to change the package and the user doesn't have to change anything (unless we actually change the API).

I did that for the other SWT chart packages too.

Only comments I had left were very minor style issues. They could be fixed eventually (the copyright years for example, we can easily catch that by running the copyright tool).

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I thought at first this was meant to be internal "forever" (or maybe at least, until stabilization).

If we plan to make this public by the Luna release, then it's fine we can leave it as it is and remove the x-internal before then. I'd personally think it could stay internal for one release cycle. But if you both are confident that the API/feature will be stable and useable, we could make it public for Luna.
