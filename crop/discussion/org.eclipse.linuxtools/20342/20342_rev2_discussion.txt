DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add abstract XY line chart viewer on top of SWT chart

* Provides a viewer for line charts. With this viewer, all series will use
the same X axis data.
* It automatically creates series as values are provided for a key.
* A tooltip shows the values for each series at the selected x position.
* Series can also be manually added and the returned series can be modified,
so while "line chart" is the default representation, it can be used in other
ways.

See inline comment for first comments.

Overall, this abstract class works well for data sources that can provide y values for a given set of x-values (e.g. state system). (Similar to the bar chart viewer class). I guess we could implement other abstract viewers or tooltip providers that remove this limitation. 

What's your take on it?

The java doc of the tooltip provider needs to be more clear about shared x-values.

Line:114, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfLineChartTooltipProvider.java -> This only works if each series has the same x-y relationship with the same number of values. If not then it cause incorrect values or event array out-of-bound exceptions. 

I mean there could be multiple series that span the same start and end, but have different number of data points.

However, this provider is a valid implementation for a valid uses case. However, it should be documented in the java doc so that the user of knows about this limitation.

For the other case (series with different number of data points) we could have a tool tip provider that calculates the closest data point to the x-position and highlights the closest data point.

Patch Set 2:

I'll add to the javadoc to mention that it only covers the case of common x sampling for multiple series. 

As long as this API stays internal, we can always extend it later to cover also the cases where x values may be different for each series (and update/add a tooltip accordingly). But I don't have a use case for it yet and this already covers quite a few potential charts.
