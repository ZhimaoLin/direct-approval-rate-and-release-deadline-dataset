DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add abstract XY line chart viewer on top of SWT chart

* Provides a viewer for line charts. With this viewer, all series will use
the same X axis data.
* It automatically creates series as values are provided for a key.
* A tooltip shows the values for each series at the selected x position.
* Series can also be manually added and the returned series can be modified,
so while "line chart" is the default representation, it can be used in other
ways.
