DESCRIPTION

Changing default timestamp format to include year, month, day

When using a time format without year, month, day the entered
timestamp in Histogram view will lead to incorrect time 
synchronization, because SimpleDateFormat assumes then
current date.

The displayed format doesn't change (Current Event widget for example), is this normal?

But I could test that entering a timestamp manually in the widget now correctly selects the following event in the trace.

Time format input problem fixed (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/9051/)

No need to change default settings.
