DESCRIPTION

TMF: Do not keep event matches by default when no processing unit is set

This reduces the memory footprint of even matching. Just counting the matches
is enough.

Patch Set 1:

It seems to me like the class does what it should. It's just that this class shouldn't be the parent class of those other match processing units. Maybe they should have no parent and keep their own match count if they need it, or there should be another default implementation that just counts matches. But I can't find any reference to countMatches() method so is any counter implementation really necessary for the moment?

Patch Set 1:

Indeed this class is quite useless, except maybe as a stub for unit tests or some default do-nothing class. Unfortunately, it is there and part of the API, until next API breakage and it uselessly takes a lot of space in the RAM.

So how would you feel about leaving the class untouched and just remove it as parent class of SynchronizationAlgorithm?

I wouldn't feel bad at all about it, except it also breaks the API, that would be an option for TraceCompass, but for now, a default counting only processing unit makes more sense.

Oh, I see, because it would remove getMatch(). Alrighty then.
