why truncate the name at the first dash ? That does not seem quite right.

Patch Set 3:

In RunBaseScriptAction#finalizeScript [line 294] the module name is generated by truncating the script name up to the first dash.

Hmm.. do you know what the purpose of that is ?
It seems to me we should change the behaviour in RunScriptBaseAction to not truncate at dash. WDYT ?

I think this is because stap only allows you to assign module names of the form ^[a-z0-9_]+$ .
