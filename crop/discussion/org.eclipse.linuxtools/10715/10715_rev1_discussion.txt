Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

You should only add 2013 to the copyright statement if the source code in a file has actually changed that year.

Also, you should not remove years, that the file was changed. You need to list every year when the file was changed. Only if it is not known, then you can list the first and latest years. It's also possible to use something like "2010-1013" if the file was change every year.

Patch Set 1:

I know in most projects (and like pretty much everywhere else...) copyright years are given as a range. But apparently in Eclipse they want to have only the initial version's year and then the last revision: http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php

The Eclipse copyright tool also looks for this format, so "2010, 2011, 2012" for instance gets corrected to "2010, 2013, 2012" (because it thinks the last year is part of the company name or something). I think we should align to Eclipse's formatting.

As for adding 2013, the tool supposedly looks into the git history to see when a file was last modified. The only problem I can see is if there was no copyright header at all, the tool will add it with initial year "2013", because it's like a new file to it. If you see any specific issues where it says 2013 and shouldn't, please point it out.
