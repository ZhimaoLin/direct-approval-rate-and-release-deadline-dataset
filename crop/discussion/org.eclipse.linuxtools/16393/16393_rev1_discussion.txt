DESCRIPTION

tmf: Tweaks to CallStackStateProvider

- Add a considerEvent() method to put all checks in. This avoids
  running checks more than once per event.
- Make the abstract methods protected instead, they should not be called
  by external components.
- Add a check when popping state values, making sure the values matches
  the current function we are in. If it doesn't, log a warning in the
  error log. This will most definitely happen when there are lost events
  in the trace.
