DESCRIPTION

tmf: Tweaks to CallStackStateProvider

- Add a considerEvent() method to put all checks in. This avoids
  running checks more than once per event.
- Make the abstract methods protected instead, they should not be called
  by external components.
- Add a check when popping state values if func_exit names are available.
  This makes sure the value matches the current function we are in. If it
  doesn't, log a warning in the error log. This will most definitely happen
  if there are lost events in the trace.
