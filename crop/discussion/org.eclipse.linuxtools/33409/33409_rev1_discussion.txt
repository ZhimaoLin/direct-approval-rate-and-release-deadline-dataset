DESCRIPTION

tmf: Rename "Import" command to "Batch Import"

Yes, this brings back demons from the Abyss, but the current user
experience is very poor when opening the contextual or File menu
for the first time, where the first two options are:

- Open...
- Import...

Those two look like perfect synonyms for the fresh user, and it's
really not obvious which one should be used. "Batch Import" implies
a slightly more advanced operation, and prepares the user for a
configuration dialog or wizard of some sort.

Even though it's not technically "the" Batch Import dialog that opens,
but that is completely irrelevant to the user.

PandoraBox.open() ;)

I'm not really keen on the "Batch Import" name either, but I just think anything would be infinitely better than just "Import". Any suggestions?

I'm not for renaming it to Batch Import. 

Unless we come up with a better, meaningful name we should keep the original name. Changing it to something which doesn't improve anything doesn't make much sense for me.

I don't like Batch Import either, but I disagree that

>unless we come up with a better, meaningful name we should keep the original name.

The UX is awful *right now* because of "Import" located right under "Open". Anything would be better. It happens to do batch imports too (independently of the fact that there was a different dialog called "Batch Import" previously).

Maybe "Advanced Import..." or "Import Directory..."?

For what it's worth, my thoughts:
"Import" to me means that you will select one or more resources that will be added to the project.
"Open" to me means that you will select one resource and it will open in an editor (or could also be multiple open depending on implementation).
I don't find that these two command names overlap.

You use words like "editor" and "resources". You have been exposed as an Eclipse programmer! :P

I'm thinking about completely new users who just downloaded the RCP. They don't know what a workspace is, neither a project, a resource, a perspective, etc. They just want to open a trace. What option do they choose?

Patch Set 1:

I don't know... I'm too TMFy to fit in the skin of the new user. Open... does what Import... used to do and Import... does somewhat what Batch Import used to do, but new users don't know/care about that.

Besides "batch import" sounds a bit rough to my ear. Sounds scripted and not something the new user would be tempted to do. Maybe "Import Traces..."? The plural makes it clearer what it does.

Didn't Ludovic say anything about that?

Patch Set 1:

"Import..." was always there to import one or more traces to the RCP or IDE. It has been enhanced to support new use cases (e.g. automatic trace type detection, folders structures). It also allows the user to copy a trace to the RCP or IDE instead of having a symbolic link.

"Open Trace..." was added to *open* a single trace. This was meant as a shortcut for opening a single trace. It has limited features (only symbolic link, no preserve folder structures).

IMHO, users won't be confused about what to use: "Open Trace..." or "Import...".

Patch Set 1:

Guys, you don't need to explain *to me* how it works, I know that we know what it does (Open for a single trace, Import for multiple at the same time). The point here is about the initial experience of a new user who is not familiar with Eclipse concepts.

> Didn't Ludovic say anything about that?

I don't think he did, because back then we had the "real" Batch Import option, which was removed since then.

Although I don't dislike "Import Traces", compared to "Open Trace",  singular vs plural, it could give them a small hint.

I've opened bug #447455 to discuss this further. Bugzilla is more appropriate for these discussions.
