DESCRIPTION

Use project-specific Save Actions settings

The actions to execute on Save are:
- Remove trailing whitespaces on all lines
- Always use braces for control blocks (if, for, etc.)

Other save actions could be interesting, but they can be tracked
with compiler warnings instead.

refs bug #385535

v2: Removed the "Make private fields final if possible" option
