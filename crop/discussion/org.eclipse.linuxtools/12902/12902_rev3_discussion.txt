DESCRIPTION

Fix mouse wheel zoom in histogram view

Partial fix for bug 384423.

Add the HistogramZoom instance as a mouse wheel listener to every child
control in the Histogram that can have focus. Provide the HistogramZoom
instance owned by the full trace histogram as a mouse wheel listener to
the text controls created in the view. This allows mouse wheel zoom to
be possible when the text controls have taken focus from the histogram
canvas.

Patch Set 3: Verified; IP review completed

Is this an issue only on Windows? I can't seem to reproduce it here (if anything else, even another window, has focus I can mousewheel-zoom the histogram just fine). If so, maybe it should be specified.

This patch doesn't seem to break it at least ;)
