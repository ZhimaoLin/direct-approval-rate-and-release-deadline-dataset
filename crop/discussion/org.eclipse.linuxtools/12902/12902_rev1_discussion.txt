DESCRIPTION

Fix mouse wheel zoom in histogram view

Partial fix for bug 384423.

Create a single HistogramZoom instance owned by the full trace histogram
which receives mouse wheel events from every control in the view that
can have focus. This allows mouse wheel zoom to be possible when the
text controls have taken focus from the histogram canvas.
