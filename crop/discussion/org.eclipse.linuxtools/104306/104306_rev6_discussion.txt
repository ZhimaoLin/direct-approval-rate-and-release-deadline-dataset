Line:34, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.reddeer/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/reddeer/core/ui/wizards/ImageRunNetworkPage.java -> instead of null you can pass ReferencedComposite similar to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/104306/6/containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.reddeer/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/reddeer/preferences/LoggingPreferencePage.java
This applies to all WizardPages.

I have fixed the ControlIsEnabled comments mentioned.

Line:34, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.reddeer/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/reddeer/core/ui/wizards/ImageRunNetworkPage.java -> Done.  I was originally avoiding API additions/changes, but in some cases my hands were tied (like the PreferencePage which won't work without the ReferencedComposite).  That would dictate a minor release.  In the end, the plug-ins have to be bumped with a major version because return classes from some methods have changed.  I added the additional classes that Josef added (e.g. ImageRunWizard) that allows these classes to use a ReferencedComposite, but since the tests run without them, I left them unchanged for the mean-time.
