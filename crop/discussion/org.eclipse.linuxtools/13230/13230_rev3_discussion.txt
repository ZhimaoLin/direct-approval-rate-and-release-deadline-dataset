Line:213, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> According to image, the page is called "Available trace types". Also, in the code the warning should not have capital S on "Please Select". Or just be blunt and remove the Please. The if of last sentence should have capital I.
