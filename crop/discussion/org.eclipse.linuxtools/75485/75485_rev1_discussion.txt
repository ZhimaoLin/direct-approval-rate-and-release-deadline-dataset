DESCRIPTION

Bug 495923: Build Image Wizard should remember previously used location.

For the sake of convenience, the Build Image Wizard should automatically
populate the folder path of the previously used Dockerfile. This change
may need to evolve into storing an entire launch configuration much like
we do for the Run Image Wizard if more options are added for building.
