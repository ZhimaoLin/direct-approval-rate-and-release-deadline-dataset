DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: improve visibility of "run" menu items.

"Run" buttons on the toolbar now appear properly.
For instance, the simple Systemtap "run" button
now only appears when editing a Systemtap script,
and the Run/Debug buttons are now visible while
editing a Systemtap script in the ST IDE.
