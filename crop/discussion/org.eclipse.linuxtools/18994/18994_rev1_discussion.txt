DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: improve visibility of "run" menu items.

"Run" buttons on the toolbar now appear properly.
For instance, the simple Systemtap "run" button
now only appears when editing a Systemtap script,
and the Run/Debug buttons are now visible while
editing a Systemtap script in the ST IDE.

I can confirm this is an issue, and that this patch resolves it. I'd prefer a more concise wording for the description of the launch shortcut.

Line:53, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> I think just saying "Run SystemTap script with project launch options" is fine. In general users shouldn't have to know the details of this.
