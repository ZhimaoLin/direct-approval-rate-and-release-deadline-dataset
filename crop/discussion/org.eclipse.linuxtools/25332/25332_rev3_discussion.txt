DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split the state system in a separate plugin

TMF will depend on this new plugin, but it will allow the state
system infrastructure to be used outside of TMF.

No need for a new feature though, since this is not a user-visible
feature (the TMF feature will include this new plugin).

File Comment: lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.statesystem.core/schema/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tracetype.exsd -> Was it intentional to copy this file? It's also in tmf.core

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/AllTests.java -> the changes in this file look wrong, this package is not about mimap

Thanks for the thorough review!

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/AllTests.java -> looks like Git trying to be clever at renames, and failing miserably

File Comment: lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.statesystem.core/schema/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.analysis.exsd -> nope, good catch, I forgot to remove this directory

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/statesystem/core/Activator.java -> I probably forgot it in the lttng.control patch too...

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystemBuilder.java -> Did you get errors from the API tool? Mine doesn't give any, strange... Even though it's a new plugin, it should mention we should xxx@xxx.xxx
