DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split the state system in a separate plugin

TMF will depend on this new plugin, but it will allow the state
system infrastructure to be used outside of TMF.

No need for a new feature though, since this is not a user-visible
feature (the TMF feature will include this new plugin).

Patch Set 4:

I added a StateSystemFactory, to avoid having to add an API filter. This way StateSystem can remain internal, good-behaving classes can use the factory, and PartialStateSystem can suppresswarning(restriction) and do its own thing.
