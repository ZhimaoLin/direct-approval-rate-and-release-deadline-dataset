DESCRIPTION

tmf: Split the state system in a separate plugin

TMF will depend on this new plugin, but it will allow the state
system infrastructure to be used outside of TMF.

No need for a new feature though, since this is not a user-visible
feature (the TMF feature will include this new plugin).
