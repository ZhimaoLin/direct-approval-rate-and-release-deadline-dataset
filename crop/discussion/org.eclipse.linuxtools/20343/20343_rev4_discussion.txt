Patch Set 4:

Only problem worth mentioning is that the difference between line styles is not very visible. I have to reduce the resolution in TmfCommonX... to 0.05 (which means 88 points in my 1920x1200 screen) to have a start of difference. I'm not sure how to tweak it. Maybe Meredith Scott would know?

Anyway, that tweaking can be done in a later patch, I'll submit this as soon as Hudson approves!

quick question

Line:50, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> why is this resolution changed?

Patch Set 4:

Ok, the problem with line styles is an issue with swtchart. 

SWTchart draws segments using drawline. If it used drawPolyLine it would work well. This would require a bit of an overhaul http://sourceforge.net/p/swt-chart/code/300/tree/trunk/org.swtchart/src/org/swtchart/internal/series/LineSeries.java I think it would be nice as a patch but I don't know when we'll have the time to fix it.

Thanks for digging into this. Indeed that could be done in a later patch, maybe file a bug in bugzilla to keep that information in mind (or I could add a TODO in the code).

Am I allowed to submit this?
