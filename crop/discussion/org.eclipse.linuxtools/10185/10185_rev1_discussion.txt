DESCRIPTION

Fix merged event iterator

The merged event iterator was sometimes creating split events with
negative duration when a zoomed event was longer than an unzoomed event
starting at the same time, and when the requested iterator range was
smaller than the zoomed events range. The algorithm for the iterator is
reworked. Also, comments.
