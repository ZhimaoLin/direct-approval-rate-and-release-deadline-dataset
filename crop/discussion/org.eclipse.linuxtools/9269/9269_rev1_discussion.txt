Just some minor fixes to make, but looks good overall.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this can be removed. It should be clear from the commit data where the class is located.

Line:87, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/launch/ProfileLaunchShortcut.java -> Please also fix the imports in this class.
