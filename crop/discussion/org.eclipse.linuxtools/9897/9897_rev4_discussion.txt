Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)

Just making sure Alex's comment about exceptions is completely taken into account.

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelEvent.java -> Alex mentioned that this exception too is to be expected if the state system is not built yet.

Most comments from PS3 still apply

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelTrace.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx

Return type should be CtfKernelIterator.
