(6 inline comments)

Some comments, but this is very interesting.

Line:104, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelTrace.java -> You can remove this comment. Also return type should be CtfKernelIterator.

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelEvent.java -> Should be "public final" </pedantic>

Line:54, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelEvent.java -> In CtfTmfEvent, this returns the CPU. It shouldn't change meanings. A CPU is more a "source" than a PID, imo.

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelEvent.java -> I think it was mentioned somewhere, but AttributeNotFound and TimeRange exceptions should be caught silently, and return -1 or something for "unknown". This would be for the case where this method is called before the state system construction is finished (or at least, is done until this point).

Line:93, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelEvent.java -> Gah, I'd have to rebase my immutable-events patch :P

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelIterator.java -> CtfKernelEvent

Line:71, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/CtfKernelEvent.java -> The return type for .getTrace() could be overriden in CtfKernelEvent too.
