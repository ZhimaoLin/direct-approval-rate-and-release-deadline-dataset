I haven't had a chance to test this but the change looks like what I'd expect. Can you confirm that perf < 3.11.0 still overwrites the created perf.data files ?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would make the title something like :

I've confirmed that with or without -f on a pre 3.1.0 version of perf, data files get overwritten as expected.
