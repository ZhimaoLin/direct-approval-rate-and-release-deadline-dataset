The download-skipping part... I can take care of it once I get to it, unless you do it before me!

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core.tests/pom.xml -> Could you wrap this part into a profile, so that we do not download them when we want to skip the tests?

Please take a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/30294/
