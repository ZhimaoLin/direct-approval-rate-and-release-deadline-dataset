Just some minor things to fix, but otherwise this seems to work.

Line:1145, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/plugin.xml -> I would remove this line.

Line:1347, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/plugin.xml -> Since this is not being changed I would fix the formatting here so that it doesn't show up at all.

Line:1347, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/plugin.xml -> ok, I did not realize that the formatting/indentation was wrong on Gerrit. My workspace was configured to replace tabs with spaces. I'll fix that so that this menuContribution element is properly aligned.
