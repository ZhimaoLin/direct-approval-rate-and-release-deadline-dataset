DESCRIPTION

Bug 507769 - NullPointerException when the list of images is not loaded in the Run launch config

Main problem was that the result of the call to `getImages(force)` was not assigned to
the local `latestImages` variable which was set to `null` (as `this.images` would be
`null` at this stage). Thus, even though the list of images was correctly loaded, it
would return `null` on the first call.

Also, used a single `synchronized` block in the `getImages(boolean)` method, just as
it is done in the `getContainers(boolean)` method.

Finally, removed the use of `containersLoaded` and `imagesLoaded` fields, which can be
replaced with tests on the `containers` and `images` lists instead.

Line:959, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> This is the only change required.  Locking everything is over-kill.  We only want to lock read and write accessing of the this.images field.  So, if you simply assign the result to latestImages which is a local variable, everything is fine and we minimize the chance of a lock wait.
