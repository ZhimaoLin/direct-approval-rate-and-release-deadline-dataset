Some things to fix, just wanted to finally post this up.

Line:291, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/ImageSearchPage.java -> Add comment explaining why we still use the 'old' remote API when it comes to 'Docker Hub registires'.

the search images API seems much faster than current implementation of V1 registry search. Something to improve...

Line:1, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/AbstractRegistry.java -> Missing EPL copyright header.

Line:107, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/AbstractRegistry.java -> All these need to be handled properly. I think these should throw some kind of Docker exception to be caught by callers in case a search fails, making sure to inform the user through UI.
