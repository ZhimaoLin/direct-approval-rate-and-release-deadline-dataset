DESCRIPTION

tmf: Correctly export all packages in runtime plugins

The API tools need the packages to be correctly exported
(even the internal ones, they should be explicitely set to
"hidden from all plug-ins except: <nothing>").

This patch enables the project-specific settings to warn for
missing exported packages, exports the missing ones, and fixes
a missing annotation.
