DESCRIPTION

tmf: API clean-up of sequence diagram framework

Throughout the sequence diagram framework, most member variables
were declared protected. However, in many cases getter and setter
methods exists and the member could have been declared private.
In some other cases, some of the attributes are internal data
and should not be be protected. This commit changes the modifier
of attributes to private. Getter and setter methods were added
where needed.

I'm not sure, but I'd think if a variable was protected before, its new getter should be protected too. Although it's weird that sometimes setters are more visible than getters...

Line:208, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/BasicFrame.java -> Those variables were protected

Line:802, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/GraphNode.java -> Those variables were protected

Line:95, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/SDView.java -> Could these be private? They don't seem to be used anywhere else. (would save the need for Javadoc too)

Line:476, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/SDView.java -> fsdWidget was protected.

Line:1057, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/SDView.java -> fNeedInit was protected

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/drawings/impl/ImageImpl.java -> private final

Line:122, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/DiagramToolTip.java -> fParent was protected. Should the getter be protected too then?

Line:121, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/Lifeline.java -> fCategory was protected

Line:182, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/ExecutionOccurrence.java -> fFillRGB was protected

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/drawings/impl/ColorImpl.java -> private final

Line:706, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/SDWidget.java -> The variable was protected (although the setter is public, so it's a bit unclear what it should be..)

Line:430, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/preferences/SDViewPref.java -> fFontPref was protected

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/SDTimeEvent.java -> should be "private final", to be pedantic ;)

Line:104, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/Stop.java -> fLifeline was protected

Line:66, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/dialogs/FilterListDialog.java -> private final

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/dialogs/TabContents.java -> private final

Line:17, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/handlers/BaseSDAction.java -> Missing description

Line:208, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/BasicFrame.java -> Done

Line:802, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/core/GraphNode.java -> I put this public because the previous code sub-classes had a public methods to set fStartEventOccurrence and fEndEventOccurrence. However, I removed these methods so that they inherit from this class

Having said that, I think the original purpose of having fStartEventOccurence and fEndEventOccurence protected was to shield the update from the user. For some GraphNodes the start and end time are the same and has to stay the same.  (e.g. SyncMessage).

So, I will put these methods protected and put the public methods in the sub-classes back (e.g. BaseExecutionOccurence)

Line:95, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/SDView.java -> No can't be private because these markers can be used by extending views to add their own actions.
