Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

This failed the following test: (copying it here because Hudson's logs go away after a while):

testGetValidTraceTypes(org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui.tests.module.XmlAnalysisModuleHelperTest): expected:<1> but was:<0>

Please take a look, we won't review a patch fails the unit tests ;) Sometimes it's the test itself that have to be updated because of the new code, sometimes it's the new code that causes a breakage.

Hi Guilliano,

Sometimes there is a difference of behavior between Eclipse and Maven (which Hudson/Jenkins use to build). You can run a Maven build locally by running "mvn clean install" in the lttng/ directory.

Btw, this patch doesn't apply on latest master, it would need to be rebased. But check if it is still even needed, there were some commits related to analysis requirements over the last few weeks.

We only tried with Eclipse :s. I'll look into that this week and repost.

Patch Set 7:

After a rebase on master and some minor conflict corrections, a Maven build went well for me without the test failure mentioned earlier.

Since I can't commit on top of Mathieu's code, I pushed it on his Github, branch xml_req_rebased. Here's the link: https://github.com/MathieuRail/org.eclipse.linuxtools/tree/xml_req_rebased

If you can push it to gerrit with your permission, that would be great.
