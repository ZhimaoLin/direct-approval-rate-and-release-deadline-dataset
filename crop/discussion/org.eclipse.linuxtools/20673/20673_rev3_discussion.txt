Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/widgetStubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/experiment/type/TmfEventsTableExperimentStub.java -> This could be the default trace Editor for the experiments. (Just a note, would be a separate patch)

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/widgetStubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/experiment/type/TmfEventsTableExperimentStub.java -> So instead of a stub, put it in the tmf.ui plugin and assign it to the generic experiment? That would make sense, a trace column in experiment table would be very useful!
