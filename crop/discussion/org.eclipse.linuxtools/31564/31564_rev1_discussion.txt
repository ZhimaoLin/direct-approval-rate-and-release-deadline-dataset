DESCRIPTION

RPM: Edit targets of "Build RPM" commands.

-The "Build RPM" toolbar button now only targets the currently
active .spec file editor rather than the active selection.

-Prevent RPM Builds from being possible for projects without
an RPM nature.

-Prevent RPM popup menu options from appearing when the active
selection contains more than one element.
