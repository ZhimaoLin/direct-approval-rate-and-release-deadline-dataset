DESCRIPTION

Fix for empty views that extend TmfView after restart (Bug 409345)

All views in Tmf/LTTng are affected by this problem:

- Extract signal handling of TmfTraceOpenedSignal and
TmfTraceSelectedSignal into TmfView base class. All view that extend
TmfView are updated for that.
- The TmfUml2SDSyncLoader handles now the TmfTraceOpenedSignal
- TmfTrace is now registered as VIP listener for signals
