DESCRIPTION

Fix for empty views that extend TmfView after restart (Bug 409345)

All views in Tmf/LTTng are affected by this problem:

- Extract signal handling of TmfTraceOpenedSignal,
TmfTraceSelectedSignal and TmfTraceClosedSignal into TmfView base
class. All view that extend TmfView are updated for that.
- The TmfUml2SDSyncLoader handles now the TmfTraceOpenedSignal
- TmfTrace is now registered as VIP listener for signals

Patch Set 6:

Thanks for reviewing it and giving +1.

However, I got thinking about the comments. I pretty much agree with Patrick that it is not clear what the user has to override, the signal handler methods or loadTrace(), closeTrace()? To have it general for all cases is not possible (see TimeChartView, ColorsView or TmfStatisticsView). 

So, what I will upload as next patch is just the fix for the bug and not the refactoring of the code (i.e. add signal handler to TmfView). The new patch will have some duplications, however it's much clearer.

Later on we can decide to refactor the code. But it is out of scope of this bug fix and maybe not part of Kepler.
