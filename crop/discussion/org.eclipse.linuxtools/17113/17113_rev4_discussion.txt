DESCRIPTION

RPM: specfile compare editor and NPEs

The initial opening of a .spec file with an ERROR marker in it
will cause Ctrl + hovering over certain specfile elements
(e.g. user-defined macros, hyperlinks, etc.) to cause an NPE.

Another error was that comparing a .spec file with an ERROR marker
in it to any other .spec file would cause NPEs and open up the
compare editor with a blank page.

Lastly, comparing specfile editors now properly attach to the document
being edited. Changes done in the compare editor (merge viewer)
will persist on the document(s) being compared.

Bug: 415468
