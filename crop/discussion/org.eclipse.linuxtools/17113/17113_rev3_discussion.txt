DESCRIPTION

RPM: specfile compare editor and NPEs

The initial opening of a .spec file with an ERROR marker in it
will cause Ctrl + hovering over certain specfile elements
(e.g. user-defined macros, hyperlinks, etc.) to cause an NPE.

Another error was that comparing a .spec file with an ERROR marker
in it to any other .spec file would cause NPEs and open up the
compare editor with a blank page.

Lastly, comparing specfile editors now properly attach to the document
being edited. Changes done in the compare editor (merge viewer)
will persist on the document(s) being compared.

Just some small nitpicks.

Line:25, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/markers/SpecfileTaskHandler.java -> As this is API I would like to see classlevel documentation added too.

Line:33, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/markers/SpecfileTaskHandler.java -> Missing javadoc and since tag.
