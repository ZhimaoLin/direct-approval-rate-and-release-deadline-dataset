Seems like the patch is not full.

Line:6, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch/plugin.xml -> This extension point seems to be missing from the contribution?

Patch Set 1:

In fact, I have added this extension point to allow external plug-ins to provide malloc implementations. If there are any implementations, the field in the menu is an editable combo box. If there are no implementations, the field is simply a text box. Sorry for not making it clear, I've added screenshots and a description in the bugzilla entry (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=387027)

Patch Set 1:

I think Alex was referring to the fact that the schema (schema/customM
allocLibraries.exsd) for your extension point is not found in the patch. This means that although the functionality may work as expected, any user wishing to extend your extension point would not have the benefit of the PDE environment/error checking/schema validation.

A user would simply have to look at how you access the extension's configuration elements to get hints about how to define it. For example, looking at ValgrindOptionsTab, one might guess that a valid configuration would be :

<extension  point="org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch.customMallocLibraries">
    <foo name="a" lib_soname="libx" />
    <bar name="b" lib_soname="liby" />
    <baz name="c" lib_soname="libz" />
</extension>
