DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Prevent running scripts if existing graphs are missing required columns.

In Run Configurations->Graphing, deleting a parsing column that a created graph
relies on now counts as an error in a Run Configuration, and UI notifies users of
such an error when it is present.

A regular expression without any parenthesized groups also now counts as an error,
and graphs can't be added unless at least one such group exists.
