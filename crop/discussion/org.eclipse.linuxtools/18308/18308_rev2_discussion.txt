DESCRIPTION

tmf: Support drag selection in histogram

- Left button drag makes a range selection in both histograms
- Middle button or Ctrl-left button are used to drag the window in full
trace histogram
- Middle-click or Shift-left-click on full trace histogram now centers
the window on the mouse position
- Selection is only propagated when the mouse button is released
- When moving the mouse only redraw instead of refreshing the whole
histogram
- Fix range selection start on Shift-click
- Limit selection range to visible time range
- Draw selection region background corrected when end time is before
start time
- Prevent mouse wheel zoom when dragging in progress

Line:755, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> with this algorithm fSelectionBegin can be bigger than fSelectionEnd? Shouldn't we flip the values in that case?

I guess in the ControlFlowView it's the same behaviour since when creating the status line this is considered.

Looks like the comment needs updating. Shift-left-click -> Ctrl-left-click to center the window.
