DESCRIPTION

lttng: Some performance improvements to the Resources view

On Linux/GTK, calls to getSystemColor, getFontMetrics and gc.stringExtent are
quite expensive. This patch minimizes those calls. As a future improvement,
we should look into optimizing calls to TimeGraphControl.getXForTime because it
calls Control.getSize() which is slow as well.
