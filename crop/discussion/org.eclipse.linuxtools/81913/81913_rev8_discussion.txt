DESCRIPTION

Bug 501240 - Do not hide image with <none>:<none> as a result of a build

Extracted the way qualifier is computed, based on images
Set the 'dangling images' filter activation state to 'false' by default
 to get the same result as the CLI
Added tests to verify the qualifier computation

Also:
- renamed custom Assertions with plural form (as AssrtJ does)
- fixed failing tests because mocking the IDockerConnection#getState()
method returns unexpected values in some cases.
