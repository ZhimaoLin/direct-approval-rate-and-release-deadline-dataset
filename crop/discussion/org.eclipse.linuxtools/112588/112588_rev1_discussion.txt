DESCRIPTION

OSIO Mylyn improvements

- fix regression for New Task caused by looking for space id in
  OSIORestClient postTaskData which doesn't exist for a new task
- fix UI look and feel for the Repository query page by adding
  our own RepositoryQueryAttributeEditor class
- add token fetch support to OSIORestRequest which will try to
  get the token provider extension before attempting to use
  the user-provided token
- remove Activity section from the Task editor
- fix ordering of work item types by using a TreeMap in Space class
- put repository under Tasks category instead of Bugs which
  doesn't apply here
- add org.eclipse.core.resources as dependency to core plug-in
