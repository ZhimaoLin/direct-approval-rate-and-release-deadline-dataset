DESCRIPTION

lttng: Disable API checking in the luna branch

Instead of always xxx@xxx.xxx annotations to 3.0 in the luna branch,
it was deemed much more simple to simply ignore all API problems in
the Luna branch. That way xxx@xxx.xxx 2.x annotation will remain as-is,
without throwing errors when one checkouts that branch.

Instead of having to revert dozens and dozens of temporary commits when
we utlimately merge this branch back into master, only this one will
have to be reverted.
