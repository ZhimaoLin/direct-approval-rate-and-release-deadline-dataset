Patch Set 2:

I'm probably missing smth but I don't see any change here as these are interfaces and all methods in interfaces are public by default so public can be omitted. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/interfaceDef.html

Patch Set 2:

The Eclipse API checker is marking it as error, saying the methods have been removed and that the plug-in needs to bump a major release.  I traced it to them not being declared public anymore.  The error goes away with the change.  Are you not seeing this with your API checking on your Eclipse?
