DESCRIPTION

Bug 512931 - Automatic open retry doesn't stop after Connection removed

- add code in DockerExplorerContentProvider.dispose() to interrupt 
  all openRetryJobs
- add check in getChildren() to only start a retry job if one doesn't
  already exist
- add check in openRetryJob to return cancelled if the connection's
  URI is no longer listed by the DockerConnectionManager
