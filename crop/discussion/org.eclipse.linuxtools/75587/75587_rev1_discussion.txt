DESCRIPTION

Bug 496432: static ICON reference should not be disposed.

The static ICON reference in IconColumnLabelProvider is used for all
icon measurement and rendering. If it's disposed by any specific
instance, it will be unusable going forward. Since only one instance
should exist for the entire runtime, it should be safe to leave it.

Arianna Johns, if you see a nicer solution (that doesn't leave the icon around), I'm fine with it.

I mean making it non static should allow to keep the dispose, but having 1 laying around shouldn't be the end of the world.
