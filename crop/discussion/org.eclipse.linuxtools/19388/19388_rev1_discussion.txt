DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduction of ITmfHistoryBuilder interface and factory

This interface is used to build state system histories using the
TmfStateSystemFactory. Using this interface it is easy to
cancel building of state system histories from the analysis framework.

Also it supports coalescing of request across the analysis framework.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I haven't looked into the details yet. Will that help fixing bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=423348 ?

I don't like that it mixes the coalescing request part and the new ITmfHistoryBuilder. Those are 2 independent features. Sounds like some political maneuver to pass a discutable bill :p

I'll look into it in more details tomorrow.
