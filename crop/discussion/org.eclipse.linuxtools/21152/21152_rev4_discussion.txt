DESCRIPTION

tmf: Rework analysis-returning methods in ITmfTrace

Make the analysis accesses thread-safe: each access is now encased
in a synchronized block (or using the synchronizedMap wrapper).

This also implies exposing only Iterable's in the interface, which
is a good practice in general. If a caller could get a reference to
the map (even through unmodifiableMap), we'd have no guarantee that
they'd correctly lock their iterations, which could result in a
concurrent access error if the map is modified internally at the
same time.
