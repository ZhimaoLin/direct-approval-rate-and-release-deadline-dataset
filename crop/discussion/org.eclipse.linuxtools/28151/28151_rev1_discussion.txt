DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Stop BrowserView crashes on re-open.

Prevent BrowserViews from disposing their content trees when
they are closed. This disposal caused TapsetLibrary trees to
be disposed, which are not rebuilt the the next time the views
are opened. This resulted in the NPEs that prevented the views
from being re-opened after being closed.

Resolves EBZ #435979.
