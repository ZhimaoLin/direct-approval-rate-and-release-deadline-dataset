Line:102, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/ProviderOptionsTab.java -> Launch configurations created manually skip checking the project properties for a provider. This is because a launch configuration working copy is not being passed here. The current configuration's working copy (initial.getWorkingCopy()) can be used.

Line:86, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/launch/ProviderLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> The above commented out code can be removed.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The change looks good. My only comments, other than the inline comments provided, are to move the profiling properties page under the "C/C++ General" properties page, and to rename the parent properties page to "Profiling Categories". This is to show that our profiling tools are for C/C++ exclusively and to differentiate our profiling framework from other future profiling contributions.
