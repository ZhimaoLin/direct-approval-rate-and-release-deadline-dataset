Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'd prefer if this were held off until https://git.eclipse.org/r/#change,8361 gets in.

Roland's change has been submitted, this change should be rebased.

Line:102, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/ProviderOptionsTab.java -> initial.getWorkingCopy() can be passed here instead of null. This would set the
provider id selected in the project properties, as opposed to the one in the global
preferences, to manually created launch configurations.

Patch Set 2: No score

Thanks for doing this. The only thing to watch out for when rebasing is that the classes that access the provider extension point are now in ProviderFramework. Also the getDefaultProviderLaunchShortcut no longer exists, and was replaced by getHighestPriority..
