DESCRIPTION

Bug 481300: Fix various refresh issues in Docker Views.

The get -> refresh -> set logic is not what's responsible for preserving
a selection after refreshes occur. The UI already knows how
to preserve a selection. As long as the objects given to the content
provider override equals() and hasCode(), the selection will be
preserved without any intervention.
