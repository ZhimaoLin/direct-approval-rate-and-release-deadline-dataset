Patch Set 2: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

This is fine, but please reference the commit this is fixing, perhaps on a separate line.

Thanks for the change. In particular, the reason this worked so far was because of String Interning. When they were externalized, it's likely that they became String objects, and so the '==' failed.
