DESCRIPTION

RPM: createrepo execute command

Added functionality to the execute button on the Import RPMs page and to
the execute button at the top of the form pages.

The default call to the execute command would simply be the createrepo
command executing on the content folder, e.g.:
"createrepo /path/to/project/content"

It calls the RPM Utils.runCommand(...) to execute createrepo.

Further implementation will grab command line arguments from the project
preferences.
