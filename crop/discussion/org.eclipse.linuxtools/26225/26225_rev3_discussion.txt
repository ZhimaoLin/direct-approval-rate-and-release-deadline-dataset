Small comments. I would correct them, but not on this laptop.

Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/headless/BenchmarkAnalysis.java -> I think this trace.dispose is unnecessary here since it is in a try-with-resource. But module.dispose() would be good. Or put it in the try too.
