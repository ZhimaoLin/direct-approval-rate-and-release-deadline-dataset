DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update the refresh handler

- Remove delay when the handler is not busy
- Immediately schedule the next task when the current one is completed
- Allow any Object as source to allow a component to queue different
types of update that don't cancel each other
- Only schedule one update at a time to allow other (non-coalesced) UI
runnables to execute between updates and to allow updates from other
sources to be replaced while the handler is busy
