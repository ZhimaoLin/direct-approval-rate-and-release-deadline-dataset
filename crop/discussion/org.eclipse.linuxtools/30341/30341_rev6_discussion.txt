DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update the refresh handler

- Remove delay when the handler is not busy
- Allow any Object as source to allow a component to queue different
  types of update that don't cancel each other
- Only execute one update at a time to allow other (non-coalesced) UI
  runnables to execute between updates and to allow updates from other
  sources to be replaced while the handler is busy

Btw, XmlXYViewer doesn't use the refresh handler. Alex, maybe you have some temporary changes.
