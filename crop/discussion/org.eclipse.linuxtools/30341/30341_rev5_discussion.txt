DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update the refresh handler

- Remove delay when the handler is not busy
- Allow any Object as source to allow a component to queue different
  types of update that don't cancel each other
- Only execute one update at a time to allow other (non-coalesced) UI
  runnables to execute between updates and to allow updates from other
  sources to be replaced while the handler is busy

I'm ok with the new approach. For experiments with many traces the number of redraws during building of the state system in e.g. the stats view is still limited event though most of the time the first update and the last update will be executed instead of only one with the previous approach.

Alex, are you ok with the change?

Sure, that's fine with me, and my previous comments seem addressed.

However, rebased to master, this fails to compile, because XmlXYViewer is still using TmfUiRefreshHandler.UPDATE_PERIOD.

+1 from me once that is fixed.
