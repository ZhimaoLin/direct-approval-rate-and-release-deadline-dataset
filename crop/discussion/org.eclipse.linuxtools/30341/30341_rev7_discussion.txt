DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update the refresh handler

- Remove delay when the handler is not busy
- Allow any Object as source to allow a component to queue different
  types of update that don't cancel each other
- Only execute one update at a time to allow other (non-coalesced) UI
  runnables to execute between updates and to allow updates from other
  sources to be replaced while the handler is busy
