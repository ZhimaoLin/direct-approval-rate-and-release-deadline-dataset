Seems to work as intended. I'm not too familiar with those XMLs, so I'd rather have one more person look at it.

You might also want to consider programatically adding a new wizard shortcut for NewTmfProjectWizard to the LTTng and GDB Trace perspective factories.

Line:266, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> Not sure that we want to show the New Tracing Project wizard when we are in an unrelated perspective and that a tracing project is currently selected.

Line:266, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> I removed the project nature part. It is more inline with the JDT way.
