DESCRIPTION

ctf: Specify a timeout for the CTF testsuite download

The default timeout of the Ant "get" task is reasonable, but the
default for "exec" (which we use for pulling the CTF testsuite) feels
like 5 minutes. This makes building offline, or behind a proxy, a bit
more painful.

Shorten the delay to 20 seconds.
