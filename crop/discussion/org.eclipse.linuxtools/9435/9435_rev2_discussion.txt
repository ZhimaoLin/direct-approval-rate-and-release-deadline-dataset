DESCRIPTION

Update bookmarks file API, link to editor and delete & rename handlers

- Implement different methods in trace element and experiment element to
get the bookmarks file with or without creating it.
- Update TmfEditorLinkHelper to use the new methods to get the bookmarks
file from trace or experiment element.
- Update TmfEditorLinkHelper to no longer activate the found editor
part. Doing so would make the Project Explorer view lose focus.
- Update TmfEventsEditor to also broadcast TmfTraceSelectedSignal when
part is brought to top without being activated. Selected flag is added
to ensure the signal is sent only once as long as the same trace is
selected.
- Fix equals() method of TmfProjectModelElement. Path is used for
equality check. Using name and location would return true when comparing
a trace element and a link to the same trace under an experiment, which
would confuse the Project Explorer tree navigator model. Update
hashCode() to only use path.
- Fix rename trace handler to propagate rename to experiment traces
based on trace name since the equals method no longer matches for the
different trace element under Traces folder and under an experiment.
- Fix delete trace handler to propagate deletion to experiment traces
based on trace name. Using location could unnecessarily remove trace
from an experiment which was a different linked trace to the same
location as the deleted trace.
- Dispose temporary trace used in validate() of CtfTmfTrace and
CtfKernelTrace. This allows deletion soon after import.
