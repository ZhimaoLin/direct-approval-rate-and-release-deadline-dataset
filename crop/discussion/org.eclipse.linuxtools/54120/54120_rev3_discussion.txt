DESCRIPTION

Bug 475326 - NullPointerException in DockerExplorerLabelProvider.getStyledText

From the version that the user was running, the line
of code the initiated the NPE was:
  styledString.setStyle(connection.getName().length(),
    message.length() - connection.getName().length(),
    StyledString.QUALIFIER_STYLER);

This may be caused by a connection with no name, so the
workaround here is to check that the name is not null or
empty and default to a "<unnamed>" label.
