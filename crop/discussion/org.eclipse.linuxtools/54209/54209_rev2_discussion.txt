DESCRIPTION

Bug 475327 - NullPointerException in DockerExplorerContentProvider.getChildren

The NPE might have been caused by IDockerConnection#getContainers() that
returned null.
This patch proposes a simplified version of the code in which the risk
of having a null result is removed.

There is still a locking issue.

Line:837, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/DockerConnection.java -> The following code needs to be locked as you are modifying the loggingThreads list.  It has the potential for disaster as one removes a loggingThread and another tries to access that thread afterwards.
