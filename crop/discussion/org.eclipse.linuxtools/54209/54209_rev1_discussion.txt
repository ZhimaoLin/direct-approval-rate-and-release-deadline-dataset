DESCRIPTION

Bug 475327 - NullPointerException in DockerExplorerContentProvider.getChildren

The NPE might have been caused by IDockerConnection#getContainers() that
returned null.
This patch proposes a simplified version of the code in which the risk
of having a null result is removed.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

This will regress UI-freezes.  You cannot have notification within the locked section of code because the code may be called by non-UI threads which will then notify UI-threads trying to refresh Views.  The way it was being done was trying to have a read list copy.  The readers look at a copy of the list and the writers change the next read list.  Readers may be seeing stale info, but that is ok because writers will end up notifying them to refresh.
