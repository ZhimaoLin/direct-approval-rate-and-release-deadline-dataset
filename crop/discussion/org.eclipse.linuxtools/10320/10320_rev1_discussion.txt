DESCRIPTION

Disable CTF/TMF unit tests that depend on external traces

Temporarily disable the unit tests using CTF traces, at least
until bug 400473 is fixed.

Before re-enabling them, they should be made to run only if the
traces are present, and skipped if they are not. That way it
should not show unit test failures if the download failed.
