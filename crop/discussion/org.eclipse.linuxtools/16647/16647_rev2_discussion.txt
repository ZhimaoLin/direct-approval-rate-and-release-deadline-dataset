DESCRIPTION

lttng-rcp: create separate RCP branding feature

Having a separated branding feature makes it easier to build
other RCP products based on the LTTng tracing RCP using own
product definition and branding.

Also update the LTTng releng to provide a RCP specific update site.

Looks good, I was able to make my own product and branding. Just some minor comments inlined.

I think it should be possible to move more features from tracing.product to tracing.rcp.feature (Included features tab?) so that custom products don't have to duplicate that. I'm thinking, TMF, CTF, e4.rcp, emf, help, maybe RSE and TM. But it could be done in a separate commit. I tried this and I was able to just have my branding feature and the tracing.rcp.feature in my product and it worked.

Line:37, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.branding/plugin.xml -> This looks like old stuff that can be removed.

Line:51, lttng/pom.xml -> Missing leading spaces.
