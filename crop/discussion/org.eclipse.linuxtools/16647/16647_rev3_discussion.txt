DESCRIPTION

lttng-rcp: create separate RCP branding feature

Having a separated branding feature makes it easier to build
other RCP products based on the LTTng tracing RCP using own
product definition and branding.

Also update the LTTng releng to provide the RCP feature on the
LTTng update site.

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/build.properties -> I think you need to keep both lines with about.html, every plug-in has them (it seems).

Line:11, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.branding/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't think ui.intro and rcp.ui are necessary here.

Line:158, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/plugin.xml -> This part needs to be removed

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/build.properties -> you're right. about.html needs to be there for bin and src

Line:11, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.branding/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:158, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/plugin.xml -> Hmm, I don't know how it ended up there again. I had removed it. Will remove it again.
