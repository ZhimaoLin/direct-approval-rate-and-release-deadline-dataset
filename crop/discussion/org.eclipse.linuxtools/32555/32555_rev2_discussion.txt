DESCRIPTION

CTF: Add some documentation on CTF test traces

Sometimes, for a unit test, we just need a trace and having the trace length,
size and event count may help choose the right trace for the right test.

Very good initiative! I didn't look through ALL of them, but the first few ones seemed ok, I assume you did your homework ;)

Did you use a script to get the information for each trace? If so, it could be useful to have it in-tree, for the future traces we might add.
