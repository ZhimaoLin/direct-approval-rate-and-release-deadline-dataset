DESCRIPTION

Bug 494555: Quote command arguments when entrypoint is not defined.

By default the entrypoint should be '/bin/sh -c' so the arguments to
this should be quoted to work correctly. If this is done in the
setCommand method of the Image Run model, then we just need to ensure
that entrypoints are set before setCommand is called.
