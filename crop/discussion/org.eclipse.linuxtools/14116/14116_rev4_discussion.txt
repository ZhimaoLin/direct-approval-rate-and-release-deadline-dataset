DESCRIPTION

tmf : Add test to StateSystemTest

This new test will check if the very first interval gets set correctly
in certain cases. This exposed a bug with in-memory backends, which
was fixed in 9898079defaa94bc3f0cf60dc89b1e863ac304da.

The partial history backend didn't have the bug after all. It is a known limitation that they cannot provide the end time of intervals. This new test was checking for both the returned interval's start and end times.

Instead of overriding this test in the partial history test class, just don't bother with the end time. Value is what is important here.
