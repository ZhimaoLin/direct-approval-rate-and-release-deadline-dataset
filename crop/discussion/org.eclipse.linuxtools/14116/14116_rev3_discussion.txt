Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Pushed a new version with small formatting fixes.

This is a very good test! It actually finds that the bug existed not only for the in-memory backend, but in the partial history backend too!

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/14117/ takes care of the first part, but we'll need to get a new fix ready for the partial backend before we can push this one.
