DESCRIPTION

ctf: Fix simple resource leak warnings

Many warnings left though. For instance, the Stream/StreamInput/
StreamInputReader etc. constructor should create their inner Closeable
objects themselves (instead of having to pass say
new StreamInput(new StreamInputReader(...)) ). That way they can keep
a reference to it, and close() it in their own close() method.

Right now nobody keeps a reference to them, and they never get closed.
