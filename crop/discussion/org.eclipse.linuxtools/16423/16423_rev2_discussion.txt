Good initiative!

Just some small comments, basically if the trace path is used more than once (other than in the test setup method for example), then it should be saved in a local variable. That way it's not easy to make a typo and end up with a completely different trace.

Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceTest.java -> "TmfTestTrace.A_TEST_10K" should be saved in a local TmfTestTrace variable, so it is not repeated.

Line:140, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfExperimentCheckpointIndexTest.java -> Should be saved in a class variable, so it is not repeated

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/shared/TmfTestTrace.java -> You can drop the 'directory' parameter, since it's the same for everybody. If we do ever add test traces in another directory, it could be added.

Line:535, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfCoalescedEventRequestTest.java -> should be saved in a local variable
