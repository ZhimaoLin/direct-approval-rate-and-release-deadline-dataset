DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make CtfTmfEvent extend TmfEvent

into a new CtfTmfEventFactory.

Patch Set 6:

After thinking about it, I kind of prefer having the "nullEvent" be wrapped in a singleton constructor. If we define it statically, and in the future somebody adds for example a copy constructor to CtfTmfEvent, which calls factory.createEvent(). This will create a circular dependency back on CtfTmfEvent just for the class initialization, and we'll get an init error at runtime (no way to track that at compile time).
