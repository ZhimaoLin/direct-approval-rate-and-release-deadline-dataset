DESCRIPTION

Additional fixes for Building in Container support

- add remote daemon support to copy back changed files
  after command in runCommand has completed in ContainerCommandProcess
- add mounting support for runCommand to specify mounts
  in Container that don't have the same name as mounts in Host
- keep track of read-only mounts so these will copied over to
