DESCRIPTION

lttng: Do not cache attribute tree locations

As a requirement for partial histories, we cannot cache
commonly-used attribute tree locations in the state providers.
Since the partial history's inner state provider will not know
the cached values of the real one, we need to resolve them
every time.

This unfortunately hampers the performance of standard state
system constructions a bit.
