DESCRIPTION

Bug 513591 - Add support for building C/C++ projects in Container

- add securityOptions specification to IDockerHostConfig and
  DockerHostConfig
- add support for showing security options in the Container
  Inspect tab of the Properties view by modifying
  ContainerInspectContentProvider
- fix DockerConnection createContainer to add in the security
  options from the DockerHostConfig
- add attachLog method to DockerConnection
- add getImageByTag() method to DockerConnection
- close LogStream when Log job in DockerConnection completes
- add waitForContainer and attachLog methods to IDockerConnection
- fix ContainerLauncher to try and set uid and gid of calling
  user so output files are accessible from Container
- add new launch method to ContainerLauncher which takes a
  seccomp string specifier
- add support for copying language entries from Container to Host
- add a new CopyVolumesFromImageJob to copy over header files from Image
- when copying volumes from image in ContainerLauncher,
  keep track of which directories are copied and don't bother if
  they or parents are already recorded in a static map for the
connection and
  image which we serialize to a file upon exit
- add a new fetchContainerDirs method in ContainerLauncher
- add new getCopiedVolumes() method to ContainerLauncher to get
  the volumes that have been copied for an image
- add new runCommand method to ContainerLauncher to run an
  arbitrary command
- add new ContainerCommandProcess which extends Process
- have ContainerCommandProcess destroy() delay before closing
  the piped std streams to allow output to complete
- fix uses of Objects.toStringHelper to instead use
  MoreObjects.toStringHelper (ImageSearchResultV1,
  ImageSearchResultV2, and RepositoryTag classes)
