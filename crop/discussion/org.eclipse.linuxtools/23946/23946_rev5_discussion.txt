Patch Set 5:

This patch relies on "Systemtap: More Probe & Function view fixes." (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/23878/7) Particularly, that patch provides changes that are strongly coupled to the standardization of adding Systemtap elements made by this patch, so this patch probably shouldn't be reworked to be independent of it.
