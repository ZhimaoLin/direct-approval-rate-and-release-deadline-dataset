DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bring Java 7-specific errors back down to warnings

If we were to switch to Java 7 today, thousands of *errors* would
show up because of the 1.7-specific project settings set to generate
errors. Tone them down to warnings, until they are actually fixed.

I imagine this will be reverted when all the warnings are gone?

Once the warnings are fixed, they could be put back to errors, yes.
