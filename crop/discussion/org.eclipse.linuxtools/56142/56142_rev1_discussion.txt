Thanks for the patch. Some procedural comments from me and added Arianna Johns to review the functionality.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This author tag doesn't look in place and just screws normal Git logs, just remove it as it's available 5 lines above too.

Line:1, libhover/org.eclipse.linuxtools.cdt.libhover/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/cdt/libhover/utils/BuildFunctionInfos.java -> Please don't remove copyright headers. The correct change is to change the top line to be 
Copyright (c) 2009, 2015 Red Hat, Inc. and others.

And add yourself in the Contributors list.

Line:1, libhover/org.eclipse.linuxtools.cdt.libhover/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/cdt/libhover/utils/LibhoverInfoGenerator.java -> Please add copyright header.

Line:26, libhover/org.eclipse.linuxtools.cdt.libhover/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/cdt/libhover/utils/LibhoverInfoGenerator.java -> Is there any meaningful handling of the exception? Printing the stack trace will be completely invisible ot people running from inside the IDE (if not --debug passed to launcher) so maybe better to just ignore or log in eclipse error log depending on importance.

Patch Set 1:

Could you attach a sample doxygen C input file in the bug so we can run it through the new code to see what it outputs and perhaps add a test case in the future (barring any licensing issues with Eclipse.org)?
