Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This API was in 2.2 . Are you sure that your api baseline is set to Kepler SR1 + Linux Tools 2.2?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

>This API was in 2.2 . Are you sure that your api baseline is set to Kepler SR1 + Linux Tools 2.2?

Yes, you're right--I had forgotten to update my baseline since the release. The only things that actually are new API are methods in OpenFileAction, but that may be subject to change since the patch the new methods came from is 8b6fcae (Systemtap: Improve UI for probe insertion) which still needs proper review.

Also, updating my baseline revealed to me that patch 97d561c (Add Linux Tools path support for SystemTap) from stable-2.2 was never merged to master, and is causing API breakage in master. So until all this gets sorted out, I'll just put this patch on hold.
