It seems to have fixed the bug where the Control Flow's next/previous buttons would skip over events randomly and end up elsewhere in the trace.

(except in one particular case, but it's probably related to something else, I'll open a separate bug)

Great work!

Looks fine. I updated the unit tests to (1) reproduce the problem and (2) confirm that the fix works.
