DESCRIPTION

TMF: Changed the state system explorer to use an abstract tree viewer

This adds the possibility to sort columns. And we don't need to worry about
which thread runs the code.

Much more streamlined the implementation using a TreeViewer than using the Tree class directly. I prefer that.

Just minor comments.

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> Update java-doc. It was taken from the base class

Line:311, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> BTW, you only get an exact timestamp value of an event in the trace if the selection came from the events table and not from another view that does an approximation (e.g. control flow view). Therefore when filtering often the view is empty.

Line:378, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> we don't need to call clearContent() here?

Line:311, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> I know, I thought it weird at first (the comment here was not there originally), but talking with Florian (who made this view at first), this is by design. The use case for this is to be able to select an event in the event table and see exactly what state changes this event caused. But I agree it should be better documented
