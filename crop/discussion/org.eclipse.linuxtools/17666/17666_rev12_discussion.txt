Line:122, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/tracepkg/AbstractTracePackageWizardPage.java -> The top-level trace check box can never be less than grayed when all the optional items are unchecked (because the Trace item is mandatory). But it's possible to deselect the check box itself (even though the Trace item is checked). We also should consider upcoming change to have multiple traces in archive. So proposal: allow deselecting the trace (Trace item can also then be deselected) but selecting any sub item will force its Trace item to be selected. If no trace item is selected/grayed, then Finish button should be disabled. OK to fix this when multiple trace import is implemented...

Line:314, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/tracepkg/importexport/ExportTracePackageWizardPage.java -> Perhaps add bookmarks element only if the trace has bookmarks?

Line:238, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/tracepkg/importexport/TracePackageExportOperation.java -> When you open (and I guess, export) a trace that is under an experiment, we usually work with the 'element under Traces folder'. The bookmarks are stored with that resource, so using the Experiment folder's trace element resource does not find or export the bookmarks. This could perhaps be fixed by changing the trace element from the selection directly in the ExportTracePackageWizardPage constructor.
