DESCRIPTION

Bug 500298 - No property tester contributes a property o.e.l.docker.dockerComposePropertyTester

Full error message was:
"No property tester contributes a property
 org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.dockerComposePropertyTester.isDockerComposeConsole
 to type class org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.views.console.ProcessConsole"

Changed the 'type' in the propertyTester definition to accept any kind of
console. Then the type checking can be performed in the corresponding
class, whatever the type of console that was given.
