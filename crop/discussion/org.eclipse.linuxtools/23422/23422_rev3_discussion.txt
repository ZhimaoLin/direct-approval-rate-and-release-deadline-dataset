Patch Set 3:

I removed the default trace session path since it will not be used anymore. Moreover lttng couldn't read the "/~/" path section.

I added other values used when generating a session configuration from ISessionInfo objects.

In case you have time to go more deeply in the trace generation with requirements using the lttng2 control, you may want to take a look at the patch series ending at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/23593/

It involves the support of live session. You could add the requirements to the SessionInfo class maybe? where they can be processed once the session is created on the target.

I know we've been talking since the beginning about the XML session profile and now at the end of the project it appears we will not be using it in the short term, at least not for the main use case. But it happens when developing... you realize after a while that what you thought would work doesn't... quite...

Anyway, we WILL be using the XML session profile, it will be useful to save a session to XML to be able to repeat it exactly, either on another target or on the same. So I really wish to get your work in, at least in unit tests for now.

Line:113, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigStrings.java -> Since we are not going to use the default values to generate the XML, it would be better not to put them here (to avoid temptation to use them). You can add them to a unit test interface where unit tests can create XML with the default values. 

If you still keep the XML session file (instead of simply adding the required events to an existing session), you may put those variables there, so that when refactoring takes place, we can just remove them from the class.
