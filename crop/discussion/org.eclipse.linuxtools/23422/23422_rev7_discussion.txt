genevieve, i need a second opinion here, am i being mean?

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigStrings.java -> why not javadoc and explicitly nls? prevents later accidents?

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigStrings.java -> Since these strings won't be externalized, they're supposed to be tagged non-nls. If we don't specify nls and only let javadoc, we will be submerge by a huge amount of warning

Matthew, yes you are being mean. Look at we we do ourselves!

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigStrings.java -> I don't mind. I'd say for constants like that it looks cleaner this way. Besides, in many such interfaces, that's how we do it. @See {@link LttngStrings}, xxx@xxx.xxx TmfXmlStrings} and that's only the 2 I knew of and checked rapidly ;-)
