DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix custom parser wizard preview table

Since the preview table is built using a temporary trace file with a
fixed name, its persistent index was not being rebuilt when the parser
and/or the preview input was changed.

The preview table is now built using a trace class implementation that
is overridden to use the in-memory checkpoint indexer.
