DESCRIPTION

DRAFT: testing createrepo execution

do not submit/review, testing hudson build in regards to fixing 19736

Thinking the problem is with the finder class not finding the correct
widget.

Testing if shell was not being focused on.
    o turns out to be the problem. Need to activate eclipse shell!

Testing if CreaterepoProjectTest.java works with fix.
