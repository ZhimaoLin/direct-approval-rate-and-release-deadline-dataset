(4 comments)

Line:523, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramDataModel.java -> Comments from patch set 4 are still valid.
For time range histogram: if a lost event range partially overflows the current time range, the extra lost events should not be displayed, and the buckets within range should *not* have more lost events to compensate.
For full range histogram: if a lost event range ends later than the last normal event then the data model should merge to accommodate the complete lost event range (can this happen from the tracer though?)

Line:525, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramDataModel.java -> space between -1

Line:642, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> needs -1 to prevent drawing over the last pixel of normal event line.

Line:653, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> As discussed, it would be a good improvement to fill the area to the right of the last event bucket in background color, or some other visual cue that this area is not valid and empty.
