I haven't tried this out yet (working on another review) but things mostly look fine. Just a few small points.

Line:7, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I would set this to 'JavaSE-1.7' just for the sake of being consistent with other plugins.

Line:32, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/javadocs/test/CheckJavadoc.java -> I don't think this code is necessary. There's shouldn't be any file called "C" in the plugin's state location directory. Perhaps this is left over from CDT's devhelp plugin ?

Line:80, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/javadocs/test/CheckJavadoc.java -> This isn't really the ideal way of getting the path to the plugin although I guess it does work.

You can take a look in DataManipulatorTest testPerfStatDataOpenHandler() as an example.

Line:355, pom.xml -> Please remove this change. This is ensures that we exclude internal, and test classes from javadoc generation. For some reason I thought it was related to excluding test packages but it's not related to tycho-surefire at all! Clearly it's a configuration for the javadoc plugin.
