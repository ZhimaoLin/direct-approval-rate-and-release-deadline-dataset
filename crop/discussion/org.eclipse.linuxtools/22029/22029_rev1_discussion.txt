DESCRIPTION

TMF: Move methods from TmfXYChartViewer to new abstract TmfTimeViewer

The TmfXYChartViewer already had time synchronization methods implemented,
but those can be used by other types of viewer. They have been moved to an
abstract class. All viewers who need to synchronize with trace time may extend
this class.

I am working on an abstract tree viewer to display as a tree some data. I was copy pasting pretty much all methods from the XY chart to that treeViewer, so I thought I might as well add a level of abstract class for it!
