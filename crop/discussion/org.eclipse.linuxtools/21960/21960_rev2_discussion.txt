DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Properly disabled Graphing controls.

In Run Configurations->Graphing menu, if graphing for the current
Run Configuration is disabled upon entering the menu, some controls
appear to be interactable despite being disabled. (Enabling and then
disabling graphing properly disables all controls.)

Change UI updates to make all controls appear disabled when entering
the Graphing menu, if graphing is disabled.
