DESCRIPTION

Bug 494926: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in RunImageMainTab

- change CommandUtils.getCurrentConnection to fall back to first
  active connection (not just first connection)
- have DockerImagesView and DockerContainersView use CommandUtils
  to get the default connection (i.e. first active connection)
- add checks in RunImageMainTab to look for no active connection
  and set an error message if that is the case
- add similar checks in RunImageVolumesTab, RunImageResourceTab,
  and RunImageEnvironmentTab
- use CommandUtils for default connection in
  RunImageLaunchConfigurationTabGroup
- add new Wizard message for inactive connection
