DESCRIPTION

LTTng: Remove dependency to LttngKernelTrace in Lttng Kernel analysis module

The helper's appliesToTraceType and the analysis's canExecute methods already
verify if a trace has the necessary requirements to be able to execute the
analysis and it shouldn't matter if it's not the same class.

Also added a unit test that tests the execution of the analysis itself.
