Just this small comment, I'm ok with this patch, but I think the window should still be updated so we see what we're doing when moving the content of the chart. It can be done in a later patch though.

Also, I confirm that the problem I mentioned earlier is only with my home mouse, here it works fine.

Line:132, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseDragProvider.java -> > I don't think we should update the window. We want to define the new range first before update the window which will read the data and broadcast the range to the other views. This is inline with what the control flow view and the histogram view does.

From what I see in the control flow view and the histogram, if I push the middle button and start dragging left and right, the view follows my mouse. So here too it should move along. Since the windowUpdate is in a signal throttler (I think), it shouldn't trigger too much updates.
