Small comments.

Also, it may be a linux thing or my home mouse problem, but the drag with middle button doesn't act as expected: it first zooms in when I push, then when I move my mouse or let the button go nothing happens. But that behavior is consistent across all views, so it's not this patch's problem. I'll try it from Poly on monday to see what it does. I never used middle button drag before...

Line:61, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseDragProvider.java -> Same comment as for previous patches

Line:126, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseDragProvider.java -> space after cast

Line:139, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseDragProvider.java -> Shouldn't we update the window, so that what is displayed is the same as what will be displayed when letting go of the mouse button? Then it wouldn't be necessary to do it in the mouseUp.

Line:139, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseDragProvider.java -> I don't think we should update the window. We want to define the new range first before update the window which will read the data and broadcast the range to the other views. This is inline with what the control flow view and the histogram view does. 

Also if we would update the window here it would cause many read data and broadcasting of the new range and that wouldn't be user friendly.
