Line:29, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/editor/DockerPresentationReconciler.java -> The simplest way to get this example working would be to have the DockerInstructionScanner processing the line starting with "#" (basic LineRule) and to turn them grey like the DockerCommentScanner does. Then the presentationReconcilier would work on any kind of Document, not only DockerDocument.
