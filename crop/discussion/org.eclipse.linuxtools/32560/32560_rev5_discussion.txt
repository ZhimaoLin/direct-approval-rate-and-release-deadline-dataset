Looks good. Some small comments. I put -1, but if you really prefer the current version I don't mind either way.

Line:189, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/ImportTraceWizardPage.java -> Having these fields protected bothers me (and Sonar) a little bit. Could we have getters/setters instead? (and the example in the following patch only uses 2 of them).

Line:172, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/ImportTraceWizardPage.java -> This is very C-ish ;)  Another pattern I've seen often recently that is more Java-ish is to use an enum and a (Options... opts) or Set<Options> parameter. Like in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#open%28java.nio.file.Path,%20java.util.Set,%20java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...%29
That way you can do .contains() etc. directly.

It's a bit heavier, but reading options for a dialog isn't normally on the fast path.

Good comments. I'm thinking I'll push this as is for now since it was previously approved and I can make another patch.
