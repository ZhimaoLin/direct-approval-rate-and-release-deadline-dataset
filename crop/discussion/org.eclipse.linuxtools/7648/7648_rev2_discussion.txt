DESCRIPTION

tmf: CtfTmfEvent improvements

- Remove extraneous Javadoc
- Change fTimestamp from a singleton to a proper field, set at
  the constructor.
- Drop unneeded singletons (fReference and fSource)
- Remove getTimestampValue(), call getTimestamp.getValue() instead,
  it is more compatible with ITmfEvent/Timestamp interfaces.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Side question: Why doesn't CtfTmfEvent extend TmfEvent?
