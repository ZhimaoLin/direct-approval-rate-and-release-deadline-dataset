DESCRIPTION

[WIP] tmf: Update the AbstractTimeGraphView to use the refresh handler

Work in progress: this introduces an annoying behavior where zoom operations
coming from the user can get discarded along with the replaced UI update
requests. The refresh() method will probably need to be cut in two, with
one part being queued in the UI handler, and one part being asyncExec'd directly.

Turns out this actually works as intended. The "bug" described in the commit message happens with live reading, even without this patch.

So if we want to merge the refresh handler thing, we could merge this harmlessly.
