DESCRIPTION

TMF: [WIP] Implementation of UstMemoryAnalysisModule requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements as well as his domain type. We
also add the information that the libc with probes should be loaded prior to start the trace session.
The lttng2.core.session is imported to make use of the session configuration strings.

Again some comments. 

Would it be possible to add a unit test that will use the lttng2.core.session class to generate the profile? You can just make sure the status is OK, we'll know it works and we can just run the unit test and not delete the file to get it and test it in a real trace environment.

Line:47, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModule.java -> Same comment as for the lttng kernel analysis. Requirements should be returned on demand and not saved in a field.

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModule.java -> Remove this TODO?

Line:85, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModule.java -> I would put them mandatory by default. I don't think you do anything about it yet, but without those events there is no analysis. Same applies to LTTng kernel analysis.

Line:93, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModule.java -> This message will be displayed to the end user. Please externalize.

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Here add org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core as a require-bundle instead

Since we are working on something that will be able to get the analysis requirements through the helpers, we were thinking on adding a test case there for the profile generation. Is it better if we do it per analysis?
