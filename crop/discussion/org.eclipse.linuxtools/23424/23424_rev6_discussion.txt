DESCRIPTION

TMF: Implementation of UstMemoryAnalysisModule requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements. We also add the
information that the libc with probes should be loaded prior to start the trace
session. The lttng2.core bundle is imported to make use of the session
configuration strings.
