DESCRIPTION

TMF: [WIP] Implementation of UstMemoryAnalysisModule requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements as well as his
domain type. We also add the information that the libc with probes should be
loaded prior to start the trace session. The lttng2.core bundle is imported to
make use of the session configuration strings.

Small comments for the next time you have to push this.

If an upcoming patch will generate the session configuration file, then it's not necessary to add it here as a unit test, though unit testing this functionnality somehow will be important somewhere ;-)

Also, if you could plan some time to add the documentation on your new features (towards the end when the work is close to approval), that would be really appreciated. Documentation for the analysis requirement should go in the developer documentation in org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/Developer-guide.mediawiki in the "Analysis framework" section (end of the file)

Line:17, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/Messages.java -> Add an empty line here

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/Messages.java -> And remove it here
