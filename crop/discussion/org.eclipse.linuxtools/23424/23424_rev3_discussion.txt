DESCRIPTION

TMF: [WIP] Implementation of UstMemoryAnalysisModule requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements as well as his
domain type. We also add the information that the libc with probes should be
loaded prior to start the trace session. The lttng2.core bundle is imported to
make use of the session configuration strings.

Please rebase this patch to master, the memory analysis has been moved to ust.core plug-in.

I generated the XML with the requirements. It works well, though I had some problem loading it in lttng, but I think it's a problem on the lttng side. I could load it once, then it didn't work anymore.

Line:23, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/Messages.java -> When you rebase this patch and move this to core, make sure you change this path.

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModuleTest.java -> When you rebase, this can be moved to the core.tests plugin

Line:48, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModuleTest.java -> The rule in unit tests is to leave the workspace exactly as it was. So you should have xxx@xxx.xxx method to delete the file if it exists. (that we can manually comment if we want to use this unit test to generate the XML ;-)

The comment applies to LTTng kernel analysis too.
