A bandaid on a gun wound ;) There is no synchronization between the rank and the location in the class. Anyone is free to change one without the other. What can possibly go wrong.

Even if setRank/getRank/setLocation/getLocation were all synchronized, if two threads try to call setRank/setLocation at the same time, you can end up in an inconsistent state.

This patch is still an improvement, I guess.
