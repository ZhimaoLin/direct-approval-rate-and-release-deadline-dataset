There needs to be a bug opened to describe the problem you are fixing (i.e. what is happening without your fix).  If there is already a bug open, please add it to your commit message, otherwise, please open a bug.

Please add a changeid to your patch commit message.  Check out:
http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/cmd-hook-commit-msg.html for details on how to automatically add a changeid to your commit msg.  If you make subsequent changes to the patch (e.g. from review comments), then you can make the changes in your branch and commit with the --amend flag.  This will preserve your commit msg which has the changeid so that when you push the change into gerrit, it will update the patch set in this review and there won't be multiple reviews open.

Line:229, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/valgrind/launch/ValgrindRemoteProxyLaunchDelegate.java -> what if we have more than one path in the field? Something like "/opt/test1:/opt/test2" ?
