DESCRIPTION

Bug 398008: Implement Perf Stat View.

The Perf Stat command runs a set of pre-defined events on a particular
binary, listing the total number of samples collected per event. The
ability to specify the number of times the binary should run is also
provided.

Looks good to me. Total number of samples collected for selected events, for specified number of runs of a particular binary, are correctly displayed in the perf stat view.
