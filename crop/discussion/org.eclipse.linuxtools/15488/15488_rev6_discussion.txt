Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Oups, I hadn't seen Alex's comment on this patch and just added yet one more little patch inside this one ;-)

Meredith Scott, Alex, will you take care of splitting it? Or I can do it tomorrow if that can help. That will make it easier, I haven't really looked at the histogram yet and that all need to be looked at before being merged.

By the way, if you can take a quick look at BarChartViewer vs XYLinePlotViewer. They are a bit different in method names and task separation, but I think they should be more alike. I'd like some feedback before unilaterally selecting one option above the other.

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.examples/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tracing/examples/ui/viewers/histogram/NewHistogramViewer.java -> I ctrl-alt-f'ed it and this is what it looks like :(
Any missing settings to the project?

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.examples/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tracing/examples/ui/viewers/histogram/NewHistogramViewer.java -> Yes, the auto-format settings are set as project-specific settings too. Make sure you copy over all the files in .settings/ from another "real" plugin, like tmf.core.

Hi Genevieve

thanks for updating this patch. I'll take a look. I'm going to split the patch in smaller patch sets as Alex suggested. BTW, I was working on updating the the selection handling with the left mouse and the drag zoom with the right mouse. This will be part of the set of patches.

oh yeah! But I don't see my line chart in those patchsets. You give me the honour of pushing this extra patch?

Abandoned

This was split in smaller patches, and most of it is already in master.
