Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Would it be possible to split this in smaller patches? Smaller patches means it's easier to review, easier to bisect, revert if needed, etc., but more importantly, it really shows the logical progression and tells the reviewers where they should be looking at first.

I think this could be easily split in:
* Add the "xychart" package and the base TmfXYChartViewer, as well as the dependencies in the manifest
* Add the TmfBarChartViewer and its related classes (they could go in a xychart.barchart package, but it doesn't really matter.)
* Add the tracing.examples plugin, with its settings (but no contents)
* Add the NewHistogramView

(I myself still have many huge patches I will try to break down in the next couple days, like the null-annotations one.)

I like the notion of an "examples" plugin, it's very useful for prototyping, but can serve as kind of staging for "real" views. Eventually the NewHistogramViewer can migrate to TMF to become the widget used in the Histogram View.
