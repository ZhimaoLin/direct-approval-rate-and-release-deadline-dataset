Hi Rob,

Thanks for contributing this. It looks fine to me, but I'll just try testing it out. It makes sense to have the VM parsing happen in separate threads.

There was a commit I pushed at the start of this week that conflicts with this one. The changes can be seen at : http://git.eclipse.org/c/linuxtools/org.eclipse.linuxtools.git/diff/vagrant/org.eclipse.linuxtools.vagrant.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/vagrant/core/VagrantConnection.java?id=a506e5f52af0cf52c9be4504c6e04d5c9c26eefa

If you rebase on top of this, it should be possible to get it pushed in.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would make this wrap to around 50 chars for the main line, and any additional description I'd put in a separate paragraph.

See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Git#Commit_messages (basically to make it readable for anyone using a terminal) .
