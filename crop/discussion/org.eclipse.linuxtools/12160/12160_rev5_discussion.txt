Just rebased on top of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/12224/ so that ctf.core.tests can avoid the dependency on antlr-runtime.

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this a standard Eclipse-provided plugin? If so, it could go in Required-Bundle. 

If not, then unless it's the Best Thing Ever (tm) and we want to move all our message handling to this, perhaps it's better to use plain old messages, as the rest of the codebase does.

Line:13, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/messages.properties -> the " " quotes would be part of the externalized string

Patch Set 5:

This change slows down the reading time on windows from 4us/event to 4.8us/event. please do not commit before reverting to mapped byte buffers. this is a 20% slowdown on a laptop.

Line:531, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> This is for reading the metadata only, not the events. Performance doesn't really matter here... and it doesn't make much sense to use a mmap for <= 4K.

please remove the bytebuffer stuff, it's good for a later commit. In Linux, it is approx 5% faster, in windows it's 20% slower. I say this is a good compromise judging by our user base. We just have to also change "setCurrentPacket" in streamInputPacketReader.

Line:531, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> Nope, this is for reading the trace, performance is more important to some than actual content.
