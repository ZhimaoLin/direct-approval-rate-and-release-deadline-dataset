DESCRIPTION

Bug 471665 - Add status icon decorators in the Explorer and Containers view

Replaced the container icon with a set of icons with a decorator
 that shows the status of the container (running, paused or stopped)
Fixed a problem where the Docker Explorer view was not refreshing
 after being notified of the containers list change.
Renamed 'CommandUtils#refresh()' to 'CommandUtils#asyncRefresh()'
 to explicitly mean that an async invocation will be triggered
 (although, this method is not used anymore now)
Fixed problem where the Containers view toolbar would not
 be refreshed after a container state was changed unless 2 calls to
 DockerConnection#listContainers() was made (which was ineffective)
