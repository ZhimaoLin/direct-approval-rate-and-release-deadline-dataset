DESCRIPTION

Bug 471665 - Add status icon decorators in the Explorer and Containers view

Replaced the container icon with a set of icons with a decorator that shows
the status of the container (running, paused or stopped)
Fixed a problem where the Docker Explorer view was not refreshing after
being notified of the containers list change.
Renamed 'CommandUtils#refresh()' to 'CommandUtils#asyncRefresh()' to
explicitly mean that an async invocation will be triggered
(although, this method is not used anymore now)
Fixed problem where the Containers view toolbar would not
be refreshed after a container state was changed unless 2 calls to
DockerConnection#listContainers() was made (which was ineffective)
