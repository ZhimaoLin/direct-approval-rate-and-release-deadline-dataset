DESCRIPTION

Bug 471665 - Add status icon decorators in the Explorer and Containers view

Replaced the container icon with a set of icons with a decorator
 that shows the status of the container (running, paused or stopped)
Fixed a problem where the Docker Explorer view was not refreshing
 after being notified of the containers list change.
Renamed 'CommandUtils#refresh()' to 'CommandUtils#asyncRefresh()'
 to explicitly mean that an async invocation will be triggered
 (although, this method is not used anymore now)
Fixed problem where the Containers view toolbar would not
 be refreshed after a container state was changed unless 2 calls to
 DockerConnection#listContainers() was made (which was ineffective)

This looks fine to me and works as expected. Are there any other icons we can use for paused/started/stopped ?

Patch Set 3:

I already used a slightly larger decorator for the "Running" state. I suggest that we use that for now and once I work on adding elements under the container nodes (exposed ports, etc), we could replace the image name with the container state (as in the Servers view) and display the image name as a child node. WDYT ?
