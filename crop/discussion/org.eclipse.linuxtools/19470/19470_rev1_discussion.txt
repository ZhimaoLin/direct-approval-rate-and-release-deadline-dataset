DESCRIPTION

tmf: Enable and fix Number unboxing warnings

While this makes the code a bit heavier in certain places, it makes it
much easier to detect useless boxing/unboxing operations, which can
save unneeded object allocations.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

After discussing this proposal, it was decided that the code where performance was potentially affected by boxing/unboxing should be fixed but that the rest should stay as is.

Abandoned

Abandoned due to low popularity. Replacement at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22398/ (only fix the problematic cases). Sad to see laziness trump code quality.
