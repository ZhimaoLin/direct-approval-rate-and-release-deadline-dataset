Patch Set 1:

There's also https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16423/ which is for master. Which one is the good one?

If the patch can go in master, only the master one should be proposed. We regularly sync from master to luna to get everything.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Marking this one as "do not merge". We can abandon it once https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16423/ is pushed and sync'ed to luna
