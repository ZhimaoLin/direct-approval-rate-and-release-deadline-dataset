Patch Set 1:

fa07308 restored all editors when autosaving a SystemTap script editor, so as to prevent a non-opened editor from being seen as "null" to allow those editors to be saved as well. However, there's no point to this since a non-opened editor couldn't have had its contents modified, so it would never have any changes to be saved.
