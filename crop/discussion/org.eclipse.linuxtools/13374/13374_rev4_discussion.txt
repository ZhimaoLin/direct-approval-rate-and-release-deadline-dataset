Line:994, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> functionalilty > functionality. Another benefit of TmfView is support for signal handling between components.

Line:1091, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> should prevent to recompute data when the trace selected is already the same one we are displaying

Line:1265, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Is this necessary? The old TmfChartTimeStampFormat should format dates according to the new preference.

Line:1265, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Yes this is necessary even if TmfTimestampFormat is already a SimpleDateFormat. However, it provides additional format which would not be displayed correctly if we use TmfTimestampFormat directly.

Line:1265, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I meant, is it necessary to create a new instance and set the format again? Won't the old object redraw using the new preference setting?

Line:994, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Done

Line:1091, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Done

Line:1265, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> The redraw alone is not sufficient. It looks like the chart needs to be nudged so that it formats the values again, possibly because of caching? As for creating a new instance, I could store the format in a member but the constructor is pretty trivial.
