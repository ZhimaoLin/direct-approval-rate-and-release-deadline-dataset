DESCRIPTION

tmf: Correctly use null values for empty stacks

When removing the last element of a stack attribute, the
popAttribute() method would leave the stack-attribute (which
represents the depth of the stack) with a state value of 0.

We expect a null value for empty stacks, and the integer
representation of a null value is -1. This would make it
impossible to re-use an attribute stack after it was completely
emptied once.

This patch fixes this by correctly assigning a null value when
emptying a stack.
