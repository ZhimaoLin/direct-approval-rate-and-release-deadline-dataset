DESCRIPTION

tmf: Allow waiting for a state system's completion

ITmfStateSystem.waitUntilBuilt() will now block the calling
thread until the state system underneath is finished building.
This will be immediately useful for statistics (intermediate
queries are useless, we need to wait until it's ready anyway).

It's implemented using a CountDownLatch, similar to the
.waitForCompletion() in event requests.
