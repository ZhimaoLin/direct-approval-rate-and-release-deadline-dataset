Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

You can already change the workspace directory by changing the traceviewer.ini file. Just change @noDefault to something else, e.g. /tmp/workspace xxx@xxx.xxx

If this is not sufficient, we can add your change. However, I would call the environment variable differently and not have LTTNG in it. (e.g. TRACING_RCP_HOME)

Patch Set 2:

ok fair enough for the xxx@xxx.xxx in the traceviewer.ini. But we still want to be able to overwrite it by an environment variable so a script can set the home before running the RCP. 

We are using the RCP at Poly in the Operating System course and the path is different for each student, but not their home directory.

If you'd like add the environment variable I'm ok with it. But please rename it to TRACING_RCP_HOME or TRACING_RCP_ROOT
