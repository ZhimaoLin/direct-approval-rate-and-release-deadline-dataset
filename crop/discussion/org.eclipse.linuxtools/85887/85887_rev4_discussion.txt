DESCRIPTION

Bug 508282 - Unable to list image tags on DockerHub

Refactored the code in the AbstractRegistry class to move the logic of
retrieving the tags by type of registry in private methods, and implemented
the workflow to retrieve a Bearer token if needed when querying on DockerHub.

Also, providing the resulting list of tags in a sorted, reverse order.

Added a few tests to verify the parsing of the 'Www-Authenticate' response header,
and verify that the list of tags for an official image (eg: "php") and a
regular image (eg: "jboss/wildfly") can be retrieved. These tests are
temporarily ignored because they fail on Hudson (can the salve machine
connect to Docker Hub ?)

Also: refactored some loops to use the Stream API.
