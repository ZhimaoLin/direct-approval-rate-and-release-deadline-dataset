Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you please explain the reasoning behind this change? IIRC it has to do with eventually supporting streaming. But to somebody looking at just the git history, there is no point.

Line:823, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Are we sure this signal can be for "an experiment containing this trace"? If you look at the code in the TmfTrace.traceOpened() handler, we iterate over all the traceset to get this condition.
