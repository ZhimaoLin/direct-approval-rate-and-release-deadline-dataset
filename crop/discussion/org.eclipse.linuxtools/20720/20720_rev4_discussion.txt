DESCRIPTION

tmf: use trace range updated as trigger for building of analysis

The TmfTraceRangeUpdateSignal is used to inform relevant components
(e.g. TmfTrace, HistogramView, HistoryBuilder) about a new time range
of the trace that can be analyzed.

In the case of opening a non-streamed trace all relevant components
will start their analysis for the trace.

In the case of streaming all relevant components will restart their
analysis for the new received trace range.

This update will useful for the upcoming support of LTTng streaming.
