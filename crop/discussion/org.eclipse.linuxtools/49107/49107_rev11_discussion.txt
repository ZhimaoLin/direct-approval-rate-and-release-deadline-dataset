DESCRIPTION

Bug 468966 - New Connection Wizard fails when no settings are detected

Refactored the wizard page to use Databinding and to validate
connection settings input:
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the TCP connection scheme is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the TCP connection host and port are valid
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
  (those values are validated according to the connection
   mode)
- automatically insert a "unix://" prefix (scheme) in the
  "Unix Socket" field when the user selects a file from
  the FileDialog

Ok so now we have a more subtle problem that this change makes more obvious.

By removing the "Default Local" connection name and allowing connection names to be null, this increases users seeing NPE since many parts of the code assume that connection.getName() will not be null.

I think the nicest solution is to remove the unnamed connection logic in DockerExplorerLabelProvider and actually name the connection "<Unnamed>" so that they won't be null.

Xavier has offered to fix some of the issues with this in a subsequent commit so seeing as there's nothing else, I'm going to push this into master. I'll cherry-pick to stable-4.1 once the corresponding fix lands in.
