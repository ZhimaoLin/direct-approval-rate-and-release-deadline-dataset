DESCRIPTION

Bug 468966 - New Connection Wizard fails when no settings are detected

Refactored the wizard page to use Databinding and to validate
connection settings input:
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the TCP connection scheme is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the TCP connection host and port are valid
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
  (those values are validated according to the connection
   mode)
- automatically insert a "unix://" prefix (scheme) in the
  "Unix Socket" field when the user selects a file from
  the FileDialog

Just one last thing, along with some minor fixes.

- The 'use custom connection settings:' checkbox works as expected when enabling it, but when unchecking, it does not disable the widgets under it (textboxes, radio buttons) so they remain modifiable. They should become disabled.

Line:637, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/NewDockerConnectionPage.java -> This should be just '!unixSocket.canRead()' .
