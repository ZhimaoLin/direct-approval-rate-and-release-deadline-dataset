DESCRIPTION

Bug 468966 - New Connection Wizard fails when no settings are detected

Refactored the wizard page to use Databinding and to validate
connection settings input:
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the TCP connection scheme is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the TCP connection host and port are valid
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
  (those values are validated according to the connection
   mode)
- automatically insert a "unix://" prefix (scheme) in the
  "Unix Socket" field when the user selects a file from
  the FileDialog

Ok, then we'll keep it as it is, and at least the user has some indication to enter the extra information.

After the initial state is fixed, I'm noticing that even when the connection settings are auto-detected the radio widgets and textbook that get filled in are still modifiable despite the custom connection checkbox being unchecked. This is different from the previous behaviour.

So even when the values get filled in by the auto-detection script, the textbox/radio widgets should be disabled until the user clicks the custom connection checkbox.

Line:492, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/views/DockerImagesView.java -> You've reversed the expression which is now a problem because currUri can be null. I would restore it to what it was originally.
