DESCRIPTION

Bug 468966 - New Connection Wizard fails when no settings are detected

Refactored the wizard page to use Databinding and to validate
connection settings input:
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the host scheme starts is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
  (those values are validated according to the connection
   mode)

This is broken for me. When I attempt to create a connection it automatically detects 'unix://var/run/docker.sock' and fills it in, but then the validation says 'unix socket path is invalid' and doesn't let me hit Finish. Somehow "Test Connection" is also failing to recognize it as a proper connection. If I chance the socket location to '/var/run/docker.sock' validation passes, but "Test Connection" still fails and an NPE is genreated at :

java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.docker.ui.views.DockerImagesView.changeEvent(DockerImagesView.java:492)

When I attempt to select a TCP Connection by clicking that radio box, the UNIX Socket connection location Text Box is still active, and the HOST/PATH text boxes remain inactive.
