Patch Set 2: Verified+1

This change looks mostly fine, and works as expectd. I'l just take a closer look in NewDockerConnectionPage, and it'll need to be rebased against the latest, but I think the conflict is just with the DockerConnection file.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

The code looks fine to me. My one nit-pick would be that we could very easily support Luna just by lowering the version of databinding, assuming you're not using any new APIs of that framework.
