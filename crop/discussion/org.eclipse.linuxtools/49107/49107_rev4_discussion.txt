DESCRIPTION

Bug 468966 - New Connection Wizard fails when no settings are detected

Refactored the wizard page to use Databinding and to validate
connection settings input:
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the host scheme starts is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
  (those values are validated according to the connection
   mode)
