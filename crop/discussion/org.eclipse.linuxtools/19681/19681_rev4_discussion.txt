DESCRIPTION

tmf: add a doQuery version with an intervals listener (draft).

The doQuery method populates a List (ArrayList) with intervals
intersecting a given timestamp.

Most of the time, the produced array is use to iterate over and
its creation wasn't necessary. This is a producer/consumer design
which could be better abstract by a listener to link the publish of
an intervals to the consume point.

This patch-set provides the idea without fully replaced the actual
doQuery implementation. There is actually no place where the
listener concept is used.
