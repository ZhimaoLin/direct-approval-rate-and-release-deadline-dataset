Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> I see, the index request starts at index 1, so the startTime is the time of the first event of the request. This was not correct in the old implementation.

Line:28, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> remove unused import which causes a warning

Line:203, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> This is the actual fix for the missing signal.

Line:204, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> This fixes the problem of the incorrect startTime of the previous implementation on condition that the trace has the correct startTime (and also endTime). For traces that extend TmfTrace, this is taken care of in method updateAttributes() during getNext() of any requests. So, I think it is save to do as proposed..
