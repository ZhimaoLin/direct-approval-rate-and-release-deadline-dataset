The patch in its current state crashes the Eclipse instance.

I open the 'Docker Tooling' perspective, where the Docker Containers/Images view are stacked on top of each other by default. Create a new connection from the 'Docker Explorer'. When I attempt to give the  'Docker Containers' view focus, or switch focus between the two, the workbench UI eventually hangs.
