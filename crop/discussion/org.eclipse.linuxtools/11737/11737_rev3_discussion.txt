Patch Set 3:

Did not use a xxx@xxx.xxx as it would apply to all tests. This would eliminate coverage of tests that do not depend on stap being installed.

One suggestion.

Line:10, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/tests/SystemtapTestUtil.java -> Have you considered making this into a root class (SystemtapTest) ? If you do that then even the setup code can be shared.

Line:10, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/tests/SystemtapTestUtil.java -> I did not, it's a good idea, I'll update the patch.
