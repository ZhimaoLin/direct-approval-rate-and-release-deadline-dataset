DESCRIPTION

tmf: add command to open trace as a specific trace type

This allows the user to open a given trace for different trace
types without having to copy the trace, re-selecting a trace
trace type and delete the supplementary files.

The implementation considers multiple scenarios:
1) Original trace has no trace type
   -> original trace will be opened and the trace type will be
      set accordingly

2) Trace type of original trace and given trace type are the same
   -> original trace will be opened

3) Trace type of original trace and given trace type are different
   -> original trace will be copied
   -> copied trace will be opened and the trace type will be set
      accordingly

4) Trace type of original trace and given trace type are different
   and the new trace already exists
   -> the previously copied trace will be opened

Patch Set 2:

Isn't this redundant with the existing "Select Trace Type" option? In fact I think this (Open As) could replace Select Trace Type completely. It's also better placed in the menu.

Patch Set 2:

Good point. However, SelectTraceType allows for multiple selection which is handy for some use cases. The question is now, can we live without SelectTraceType.
