DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.

This is a first draft of unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.

are to come.

Some tests are commented and need to fix the grammars.
The plan is to fix them in future commits to limits the
amount of refactoring.

Patch Set 7:

Comments are addressed.
For the remaining copyright, those files was a copy paste from the Ericsson file (from the GDB folder).
So, I won't take the authorship.

I did the modification for the those main test files, which was entirely written by me.

Patch Set 7:

I maintain that the test code is good and interesting. My +1 shall remain transitive, but the nits need to be addressed if there are any.
