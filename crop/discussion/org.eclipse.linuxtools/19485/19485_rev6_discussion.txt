DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.

This is a first draft of unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.
The coverage of these tests is still incomplete. More unittests
are to come.

Some tests are commented and need to fix the grammars.
The plan is to fix them in future commits to limits the
amount of refactoring.
