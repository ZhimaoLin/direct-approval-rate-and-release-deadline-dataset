DESCRIPTION

Patch Set 4:

Eh, never mind, I figured it out (patch 4). I tried to add x-friends before but still saw warnings so I assumed it didn't work but the remaining warnings are actually from missing javadoc. Could we add those?

Yes I can take care of that. (tomorrow).

I didn't know javadoc was mandatory in your coding style for the unittests.

Thanks for your help.
