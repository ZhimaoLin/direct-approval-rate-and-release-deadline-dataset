DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.

This is a first draft of unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.

Some tests are commented and need to fix the grammars.
The plan is to fix them in future commits to limits the
amount of refactoring.

The code looks good to me and the test cases too.

I am not an expert on project setup, I will ask a colleague to review it asap.

Patch Set 2:

I never did a package in Eclipse. This is the first one.
So, I copy-pasted an existing one. I would really appreciate somebody to look over my shoulder and fix anything incorrect with the way this package is bundle into linuxtools and git.
