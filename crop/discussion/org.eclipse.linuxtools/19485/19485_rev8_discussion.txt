DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.

This is a first draft of unittests for the CTF Lexer and Parser.
The coverage of these tests is still incomplete. More unittests
are to come.

Some tests are commented and need to fix the grammars.
The plan is to fix them in future commits to limits the
amount of refactoring.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review+1

There was still xxx@xxx.xxx at the top instead of the bottom of the class Javadoc.

As for the SupressWarnings(javadoc), ideally even in tests we should aim to have some javadoc explaining what the test does (GDB tests might not, but maybe they should!)

However in the particular case here, it's usually quite clear from the method name what it's trying to do, so I don't mind keeping it this way. It's more useful for documenting things like testGetter1(), testGetter2(), etc.

Since this patch is relatively large (>250 lines), it will require going through the CQ process[1]. I've opened a CQ, let's see how long it takes...
