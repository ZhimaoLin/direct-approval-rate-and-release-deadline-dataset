DESCRIPTION

tmf: Bug 436258: Bookmark icon disappears on deletion even if there is

The TmfEventsTable now supports many bookmarks for the same rank by use
of a multimap. The tool tip is updated to show multiple bookmarks. The
remove and toggle bookmark actions now remove all bookmarks.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Looks good! One comment though, I'll let you judge if it's a problem or not.

Line:1021, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> the .join() below will fail if any of the parts are null. Are we guaranteed that there will be no nulls in the array? You can add .skipNulls(), or useForNull(String) at the end of this line to avoid this.
