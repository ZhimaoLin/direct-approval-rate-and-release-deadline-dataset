DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce a central trace manager

This manager will track all currently opened traces and their
currently selected timestamps and time ranges.

This will also give both views and *.core analysis plugins
a centralized way to get the current active trace/experiment.
This was not an easy thing to do reliably if you were not an
instance of TmfView.

Basic unit tests are included, more complete tests will be added
later.

Line:299, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> This was supposed to be "< 0", not "< 1". The experiment tests figured it out right away.
