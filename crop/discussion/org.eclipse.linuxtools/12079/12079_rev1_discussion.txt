DESCRIPTION

[WIP] tmf: Introduce a central trace manager

This manager will track all currently opened traces and their
currently selected timestamps and time ranges.

This will also give both views and *.core analysis plugins
a centralized way to get the current active trace/experiment.
This was not an easy thing to do reliably if you were not an
instance of TmfView.

Unit tests are still WIP.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This change seems to be based on the partial state history for the statistics. Could you please provide the trace manager changes independent from it? I found some issues, however, I'm not sure where the problem is (partial statistics or trace manager update)
