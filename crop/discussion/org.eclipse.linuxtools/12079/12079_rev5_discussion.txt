DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce a central trace manager

This manager will track all currently opened traces and their
currently selected timestamps and time ranges.

This will also give both views and *.core analysis plugins
a centralized way to get the current active trace/experiment.
This was not an easy thing to do reliably if you were not an
instance of TmfView.

Basic unit tests are included, more complete tests will be added
later.

The feature works. However some small updates are needed

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> Add synchronized to this method

Famous last works ... It should not happen

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> "test suite" not "test sweet" :-)

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> Aww you found it ;)

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> It will be used for the experiment tests that are coming up. In fact, I'll write at least one of those so it gets used...
