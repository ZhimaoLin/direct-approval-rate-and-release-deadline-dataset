DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce a central trace manager

This manager will track all currently opened traces and their
currently selected timestamps and time ranges.

This will also give both views and *.core analysis plugins
a centralized way to get the current active trace/experiment.
This was not an easy thing to do reliably if you were not an
instance of TmfView.

Basic unit tests are included, more complete tests will be added
later.
