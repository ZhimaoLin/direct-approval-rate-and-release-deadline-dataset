DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Restore public TapsetLibrary.init().

Restore the public initialization method for TapsetLibrary,
so that tapset contents can be loaded as soon as the Systemtap
plugin is loaded. Also implement a better means of forbidding
multiple initializations than what was done before, and remove
a potential NPE elsewhere in TapsetLibrary.
