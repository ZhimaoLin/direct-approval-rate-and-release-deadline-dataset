DESCRIPTION

RPM: filter out %{?...} macros from outline

The eval function is calling the "rpm" command but to do this the plugin
tries to get a RemoteService to get the system environment variables.
The RemoteService is returning null because it cannot find a
remoteService extension point for RSE scheme.

For now it is temporarily better to filter out the %{?...} macros from
the outline entries rather than having NPEs and showing nothing at all.
