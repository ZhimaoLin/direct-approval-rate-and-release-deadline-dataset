DESCRIPTION

RPM: temporarily fix NPEs in outline with RSE

The eval function is calling the "rpm" command but to do this the plugin
tries to get a RemoteService to get the system environment variables.
The RemoteService is returning null because it cannot find a
remoteService extension point for RSE scheme.

For now it is temporarily better to let the outline show unresolved
macros rather than show nothing at all + NPEs.

Drop the eval but filter scl_prefix stuff.

Line:85, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/outline/SpecfileLabelProvider.java -> I would not mind such a change if scl_prefix gets filtered so it doesn't show in the outline. This is the reason why the eval was added.
