The change looks fine to me, but there are some small issues to address. Also have you tested this in just the local case ?

Line:101, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/ui/ProfileUIUtils.java -> This would need to xxx@xxx.xxx 3.1 , since that's the release we'd be targeting.

Line:26, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We would also need to bump the manifest + pom.xml to be 3.1 since there would be new api here.
