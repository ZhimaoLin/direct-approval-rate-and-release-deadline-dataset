Line:371, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/ImportTraceWizardScanPage.java -> The status line always shows "Scan job 0%". It seems to be never updated. Also, when the scanning is finished, this job still seems to be running, even if the sub-job is done. I guess when the sub-job for which you create a sub-monitor is finished, it needs to propagate that information to the parent monitor.
