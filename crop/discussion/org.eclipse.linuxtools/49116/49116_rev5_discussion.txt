DESCRIPTION

Bug 469008 - Add script to detect connection settings on Windows

Refactored the code to only create the script file in the data dir when
needed
Check the OS name and return the name of the script to use (script.sh /
scrip.bat)
Using try-with-resources to avoid having to manually close the
resources.
