DESCRIPTION

Bug 496705: Context menu should reflect correct state after command.

Although property testers get re-triggered, the selection data remains
stale leading to incorrect context menu states (eg. start container is
selectable even after the container has already started). Property
testers should query for fresh container data every time.
