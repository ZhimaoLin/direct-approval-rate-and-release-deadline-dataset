DESCRIPTION

[RFC]ctf: Make events immutable

This patch does some major changes to the ctf parser

The event definitions are now immutable and can no longer be modified.
The declarations will read the bitbuffer and then create event
definitions. The event definitions are going to have fields. Innitial
tests show a 4x slowdown, but it's better for memory usage.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Most comments from PS4 are still valid. Mostly code style issues, but a couple more fundamental ones (assigning an array directly from the constructor).
