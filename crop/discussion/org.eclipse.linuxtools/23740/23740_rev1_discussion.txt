DESCRIPTION

[RFC]ctf: Make events immutable

This patch does some major changes to the ctf parser

The event definitions are now immutable and can no longer be modified.
The declarations will read the bitbuffer and then create event
definitions. The event definitions are going to have fields. Innitial
tests show a 4x slowdown, but it's better for memory usage.

It's not just the JUnit tests, it doesn't even compile ;)  And there are conflicts with the latest master, so it's a bit hard to pull as is.
