DESCRIPTION

ctf: Make events immutable

This patch does some major changes to the ctf parser

The event definitions are now immutable and can no longer be modified.
The declarations will read the bitbuffer and then create event
definitions. The event definitions are going to have fields. Initial
tests show a slight speedup but the parser is 66% slower without
eclipse.
