DESCRIPTION

ctf: Make events immutable

This patch does some major changes to the ctf parser

The event definitions are now immutable and can no longer be modified.
The declarations will read the bitbuffer and then create event
definitions. The event definitions are going to have fields. Initial
tests show a slight speedup but the parser is 66% slower without eclipse.

Just one small thing I found, will investigate the build failure more.

Line:63, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/ArrayDefinition.java -> You are using redundant annotations in here (the class is NonNullByDefault, no need xxx@xxx.xxx on parameters), but the SuppressWarning silences them. And causes a build failure with Maven...

As much as possible, do NOT use SupressWarnings on whole methods, only one single variables. It avoids problems like these. And Maven doesn't seem to like it either.
