Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Right now the analysis of an experiment are shown on the same level as the traces of the experiment. User might mistakenly thing they are traces. We could introduce another layer with is called Analyses (which is a folder) under the Experiment (and Trace in the Traces folder) to make it clear. This could be in another patch. Alternatively, when we move the analysis our of the project explorer then we this is obsolete. Any comments?

Patch Set 2:

Indeed the children of an experiment can be confusing.

Ideally, the analysis would not be in the project explorer at all, there should be a view to display them nicely, with screenshots of the available views, the list of analysis, their status (not started, running, completed, error). Will that be possible before luna? I'm not sure, at least it's not in my priorities. How about on your side?

In the meantime, adding a level under the trace for analysis would involve adding a new TmfAnalysisFolderElement. The refreshChildren and getAvailableAnalysis code cannot go in the TmfCommonProjectelement element since it will not be common to experiment and trace elements anymore, it will have to be repeated in the analysis folder element.

I'm not yippi yippi yay about this, but if the ideal solution is not available for luna, then this might be the best. But in other patches.
