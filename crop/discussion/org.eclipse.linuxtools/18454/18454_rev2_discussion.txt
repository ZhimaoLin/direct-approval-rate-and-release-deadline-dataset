DESCRIPTION

Fix coding style in TmfVirtualTable.

Fixing some nits I've found while reading this file.
Mostly no behavior changed, except shortcut a loop and removing a useless test.

Line:255, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Makes sense, but I'll let Patrick confirm that's what we want to happen.

Line:374, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> ok, the check is unneeded because updateStatusLine() also does a null check.

meh, it would be much cleaner with null-annotations ;-D

I agree, but I think you should lift out this functionnality.

Line:255, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> In fact, a better thing to do is to lift out a helper function:
GetItemAtPosition(x,y)
which do the loop over items and returns the appropriate one.

And, this function will be used at more than one place in the code. Tiny refactoring that will clean up a little bit the code.
