DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add rebuild() method to abstract time graph view

It is useful when some action in the view requires the view to rebuild the
list of entries, for a same trace.

This patch also adds a getPresentationProvider() method to the time graph
view so concrete classes may make changes to the presentation provider.

Patch Set 1:

The rebuild method will be useful for the XML view, where many views may be requested for a single trace. Each view opened will trigger a rebuild of the entries for the trace.

It will also be useful for the Critical path view, where the selection in the control flow view triggers a new analysis and output.
