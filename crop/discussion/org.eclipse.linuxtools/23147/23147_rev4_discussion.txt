DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add rebuild() method to abstract time graph view

It is useful when some action in the view requires the view to rebuild the
list of entries, for a same trace.

This patch also adds a getPresentationProvider() method to the time graph
view so concrete classes may make changes to the presentation provider.
