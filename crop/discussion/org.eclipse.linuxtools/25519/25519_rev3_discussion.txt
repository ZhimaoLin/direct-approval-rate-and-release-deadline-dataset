Patch Set 3: Verified+1 Code-Review+1

I did say only the trailing space was bugging me ;-)

> That's what the README is for. This pic is like an extension of the README.

But who ever reads the README? :p A wiki page could eventually be more verbose than the README because 

org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.*          Tracing and Monitoring Framework

doesn't say much imho.

> lttng2.[core|ui] are missing Don't you mean lttng2.control.[core|ui] ? ;) But yeah I didn't put them on purpose, dependencies are being added right now (with the analysis-session-profile-thingy), and it's not clear where it will end yet.

Did you rename a plugin again? :p As for the relationship between control and kernel/ust, I think that should be discussed once that thingy is in. I'd add an extension point for trace generators to associate with a tracetype. But that's me, I like extension point! But i'm highjacking this patch with this discussion, let's go back to the diagram...

> but how about we get it in first, then decide where to link it from the doc?

Sure sure, now that it exists, we can put it everywhere!
