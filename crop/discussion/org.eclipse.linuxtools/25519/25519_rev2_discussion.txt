Patch Set 2:

Hmm, I can't really figure out where it would fit in the user guides...

The developer guide (tmf.help) is more about "how to add a trace type to TMF", "here are the classes in TMF". It doesn't talk about the other plugins in the tree.

The user guide (lttng.help) is more about using the plugin/RCP, as a user who doesn't care about how the code underneath is organized.

Users on the wiki won't see the list of plugins either.

The only place where we explain the different plugins is in the README file. Which is specifically for people who download the git tree. Isn't that the only relevant place then?

-1 for trailing space.

And extra comments that you may or may not act upon:

I would put them in square bubbles (yes, square bubbles...) and add some short text to describe what kind of stuff can be found. The image does show the relationship between plugins, but it doesn't help me find what I'm looking for (were I a newcomer). 

Also lttng2.[core|ui] are missing and if you add that, maybe also the tracing.rcp.* plug-ins.

As for where to put it in the dev doc, I'd say anywhere! It does also talk about component interaction, how to use state system, why not what's in TMF? And also I sort of remember starting a page in the Eclipse wiki on developer documentation, back when I was a newcomer, but by the time I understood enough to be able to write the doc, I forgot about it ;-) And I can't seem to find the page anymore. That would have been a good place to put it. Or maybe a link on the Development environment setup wiki page?

Line:12, lttng/README -> trailing space...

> square bubbles
rly?? I tried it and... it isn't as nice, imnsho. I liked the geometric differentiation : bubbles for the plugins, and the (dashed) square for the feature.

>  The image does show the relationship between plugins, but it doesn't help me find what I'm looking for
That's what the README is for. This pic is like an extension of the README.

> lttng2.[core|ui] are missing
Don't you mean lttng2.control.[core|ui] ? ;)  But yeah I didn't put them on purpose, dependencies are being added right now (with the analysis-session-profile-thingy), and it's not clear where it will end yet.

I'll fix the trailing space (curse you non-auto-formatting editors :( ), but how about we get it in first, then decide where to link it from the doc?

Line:12, lttng/README -> gah!
