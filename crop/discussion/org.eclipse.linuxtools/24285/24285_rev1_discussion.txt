Patch Set 1:

This manager will be helpful when we'll need to enable events (in the control view) from an analysis that has requirements.

By enabling the events, the session info that holds them will be updated and we would be able to generate a session configuration file (with this patch : https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/23425/).
