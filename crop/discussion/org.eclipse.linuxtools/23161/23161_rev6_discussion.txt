(1 comment)

Some comments got put on Patch Set 5, gg Gerrit...  look at the email, it will be more clear ;)

some things left. Also, I don't think "State System View" means anything, it's actually a Time Graph View here. A state system could be used to display other types of views. It applies to both the view name, and the package name.

Line:21, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/plugin.properties -> Data-Driven Time Graph View ?

Patch Set 6:

Actually it's a time graph view based on a state system. We *could* eventually have another data-driven time graph view based on the events for instance, or on something else. So I'd say it is a "state system time graph view", a sub-category of data-driven time graph views.

There will eventually be "state system xy charts" as well.

Patch Set 6:

We could eventually add support for getting the information from events (some trace types do have "states" in them, like MPI Jumpshot traces), but it would make more sense to add support for that to one "data-driven time graph view", rather than adding a separate "event-driven time graph view". Maybe underneath it could be handled separately, but when presented to the user there should be one time graph view, and then the user can decide the data source (a bit like, dare I say, Excel). And the user might even want both state-system-provided and event-provided states in the same view(!)

All in all, since we only have one time graph view atm, the package should be views.timegraph (or similar). As for the externalized view's name, didn't we mention that it could eventually be defined in the XML file itself? In that case the temporary name we'll give it now doesn't really matter. But please, not "State System View", that doesn't mean anything. Most of the view are state-system-driven nowadays.

Patch Set 6:

It is already possible to define the label of the view in the XML, so the title shouldn't be something the user will see (at least not when the XML file is in production mode) XML Time Graph View it will be then.
