DESCRIPTION

Gcov: remove SWTBot from tests.

Convert all GCov UI tests to use Eclipse API instead of SWTBot.
This required some features to be modified so they could be
testable without relying on UI interaction.

Patch Set 4:

For some reason, when the test opens either of the coverage files for Gcov_CPP_test/main.cpp, it doesn't put the editor for main.cpp in focus. It *does* open the file, but it's one of the other files that get opened (dependant .h files) that get focus.

This does not happen to me locally, even when I perform a local maven build. For now I added a workaround (i.e. a scan of all opened editors) to let the test pass (and to print a warning when the described issue happens), but this might be something to look into more closely.

I'm really glad that path to more stable tests is open now.
