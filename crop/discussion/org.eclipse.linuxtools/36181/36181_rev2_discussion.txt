DESCRIPTION

Gcov: remove SWTBot from tests.

Convert all GCov UI tests to use Eclipse API instead of SWTBot.
This required some features to be modified so they could be
testable without relying on UI interaction.

Patch Set 2:

Fixed a problem that prevented the different Gcov tests from running back to back. Also got rid of calls to close editors, since they automatically get closed when their parent project is deleted.
