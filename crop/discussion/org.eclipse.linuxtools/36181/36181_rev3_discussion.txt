DESCRIPTION

Gcov: remove SWTBot from tests.

Convert all GCov UI tests to use Eclipse API instead of SWTBot.
This required some features to be modified so they could be
testable without relying on UI interaction.

Patch Set 3:

The last failure came from an invalid cast of the current editorInput as an IFileEditorInput; the cast was done in order to get the editor's input file. Since I never experienced any such casting errors locally, I just got rid of the cast & used a different way of getting the file, since the actual type of the editor input isn't all that important for the test.
