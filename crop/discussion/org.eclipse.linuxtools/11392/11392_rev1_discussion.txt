DESCRIPTION

Print program output to a console.

When running Perf, one stream will contain the program output, and the
other will contain the collected data. As a starting point, add the
ability for Perf stat to display its program output to the console.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Perf stat works as expected. However, when profiling a program with the perf disassembly option enabled, at least one program execution stalls at 50%.
