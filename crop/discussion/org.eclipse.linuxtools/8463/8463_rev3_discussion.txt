DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add some unit tests to the ITmfStatistics

Also fixed some bugs that those tests exposed:
- Time ranges are now inclusive (both at the beginning and end)
  for all implementations.
- All methods in TmfStateStatistics will now wait for the history
  construction to be complete, so hopefully no more hundreds of
  AttributeNotFoundException's.
- State system queries at the end time should now work correctly
  (the work-around was removed).
- A time range beginning at the trace's start time should now
  return the correct values. I couldn't test with the edge case
  where you have more than 1 event exactly at the start time, but
  I assume it should work correctly too.
