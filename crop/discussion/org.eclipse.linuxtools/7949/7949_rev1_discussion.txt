Patch Set 1:

This should release all resources held by the experiment and allow subsequent deletion of the experiment's traces from the file system.

However deletion still fails due to two lingering references to the experiment:

1. TmfEventsView.fExperiment: It should be cleared in the experiment disposed handler

2. TmfRawEventViewer.fTrace: TmfEventsTable does not propagate setTrace to the raw viewer if the trace is null. Also TmfRawEventViewer.refreshEventCount() should probably handle a null trace to set the thumb and refresh its display.

Also, this clearing could be performed when executing the Delete command on a trace which is currently displayed, to allow the deletion to succeed. This could be done in a separate patch.
