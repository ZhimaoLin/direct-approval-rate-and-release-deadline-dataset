This change works as expected. I'd like for Sami to also take a look as it is a significant change to the graphing config wizard. One more suggestion would be to add comments to the changes made to SelectSeriesWizardPage#createControl, mainly to try to make it easier for others to pick out what ui components of the wizard page are being created.

Line:259, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphAndSeriesWizardPage.java -> Missing javadoc for new method.

Line:40, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphAndSeriesWizardPage.java -> I think it would be better if the graphs are layout horizontally and grouped together in a Group. Then below them add the series info in a Group as well.

Line:115, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphAndSeriesWizardPage.java -> Try to avoid using static width settings as much as possible.
Instead use layout data properties such as grabExcessHorizontalSpace/VerticalSpace to set widget behaviour.

Line:24, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphandSeriesWizard.java -> should be GraphAndSeriesWizard instead of GraphandSeriesWizard

Line:78, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphandSeriesWizard.java -> Wizards know to dispose of all their pages and there is no need to call super.dispose() explicitly. Please get rid of this method all together.

The systemtap code uses dispose methods very excessively so be on the lookout for unessessary dispose calls

Line:259, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphAndSeriesWizardPage.java -> I didn't put a javadoc here because the original function that I took from SelectGraphWizardPage didn't have one. The similar saveDataToModelSeries below didn't originally have one either, and neither did any of the other private methods.

Line:259, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/wizards/graph/SelectGraphAndSeriesWizardPage.java -> Yeah... The systemtap code is not in great shape but we try to improve the bits we touch little by little.
