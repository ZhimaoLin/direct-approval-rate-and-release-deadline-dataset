Line:293, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> File f should be scoped, and not reused. This is a recipe for leaking descriptors.

Line:332, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> Wouldn't be in the scope of this change, but could be worth using @Before xxx@xxx.xxx methods to open and close/cleanup the files.

Line:90, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> formatting changes should be separated from code changes (in a different commit)

Line:397, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> This is not the "blessed" way of using ByteBuffer... might work, but to be safe it should be:

  FileChannel fc = new FileChannel(fos);
  fc.write(data);
  fc.close();
  fos.close();

(if you close fos it should close fc automatically anyway).
fw seems unused, could be removed.

Line:412, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> For non-expected exceptions, sometimes it's cleaner to use:

  try {
    ...
  } catch (CTFReaderException e) {
    fail();
  }

This way you don't need to put the exception in the signature, and you don't need the javadoc entry etc.
