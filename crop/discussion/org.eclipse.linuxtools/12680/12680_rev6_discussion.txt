Line:270, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> Only if you do another patchset:

This could be private. Also, probably better to use File.createTempFile() (so that there is no filename clash).

Line:341, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> You could do the definition and declaration on the same line:
  File dir = new File(...);

Sometimes you have to separate them, if you want to access 'dir' outside of the try block, but here it would work.
