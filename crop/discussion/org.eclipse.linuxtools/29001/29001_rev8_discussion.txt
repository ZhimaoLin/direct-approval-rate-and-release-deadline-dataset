Line:28, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> Does it make sense to use the same key for Refresh? If it's Refresh why don't we share the same key? I know we haven't cared for such things up to know but the point in having externalized strings is to ease translations so less keys would make it easier.

Line:1, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/views/RefreshHandler.java -> Missing license header!

Line:28, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> I made an extra "Refresh" key so it could be used for a category name, without it being linked to the label string of the Refresh button. But now that you mention it, it is wasteful to have two identical keys, and to have a whole category just for refresh operations.

To reduce redundancy & duplication, I think I'll put the Refresh commands in the "Tapset" category instead. It's probably more appropriate that way, too.
