Line:79, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rdt.proxy/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rdt/proxy/RDTFileProxy.java -> Well, I don't like the idea of printing the stacktrace too, but this is done all over Linuxtools. Is there any effort to change that? In this case, what do you suggest, just skiping the check and let others handle it?
