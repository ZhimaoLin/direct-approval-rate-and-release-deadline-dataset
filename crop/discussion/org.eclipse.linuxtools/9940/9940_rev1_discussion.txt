DESCRIPTION

Use Traces folder trace element when creating experiment from editor

When an experiment is created from the TmfEventsEditor.init method from
a FileEditorInput (ie. on platform restart or on open from bookmark),
the trace element from the Traces folder should be used. This is
required so that any plug-in extension that stores a persistent property
on the trace resource can access it when an experiment is created this
way.
