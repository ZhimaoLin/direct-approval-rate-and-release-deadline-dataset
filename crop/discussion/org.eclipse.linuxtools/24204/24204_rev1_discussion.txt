IIRC we were thinking of moving the location of the bookmarks file to the persistent properties. Or was it the supplementary files? Patrick, I think we had a good plan in mind last time we discussed this, do you remember?

Ok. The idea is to have a programmatic access to the bookmark file. For example to add bookmarks from the time-chart view.

I would prefer if we removed completely the concept of bookmarks file from the interfaces and instead use the editor's input. The file in the FileEditorInput is always the file used for storing bookmarks.

How about a solution where the TmfTraceManager has a static method to return the editor associated with an opened trace? Then you can easily get the file from the editor input. Or the TmfTraceManager could return the file directly.

Note that if you are using the TimeChartView, you can already get the bookmarks file from the TimeChartDecorationProvider associated with the trace. It is stored when the trace is opened from the signal's getBookmarksFile(), or when the view is opened from the editor's getBookmarksFile(). But both of these methods could be removed if we use the editor input or the new suggested method from TmfTraceManager instead.

Line:387, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> We have cases where the bookmarks file is an IFolder (e.g. CTF traces) so this would return null.
