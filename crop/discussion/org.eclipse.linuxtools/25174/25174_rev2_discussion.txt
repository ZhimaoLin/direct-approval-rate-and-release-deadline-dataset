DESCRIPTION

ctf: Do not call System.gc() in CTFTrace.close()

This call is used to workaround a bug/limitation of MappedByteBuffer
(see JDK-4724038). But CTFTrace.close() is called quite often
(for example, once per trace when closing an experiment), so it is not
the best place to call System.gc(). Instead, only call it when we are
about to delete/rename a trace.
