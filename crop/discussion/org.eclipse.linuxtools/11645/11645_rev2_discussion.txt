Patch Set 2:

Hover help for functions and probes works correctly. I did notice that there is no help dialog when hovering over tapsets, is this intended for a later patch?

Patch Set 2:

It is intended. I thought if the probe point is there then just present the documentation for the probe point.

But if it is an incomplete probe and only the tapset is specified we should return documentation for the tapset... let me add something to that effect
