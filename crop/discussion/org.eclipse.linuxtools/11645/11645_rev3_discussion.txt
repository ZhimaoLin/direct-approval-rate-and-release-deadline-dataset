(1 inline comment)

Change looks good to me; works as expected on probes,functions and tapsets. Just a minor comment.

Line:470, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/editors/stp/STPCompletionProcessor.java -> This condition is a duplicate of the previous one.
