DESCRIPTION

RPM: createrepo tooltips and multiple imports

Added tooltips in the second createrepo project wizard page to help the
user what the required fields are.

Allowed multiple RPM imports in the Repository page. There is a current
bug where FileDialog will only return the first RPM's directory and assume
that all the other selected RPMs come from there (reproduce  using "Search").

Nice.. just a few notes.

Line:96, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.createrepo/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/createrepo/wizard/CreaterepoNewWizardPageTwo.java -> Ah I see.. Could you add the same tooltips to the labels ? I was hovering over the label instead of the text field.

Line:288, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.createrepo/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/createrepo/form/ImportRPMsPage.java -> Is the if really needed ? wont the loop just not get executed when files.length = 0 ?

Line:298, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.createrepo/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/createrepo/form/ImportRPMsPage.java -> I was going to suggest moving this inside the loop but the refreshTree is too inefficient. Perhaps in a future patch get ride of the removeAll and the loops inside addTreeItem. You can use hash maps to avoid a blanket clear and iterating over items to find existing strings. In that patch change this to just add the item instead of refreshing the tree. This is OK for this patch.

Line:37, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.createrepo/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/createrepo/messages.properties -> For some reason I don't see the tooltips in wizard page.
