DESCRIPTION

RPM: createrepo tooltips and multiple imports

Added tooltips in the second createrepo project wizard page to help the
user what the required fields are.

Allowed multiple RPM imports in the Repository page. There is a current
bug where FileDialog will only return the first RPM's directory and assume
that all the other selected RPMs come from there (reproduce  using "Search").
