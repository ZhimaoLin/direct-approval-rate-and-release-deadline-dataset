Patch Set 1: Verified+1 IP-Clean+1

The "Add context" option is correctly greyed out with LTTng 2.4~pre.

However, since that option is gone for good, wouldn't it be better to remove it altogether from the menu (and only display it for LTTng 2.0 and 2.1)? Right now, the user might wonder if he needs to do something with his session to make that option available.

Yes, it would be possible. However, the change would be more involving because I need to implement a property tester. I'll see what I can do.
