DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix visibility warning with TmfRequestExecutor

TmfDataProvider.fExecutor is protected, but TmfRequestExecutor
is not part of the public API. This means any class from another
plugin extending TmfDataProvider couldn't access the fExecutor.

Solve this by making the fExecutor field private, and supplying
protected access methods.
