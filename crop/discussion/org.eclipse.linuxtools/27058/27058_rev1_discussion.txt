DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make statistics analysis not automatic

it becomes important that the analysis is optional.

This makes sense, however should it run the analysis if the view is merely opened, instead of focused? Now if somebody switches to the stats view, they have to wait for the WHOLE trace to be read through again. You could still completely close the view if you this analysis to be skipped.

Line:432, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> you could do

  for (TmfStatisticsModule module : fTrace.getAnalysisModulesOfClass(TmfStatisticsModule.class)) {
    module.schedule();
  }

I was wondering if we should do a module.waitForInitialization() in here too, but it's done further before we do queries, so it should be fine. And doing it here causes a deadlock....

Line:432, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> This patch does more or less that. It runs the analysis if the view is opened even when it's not in focus. Except if the view was never focused, then it was never instantiated so it will not run the analysis. We don't think this is a good behavior; it should run the analysis whenever the view is in the workbench. To achieve that, we might want to convert the statistics into a proper analysis output and add support for better control of when an analysis should be scheduled at the analysis framework level.

Abandoned

Will be done later with a different approach, maybe.
