DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Allow the experiment to have a state system

Some modifications were required for an experiment itself to have a state
system.  Maybe a more general approach would be required instead of those
very local changes, so that experiments can have the same behavior and
functionnalities as the traces.

Also include unit tests of the functionnality developed by Alexandre
Montplaisir.
