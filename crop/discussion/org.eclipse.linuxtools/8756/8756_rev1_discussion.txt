DESCRIPTION

Support for multiple events for same timestamp at checkpoint

If a trace has multiple events with the same timestamps before
a checkpoint and at the checkpoint, the seek to this timestamp 
used to return the event at the checkpoint. The implementation
was changed so that the first event in the trace with this 
timestamp is returned.
