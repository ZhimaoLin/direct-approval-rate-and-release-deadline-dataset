Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

I have not checked out if this patch actually fixes the bug, but it seems like a legit solution.

I just had a simple comment in the code :)

Line:950, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> I am not sure of the efficiency of the remove(0) operation on ArrayLists.
Wouldn't LinkedList provide better performance?

Patch Set 3: Fails

(3 inline comments)

Does not fix the problem when entry is expanded by ENTER key while time graph viewer has focus.

I will submit new version as it is too late for non-committer patches for Kepler release.

Line:374, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> not necessary to do this at collapse

Line:408, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> need to synchronize in this case also (pressing ENTER to expand entry when time graph has focus)

Line:957, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> not necessary to do this recursively, the deeper levels will get fixed as they are expanded
