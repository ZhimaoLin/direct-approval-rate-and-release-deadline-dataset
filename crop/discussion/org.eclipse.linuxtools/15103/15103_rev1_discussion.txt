DESCRIPTION

lttng: add cpu usage per process

This feature requires a kernel trace with LTTng with the
scheduler sched_switch event enabled.

Big thanks to Liana Berg for a great job cleaning this up.

It does not compile since manifest.mf needs to have ui.tests it it. I think this is a problem.

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> keep this!
