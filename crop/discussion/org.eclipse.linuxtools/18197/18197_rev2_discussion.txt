DESCRIPTION

RPM: createrepo new project wizard

Add new project wizard. Creating a createrepo project will initialize
the repodata folder with an empty repomd.xml file. For now this file has
no special editor, but will be used as the file to edit the RPMs to
create a repository for.

The project will also update the RPM list stored in the project preferences
that the plugin will use to execute the command with.

Some constants and messages are not being used yet, but will be added in
very soon.
