Patch Set 3:

Removed most of the unused messages, as well as the project preference initialization. Also made the default file become the .repo instead of the repomd.xml file, because it makes more sense to edit.

Line:43, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.createrepo/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/createrepo/wizard/CreaterepoNewWizardPageOne.java -> Override that simply calls super is not needed, right?

Line:46, rpm/pom.xml -> Please don't enable it in the default build. We would do that once 2.2 branches.
