DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add functions to verify if events are present in a CTF Trace

These functions verify whether one, some or all events are present in the
metadata of a CTF trace.  It is useful to verify the presence of events
before doing an analysis that requires them.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Looks good. Eventually we could move at least hasEvents up to ITmfTrace.

+1 from me, Matthew will probably want to look at it. I checked again, the deadline for non-contributor contribs is this Friday after all, so we should merge it before then if we want it in Kepler!
