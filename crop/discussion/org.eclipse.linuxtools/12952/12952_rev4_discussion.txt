DESCRIPTION

before doing an analysis that requires them.

It will be in 2.1 after all. We'll wait until 2.0 is released before we merge it anyway, since we should setup the baseline and stuff first.

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Did Ctrl+Shift+O remove this line? It shouldn't... it normally separates imports from java.* and from other stuff.

Line:318, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> will have to xxx@xxx.xxx 2.1

Line:338, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> 2.1
