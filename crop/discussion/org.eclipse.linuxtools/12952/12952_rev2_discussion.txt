(6 inline comments)

Some style comments, otherwise looks fine. Would be nice to have an explanation, in the commit message for instance, what this is for.

Line:320, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> eventName. Sonar would actually complain ;)

Line:339, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> You can use for-each for arrays too,

  for (String name : names) {

Line:356, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Perhaps this should be called hasAtLeastOneEvent or hasOneAmongst or something of the like, to make it clearer.

Line:357, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> for (String name : names) here too

Line:360, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTraceTest.java -> My formatting-OCD tells me there should be spaces before and after the {Â }

Line:363, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTraceTest.java -> here too
