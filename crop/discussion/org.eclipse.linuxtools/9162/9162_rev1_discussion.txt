I'm fine with bumping the parent poms but the actual bundles/features poms should be bumped on their own based on changes, right?

Yes, only the parent pom versions should change.  Plugin and feature versions are independent.  I changed all those I caught the maven job fooling around with back to there version (e.g. it tried to change all features/plug-ins with version 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT).  If you see something I missed, feel free to point it out.

This looks fine to me. It seems to change just the pom modules to 2.0.0 and just the parent pom reference in the other packaging types. The lttng folder already seems to be at 2.0.0.
