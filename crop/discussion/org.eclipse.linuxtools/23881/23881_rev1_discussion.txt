DESCRIPTION

tmf: Avoid unnecessary trace type selection during drag & drop

In some cases of drag & drop the trace type id of the target resource is
already known (set during the copy/link of the source resource, or if
the source is a trace in the same project).

In that case the trace type id should be used for refreshing the trace
type of the target element, instead of selecting the trace type by
validating the trace against all known trace types.

I didn't have enough trace types loaded to make a difference, but it sill works as expected.
