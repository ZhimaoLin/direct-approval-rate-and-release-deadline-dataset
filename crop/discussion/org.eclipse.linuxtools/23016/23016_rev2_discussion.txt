DESCRIPTION

Systemtap & RPM: Stabilize SWTBot tree tests.

SWTBot sometimes fails when expanding tree items directly, so
use textual "search" features instead to reveal desired tree
items in any tests that look for tree nodes.

Looks good. Just a small issue.

Line:128, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/test/swtbot/TestCreateSystemtapScript.java -> This code is the same as in CreaterepoDeltaPropertyPageTest.java. Perhaps it should be moved somewhere where it can be reused. Also, to further promote reuse add a little comment about what the condition does.

Line:128, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/test/swtbot/TestCreateSystemtapScript.java -> I agree, but right now there isn't a location I could put this without creating project dependencies between Stap & RMP. Like we discussed, a shared "SWTBot Test Utils" package/project for all of Linuxtools could be useful for cases like this.

Line:128, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/test/swtbot/TestCreateSystemtapScript.java -> That is true. Lets look into creating a shared location for things like this.
