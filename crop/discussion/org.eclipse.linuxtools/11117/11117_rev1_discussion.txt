displayed in the SystemTap Dashboard, and IDE perspectives. Icons should
also be part of the build.

Patch Set 1:

I've noticed that this is causing some strange errors, regarding not being able to find some action sets, but I've seen similar problems before this patch as well so I'm not sure how related it is. Things seem to work as expected in a clean workspace.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Given that actionsets are deprecated, we should stick to the command extension point and use visiblewhen to do what we need. Thanks Sami.
