DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add method to get traces with build thread in Time graph view

This new method returns the traces for which a build thread will be started
in the abstract time graph view. This will allow a time graph view displaying
results from an experiment to override this method so that only one build
thread for the experiment starts.
