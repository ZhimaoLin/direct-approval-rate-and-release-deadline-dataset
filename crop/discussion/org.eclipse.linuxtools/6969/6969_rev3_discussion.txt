DESCRIPTION

tmf: Drop generics from ITmfTrace and TmfExperiment

Most of the generics are redundant now that we have interfaces.
In this case, the ITmfEvent type is always implied.

Lots of lines affected, but most of it is just removing the
stuff in brackets.

Fixes bug #382905

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I think it's in good shape for review now.
