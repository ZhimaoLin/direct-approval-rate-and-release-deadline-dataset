One minor comment.

Fixes 3 more CTF tests, that's always good.

However, just to be sure, this means the CTF reading library will support "traces with no content but a packet size", but they will still fail validation in TMF du to "Trace has no events". Correct?

Patch Set 2:

This should not affect empty trace behabiour. As far as I know, a trace with no events or data is a trace in name only.
