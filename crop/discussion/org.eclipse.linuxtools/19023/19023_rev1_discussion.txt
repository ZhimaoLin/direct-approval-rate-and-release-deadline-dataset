Will have to be rebased/updated, there are now new CTFReaderException that are not handled.

Line:294, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputReader.java -> It was better before. Kinda sucks that auto-format screws up marked-up text like that.

Line:439, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInput.java -> you could do a } else if { to save one indentation level

Line:440, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInput.java -> Why is this .longValue(), other cases pass an int?

Rather, the parameters are all long, and the method takes a long, so why do the other cases cast to int?

Line:391, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketReader.java -> "Empty event not allowed"

Yoda, is that you?
