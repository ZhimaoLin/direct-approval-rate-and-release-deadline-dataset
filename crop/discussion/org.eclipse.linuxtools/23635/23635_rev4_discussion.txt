DESCRIPTION

[WIP] tmf: only dispatch events to relevant event providers

When coalescing request across event providers (e.g. Experiment and
traces) then the requests done on the traces are not interested
in events from other requests. Before this patch each implementation
of handleData() had to do this.

Line:207, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/request/TmfCoalescedEventRequest.java -> we need to check if (!frequestingATrace.contains(data.getTrace() )){ populate for that type }

Line:79, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/tests/stubs/component/TmfEventProviderStub.java -> remove?
