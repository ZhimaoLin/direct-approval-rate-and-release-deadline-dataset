DESCRIPTION

tmf: only dispatch events to relevant event providers 

When coalescing request across event providers (e.g. Experiment and
traces) then the requests done on the traces are not interested
in events from other requests. Before this patch each implementation
of handleData() had to do this.

I really like where this is going, not a super fan on checking metadata, but I'm not against it.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/component/TmfEventProvider.java -> can this be final?

Line:641, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/component/TmfEventProvider.java -> double space
