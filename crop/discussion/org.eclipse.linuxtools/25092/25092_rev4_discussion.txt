Patch Set 4:

Good point, we don't have any .api_filters now, but we might add some in the future. New version only copies the files ending in ".prefs"

Imo, the feature projects don't matter as much. Those settings don't really change. And it was nice to not have to list all the directories in the script. If we add new code projects, they get handled automatically.

I did think about ctf.parser, that one has its own very permissive settings (to cope with the ugly ugly code that Antlr generates), so I think it's better to leave it alone...
