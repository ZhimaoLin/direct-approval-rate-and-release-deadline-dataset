DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move timestamps to their own package

Eventually, for trace synchronization among other things, we
will need to use trace-specific timestamp factories. It will
be much better organized if timestamps have their own package
(they are not specific to events anyway).

The trace sync/timestamp factory rework is really big, and it
probably won't make Kepler. However, doing this move right now
will allow us to introduce timestamp factories and the such
post-Kepler, without breaking the 2.0 API.
