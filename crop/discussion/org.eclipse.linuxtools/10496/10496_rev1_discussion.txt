Patch Set 1:

Some rationale behind this:

Eventually, for trace synchronization among other things, we will need to use trace-specific timestamp factories. It will be much better organized if timestamps have their own package (they are not specific to events anyway).

The trace sync/timestamp factory rework is really big, and it probably won't be in Kepler. However, if we can get this move in right now, this will allow us to introduce timestamp factories and the such post-Kepler, without breaking the 2.0 API.


Also, there might be xxx@xxx.xxx annotations. It seems every time I reload this branch and refresh Eclipse, it finds new ones...
