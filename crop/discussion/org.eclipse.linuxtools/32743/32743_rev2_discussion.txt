transient fields in the readObject method. Also added serialization unit tests.

Patch Set 2:

The way I see it, if a field can be in a initialized/uninitialized state, "having to do null checks everywhere" is actually a good thing, because everywhere you are using this field it could be in one state or another.

Sure, using an empty Collection instead of null is easier, but then you would be supposed to check for .isEmtpy() everywhere before using it. Whereas with xxx@xxx.xxx those checks are enforced by the compiler.
