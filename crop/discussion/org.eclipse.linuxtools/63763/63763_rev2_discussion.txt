DESCRIPTION

Bug 447554 - GCov not working for files linked from file system

- fix Visitor logic in GcovAnnotationModel.java so that it handles
  the case where the link is actually a parent directory
- when the link is a parent directory, a file does not have the
  isLinked attribute set on and so we must figure this out by
  saving the last linked directory we found
