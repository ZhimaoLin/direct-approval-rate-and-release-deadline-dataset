It's ok, it works.  But I only have one view on which to really test it, the Control Flow View.  Does it make sense for all views?  I'm not sure what this would do in a stack chart.

Should a view be able to decide whether they want this button or not?

Line:106, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowEntry.java -> Is this if necessary if we already requested an iterator from startTime to endTime?  Just asking...

Line:403, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> If you make another patchset, you could add a tooltip for this button to explain to the user what this does 

checkActiveButton.setToolTipText(string);

What I would prefer is if the Control Flow view could 'install' this button either by API or extension of the filter dialog. But it's probably not simple to do so.
