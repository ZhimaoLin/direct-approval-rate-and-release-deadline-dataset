DESCRIPTION

Bug 514425 - Failure to run image results in Container Not Found 

- fix DockerConnection startContainer methods to try getting
  container info before starting so that the logic can
  determine if a container is truly not found or if the
  docker client is returning due to a problem running the command
- also change the DockerException returned to include a message
  that contains the command that couldn't be run
- fix issue in DockerException whereby the end of a JSON
  message isn't matching
- fix RunImageCommandHandler to remove a run console if
  the run fails
