DESCRIPTION

tmf: Refactor resource change listener in project model

- Move resource change listener from every project element to the
project registry

- Create project in a WorkspaceModifyOperation to combine the many
resource change events into one.

- Only refresh the projects affected by the resource change event

- Update the model in the current thread on refresh

- Move the refresh from the project element to the base model element

- Refreshing the model children moved from the navigator content
provider to each specific model element

- Change getChildren from navigator content provider to simply return
the children list, that is now updated separately (as described above)

- Remove project from the registry when it is deleted

- Modify project registry to populate the model when getting a project
element for the first time

- Remove various unnecessary refresh of the model accordingly

- Do all modifications from the rename trace handler in a single
workspace modify operation

- Refresh all affected projects in the select trace type handler
