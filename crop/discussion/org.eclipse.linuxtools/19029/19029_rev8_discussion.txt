DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add support for arrays or any type.

A null pointer exception occured for events that contained an array
of something else than "int". For example, an array of struct:

fields := struct {
  ...
  struct {
    string arg_name;
    string arg_value;
  } arguments[4];
};

With this fix, all arrays of CTF types are supported.
