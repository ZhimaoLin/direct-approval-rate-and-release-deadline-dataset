DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add support for arrays or any type.

A null pointer exception occured for events that contained an array
of something else than "int". For example, an array of struct:

fields := struct {
  ...
  struct {
    string arg_name;
    string arg_value;
  } arguments[4];
};

With this fix, all arrays of CTF types are supported.

Gah, it conflicted again. This time I think it was because of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/19240/ that was merged today... That's what happens with "hot" files ;)

It was more straightforward this time so I fixed it, please take a look to make sure I didn't screw up...
