DESCRIPTION

Add 'run with chart' in run configuration

And simplify RunScriptAction et al. These can probably be simplified
further and moved to internal packages in a future patch.

Change looks good to me. I can successfully set the stap launch configuration to run with chart. Just have a couple minor comments.

Line:165, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> Braces should be used in the above if-else statement.

Line:23, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/messages.properties -> Should this be called 'Options' instead?

Line:23, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/messages.properties -> I mentioned to disambiguate stap launch configuration options from the stap global preferences.
