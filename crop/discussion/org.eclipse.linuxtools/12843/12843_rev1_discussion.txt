I personally prefer to have it not expanded, especially since I have many categories and trace types underneath. However, if the majority in team is for it I won't oppose it :-).

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I like expanded ;)

Especially since:
- This was originally reported by a *user*.
- I still think that mousewheel-scrolling is a very "easy" UI action, compared to pointing to and clicking on a small 16x16 arrow.

Ideally, maybe the last-opened sub-tree should be opened, and the other ones closed, so you get the benefits of both approaches. Like in the Eclipse Import Dialog.
