The call stack view showed incorrect stack frames because of that.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Sounds correct to maintain the iteration order the same as the insertion order.

However, the views should not rely on that particular order, because in general the insertion order is not necessarily the alphabetical or ascending order.

For instance, this will not help having the CPU numbers in the Resource View sorted in ascending order, the view would have to sort it before printing.
