DESCRIPTION

bug 408543 - Implemented first time auto-enable-checkboxes for gprof.

If the user launches gprof and it is not enabled in the options
then the user will now be prompted if he wants to have the
option enabled for him automatically.
If so, the option is enabled and project is rebuild.

Please rebase your change after pulling in the actual shared API change that got merged already.  Notice how above the fact that gerrit is posting the dependent patch in red because it is obsoleted.  It saves having to rebase the whole patch once it is ready and waiting for another rebuild.

Line:5, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This bump is not really as important as bumping up the plug-in that other folks may use.

Line:22, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> You did not bump up the version of this plug-in.  Has it already been bumped up for this release?

Line:11, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gprof/launch/GprofLaunchMessages.properties -> You have not changed this to be Red Hat per my previous comment.

Line:52, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gprof/launch/GprofLaunchMessages.properties -> gprof, not gcov

Line:58, gprof/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gprof.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gprof/launch/GprofLaunchMessages.properties -> gprof, not gcov
