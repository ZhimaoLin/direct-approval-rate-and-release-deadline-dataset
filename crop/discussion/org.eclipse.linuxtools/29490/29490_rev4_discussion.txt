DESCRIPTION

bug 408543 - Implemented first time auto-enable-checkboxes for gprof.

If the user launches gprof and it is not enabled in the options
then the user will now be prompted if he wants to have the
option enabled for him automatically.
If so, the option is enabled and project is rebuild.

Patch Set 4:

Fixed the test case that hung due to the new message in case the gprof is not enabled. 

I added code to programatically enable the option in the test case. 

tested locally with mvn install in linuxtools/gprof. Works.
