DESCRIPTION

bug 408543 - Implemented first time auto-enable-checkboxes for gprof.

If the user launches gprof and it is not enabled in the options
then the user will now be prompted if he wants to have the
option enabled for him automatically.
If so, the option is enabled and project is rebuild.
Incremented version numbers in feature and gprof.
