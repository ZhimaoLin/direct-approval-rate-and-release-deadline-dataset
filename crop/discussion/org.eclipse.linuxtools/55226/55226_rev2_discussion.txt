content.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

On Arianna Johns's advice, I'll move the validation logic outside of ImageBuild and into the Job since the logic to recursively check the directory could potentially take very long, and hang the UI.

In additional I'll add a simple check if the target folder itself is readable in the validation logic.
