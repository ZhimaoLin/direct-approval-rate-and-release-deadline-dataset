DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix exceptions in TmfTraceManagerTests

This Junit tests causes NullPointerExceptions and
IllegalStateExceptions in the TmfStatisticsModule and
TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule because the trace object is null. This
happens because the job that executes analysis was scheduled but
the acutal test case is finished. This patch fixes the time issue
in the test case and not the concurrency issue of these analysis 
modules.
