DESCRIPTION

tmf: Support for multiple state systems per trace

With the statistics-in-the-state that are coming up, the
state system won't be limited to CTF/LTTng traces anymore.

This commit reworks the state system field of CtfTmfTrace
into a map of available systems, and exposes its getter
all the way up to ITmfTrace. Now every level of trace type
can, if they want, add one or more state systems to the map.

Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Looks good, I would suggest not exposing the map, since this can lead to some people doing naughty things with the state systems, but it works and looks nice right now.
