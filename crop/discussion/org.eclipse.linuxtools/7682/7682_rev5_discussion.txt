DESCRIPTION

tmf: Support for multiple state systems per trace

With the statistics-in-the-state that are coming up, the
state system won't be limited to CTF/LTTng traces anymore.

This commit reworks the state system field of CtfTmfTrace
into a map of available systems, and exposes its getter
all the way up to ITmfTrace. Now every level of trace type
can, if they want, add one or more state systems to the map.

v2: Don't expose the entire Map, only provide a method to
    retrieve from it.

Good call Matthew, here's a new version that only provides a getter to the map.
