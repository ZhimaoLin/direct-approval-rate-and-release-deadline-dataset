DESCRIPTION

tmf: Expose the getStateSystem() method in ITmfTrace

With the statistics-in-the-state that are coming up, the
state system won't be limited to CTF/LTTng traces anymore.

Expose this method up to the interface so that other trace
types can potentially use a state system.

Patch Set 1:

What if a trace type has multiple state systems (e.g. for statistics and for kernel). Which one will be returned?

Maybe we should consider adding an attribute to the trace type extension point, that allows for 0..N state systems. Then we could define a state system manager that manages all state system implementations for a given trace type.
