DESCRIPTION

tmf: Expose the getStateSystem() method in ITmfTrace

With the statistics-in-the-state that are coming up, the
state system won't be limited to CTF/LTTng traces anymore.

Expose this method up to the interface so that other trace
types can potentially use a state system.

Patch Set 2:

To answer your question Meredith Scott:

The way I was seeing we would still need only 1 state system per trace, on which we would run all the get*Attributes() etc. methods. The logic to decide which state history has to receive the query would be hidden from the trace.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This is currently obsolete.

Will update after we figure out how to handle multiple state systems for one trace.
