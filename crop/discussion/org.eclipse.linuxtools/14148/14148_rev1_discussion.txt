Another step towards making the RCP a "real" application ;)

I just have a small comment about the directory name (should be lowercase).

Line:36, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/TracingRcpPlugin.java -> typically, at least on Linux, applications try to use lowercase characters only for filename or directory names. This way we're safe that there are no problems if mixing different filesystems that might not all be aware of lower/upper cases.
