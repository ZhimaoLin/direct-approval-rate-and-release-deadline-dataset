Not sure why the UST *feature* is at 1.0 (don't we want all features to follow the Linux Tools version?), but if that's really what you want, I don't mind.

UST feature is new. It wasn't delivered in 2.1. It shouldn't start be at 2.2. The same way GDB trace analysis is at 1.2. For Luna we can decide if we want to jump to 3.0 for them. But we can discuss that later.
