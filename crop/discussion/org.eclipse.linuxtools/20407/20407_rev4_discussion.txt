DESCRIPTION

tmf: Work around SWTBot test hang in the presence of GTK3

With GTK3, the SWTBot test hangs as soon as a Display.syncExec
is called on the swtbot thread (non-UI) which seems like a bug
in SWT. For now, GTK3 can be disabled by setting the SWT_GTK3
environment variable to 0. Note that for Kepler GTK2 is still
used by default so this is not a problem.
