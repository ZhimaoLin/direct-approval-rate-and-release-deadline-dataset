DESCRIPTION

Move the Linux Path extension point to the core plugin.

There was a wild mixture between the core and ui plugin and each of them
has the plugin id of the other on hardcoded. With this change things are
becoming saner with only the ui plugin knowing about the core but not
vice-versa.

This change is fine with me. Just a small issue to address regarding API annotations.

Line:14, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tools/launch/core/LaunchCoreConstants.java -> As part of a public API, this needs to have xxx@xxx.xxx tag (I guess 2.0). The bundle itself is already at 2.0.
