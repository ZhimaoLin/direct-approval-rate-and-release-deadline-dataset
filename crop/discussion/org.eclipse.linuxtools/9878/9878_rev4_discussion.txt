DESCRIPTION

Move the Linux Path extension point to the core plugin.

There was a wild mixture between the core and ui plugin and each of them
has the plugin id of the other on hardcoded. With this change things are
becoming saner with only the ui plugin knowing about the core but not
vice-versa.

Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

This change looks fine to me. It'll remove the need to have core referencing ui's plugin id.
