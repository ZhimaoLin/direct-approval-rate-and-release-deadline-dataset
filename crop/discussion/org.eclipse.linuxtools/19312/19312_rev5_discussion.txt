Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Try to make full sentence.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> api -> API   it's not a word.

Line:347, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> In this case, "recursively" and "structs" are misleading us.
