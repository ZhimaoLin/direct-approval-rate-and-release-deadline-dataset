DESCRIPTION

ctf: more restrictive parameters accepted as sequence lengths

This patch also changes the API of DeclarationScope to be more clearly named.

Some comments. The formatting/renaming changes could have been in a separate patchset, it's really borderline here.

File Comment: lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> The auto-formatter changes in here are also part of another patch. Whichever gets merged first, the other one will have to be rebased.

Line:1156, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> As mentioned in a previous patchset, "isSigned" is clearer than "isUnsigned", so you don't end up with double negatives. And the return clause is more straightforward.

Line:25, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> Wrap this comment

In fact it should be part of the class javadoc instead.
