DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make CtfTmfTrace AutoCloseable

While we won't be able to make ITmfTrace closeable anytime soon (every
time you get a local reference to a trace, it'd expect you to close()
it, which is not what we want), CtfTmfTrace can benefit a bit from it,
as it helps pointing out some tests that are causing resource leaks.
