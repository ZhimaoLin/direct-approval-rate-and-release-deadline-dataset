DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a Double type for state values

Double has a convenient Double.NaN value that cannot be attained
by "normal" means. We'll use this as the null representation of a
DoubleStateValue.

They are stored in the history tree the same way as Long state values:
by using a fixed 64-bit entry in the Strings section. If we start
using a lot of Long and Double values, eventually it might be worth
making the "valueOrOffset" field 64-bit to save space...
