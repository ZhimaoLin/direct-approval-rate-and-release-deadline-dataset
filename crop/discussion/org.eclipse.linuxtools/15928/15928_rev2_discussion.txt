DESCRIPTION

valgrind.launch: enable warnings and fix many of them.

The BREE is bumped to 1.6, I don't consider this an api change but more
of lining up things as o.e.l.tools.launch.core which this bundle depends
on has been requiring 1.6 for very long time.
Warnings fixed are mostly NON-NLS and missing annotations.
