DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove TmfStatsUpdatedSignal

Rework the Statistics view to not need a specially-crafted signal to get
its results. Just make it spawn a thread for queries, like every other
view does. This is now easier to do, due to the fact that we can
.waitForCompletion() on the statistics analysis module object.

Line:698, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Indeed, in fact to be consistent with everywhere else, we could do throw new IllegalStateException(), because getStatistics() should never return null after we have done a waitForCompletion() (or later, waitForInitialization)

But this code here was just temporary, it gets replaced in the following patches that introduce the live reading. If for some reason we don't merge those next patches soon, I will go back and update this.
