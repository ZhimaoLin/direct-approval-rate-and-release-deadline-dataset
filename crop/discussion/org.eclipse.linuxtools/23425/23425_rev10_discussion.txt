last comment, I swear!

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigGenerator.java -> how about if( domain.isKernel() ) { blabla} if (domain.isUst...) { blablabla } ... if(domainType == null) throw bad exception?

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigGenerator.java -> right now from lttng control, can a domain type be null? It looks like the choice is made from a radio button. Is it for safety purpose?

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigGenerator.java -> Right now, the IDomainInfo interface is such that there is only the isKernel() method available, so if it's not kernel, then it means it's UST.

But LTTng also supports JUL domain that we'll eventually have to support as well. When that happens, there should probably be a getDomain method with an enumeration of domain KERNEL, UST, JUL, SOMETHINGELSE and we can do a switch case here instead. But that day... is not today... today, we ?:  (imho)
