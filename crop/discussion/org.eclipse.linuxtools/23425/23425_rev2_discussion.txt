DESCRIPTION

TMF: Generate a session configuration file from LTTng analysis requirements

The requirements must contain both the event names and the domain type. With
these, we are able to generate a minimal session configuration capable of being
loaded by LTTng with the load command.

Hi Genevieve

I understand that the XML has to be complete for a given session. However, the default values are set based on the current values of the defaults of the tracers. And from my experience, they can change from release to release and from Linux Distribution to Linux distribution. There will be differences eventually between Eclipse and the tracer. (I had the same approach at the first version of the  control view, but I changed the approach). I think the user expects, if certain parameters are not explicitly configured then the tracers default values are used. 

Eclipse should not use its own set of default values.

Hi Meredith Scott,

I agree with you, but there's only a few weeks left to the semester, and we'd like to see the student's work integrated.

I think the approach number 2 I mentioned above (no XML session file) may be the best way to go about it, at least in the short term. But I'm not sure it's fully doable in the time left. So having this XML session file with default values will allow us to test their requirement additions and see if we can generate a trace with "good-enough average case" defaults.

What do you think?
