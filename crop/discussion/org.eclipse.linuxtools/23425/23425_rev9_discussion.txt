Some comments. I made some corrections in the next patchset. We can now know the control and data url of a session so I removed that todo. Also mostly changed some ifs to ?: notation

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/session/SessionConfigGenerator.java -> Isn't there also a java domain? In that case, it is wrong to assume if it is not kernel it is UST.

But then I guess we would have to update the IDomainInfo interface because that one assumes there is only kernel and UST. So we'll leave a todo here.

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/core/tests/session/SessionConfigGeneratorTest.java -> Is it me or you do not use the requirements at all? Are they left overs from before?

I guess the missing glue is to put those requirements in a session.
