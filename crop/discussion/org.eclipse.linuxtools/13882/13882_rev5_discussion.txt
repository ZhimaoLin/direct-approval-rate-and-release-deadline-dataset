Some formalities to change

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The commit message needs extended. The first line should give a short statement with reference to the bugzilla bug e.g "Tmf: Improved TMF Request Scheduler Bug <number>". Then after an empty line you add some description of the change. BTW, you could choose to add the description in the bugzilla bug of that change.

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/request/TmfRequestExecutor.java -> Change to a more descriptive one-liner statement

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIteratorManager.java -> This change is not needed anymore because the concurrency problem in CTF was fixed by another commit
