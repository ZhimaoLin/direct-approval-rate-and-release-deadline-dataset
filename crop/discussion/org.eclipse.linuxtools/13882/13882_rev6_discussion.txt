Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

Some code review, will try it next.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit title could be more descriptive, typically starting with an action verb, like

 tmf: Introduce event request scheduler

A commit message describing the change would also be useful for such a big feature.

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfSchedulerTest.java -> Should be only 2013

Line:50, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfSchedulerTest.java -> You can use TmfTimeRange.ETERNITY directly, it's already a static final constant.

Line:62, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfSchedulerTest.java -> why are you using a signal throttler? you seem to be queueing only 1 signal per test.

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIteratorManager.java -> This change should not be included anymore, the bug this worked around was fixed.

Line:141, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/component/TmfEventThread.java -> Should be called isPaused() to match the field name.
