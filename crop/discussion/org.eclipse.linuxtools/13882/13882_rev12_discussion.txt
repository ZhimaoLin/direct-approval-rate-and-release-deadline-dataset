DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce a scheduler for event requests

The request scheduler will increase the responsiveness of user actions.
It works with 5 slots with a specific time. It has 4 slots for
foreground
requests and 1 slot for background requests, and it passes through all
the
slots (foreground first and background after).

Example: if we have one foreground and one background request, the
foreground
request will be executed four times more often than the background
request.
