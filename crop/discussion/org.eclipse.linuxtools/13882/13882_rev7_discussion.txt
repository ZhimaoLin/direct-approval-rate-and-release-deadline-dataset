DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Introduce event request scheduler

The request scheduler will increase the responsiveness of user actions.
It work with 5 slots with a specific time. It has 4 slots for foreground
request and 1 slot for background request and it passes through all the
slot (foreground first and background after). Example : if we have one
foreground and one background request, the foreground request will be
execute four time more than the background request.

Patch Set 7:

I just would like to suggest some more test cases for the new scheduler. One thing would be good if you could actually test that the scheduling algorithm is working as expected. The test in TmfSchedulerTests verify that all requests are finished with the correct number of events read as well as that they are finished in the correct order (e.g. short foreground request finishes before a long one). However, this doesn't guarantee that the scheduling is working as intended. I think that there should be a test that runs multiple foreground requests and at least 2 background requests in parallel. In this test the requests store the requestID+ExectionType of the current active request and verify at the end that the correct order is stored: e.g. FORE_1, FORE_2, FORE_1, FORE_2 BACK_3 FORE_1, FORE_2, FORE_1, FORE_2 BACK_4 FORE_1, FORE_2, FORE_1, FORE_2 BACK_3 FORE_1, FORE_2, FORE_1, FORE_2 BACK_4 and so on.

Could you please look into this?

So we don't forget.

Line:117, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfSchedulerTest.java -> The test should fail() if there is an exception.
