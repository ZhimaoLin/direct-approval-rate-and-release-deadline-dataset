DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Introduce event request scheduler

The request scheduler will increase the responsiveness of user actions.
It work with 5 slots with a specific time. It has 4 slots for foreground
request and 1 slot for background request and it passes through all the
slot (foreground first and background after). Example : if we have one

execute four time more than the background request.
