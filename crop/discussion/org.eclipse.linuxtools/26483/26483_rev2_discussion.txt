DESCRIPTION

tmf remote: Remove IRemoteSystemProxy

This interface is was only introduced for testing purposes and
therefore not needed. Use RemoteSystemProxy directly instead of the
interface. If a different implementation of a method is needed this
class can be extended and the relevant method overwritten. 

Also, removing an unnecessary interface makes it easier to maintain
the API.
