DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Support for vagrant + polkit on Linux distros.

On Linux distros, vagrant providers (eg. libvirt) might require elevated
privileges even for things like status/ssh-config, which are frequently
called. We should ship our own polkit file that authenticates the entire
session and preserves the credentials.

Patch Set 4: Verified-1

This is ending up to be trickier than I thought.

Elevating permissions to 'root' for /usr/bin/vagrant means that everything is run as root and even looking for the user's VMs fails because 'root' wouldn't have had any. vagrant istelf doesn't run as root, but elevates to root only for certain operations, which are still done in the context of the regular user.

However, I've noticed that at least on Fedora, placing oneself under the 'libvirt' group completely fixes this issue, so this change may not be necessary at all.

Abandoned

No longer necessary since a user group will exist to enable elevated permissions.
