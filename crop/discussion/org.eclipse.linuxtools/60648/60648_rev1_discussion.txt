DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Support for vagrant + polkit on Linux distros.

On Linux distros, vagrant providers (eg. libvirt) might require elevated
privileges even for things like status/ssh-config, which are frequently
called. We should ship our own polkit file that authenticates the entire
session and preserves the credentials.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

There are some issues here :

- Forgot to get rid of the 'vagrant' file, it'll be generated by install.sh, so should not be added
- How do we 'know' if a user needs this ? A user could have /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/*libvirt*.policy files, but be using virtualbox as the backend and if they did call the install.sh script, they'd be having to enter their password when it isn't necessary.

If we can't predict when the user might need it, then the best we can do is inform the user on startup that if they're getting excessive prompts for passwords, then they should run the script. Of course for distros like Fedora where we know libvirt+polkit would be the default, it would be the responsibility of packagers to improve that experience by making sure things are setup correctly.
