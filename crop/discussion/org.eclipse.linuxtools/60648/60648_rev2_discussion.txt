DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Support for vagrant + polkit on Linux distros.

On Linux distros, vagrant providers (eg. libvirt) might require elevated
privileges even for things like status/ssh-config, which are frequently
called. We should ship our own polkit file that authenticates the entire
session and preserves the credentials.
