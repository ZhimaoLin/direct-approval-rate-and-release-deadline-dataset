This looks fine to me, and should be fixed. Just some issues I found in the ui.tests manifest.

Line:6, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't think this should be re-exported by the ui.tests. I can't see anything particularly bad since we wouldn't ship it, but it shouldn't be listed.

Line:8, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This would seem to be listed twice now ? It's already in the list.
