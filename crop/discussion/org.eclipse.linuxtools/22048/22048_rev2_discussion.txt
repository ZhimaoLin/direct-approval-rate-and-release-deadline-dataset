(com.google.common.base.Strings among other things). Maven had it
covered already, but building it from within Eclipse was broken.

Patch Set 2:

Removed the change to the target definition, this had nothing to do with the Wikitext plugin, which already pulls the guava jar when installing it within Eclipse.
