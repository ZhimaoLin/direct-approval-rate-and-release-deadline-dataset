DESCRIPTION

Save and restore current time and range when switching traces

- ITmfTrace augmented with methods to return current time and current
range.
- TmfTrace implements the new interface.
- TmfTrace provides a method to return the default initial range offset
that can be overridden.
- TmfTrace initializes the time range when the first event is parsed.
- TmfTrace updates the current time and range on time and range synch
signals. The current time and range are only updated if they intersect
with the trace range.
- ControlFlowView uses the trace's current time and range when a trace
is selected.
- ResourcesView uses the trace's current time and range when a trace is
selected.
- HistogramView uses the trace's current time and range when a trace is
selected.
- TmfStatisticsViewer uses the trace's current range when a trace is
selected.
- TmfUml2SDSyncLoader uses the trace's current range when moving to a
new page.
- TimeChartView uses the trace's current time when a trace is selected.

Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

- When opening a view after a trace was open then the current time/ range is not correct. (e.g. Control Flow View, Resources View, Sequence Diagram)

- When opening an Experiment the initial time range is 0. See value in Histogram View

Line:461, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Use constant from ITmfTimestamp for nano seconds instead of hardcoded value of -9
