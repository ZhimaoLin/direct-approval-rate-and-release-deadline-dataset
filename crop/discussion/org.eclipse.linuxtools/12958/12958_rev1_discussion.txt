Patch Set 1: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

The finish button is not enabled after selecting a project when initially no project is selected

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "project folder" instead of just "folder"

Line:106, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/ImportTraceWizardPageOptions.java -> Set the title of the page so that the user knows what to do. Also other pages don't have a proper title. Their title shows only the default which is "File System"

Patch Set 1:

Just to reply, yes, you cannot finish until you pick a folder to import to. 
the titles will be in another patch, it's another bug. 
The warning message is up.
