DESCRIPTION

Fix BZ #389778 by tracking initialization state of all tabs.

The underlying LaunchConfigurationTabGroupViewer is internal and does
not have the API to add/remove tabs after being initialized. It is
unaware of any tabs added/removed and will call performApply() even if
they are still initializing. If performApply() is called during
initialization the configuration will be corrupted. It is necessary to
track the state of initialization for each tab to determine whether
performApply() can be safely called.

Line:77, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/ProviderOptionsTab.java -> If the tabs are being destroyed, then all the providerids they represent should be removed from the initialized list as well.

Line:44, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/ProviderOptionsTab.java -> This is the right thing to do. Since we treat a non-existent entry, and "false" as meaning the same thing (not initialized / in the process of being initialized), it shouldn't make a difference, but clearing out old data will probably keep things consistent. An initialize.clear() should do the trick.
