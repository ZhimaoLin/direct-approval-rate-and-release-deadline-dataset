Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

Code style fixes needed.

I'm not a big fan of the pre-computed flippedMask, it makes all the code heavier (and if a caller calls un-matched masks and flippedMasks, we're in for more OutOfMemory errors since we don't do any checks).

But the rest of the patch is pretty good, good improvement!

Line:140, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/Definition.java -> You can remove this method since we've added it in 2.2, no release contained it.
