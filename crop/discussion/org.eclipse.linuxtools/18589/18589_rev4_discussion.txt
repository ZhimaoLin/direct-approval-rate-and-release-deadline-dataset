Patch Set 4:

Why was this merged before we finished integrating the CTF Testsuite? Next time will I have to pre-emptively NAK it, like you did with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/19001/ ?

Patch Set 4:

You are free to do so on any patch you feel needs this, I will, as always, abide by the NAK. I only wish for the best code to enter in the project, but I feel that this patch is unrelated to the CTF regression tests, as http://git.efficios.com/?p=ctf.git;a=blob;f=common-trace-format-specification.txt;h=830699ff130ac4757e003d70b71b312f1f8ca2a0;hb=9f04b9f6281cda27010f25816a66df7700cd0a9a#l165 "Alignments must be powers of two" so it does respect the standard.
