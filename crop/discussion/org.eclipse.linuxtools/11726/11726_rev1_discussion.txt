Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks good but should the top level directory be renamed as well ? In the future it would be confusing for someone looking for bundle org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.structures to find it in directory org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.structures.
