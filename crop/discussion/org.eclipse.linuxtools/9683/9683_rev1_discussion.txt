Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Samples are properly display in the resulting perf tree view. However, on events with small sample sizes, samples displayed on respective symbols are not properly distributed.

I don't think anything can be done about this. From what I can see, this is exactly the data that the perf tool displays. Perhaps it's a bug that may need to be filed upstream.
