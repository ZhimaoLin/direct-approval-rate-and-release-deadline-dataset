Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks good!

I found out some tweaks we could make:
- Not automatically select the text box when the row is clicked on (only when the user clicks on the text box itself).
- The right-click -> Restore Default Value option doesn't make much sense, since we can't change the value from the default. It could be removed.

But those changes would be in the ReadOnlyTextPropertyDescriptor itself, so would be independent of this patch here.
