Please see my comment regarding documenting method logic in stone.  Please fix all of these where ever you have done this.  For example, you should not be documenting that a getChildren() method returns null because there are no children.  A class may inherit from this and override the method so now the documentation is untrue.  As well, someone may change the method implementation and fail to notice that the documentation has said it is always returning null.  Describe what a method is supposed to be doing (e.g. Get children elements).  In the return say: return array of children elements or null if there are no children

This will be true no matter what the implementation does.

Please also fix any parameters that do not have a description.

Line:39, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/ui/model/UiModelError.java -> The description of the method should describe what the method is for...e.g. Get children elements.  The return statement should say return array of children or null.   As a general rule, the docs shouldn't be hard-wiring any design decisions because later on somebody could change the method and the docs will be wrong.  Also imagine a class inherits this one and implements getChildren().  The docs will say it is returning null and has no children.
