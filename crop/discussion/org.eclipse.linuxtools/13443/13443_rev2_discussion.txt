Line:426, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/ScrollView.java -> This code is never executed. Widget.dispose() is not called automatically and recursively by the platform, unlike WorkbenchPart.dispose(). It is meant to be called explicitly when one wants to programatically dispose a widget. The code should be put in a DisposeListener, unless you call it explicitly from the DisposeListener of the subclasses (SDWidget & TimeCompressionBar).

Line:878, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/ScrollView.java -> When you close the view the ScrollView control could be disposed but not the display. Better to check if scrollView.isDisposed.
