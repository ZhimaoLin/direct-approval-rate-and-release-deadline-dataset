Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid.xml -> Why is the path needed at each level? Could we have just <line> and then many entries each with their path?

In this case maybe <line> should be more like <subtree> or something?

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid.xml -> Actually, the line path is the full (base) path to fetch, and then for each level, we check if there is an entry that corresponds and if so, add and process the entry.

So you can have

<line path="a/*/*/*/b/*">

<entry path="a/*">[...]</entry>

<entry path="a/*/*/*/b/*">[...]</entry>

</line>

And the leaf entries would go under their corresponding a/* entry. It's much easier to process this way and you somehow force all entry elements to have a path under the base path (otherwise, it will only be ignored). And the order in which the entries are entered is not important.

Otherwise, what would you do if you have this?

<line>

<entry path="a/*">[...]</entry>

<entry path="c/*/d/*/e/*">[...]</entry>

<entry path="c/*/d/*">[...]</entry>

</line>

Another suggestion

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid.xml -> May be another method is to have this :

<line path="a/*" >
     <display>
     <.....>

     <line path="*/*/b/*">
         <display>
         <....>
      </line>
<line>

So for classic use case we have just :

<line path="CPUs/*">
     <display>
     <....>
</line>

And for more complexe use case (BTF) we :

<line path="Task/Core*">
     <display type="self">

     <line path="RUNNABLE*">
         <display type="self">
     </line>
</line>
