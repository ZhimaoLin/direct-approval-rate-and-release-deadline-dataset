Small comment, will try it out more. Also, why is test_valid.xml not moved to its own directory too?

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> You could add, inside the loop, some filters to make sure you only check the .xml files (!f.isDirectory(), f.getPath().endsWith("xml") etc.) In case some extra files end up in that directory you don't want it to blow up the test.

Also, might not have to be done right now since there is only one file, but if it's planned to have many of them, with a test like it will fail as soon as it hits a failure. A nice thing to have is parameterized tests, so that it generates a JUnit test for every file. That way it goes through all of them and reports which ones failed. See CtfTestSuiteTests for an example.

One small comment (static final!). With that fixed, consider my +1 on this patch. I didn't want to push to not refresh the previous patches in the branch, which should go in soon.

If you're looking for things to do, you could do the parametrized tests thing right now, it would save time in the long run. Or if you want you can push this as is, and change it later.

we'd need a mnemonic or something to help remember the order...

I'll just change the static final, but I'll keep in mind the rest for the upcoming patch series (the one that will support text in intervals and tooltips and a lot more state system data).

Line:43, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> SF => San Francisco!

Any game starting with sf?

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> Indeed parameterized tests might be good. But I'll do that in other patches, when more files will come. It will also be useful for the valid files, not just invalid.
