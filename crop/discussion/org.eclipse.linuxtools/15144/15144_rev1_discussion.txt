Could you please look at file-open 13863, I think it's a better place to put displayError()

Patch Set 1:

Or maybe you could merge this patch with yours, as the reason I did this is that I need to display an error message in more than just opening traces and experiments.

It could be used by all UI (Eclipse only or RCP too?)
