DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix SD unit test with GTK3

Using a very recent Eclipse integration build (which now uses the GTK3 SWT
backend), one of the Sequence Diagram unit tests fails because of invalid
parameter values.

This patch fixes the test by clamping the height/width area values to 1.
Exceptions can then only be thrown for run-time problems (like getDisplay()
returning null), so we let those go as runtime exceptions.

I got the same error in TimeCompressionBar.java:362

Perhaps we should hold off on this for now. It feels like this might be a bug with SWT-GTK3 since I see many visual bugs with controls shrunk to 0 size then getting resized when the parent shell is resized.
