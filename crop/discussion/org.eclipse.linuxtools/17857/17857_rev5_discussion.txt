DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix SD unit tests with GTK3

Using a very recent Eclipse integration build (which now uses the GTK3 SWT
backend), two of the Sequence Diagram unit tests fail because of invalid
parameter values.

This patch fixes the test by clamping the height/width area values to 1.
Exceptions can then only be thrown for run-time problems (like getDisplay()
returning null), so we let those go as runtime exceptions.
