if you commit after https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/18908/, and my requested fix. This patch-set could be simplify.

Line:124, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDefinition.java -> If you fix the bug I found in the other patch-set.
The two cases  length > 32 and "else" are the same and useless.

And as the previous "if" throw an exception, just remove the "if".
