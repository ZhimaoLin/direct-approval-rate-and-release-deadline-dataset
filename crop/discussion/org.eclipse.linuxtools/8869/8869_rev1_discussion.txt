Patch Set 1:

All new tests pass. However, testing auto-completion manually, it appears that the completion data is incomplete in regards with what is available in static_prope_list.properties. For example, there is no "process.thread", "process("PATH").thread", "process(PID).thread" completion proposals when using the prefixes "process.", "process("PATH").", "process(PID)." respectively.
