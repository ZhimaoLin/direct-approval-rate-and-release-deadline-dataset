DESCRIPTION

ctf: Re-indent the CTF grammar to ease reading.

This patch-set does not change any rules.
I tried to apply the same Java indent rules.
A few rules are still badly indented.

I don't get why you keep all enter/exit debugging in the grammar.
You have antlr option to do this:

-trace	 have all rules call traceIn/traceOut.
-traceParser	 have parser rules call traceIn/traceOut.
-traceLexer	 have lexer rules call traceIn/traceOut.
-traceTreeParser	 have tree walker rules call traceIn/traceOut.
