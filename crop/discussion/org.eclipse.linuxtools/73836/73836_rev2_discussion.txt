DESCRIPTION

Bug 494776: Don't set auth credentials for daemon's default registry.

When no registry account has been set, commands are expected to run
against the Docker daemon's default registry in an unauthenticated
manner. This removes support for matching the daemon's default registry
with the first auth entry in any 'config.json' file that's discovered.
