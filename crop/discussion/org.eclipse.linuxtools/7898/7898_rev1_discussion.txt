DESCRIPTION

Re-write of systemtap probe and function parsers

This commit alters how eclipse finds the probe points and functions
that systemtap has available to users and developers.  By leverging
stap -L '**' we are able to simply the probe point parsing process.
Probe points remain clickable to enter into the .stp file under
development and java doc continues to appear listing related variables.
For probing systemtap functions, stap -v -p1 -e 'probe begin{}' is
still used, however, a second uncompressed pass is not required to
list all available functions that systemtap intends a typical user
to use.  Functions starting with _ or __ are intended to be internal
to the tapset.  Functions are now listed in alphabetical order
instead of by tapset file to make them easier to discover/locate.

I've confirmed this works, and produces the probe/function views properly. Please address the minor issues. Also confirm that you are the author of this contribution and have permission to submit it under the EPL.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please add a period here.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you add a blank line in between the sentences of this block that mention a new feature/change ? I think it would become easier to read. I think this block can be split into 2 or 3 paragraphs.
