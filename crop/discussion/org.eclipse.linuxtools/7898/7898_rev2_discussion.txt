DESCRIPTION

Re-write of systemtap probe and function parsers.

This commit alters how eclipse finds the probe points and functions
that systemtap has available to users and developers.

By leveraging stap -L '**' we are able to simplify the probe points
parsing process.  Probe points remain clickable to enter into the
.stp file under development and java doc continues to appear listing
related variables.

For probing systemtap functions, stap -v -p1 -e 'probe begin{}' is
still used, however, a second uncompressed pass is not required to
list all available functions that systemtap intends a typical user
to use.  Functions starting with _ or __ are intended to be internal
to the tapset.  In addition, functions are now listed in alphabetical
order, instead of by tapset file, to make them easier to
discover/locate.
