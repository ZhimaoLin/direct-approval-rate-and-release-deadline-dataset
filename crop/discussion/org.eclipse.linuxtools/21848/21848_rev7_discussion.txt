DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Make updates to toolbar buttons.

1) Group together all Systemtap-related workbench toolbar
buttons in their own toolbar.

2) Remove unused components from ui.ide/plugin.xml.

3) Rework "Import Tapset" to use a Command rather than a
(deprecated) Action Set.

4) Change the "Import Tapset" and "Import Data Set" commands
to be enabled only when in the Systemtap IDE perspective.
