DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use explicit annotations in ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems

It seems Eclipse and Maven don't handle nested null annotation
contexts the same way (@NonNullByDefault -> @Nullable xxx@xxx.xxx
To keep both happy, just remove xxx@xxx.xxx and use
annotations everywhere in this file. There's acutally only one extra
place that needs it...

Eventually everything should move to package-level annotations.
