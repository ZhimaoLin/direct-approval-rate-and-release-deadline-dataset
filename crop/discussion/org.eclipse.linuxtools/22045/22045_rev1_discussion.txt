DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use explicit annotations in ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems

It seems Eclipse and Maven don't handle nested null annotation
contexts the same way (@NonNullByDefault -> @Nullable xxx@xxx.xxx
To keep both happy, just remove xxx@xxx.xxx and use
annotations everywhere in this file. There's acutally only one extra
place that needs it...

Eventually everything should move to package-level annotations.

Can you remind me what was wrong? Was it breaking the build under certain conditions?

See commit 5aceeed3

There is a difference in behavior between the Eclipse compiler and maven-tycho. The whole null-annotation thing is quite new, so it's to be expected while things are ironed out...

In the meantime, this is just a small rework (even simplification, in this case) to make sure it works in both case, while avoiding the warning in Eclipse.

I did a bit of research on the original issue. Tycho 0.19 uses JDT from Kepler SR1. A fix is available in Luna M2:

Until Tycho updates to a more recent JDT, we'll have to apply similar workarounds.
