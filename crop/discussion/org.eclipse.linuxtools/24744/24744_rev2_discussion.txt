DESCRIPTION

lttng: Updates to target definitions

- Use eclipse.platform instead of SDK since we don't need JDT, PDE, etc
This doesn't work for the 3.8 and 4.2 target because the
org.eclipse.platform.ide product fails to start (missing splash
screen?).
- Use cdt.dsf.gdb feature only since we don't need anything else from
CDT
- Add license feature (to export RCP from inside Eclipse)
- Use latest Orbit repo
