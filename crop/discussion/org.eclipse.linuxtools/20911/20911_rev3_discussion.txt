DESCRIPTION

tmf: Cleanup TmfEventProvider

* Move the fDataQueue, as well as the whole concept of queue size, to
  the test stub. it was only used by that.
* Make some protected fields private.
* Change the ArrayList of pending requests to a linked list. We never
  access a specific index directly, and insertions are faster in a
  linked list.
* Remove fireRequest() from the interface, it should only be used
  internally.
* Remove queueBackgroundRequest(), it's not used anymore (this also
  removes the need for the dispatchRequest() method).

This looks good to me, this looks like it'll make the code cleaner and memory footprint infinitesimally smaller.
