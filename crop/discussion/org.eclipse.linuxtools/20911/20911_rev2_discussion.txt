DESCRIPTION

tmf: Cleanup TmfEventProvider

* Move the fDataQueue, as well as the whole concept of queue size, to
  the test stub. it was only used by that.
* Make some protected fields private.
* Change the ArrayList of pending requests to a linked list. We never
  access a specific index directly, and insertions are faster in a
  linked list.
* Remove fireRequest() from the interface, it should only be used
  internally.
* Remove queueBackgroundRequest(), it's not used anymore (this also
  removes the need for the dispatchRequest() method).
