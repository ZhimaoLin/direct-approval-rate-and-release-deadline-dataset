The patch is an improvement but there is one case that doesn't work well with this fix: if you try to open an experiment containing a trace with unknown trace type, it will say "No trace type associated to that trace..." but there is no indication which trace is problematic and the user just tried to open an experiment so "that trace" is a bit misleading.

Thanks for the comment. I had a hard time to reproduced this. For me it was only possible to achieve this by drag&dropping a file to experiment that couldn't be associated with a valid trace type (auto-detection). 

I think the this patch go in because it fixes a common behaviour. 

The other issue you described should be handled by another patch, probably after for Luna.
