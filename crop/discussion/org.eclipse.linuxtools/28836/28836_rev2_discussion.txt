Guidelines from Richard Hughs say that we shouldn't "put the application name youâ€™re extending in the <name> or <summary> tags" [1] which I assume this is to avoid over repitition of the app name in the UI.

So I think (for example) just "GCov" or "GCov Integration" or something might be better than "Eclipse GCov" in the <name> tags.

And in the <summary> tags, just eliminating the word "Eclipse" is probably fine.

Line:10, gcov/eclipse-gcov.metainfo.xml -> This should probably be http://www.eclipse.org/linuxtools/projectPages/gcov/
