Patch Set 2:

done.

I always found prefix on variable more cryptic than useful.
This is a old coding style that came from assembly.
It's your code base ;p

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

I didn't like it at first either. :P  But after a while, seeing many

  void setter(value) {
    this.value = value
  }

or more often in constructors, where you'd end up mixing up "field1" and "this.field2" depending on the parameter names, I ended up preferring "fField1", "fField2", which will never clash with parameter names.
