DESCRIPTION

tmf: Replace "matches" with "find" for TextTrace.java

This means that if a pattern is not 100% correct, it will
fail to read an event. However, performance should increase.

If we have for example a pattern (\\d\\d)\s(\S+)
and "123 blabla" will work with matches(), returning "23 blabla"
but will fail with find().
