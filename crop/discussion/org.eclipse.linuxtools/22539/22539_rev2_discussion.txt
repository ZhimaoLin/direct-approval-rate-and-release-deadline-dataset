DESCRIPTION

tmf: Replace "find" with "matches" for TextTrace.java

This means that if a pattern is not 100% correct, it will
fail to read an event. However, performance should increase.

If we have for example a pattern (\\d\\d)\s(\S+)
and "123 blabla" will work with find(), returning "23 blabla"
but will fail with matches().

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

The change looks good but it needs to be tested with the problematic (slow) traces.

Patch Set 2:

Another option is to trim() the data first.
Do we want the events to parse or fail?

"Another option is to trim() the data first. Do we want the events to parse or fail?"

I'd say fail. The pattern is for the entire line as far as I understand.
