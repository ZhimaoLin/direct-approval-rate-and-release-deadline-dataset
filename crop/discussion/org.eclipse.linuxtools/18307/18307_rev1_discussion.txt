time (instead of the last event time)
- Display the time range text controls even when model has no events
- Snap selection to the end time
- Draw the delimiter to the right of the end time instead of last event
time
- Fill the area to the right of the delimiter with the background color
- Draw selection range anywhere in the histogram range regardless of

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> In my Ubuntu 12.04 machine using gtk theme it the background color is white and hence you change has no visual impact. Maybe using another color setting would be better.

Line:647, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> "width - delimiterIndex - 1": -1 instead of  instead of +1?
