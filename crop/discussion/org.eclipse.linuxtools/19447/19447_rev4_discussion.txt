Patch Set 4:

There is something wrong with the job it always fails with hudson.remoting.RequestAbortedException on one of the JUnit tests plug-ins... 

Since it seems that we won't use this solution for coalescing I won't investigate it further right now.

Abandoned

Solution not needed. Timer based coalescing is used instead
