I think that if you cannot add state values of different types, then it should not be in the interface. You could implement it (with increment) only in those classes where it makes sense, and the argument should be restricted to another object of the same class.

Instead of returning null, you should throw a StateValueTypeException.

add() makes sense, but I'm not too fond of increment(). It would encourage devs to use it instead of just incrementing an int primitive (which wouldn't create a new object every time). What's the exact need for increment()?
