Patch Set 4: Code-Review-2

aaand, after thinking about it more, turns out that doing .add() and .increment() on state values would send the wrong message to developers: such methods would imply you are modifying the current object. But state values are immutable, and those method create a *new* object whose internal value is the new expected one. So code like:

 myValue = blabla
 myValue.increment();
 doSomething(myValue);
 ...

The second line would do absolutely nothing, but that wouldn't be immediately obvious. It's slightly more verbose to do unbox + create new value, but at it's much more representative of what is actually happening.
