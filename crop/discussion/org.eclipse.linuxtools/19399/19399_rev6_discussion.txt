Patch Set 6:

Changes added in this patch set:

- During tree node interaction, use alternatives to directly expanding nodes whenever possible to avoid an SWTBot bug with expandNode.

- When deleting projects, an extra shell sometimes appears (caused by files being out-of-sync for some reason); add a check to close this shell.

- Revert GcovTestCPP.openGcovSummary to *not* test produced references.

- Remove the output messages in GcovTestC/CPP/CLibrary, since they reported test success even when they failed.

- Add some more wait conditions here and there.
