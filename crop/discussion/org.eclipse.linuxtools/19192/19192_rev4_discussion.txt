DESCRIPTION

ctf: Make CtfTmfEventFieldTest easier to maintain.

Before this patch, a test event was created by filling a buffer with 0x02
bytes. Then, 0x00 bytes were added at magic positions to terminate the
strings used in the tests. That made the code hard to read and maintain. In
particular, it was hard to add new values in the test event without breaking
the null-terminated strings. It was also hard to understand, for example, that
0x02020202 is the float 9.551467814359616E-38.

With this patch, values in the right format are added explicitly to the test
event. It's easier to understand the tests and to add values for new tests.
