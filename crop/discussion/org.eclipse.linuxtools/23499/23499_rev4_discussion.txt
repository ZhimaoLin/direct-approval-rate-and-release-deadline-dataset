I got this to work, the code looks decent. the view is very hard to understand. please update de tmf user guide on how to use this. 

example: the green + button, how do we make a new xml? why all the steps?

Some more comments.

You should add documentation to the user guide, as Matthew mentioned, but that can be done in another patch so that this patch is not dependent on the formulation of sentences ;-) The user guide is in org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/UserGuide.mediawiki.

Also, once this view is opened, if I import a new XML file, it is not shown right away, I have to close it and open it again. Ideal would be to have a listener somewhere for new files, but quick and easy solution would be to add a "refresh" button next to the "add" and "delete".

Line:14, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlExplorer/messages.properties -> add "and all its content? This operation is irreversible."

Line:9, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/plugin.xml -> Rename to something more explicit like TMF: Data-driven XML analysis (or component?)

Line:10, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/plugin.xml -> This path will have to be tested with the maven built RCP. See http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.soa.sca.core.doc%2Fhtml%2FprogrammerGuides%2FregisteringXMLcatalogEntries.html how they use the URI. 

Both ways, I think the XSD files should move to their plugin-root directory instead of deep within a package.  But that is none of your concern for now. I'll do it

Line:116, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlExplorer/XMLExplorerView.java -> What hurts though is to name a local variable starting with f, like fNodes. f stands for field, so we would expect fNodes and fChildren to be a field of the class, not a local variable. Please rename to nodes and children

Line:291, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlExplorer/XMLExplorerView.java -> Here, we should also trigger a refresh of the workspace, so the analysis that are removed are no longer shown. I can't tell you exactly how to do this. See for inspiration ImportXmlHandler in internal.tmf.analysis.xml.ui.handler, but this code works only because the selected view is the view containing the project elements. If you can't do this, add a TODO here in comments.
