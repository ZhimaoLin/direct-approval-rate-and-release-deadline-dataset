DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add vertical events (links) to time graph view

Add a new interface ILinkEvent and class TimeLinkEvent, for events that occur
between two entries instead of in one entry only.
Add the getLinkList method to AbstractTimeGraphView to get the links for a
given zoom level and other methods to propagate those changes to the time graph
control
