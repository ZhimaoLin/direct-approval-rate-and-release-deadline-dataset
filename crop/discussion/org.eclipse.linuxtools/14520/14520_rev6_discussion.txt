DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Benchmark for the request scheduler

The benchmark has three tests. The first one is the latency (time
between the creation of the request and the beginning of its execution).
The second one is the average waiting time for a request. The last one
is the total completion time.

Patch Set 6: Verified+1 Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

Just fixed a small typo.

Technically, accesses to lastBackgroundRequest and lastForegroundRequest should be protected by locks (since you could have more than one request object accessing those at the same time). But since it's just a test/benchmark, it's not as important.

Patch Set 6:

This is not critical code in any way, so I'll just push it so we can concentrate on other stuff.
