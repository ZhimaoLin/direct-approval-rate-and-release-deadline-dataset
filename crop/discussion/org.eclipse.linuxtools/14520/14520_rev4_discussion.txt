DESCRIPTION

Tmf:Benchmark for the request scheduler

The benchmark has three tests. The first one is the latency (time
between the creation of the request and the beginning of its execution).
The second one is the average waiting time for a request. The last one
is the total completion time.

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfSchedulerBenchmark.java -> You can use CtfTmfTestTraces.getTestTrace(0) to get this trace. That way we don't have to repeat the path in every single test/program that uses it (and if we ever move or renamed it, we only have to change it in one place).

It also does the initTrace() for you.
