Line:50, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpEventMatching.java -> LinkedList -> List, unless you are using LinkedList-specific methods (I admit I didn't really check).

Here too, if the lists aren't meant to be re-new'ed after being instantiated, they should be marked final.

Btw, you can write /** Javadoc comments on one line */ to save space, but it's really a matter of preference.

Line:132, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpEventMatching.java -> Would be a tad simpler to do:

for (List<ITmfEvent> list : tbl.values()) {

  count += list.size();

}

Line:149, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpEventMatching.java -> What is the "" for? Couldn't it start with "Trace "?
