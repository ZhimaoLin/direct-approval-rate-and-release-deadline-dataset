DESCRIPTION

ctf: Allow the test traces to be used by other plugins

Centralize the management of the CTF test traces by moving the
"TestParams" file to a separate, exported package.

This required fiddling with the plugin type and adding an
activator, to mimic the behavior of "tmf.core.tests" (which
is also a test plugin that exports packages).
