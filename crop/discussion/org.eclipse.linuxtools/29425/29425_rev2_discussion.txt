Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/event/matching/EventMatchingBenchmark.java -> a BeforeClass has to be static (it doesn't tell you until you actually try to run it)

I was wondering why this passed Hudson, but then remembered the perf tests don't run, yet...
