Patch Set 5: Verified-1

Rebased on the branch that switches the history builder to the analysis module (instead of the other way around). I just fixed some minor conflicts, however with the new versions (now with null analysis!), it becomes obvious where the views were doing a getStateSystem() without checking if the state system was actually built or not (checking for null). And that's in a lot of places!

I haven't touched those yet, which is why it fails to compile right now. Perhaps the views could be refatored a bit, to only get the ITmfStateSystem object once, and then re-use it (it could be saved as a class field, I assume?)
