Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> in the ControlFlowView, you replaced this by a continue; I assume continue is what we want here? (and the two returns below are wrong?)

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/ui/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> IllegalArgumentException would be more fitting

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/ui/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> annotations before keywords

But annotations are inherited now, so it might not be necessary to put them

Line:25, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> "analysis" is not very descriptive. Just like "kernel.core.stateprovider". It should be grouped under the same name, representing what analysis this actually is. And the views CFV and RV, since they are part of that analysis, could go under the same namespace. But it's kinda confusing, because we normally call it "the LTTng-kernel analysis".

We can leave it as is for now, just something to keep in mind.
