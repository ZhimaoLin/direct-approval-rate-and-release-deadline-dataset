Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Remove legacy reference. No legacy on Kepler branch

Line:259, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Trace/Experiment needs to be closed. Please add that.

Line:285, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Trace/Experiment needs to be closed. Please add that.

Line:335, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> In the whole document there is a problem with links to this chapter and to the LTTng Kernel Events Editor. One reference is with lower case, the other one is with upper case. Mabye the chapter for the LTTng Events Table should be called "LTTng Events Editor" and the TMF Events Editor should be "Events Editor". Please after your change go through all the references and make sure the right chapter is referenced.

Patch Set 6: Fails

The mediawiki file was updated, but the committed html files were not re-generated. Yeah, it's a pain...
