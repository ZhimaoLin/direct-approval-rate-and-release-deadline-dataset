The sourceTemplateFeature folder is used to specify resources that should be added as part of a generated source feature. When a feature.properties file is listed in this folder, its attributes can override those that would be normally inherited from the binary feature. Let's hold off on this until https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/linuxtools-master/1501/ succeeds.

.. Forgot to mention that the reason for removing this folder, is that we won't be needing it (our source features will get their licenses from our license feature), and because we don't define any attributes in any of the feature.properties defined in this folder.
