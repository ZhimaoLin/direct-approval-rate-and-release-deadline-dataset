DESCRIPTION

Don't hardcode the plugin ID in man-pages plugin.

The hard coded ID was incorrect (o.e.l.man versus o.e.l.man.core) so
trying to look up the bundle by it's ID fails and any contributions that
rely on this will not work correctly.

This commit also removes some non-javadoc comments from the Activator.
