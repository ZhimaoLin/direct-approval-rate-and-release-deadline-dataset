DESCRIPTION

lttng: Do not use java.io.tmpdir property (/tmp) when possible

This is problematic when multiple instances of Eclipse are running
(builds).
Instead, we can create a "temporary" folder under the Eclipse workspace
so
that each Eclipse instances are independant. This also has the advantage
of
the directory being cleared every time a mvn clean is executed or when a
JUnit launch configuration is used inside Eclipse.
