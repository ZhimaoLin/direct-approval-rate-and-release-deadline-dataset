DESCRIPTION

tmf: Specify trace env vars capabilities with an interface

Introduce a new ITmfEnvironmentVariables interface that traces can
implement when they can provide env vars. Also make the the
Enviornment Variables view use this interface, so it is not specific
to CTF traces.

Alex, I like where this is going but it needs to go more. More away from the CTF spec that is. :)

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/ITmfEnvironmentVariables.java -> Could we call it something else, like ITmfConstantVariables? env vars makes me think too much of '$ set'

I was thinking about that yesterday and I think with this change we want to be able to define trace specific properties. Currently, they are displayed in the EnvironmentsView. Later on we will add them to the Properties view. Why don't we use the IPropertySource interface directly instead of introducing a new interface?
