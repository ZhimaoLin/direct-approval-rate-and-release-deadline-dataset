DESCRIPTION

[RFC] tmf: Only expose one traceOpened/Closed method in TmfView

Make the traceOpened and traceClosed signal handlers final, and
make the loadTrace() and closeTrace() methods abstract. This
way, it's clearer for views which methods they have to implement.

I had to comment out some lines in TimeChartView to make it compile
for now. This will require fixing bug 409542 first.
