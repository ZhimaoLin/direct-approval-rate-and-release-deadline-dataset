DESCRIPTION

CTF : Handle traces with events without eventID

Bug 387039 : in fact, the eventID was set to null when the event was
created. We change it for -2 as default value when not set.

New patch: now that we don't use null anymore, we can do away with Long and use a simple long. That way it can never be null, so we can remove all the null checks.

Patch Set 2: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The trace attached to the bug now opens fine (and other "normal" traces seem to behave well too).

However, if I scroll the events view to the bottom, it enters an infinite loop somewhere. Could be wrong assumptions being made in the TmfEventsEditor, we'd have to fix it before merging it.
