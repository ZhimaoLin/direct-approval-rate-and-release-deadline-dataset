DESCRIPTION

CTF : Handle traces with events without eventID

Bug 387039 : First, the eventID was set to null when the event was
created. We change it for -2 as default value when not set. Then, we
must change the way to look for packetIndexEntry to adapt it to the
particular case where there are many packetIndexEntry with the same
timestamp.

Looks good, it allows opening the trace in 387039 (which doesn't even validate with current master).
