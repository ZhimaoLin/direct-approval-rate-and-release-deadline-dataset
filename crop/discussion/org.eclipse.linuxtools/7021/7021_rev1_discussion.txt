DESCRIPTION

lttng: Change external dependencies to imported packages

The external dependencies for ctf and lttng2 (RSE and Antlr) were
set as "required bundles". This means the exact plugin must be
present in the current Eclipse installation to fulfill the dependency.

This commit changes those to Imported Packages, which relaxes the
origin of the package. This allows distribution-installed plugins
to fulfill the build dependency.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Your statement "This means the exact plugin must be
present in the current Eclipse installation to fulfill the dependency" only is not true if you use p2 (Eclipse installer) for installing Features. p2 will resolve and install required plug-ins if they are defined in Require-Bundle and if packages of these plug-ins are are defined in Import-Package. It tried both. Your observation might be true for distribution-installed plug-ins. 

Nevertheless, I'm OK with the change. The move to Import-Package will allow for looser coupling between plug-ins.

Here is an interesting blog about this topic:

Patch Set 1:

Thanks for the review Meredith Scott!

I hadn't tried with p2, but if it still works, great!

I meant "the exact plugin must be present in the current Eclipse installation to build the workspace from within Eclipse". I will update the commit message before pushing it.
