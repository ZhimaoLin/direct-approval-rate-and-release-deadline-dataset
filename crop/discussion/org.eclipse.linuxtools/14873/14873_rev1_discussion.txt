DESCRIPTION

Have Tycho use Eclipse's compiler settings

This way, building with Maven should give the same results as building
from within Eclipse. Tip taken from:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/FAQ#How_to_configure_warning.2Ferror_settings_of_the_OSGi_compiler.3F

Those compiler settings can then be defined per plugin.
