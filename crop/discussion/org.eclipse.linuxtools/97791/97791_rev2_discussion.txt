DESCRIPTION

Bug 517143: Prevent UI hangs due to reloadConnections in UI thread.

DockerConnectionManager.getInstance() will end up calling
reloadConnections() if the singleton has not yet been created. This can
happen when a user first opens the Docker Tooling perspective due to it
appearing in various createControl() methods. This code can take a few
seconds to execute so it should be done outside of the UI thread.

Patch Set 2:

I think it should be fine, assuming there isn't a loading issue for the plug-ins needed (i.e. we have to force other plug-ins to be loaded before our start method).  If that is the case, we could always make  a static initializer for the class to run reloadConnections() which should occur before any references to getInstance().
