DESCRIPTION

Bug 517143: Prevent UI hangs due to reloadConnections in UI thread.

DockerConnectionManager.getInstance() will end up calling
reloadConnections() if the singleton has not yet been created. This can
happen when a user first opens the Docker Tooling perspective due to it
appearing in various createControl() methods. This code can take a few
seconds to execute so it should be done outside of the UI thread.
