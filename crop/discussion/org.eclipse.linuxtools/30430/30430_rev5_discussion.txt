This doesn't seem to work for me.

I profile with Perf (either directly from profiling tools configuration or Profile As) and get the following error dialog :

File not found: /home/rgrunberg/runtime-EclipseApplication/hello/perf.data.

failed to open /perf.data : Permission denied
Perf session creation failed.
/usr/bin/perf record --output=/perf.data Debug/hello 
Analysing recorded perf.data, please wait...
Perf Report: 
failed to open /perf.data: No such file or directory

 END OF Perf Report
No profile data generated to be displayed.

On the other hand I've also noticed some other issues with Perf so I'll be making some much needed fixes to this plugin.
