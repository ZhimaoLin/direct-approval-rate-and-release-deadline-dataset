DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix another TimeRangeException in TmfStateStatistics

The exception occurs when the requested range is completely out of the
range of the state system, for example with an experiment containing two
traces that do not intersect.

Also changed exception handling so that StateSystemDisposedException is
ignored, and runtime exceptions are not caught.

Sure, if it's just a trivial rebase, you can consider the previous reviews to still apply ;)
