DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix another TimeRangeException in TmfStateStatistics

The exception occurs when the requested range is completely out of the
range of the state system, for example with an experiment containing two
traces that do not intersect.

Also changed exception handling so that StateSystemDisposedException is
ignored, and runtime exceptions are not caught.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

Better to check with if() than to try/catch exceptions that can happen normally. lgtm

The method getEventsInRange() doesn't even check for time boundaries. It's not used but if it was, it would throw those exceptions endlessly. But this whole class is due to be merged with the analysis module anyway, so all these weird view-specific methods will go away.
