Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Centralizing the common code in Definition.alignRead is good (that needs xxx@xxx.xxx 2.2 however), but I'm not sure about the "speed up integer reads" part. It seems to have slowed down slightly.

Running ReadTrace.java with 10 loops averaged, with 'kernel' and 'kernel_vm' give me this:
on master:
kernel: 983 ns/event
kernel_vm: 2009 ns/event (those have contexts, so slower to read as expected)

with this patch:
kernel: 1007 ns/event
kernel_vm: 2123 ns/event

In any case those two changes should be split in separate patches.
