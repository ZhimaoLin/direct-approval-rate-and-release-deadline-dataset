Line:133, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/Definition.java -> "protected" would be more appropriate, it's meant to be used by sub-classes of Definition, no matter which package they are in. Minor thing.

Line:38, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDefinition.java -> Comment should be more about what it is, like "Pre-computed masks"

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDefinition.java -> static final!
