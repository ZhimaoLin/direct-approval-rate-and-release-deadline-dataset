DESCRIPTION

TMF: Introduce a framework to hook trace analysis modules/plugins

* Add a new extension point to define trace analysis modules.
* Add new interface IAnalysisModule and abstract class
  TmfAbstractAnalysisModule to implement the analysis itself.
* TmfAnalysisManager is the main class to obtain which analysis are available
  to a trace.
* IAnalysisOutput interface describe the different outputs the analysis can
  provide.  Objects of classes implementing this interface can register to an
  analysis module.
* The IAnalysisParameterProvider allows other parts of the system to set an
  analysis' parameters.
* Analysis are executed as Eclipse jobs.
* On the UI side, analysis and their provided outputs (if any) are now children
  of the trace and can be directly opened.
* Unit tests in tmf.core and tmf.ui provide stub analysis.
