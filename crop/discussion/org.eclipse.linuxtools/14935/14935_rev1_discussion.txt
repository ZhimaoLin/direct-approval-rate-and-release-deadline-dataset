DESCRIPTION

TMF: Introduce a framework to hook trace analysis modules/plugins

* Add a new extension point to define trace analysis modules
* Add new interface IAnalysisModule and abstract class
  TmfAbstractAnalysisModule to implement the analysis itself
* TmfAnalysisManager is the main class to obtain which analysis are available
  to a trace.
* On the UI side, analysis and their provided views (if any) are now children
  of the trace and can be directly opened.
* Unit tests in tmf.core and tmf.ui provide stub analysis

Submitted for comments.

I'm not entirely satisfied with the look of the UI.  Suggestions are welcome, but for now, it could do.

Also, I'd like for something to happen when I double-click either an analysis or a view name.  I can't get that to work.  Actions are available through the right-click menu.

Line:68, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/OpenViewHandler.java -> Lot of copy/paste from OpenTraceHandler in this function.  Maybe we'd need a class between the concrete handlers and AbstractHandler to check close down and get selection

Line:128, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceAnalysis.java -> See TODO comment: here we would like a help message personnalized for the current trace, so the trace needs to be instantiated.  How to cleanly do that?

Patch Set 1:

It fails to build, like everything else on -luna atm, because we didn't update some version numbers when we merged the new UST plugins in.

Rebasing it on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/14951/ should fix it.
