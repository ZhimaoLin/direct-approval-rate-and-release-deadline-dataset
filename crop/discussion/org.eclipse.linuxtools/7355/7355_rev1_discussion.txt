Small comment.

-1 because there is no Change-Id line in the commit message.

Line:235, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Shouldn't we override these methods in CtfTmfTrace to return CtfTmfTimestamp's directly? So we wouldn't have to use casts here.
