Patch Set 1:

When the payload of an event contains the newline character, the regex would never match the whole string.

This can be seen in the following trace:

Try searching for _msg in the event view. The single-line payloads will be found, but the multi-line ones will not.

This solution simply tells the regex to make the "dot" character also match newline characters.
