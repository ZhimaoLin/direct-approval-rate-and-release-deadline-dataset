DESCRIPTION

Ensure that STPEditors are created with a PathEditorInput

This should fix all problems which are cause by various
parts of the plugin not being able to handle
FileStoreEditorInput. It is a better alternative to going
around and checking for FileStoreEditorInput everywhere.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The patch is nice. I tested here and it is working. If fixes the bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=388540, right?
But there is only one problem. This item has one dependency, but the dependency is abandoned. Is it really necessary?

Patch Set 1:

Yes, it fixes 388540 and some other bugs. The dependency is not required; it was an alternative solution which attempted to support FileStoreEditorInput instead of ensuring PathEditorInput.
