DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make ITmfGraphEntry.getChildren() return a List

instead of a static array.

Because of the upcoming AbstractTimeGraphEntry and its subclasses,
we will now need to specify the exact class in each view's
.getChildren(). This is not possible to do with an array if we use
a generic type (e.g. E[]), we have to use a Collection like List<E>.
