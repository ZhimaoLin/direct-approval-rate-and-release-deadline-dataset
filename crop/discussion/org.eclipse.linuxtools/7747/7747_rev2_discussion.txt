DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make ITmfGraphEntry.getChildren() return a List

instead of a static array.

Because of the AbstractTimeGraphEntry and its subclasses, we now need
to specify the exact class in each view's .getChildren. This is not
possible to do with an array if we use a generic type (e.g. E[]), we
have to use a Collection like List<E>.
