DESCRIPTION

[RFC] tmf: Make timestamps immutable

Mark the fields in TmfTimestamp final, to ensure they do not get
modified after the object is created.

This required re-working the copy constructor in TmfSimpleTimestamp,
but other than that the setter methods didn't seem to be used so
the impacts are minimal.
