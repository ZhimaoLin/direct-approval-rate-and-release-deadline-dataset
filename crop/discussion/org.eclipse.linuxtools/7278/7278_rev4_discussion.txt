DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make TmfTimestamp and TmfTimeRange immutable

Mark the fields in TmfTimestamp/TmfTimeRange final, to ensure they
do not get modified after the object is created.

This required re-working the copy constructor in TmfSimpleTimestamp,
so we trade a IllegalArgumentException for a NullPointerException.
Both are run-time exceptions, so I don't think this is a big problem.

Other than that, the setter methods didn't seem to be used anywhere
so the impacts are minimal.
