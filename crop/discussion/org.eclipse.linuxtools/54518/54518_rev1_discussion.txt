DESCRIPTION

Bug 475504 - Creating a connection with the same name results

...in duplicate entries in combo boxes

Refactored NewConnectionPage to use DataBinding
Added validation on the form fields to verify that
- the connection name exists and is unique
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the host scheme starts is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
(those values are validated according to the connection
 mode)

Also added a warning status if the connection failed
The "ping" dialog now shows the root cause when the connection
failed, to give more feedback to the user
The opening of the wizard is preceeded by a user job
that tries to retrieve the connection settings and then
retrieve the Docker 'info'. This avoids UI freeze
The connection has a timeout of 1s instead of the default 5s
for quicker feedback.
