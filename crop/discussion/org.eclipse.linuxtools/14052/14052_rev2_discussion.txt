DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add the concept of host id to a trace

This patch adds the concept of a host to a trace.  By default, the host if the
name of the trace itself (so 1 trace => 1 host).  For CTF traces, the clock
uuid is used to uniquely identify the host (boot session) the trace was taken
from.

Small comment, otherwise looks good

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Could be added to CtfConstants instead. And be static

Line:294, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> space after cast plz

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> I'm not sure about it going to CtfConstants.  It is really specific to getting the host "in most cases".  It is not a mandatory property of a clock, and the clock may not exist.  This constant should not be used anywhere else than in this class.

If it was to go in a global constant anywhere, I'd say somewhere in the .ctf.core package.
