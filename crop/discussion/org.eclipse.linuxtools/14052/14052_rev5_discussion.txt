DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add the concept of host id to a trace

This patch adds the concept of a host to a trace.  By default, the host is the
name of the trace itself (so 1 trace => 1 host).  For CTF traces, the clock
uuid is used to uniquely identify the host (boot session) the trace was taken
from.

I forgot that uuid is not a mandatory field, so if it is not present, it falls back to the super getHostId()
