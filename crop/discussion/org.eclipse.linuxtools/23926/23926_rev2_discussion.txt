That's quite nifty!

If/when we change everything to go through "Open File", how will this option handle directory traces? Or will we still keep the notion of "this trace is a directory" in the extension point for example?

Patch Set 2:

It is not based on the trace type but rather on the actual IResource associated with the trace element (whether it is an IFile or an IFolder). If we leave it in the menu the submenu becomes grayed out when selected because the platform's OpenWithMenu class only accepts a selection that is an IFile.
