Yeah! it finally passes Hudson, performance tests, here we coooome!!

We could push this soon so we can start testing our methodology with master, or we could wait for the full circle (automatic testing -> display result) before pushing it all.

What do you guys think?

Line:43, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/perf/experiment/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> To be backward-compatible with eclipse.test.performance.ui, the part before # needs to be the component, so org.eclipse.linuxtools (it should correspond to the component in the known_component array of the performance plugin, linuxtools is not there now anyway), and it should be the same for all scenarios. We should have a helper method to build the TEST_ID somewhere.

Those tests don't run in Hudson atm, we would have to add the testsuite in the plugin's pom.xml (probably in a new profile or something). So we could push it as soon as it's ready. I'll update it in a sec.

Line:43, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/perf/experiment/ExperimentBenchmark.java -> I think I asked you this exact question, and you told me org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng was fine ;)  Anyways, I'll change it to o.e.linuxtools only then. We can put whatever we want in there, so why not remain backwards compatible.

A helper method would be nice, however it would have to be in yet another plugin that all test plugins would have to depend on... (it can't be .alltests, because that one depends on the test plugins, and you can't have circular dependencies...) I'm not sure it's that worth it.
