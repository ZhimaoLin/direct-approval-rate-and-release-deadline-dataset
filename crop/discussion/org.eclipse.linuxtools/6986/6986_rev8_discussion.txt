DESCRIPTION

tmf: Integration of the statistics in the state system

Rework the TmfStatisticsViewer to get its information from a
ITmfStatistics object (instead of doing direct event queries
on the trace).

That way, the logic to compute the statistics is now separate
from the view, which I think is a good thing.

Fixes bug 387634.
