DESCRIPTION

tmf: Integration of the statistics in the state system

Replace the TmfStatisticsViewer with a new, more simple, viewer
that only gets its information from a ITmfStatistics object.

That way, the logic to compute the statistics is now separate
from the view, which I think is a good thing.

Fixes bug 387634.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

It's still at the RFC level at the moment (there are still a couple bugs), but this should give a good idea of how it can be done.

Patch Set 7:

I'm not sure which patch introduced it but now there are 2 TmfStatistics classes (see below) with different purposes. Best thing would be to have only one class that addresses both use cases.  

org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.viewers.statistics.model.TmfStatistics
org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.statistics.TmfStatistics

Patch Set 7:

Yeah I noticed that afterwards. Maybe we could rename the tmf.ui one to TmfStatisticsModel?

Patch Set 7:

If both are fully independent and cannot be merged then I'm ok with renaming the one on the UI model.However, TmfStatisticsModel is not what the class represents. It is more a container for statistic values. Maybe TmfStatisticsValue(s) is more appropriate. If you have a better name I'm not fixed on that one.
