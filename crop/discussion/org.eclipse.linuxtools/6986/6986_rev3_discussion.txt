Patch Set 3:

This is a good proof-of-concept.

However as we discussed, the best way to implement this would be to have a separate "statistics state system" that is available and built for all trace types. And then add a wrapper on top of them that would redirect queries to the correct back-end, depending on the attributes.

I'm not sure what we want to do with the patch here, I don't think it should go in the tree right now if we are going to break it down in the future.
