DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make TmfStatisticsViewer use the trace's stats provider

Rework the TmfStatisticsViewer to get its information from a
ITmfStatistics object (instead of doing direct event queries
on the trace). That way, the logic to compute the statistics
is now separate from the view, which I think is a good thing.

This removes the need for the ITmfExtraInfo completely. Unit
tests have also been updated to take account for the fact that
the view does not 'count' anymore, it just displays whatever
we send it.

Other changes:
 - Consolidated the setters in TmfStatisticsTree
 - Renamed TmfStatisticsNode.getValue() to .getValues(), to
   better indicate that it is the wrapper object around the
   values that is returned.

Fixes bug 387634.

Patch Set 11:

New version with a couple additional fixes. I think it's ready for review/merging now. At least it will use the stats-state-system that is getting built already.

I have more improvements coming in the pipeline, but those should be in subsequent changes.

It looks good and works: 

However, indexing is noticeble slower than pre-state system statistics implementation when building the statistics state system. However, when state system is already built then it's of course much fast.

Line:714, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Header missing. I'm surprised that we don't get any warning for that.
