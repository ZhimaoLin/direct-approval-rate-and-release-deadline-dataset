DESCRIPTION

tmf: Integration of the statistics in the state system

Rework the TmfStatisticsViewer to get its information from a
ITmfStatistics object (instead of doing direct event queries
on the trace).

That way, the logic to compute the statistics is now separate
from the view, which I think is a good thing.

Fixes bug 387634.

Patch Set 9:

It looks good. Have you tried to use the extension point to create another tab in the stats view e.g.to count different stats? I think that would be good integration test of your change and the extension point. I have an example extension that was based on the code before your change to use the state system. Let me know if you need this.
