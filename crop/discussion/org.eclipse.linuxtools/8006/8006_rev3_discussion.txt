Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This solves the problem with the shortcuts but the tests that make use of the delegate (launch tests) will still fail.

They make use of LaunchOptions directly and it would still be set to 0 in that case. I think you would still need to set the number of executions to 1 in the LaunchOptions constructor.
