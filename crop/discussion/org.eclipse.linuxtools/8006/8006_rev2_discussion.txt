Patch Set 2:

I did the suggested modifications, plus fixed a bug in which the LaunchTerminationWatcher was being fired before all the executions ended when the number of executions was too big ( tipically more than 10).

Everything else looks fine, but there is a bug.

Line:33, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/LaunchOptions.java -> Not sure why I didn't spot this in earlier tests, but executionsNumber needs to be initialized to '1' by default (it's 0 currently). In the launch shortcut we apply the settings of a newly initialized LaunchOptions class to the configuration, and since executionsNumber is 0, the shortcut doesn't launch the binary at all.
