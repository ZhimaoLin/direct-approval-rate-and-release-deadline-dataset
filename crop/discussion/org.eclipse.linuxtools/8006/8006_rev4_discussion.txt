I see the minor change requested is in. (sorry for the delay.. it's difficult to tell when the commits are on different parents). I'll just need to test it out.

Patch Set 4: Fails

(2 inline comments)

The oprofile launch tests do not pass. This is the same issue as in Patch Set 2. Also please make sure to clean up any extraneous whitespace (git show on the commandline should display what extraneous whitespace your patch introduces).

Line:33, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/LaunchOptions.java -> The same problem as exists as in the previous patch sets. When launch options is initialized in the tests, the value of executionsNumber is 0, and this is saved. It should be initialized to 1.

Line:20, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/launching/OprofileLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> IProcess, and DebugException show up as not being needed. I've removed them and the project seems to build in Eclipse without problems.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There have been some recent changes that conflict with this patch set, namely with OprofileEventConfigTab and OprofileSetupTabwhen, when rebasing on top of master.

Patch Set 4:

New commits completely broke the patch, making it easier to make a new one instead of rebasing this one.
