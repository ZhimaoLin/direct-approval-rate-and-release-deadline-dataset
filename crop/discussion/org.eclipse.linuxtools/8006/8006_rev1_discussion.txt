I've tested it out, and it mostly works as expected, with some fixes needing to be made.

Line:32, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/LaunchOptions.java -> The number of executions could be defined here.

Line:43, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/oprofilelaunch.properties -> Could this become 'Number of executions', to shorten it ? I think the tool-tip clarifies well enough how this works. If you disagree or feel it makes it unclear, then you can leave it as is.

Line:35, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/core/daemon/OprofileDaemonOptions.java -> I don't think this should be defined here, as it's not an option supplied by the OProfile daemon (as far as I know). I think it should be defined in the LaunchOptions.

Line:175, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/OprofileSetupTab.java -> The current layout puts spinner underneath the label. I think they should appear side by side.

Line:181, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/OprofileSetupTab.java -> There should be a call to updateLaunchConfigurationDialog(). Otherwise the option to "Apply" and save the launch configuration will be greyed out when you modify the spinner. There are some other event listeners that do the same.
