DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Fix remote script run errors.

-Assign a set of credentials (username, password, hostname) to each
remote script run rather than using a global set of values that get
overwritten with those of the most recent remote run. This makes it
possible to stop a remote script that has been started before another
remote script.

-Make remote runs compatible with the Debug view and the Launch workflow.

-Prevent NPEs caused by error dialogs of failed scripts.

-Make improvements to concurrency of script runs.

Line:52, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.structures/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/structures/runnable/Command.java -> This should be private if it is only used locally

Line:46, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.consolelog/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/consolelog/actions/CloseStapConsoleAction.java -> why do we need two booleans to describe two states ? Doesn't !running == stopped ?

Line:46, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.consolelog/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/consolelog/actions/CloseStapConsoleAction.java -> Yes, but the reason I added a "started" property was to describe states for before a script actually starts, or if it fails to start. Just knowing if the script is running is enough to control the "stop" & "close all" actions, but more info was needed for SystemTapScriptLaunch (particularly for concurrency), which is why I added it.

-If !started && !stopped, the script didn't start yet

-If started && !stopped, the script is running

-If started && stopped, the script ran successfully & is terminated

-If !started && stopped, there was an error in starting the script
