DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Fix remote script run errors.

-Assign a set of credentials (username, password, hostname) to each
remote script run rather than using a global set of values that get
overwritten with those of the most recent remote run. This makes it
possible to stop a remote script that has been started before another
remote script.

-Make remote runs compatible with the Debug view and the Launch workflow.

-Prevent NPEs caused by error dialogs of failed scripts.

-Make improvements to concurrency of script runs.
