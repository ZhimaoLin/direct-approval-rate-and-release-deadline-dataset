DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix batch import doesn't respect user-chosen trace name on copy

When the user changes the trace display name in the batch import wizard
(for example to resolve a name conflict), this name is not used when
importing if the copy option is selected and the trace is a folder.

This prevents the trace type to be set correctly on a single trace
import, and prevents name-conflicted traces to be imported properly.
