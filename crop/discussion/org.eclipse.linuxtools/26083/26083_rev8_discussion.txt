Line:192, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> ok good enough. I would suggest that it is documented in the Javadoc though ("This method currently only supports reads aligned to 8 bytes. It is up to the developer to shift the bits in post-processing to do unaligned reads." etc)
