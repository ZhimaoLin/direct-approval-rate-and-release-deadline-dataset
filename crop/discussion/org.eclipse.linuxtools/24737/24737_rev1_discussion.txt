I'm glad to see it's moved down. 

Would it be possible to change also the name from "Import XML file" to something more meaningful what it actually does? For me it sounds like another way to import a trace which happens to be an xml file. I don't have good suggestion ready. unfortunately: Maybe "Import Custom Definition" or "Import Analysis Definition"

It's chagned to Import XML Analysis

Line:17, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/plugin.properties -> As you can see here, the name has been changed also. It's better than file...
