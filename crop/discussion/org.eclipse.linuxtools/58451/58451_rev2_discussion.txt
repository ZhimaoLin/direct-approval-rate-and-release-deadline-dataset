DESCRIPTION

perf: make stat work on PTP sync project.

Perf stat wasn't working with PTP synchronized projects (remote).
The implementation used to (wrongly) assume that appending working dir and
 path to file was going to build the correct URI to resource. As a result,
 the remote proxy always return the local proxy.
