Looks good overall, just few small fixes and it's ready.

Line:117, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/plugin.xml -> Why do you change the py in rubygem commit? Please don't mix commits that way as it makes it really hard to find when/why smth changed.

Line:34, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/parser/RubyGemParser.java -> Text file is parsed and all you deal with is String, why don't you use ArrayList<String> here and drop all the casts later?

Line:59, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/parser/RubyGemParser.java -> Remember to put {} around if/else/while/for etc.

Line:93, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/parser/RubyGemParser.java -> Do not catch exception but the actual exceptions thrown. We don't want runtime exceptions to be catched that way.

Line:189, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/parser/RubyGemParser.java -> Please return the empty rc here to prevent NPEs. Users of the method can easily check whether the list is empty instead of null. Returning null when collection is expected is considered a really bad style.
