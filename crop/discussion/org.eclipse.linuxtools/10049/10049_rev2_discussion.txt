DESCRIPTION

Merge entries with same TID in Control Flow view

Separate entries are no longer created when a thread changes its exec
name over time. A single entry is used, and its name is set to the last
exec name of the thread. If the thread is terminated and reused, a
separate entry will be created with a different name and birth time.
