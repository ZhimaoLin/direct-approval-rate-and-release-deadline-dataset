DESCRIPTION

Refresh images view after removing temporary image.

When pushing some image 'baz' to registry 'foo.bar:5000', we tag an
image temporarily as 'foo.bar:5000/baz' to facilitate the push. At the
very end this tag is removed, so the images view should be refreshed so
the image doesn't incorrectly show up until a manual refresh.
