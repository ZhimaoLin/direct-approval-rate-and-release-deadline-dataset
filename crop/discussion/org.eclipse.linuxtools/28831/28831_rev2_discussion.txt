DESCRIPTION

bug 408543 Implemented functionality to check for gprof and gcov flags

If gprof/gcov run without the flag being set in the options,
ask user if he wants it to be added automatically.
If so, enable in the options, rebuild and continue launch.
This works for C,Cpp Managed Make projects and C Autotools projects
Added shared classes in profiling.ui (common between gprof/gcov)

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Instead of one huge commit, this should be a series of two commits - one for the profiling*, one for gcov and one for gprof.

Abandoned

I will split this into 3 commits instead of one big one.
