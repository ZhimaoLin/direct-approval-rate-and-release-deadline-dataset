DESCRIPTION

bug 408543 Implemented functionality to check for PG flag and ask user if he wants it to be added automatically. This works for C,Cpp Managed Make projects and C Autotools projects (not Cpp Autotools projects as Cpp pg flag for Cpp is not yet implemented in Autotools). Added shared classes in profiling.ui which will be used in other profiling plugins in the future for similar functionality

Please wait with the review. 

I discovered a bug. 

If eclipse is opened, a new project is created and the user never opens the project properties and runs gprof, then enabling the option fails as toolsprefStore never got instantiated properly. 

I'll have to find a way to fix this first.
