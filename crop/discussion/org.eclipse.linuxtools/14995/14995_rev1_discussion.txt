Patch Set 1:

I started this to eventually remove "cache size" from ITmfTrace, since it seemed related to the requests' block size, which we don't use anymore.

Turns out cache size is used for other things (like the events table, which is generic to all trace types), so it should probably stay there. This cleanup can still be useful though.

Line:137, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/views/uml2sd/loader/Uml2SDTestFacility.java -> the parser needs to be passed as second last argument, right?
