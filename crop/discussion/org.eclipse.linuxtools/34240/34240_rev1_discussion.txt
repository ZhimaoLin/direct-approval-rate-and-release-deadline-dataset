DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Fix a bug in CFV and Xml time graph views where entries have no parent

If a child entry starts before the parent entry, like it happens at the
beginning of a trace, then in time graph views, they are not associated with
the parent.

Also added a State System Utility class to perform static operations on the
state system, like getting the first interval answering a certain condition. It
is used in the time graph views to return the first non-null interval for a
quark.
