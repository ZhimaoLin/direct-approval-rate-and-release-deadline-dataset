DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Fix a bug in CFV and Xml time graph views where entries have no parent

If a child entry starts before the parent entry, like it happens at the
beginning of a trace, then in time graph views, they are not associated with
the parent.

Also added a State System Utility class to perform static operations on the
state system, like getting the first interval answering a certain condition. It
is used in the time graph views to return the first non-null interval for a
quark.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I don't think it's worth introducing this concept or IntervalCondition (or IntervalMatcher), since the only use for now would be "checking if the value is null".

However I like the idea of a StateSystemUtils, for more "advanced" types of queries. Many methods that are currently in ITmfStateSystem could actually go in there (like queryRange, queryRangeWithAnEclipseSpecificProgressMonitor, etc.) And if we add such a util class, then we could add a queryUntilNonNullValue() method in there if it's used in more than one place.

I wasn't too keen on adding it in ITmfStateSystem, but in StateSystemUtil that would be fine, imo. I'll see what I can cook up.

Patch Set 2:

Could you try rebasing it on top of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/34340/  (and using the new queryUntilNonNullValue() method).
