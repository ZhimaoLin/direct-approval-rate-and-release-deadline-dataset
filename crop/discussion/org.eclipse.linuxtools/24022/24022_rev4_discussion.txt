DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix trace properties not shown when location URI has encoded chars

The trace properties (e.g. CTF environment variables) are not shown when
the trace element's location URI contains encoded characters (e.g.
space=%20), because the trace path uses the decoded characters and
therefore does not match the trace element's location.

The patch also modifies the output of the 'location' property to show
the unencoded URI string.
