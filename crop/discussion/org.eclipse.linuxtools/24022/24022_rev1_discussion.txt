DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix trace properties not shown when location URI has encoded chars

The trace properties (e.g. CTF environment variables) are not shown when
the trace element's location URI contains encoded characters (e.g.
space=%20), because the trace path uses the decoded characters and
therefore does not match the trace element's location.

The patch also modifies the output of the 'location' property to show
the decoded path.

Line:451, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> This path does not include the scheme part of the URI (e.g. "file:"), which prevents the location property value to be pasted in a web browser or file manager.
