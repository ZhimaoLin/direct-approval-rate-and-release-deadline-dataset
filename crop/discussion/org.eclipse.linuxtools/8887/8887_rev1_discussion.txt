Patch Set 1: Abandoned

The icon set in the editor's createPartControl does not match the default icon set in the org.eclipse.ui.editors extension's icon field. After a restart of Eclipse the non-active editors don't have the icon associated with their trace type until they gain focus and have their part created.
