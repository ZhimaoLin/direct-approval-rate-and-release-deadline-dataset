DESCRIPTION

bug 471666 - Show nested elements with most relevant info in Explorer View

Showing ports, links and volumes for each container
Loading ContainerInfo in background if it was not already
loaded (hence, a new method in IDockerContainer)
Make sure the 'volumes', 'ports' and 'links' nodes remain
 expanded when the 'refresh' command is called

Added UI tests
Running SWTBot tests on MacOSX (until they can also run on Hudson at Eclipse)
