DESCRIPTION

Bug 494926: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in RunImageMainTab

 - change CommandUtils.getCurrentConnection to fall back to first active connection (not just first connection)
 - have DockerImagesView and DockerContainersView use CommandUtils to get the default connection (i.e. first active connection)
 - add checks in RunImageMainTab to look for no active connection and set an error message if that is the case
 - add similar checks in RunImageVolumesTab, RunImageResourceTab, and RunImageEnvironmentTab
 - use CommandUtils for default connection in RunImageLaunchConfigurationTabGroup
 - add new Wizard message for inactive connection
