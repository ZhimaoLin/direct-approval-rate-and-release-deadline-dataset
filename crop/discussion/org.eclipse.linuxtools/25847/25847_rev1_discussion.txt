DESCRIPTION

Linuxtools: Preserve process env vars.

When a process is run with one of the RuntimeProcessFactory#exec
methods, environment variables that are passed to the method may
be ignored and overwritten by system variables. Modify
LinuxtoolsProcessFactory so that passed variables are preserved.
