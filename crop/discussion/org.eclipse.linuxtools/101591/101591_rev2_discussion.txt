DESCRIPTION

Handle cases where logging framework's DEBUG level is on.

When the logging framework performs logging at the DEBUG level, then the
input stream (nested in various internal fields) is encased in an
additional LoggingInputStream. Determine if this is the case and adjust
our internal field traversal accordingly.
