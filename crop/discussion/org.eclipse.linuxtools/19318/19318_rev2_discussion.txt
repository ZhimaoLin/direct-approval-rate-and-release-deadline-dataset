Line:327, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketReader.java -> yeah we let that one slip in a previous patch!

Line:274, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> auto-format did something weird here. Might want to put the comment on its own on the previous line instead.

Line:2059, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> you could add a "break;" here. I assume you don't want to continue looping once you found the value

Line:113, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> "Get a list..." should be the method description. Then you can have
xxx@xxx.xxx A list of values...

It's good to have both even if they're almost copy-pastes of each other. It fills different columns in the HTML Javadoc.

Line:115, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> This method name is weird. I'm still not sure what it's supposed to do. Would something like get "getValidValues()" be more clear (assuming that's what it does)?

Line:170, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> Are you sure this class can be static? Can't different enums have different ranges?

Line:173, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> fields could be final
