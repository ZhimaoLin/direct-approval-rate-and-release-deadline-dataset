DESCRIPTION

Bug 480263 - Run Image does not delete the container

- the remove on exit option was not being looked at in the
  RunImageCommandHandler
- add a Remove Console action to RunConsole by adding a new
  IConsolePageParticipant extension called RunConsolePageParticipant
  which adds a remove action: RunConsoleRemove to the toolbar
- alter ImageRun Wizard to return the remove on exit option back
- alter RunImageCommandHandler to look for the remove on exit option
  and to try and remove the Container if non-null
