DESCRIPTION

ctf: Provide a utility for "safe" mapping of a ByteBuffer

This works around a bug on Windows which prevents deleting a file after it
was mapped. See http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154

Running TraceSeekBenchmark, I noticed a 10% decreased in performance (3.8s vs 3.4s). We can discuss whether that's acceptable or not.

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/SafeMappedByteBuffer.java -> can this be cached? I hope TMF doesn't migrate, but I think this is a fix that will slow down Linux.

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/SafeMappedByteBuffer.java -> Done. It doesn't make a different in the benchmark results on Windows but it doesn't hurt to have it. I'll benchmark on Linux as well.
