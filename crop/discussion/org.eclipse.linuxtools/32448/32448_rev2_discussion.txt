DESCRIPTION

ctf: Provide a utility for "safe" mapping of a ByteBuffer

This works around a bug on Windows which prevents deleting a file after it
was mapped. See http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154
This is just a proof of concept and needs to be tested to see if performance
is greatly affected.
