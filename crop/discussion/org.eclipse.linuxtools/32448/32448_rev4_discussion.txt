DESCRIPTION

ctf: Provide a utility for "safe" mapping of a ByteBuffer

This works around a bug on Windows which prevents deleting a file after it
was mapped. See http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154

Running TraceSeekBenchmark, I noticed a 10% decreased in performance (3.8s vs 3.4s). We can discuss whether that's acceptable or not.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

This patch slows down seeks a bit since each seek creates a new bytebuffer. That's ok IMO.
