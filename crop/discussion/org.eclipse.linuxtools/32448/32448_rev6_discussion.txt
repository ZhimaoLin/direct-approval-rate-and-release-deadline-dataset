DESCRIPTION

ctf: Provide a utility for "safe" mapping of a ByteBuffer

This works around a bug on Windows which prevents deleting a file after it
was mapped. See http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154

Running TraceSeekBenchmark, I noticed a 10% decreased in performance (3.8s vs 3.4s) on Windows. On Linux, the difference is negligible (2.41s vs 2.40).
