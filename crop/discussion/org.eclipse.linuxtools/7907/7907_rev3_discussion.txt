Approved with the requested modifications.

Line:14, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Roland modified OprofileManualLaunchConfigurationDelegate and removed ILaunch. 
See: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/7963/1/oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/launching/OprofileManualLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java

Perhaps modification is applicable here.

Line:29, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is there a way that exporting these internal classes can be avoided ?
I see that you are using x-friends but not exporting at all would be best.

Line:14, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> That change does not apply here.

Line:29, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There is no simple way to do this.  The gcov core plug-in has not exposed any of its interfaces publicly.  The launcher needs to run the executable, parse the results and display them in the view which are all found in the core plug-in..  While it is probably possible to drop the dialog and view exports, the parser has to be there or else expose the interfaces in some way which has support ramifications.
