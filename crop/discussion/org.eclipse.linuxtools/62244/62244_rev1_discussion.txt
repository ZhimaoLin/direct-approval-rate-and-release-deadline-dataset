This isn't working for me.  The container name is still filled in when I try and run the same image again even though I let Docker pick the name.

Patch Set 1:

For existing launch configuration (prior to this patch), a container name has already been recorded in every launch configuration and thus it is actually always restored in the launch editor. For new containers, though, I could not see the name in the 'name' field on the 'Main' tab if it was provided by Docker. Can you check that scenario ?
