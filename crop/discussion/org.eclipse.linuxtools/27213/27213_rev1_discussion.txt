DESCRIPTION

Downgrade to Tycho 0.20.0 to fix build

Tycho 0.21.0-SNAPSHOT seems to fragile right now for us
to use for the Luna release. We needed 0.21 to work around
a bug in IcedTea but we can work around this issue by setting
the SWT_GTK3=0 environment variable when executing the build
instead of having it in the pom.xml. This is less convenient
but more prudent in order to stabilize the build.
