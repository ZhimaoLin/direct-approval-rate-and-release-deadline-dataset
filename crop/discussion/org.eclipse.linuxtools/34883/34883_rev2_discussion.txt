DESCRIPTION

lttng: More performance improvements to the Resources view

In the Resources view, the CPU Status states are further split, when the
current thread switches mid-state, into sub-states by a drawing overlay.

There was no limit to the number of sub-states that this overlay
produces. It should be limited to at most one sub-state per pixel.

Furthermore the vertical bar delimiting these sub-states should not be
drawn when the sub-state is smaller than a pixel, otherwise the bars
can block the underlying state color.
