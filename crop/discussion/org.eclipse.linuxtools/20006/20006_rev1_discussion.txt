DESCRIPTION

tmf: remove setting of anti-aliasing in histogram

The setting of anti-aliasing in histogram paintContro() is triggering
another redraw of the histogram. This endless redraw will make
the UI unresponsive. It seems only to happen on some Linux versions.
Until we figured-out the root cause it's better to remove the setting
of anti-aliasing.
