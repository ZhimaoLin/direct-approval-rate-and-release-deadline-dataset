DESCRIPTION

tmf: remove setting of anti-aliasing in histogram

The setting of anti-aliasing in histogram paintContro() is triggering
another redraw of the histogram. This endless redraw will make
the UI unresponsive. It seems only to happen on some Linux versions.
Until we figured-out the root cause it's better to remove the setting
of anti-aliasing.

Line:717, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/Histogram.java -> We might mitigate the effect of anti-aliasing by finally drawing an extra point at (x, height - value)? Not sure if it's worth it, how does it look without it (when there are lost events)?
