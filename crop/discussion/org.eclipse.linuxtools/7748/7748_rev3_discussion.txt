DESCRIPTION

tmf: Introduce the AbstractTimeGraphView

Provide an abstract class that all potential Time Graph views can
extend to get going. This will hopefully reduce the large amount of
redundant code we have between these views.

This change includes:
- A new AbstractTimeGraphView, which lttng2's ResourcesView can now use.
- A new AbstractTimeGraphEntry type, to consolidate all the needed code
  for time graph entries. This could become unnecessary at one point,
  but it's not clear at the moment.
- Consolidate all EventIterator's in one place. This could be changed
  to an abstract class too in the future if different views need
  different iterators.

This is the first phase of this effort. The selectExperiment() and
getEventList() methods still require a relatively large amount of code.
These could probably be abstracted a bit further.

Another future work item is to do the same thing for TimeGraphCombo views.

Looks great. OK with me (with minor comment).

Patch Set 3: Abandoned

Would have to be rebased from hell. Faster to just re-write it from scratch at some point.
