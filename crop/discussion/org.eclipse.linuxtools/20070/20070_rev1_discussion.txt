Sounds good! So many ways to do the same thing...

Line:273, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> From what I see, the decode method has the advantage to convert a string to long, without needing to specify the radix. You could do it 4 lines below as well, unless you're sure the format is not going to change.

By the way, you could have done Long.parseLong(blabla, 16); that would have saved the trouble to trim 0x
