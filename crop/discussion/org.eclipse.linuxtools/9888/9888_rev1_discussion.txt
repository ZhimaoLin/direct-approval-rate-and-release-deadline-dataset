Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

* Auto-completion and cancelling of the TapSetParser job while it is running works well (no exceptions thrown).
* No more load time from the stap parser during eclipse start up.
* TapSetParser job properly shows up under the progress view, allowing job cancellation.

I just have a minor inline comment. Also, patch set needs to be rebased.

Line:161, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/structures/TapsetParser.java -> A for each loop on the listeners can be used here instead.
