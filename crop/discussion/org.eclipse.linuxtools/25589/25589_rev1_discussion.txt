Sorry about this patch in double. I accidently submitted it before the patch it depends on and it had to be quickly reverted. Here it is again. I don't push on friday afternoons anymore!

I'm still bored, have some more comments ;)

Line:38, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/analysis/AnalysisRequirementHelperTest.java -> Are each tests supposed to have their instance of the ModuleHelper?

If so, they should be new'ed in xxx@xxx.xxx method.

If not, they could be static final.

Right now they're in some kind of limbo between the two.

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirementHelper.java -> yep that's good

Line:92, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirementHelper.java -> Maybe you can use Guava's Multimap instead. it would make the creation and use a bit more simple.

However I am not 100% sure, because...

Line:100, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirementHelper.java -> ...of this. Multimap can allow duplicate mappings. For example, [a, 2] [a, 2] [a, 3]. Whereas with your current implementation, you wouldn't have "2" twice. See if that's needed/expected.

Line:100, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisRequirementHelper.java -> Multimap can indeed be used. As in list/set in java.util, there are multimaps that allow duplicates and others that don't. ListMultimap allow duplicates, but SetMultimap don't. We could use HashMultimap or TreeMultimap. I don't know enough yet to know which is the best in which case.
