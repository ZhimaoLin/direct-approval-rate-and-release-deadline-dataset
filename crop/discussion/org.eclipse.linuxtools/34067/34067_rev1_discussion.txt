This sort of makes sense, given the limited knowledge and understanding I have of this code. Is there an easy way to add a test for this case?

Patch Set 1:

"easy" as in "add another test experiment that can synchronize but with both kernel and ust traces from a same host", yeah. But I think, this would be an easy case for the new XML test traces, no need to have real live traces for this. I don't have time right now to work on it, so if you prefer to wait for the unit tests to accept this patch, it might go after LinuxCon.

OK, that's not easy ;) I'm OK with it. It was just in case there was already all the pieces available to make this a quick test.
