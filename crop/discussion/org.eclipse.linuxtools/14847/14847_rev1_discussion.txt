Patch Set 1:

All tests pass locally, support for foreach and other cases mentioned in the commit message work as expected. Just some trailing white spaces in the new test file that should be removed.

Patch Set 1:

Those spaces are required by the test as the input is found by parsing the test file.  If the test file is reformatted, all the tests fail.
