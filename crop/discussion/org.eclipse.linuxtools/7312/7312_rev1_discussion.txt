Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:61, man/org.eclipse.linuxtools.man.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/man/parser/ManParser.java -> BufferedReader's close() , seems to call close() on the underlying Reader, and the underlying Reader's close, would seem to call close() on the underlying InputStream (from the StreamDecoder). I think it should just be reader.close().
