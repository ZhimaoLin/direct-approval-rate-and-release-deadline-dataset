Line:92, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/launching/AbstractOprofileLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Copied for the sake of ease: I definetely don't want to see print stack traces added to the codebase anymore. Exception either needs to be poped up all the way to the user so he is aware of what happened or it is ignorable or in very rare cases it can be only logged so available for expection in the Error Log .
