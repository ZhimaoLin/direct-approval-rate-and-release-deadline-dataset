Please take a look at the code comments.

Line:224, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/valgrind/launch/ValgrindRemoteProxyLaunchDelegate.java -> is int state= 0 necessary if it will be changed below without being used?

Line:226, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/valgrind/launch/ValgrindRemoteProxyLaunchDelegate.java -> would this work if valgrind is not on system path and only in LinuxTools Path field? Path is being declared as empty string.
Also, if so, $NON-NLS-1$ needed.. better to declare it as private final String EMPTY_STRING.

Line:228, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/valgrind/launch/ValgrindRemoteProxyLaunchDelegate.java -> why workingDir was removed from the regular execution of remote projects?

Line:231, valgrind/org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/valgrind/launch/ValgrindRemoteProxyLaunchDelegate.java -> why do you need 2 p.waitFor()?
