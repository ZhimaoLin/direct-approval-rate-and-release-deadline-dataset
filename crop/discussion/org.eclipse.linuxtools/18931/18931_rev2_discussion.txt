DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Merge 64bbd52 & 2feae5f from master.

1) When capturing a script's output to display it in a graph,
don't attempt to plot null or invalid values so as to
avoid causing an error.

2) Add labels on individual pie charts to signify which series
each pie represents. Also show a "No data" label when all pie
charts are empty.

3) Increase the version number of linuxtools.dataviewers
to account for the new public API added by 1) and 2).
Also add some public documentation.
