Patch Set 2:

OMG that was bad! Actually, as the variable name says, the full query range used to be done with the execName quark, which didn't change much. But with the new way, we do it with the status quark, which has looooots of intervals and takes a long while.

I changed the variable name and I'll push as soon as Hudson says so.
