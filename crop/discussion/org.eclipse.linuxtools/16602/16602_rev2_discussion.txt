DESCRIPTION

Tmf: Add the possibility to define experiment types

* Added the element experiment to the org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetype
  extension point to declare experiment types, using the same handler and
  contribution items.
* Experiment elements are now instantiated with the given trace type.
* Renamed class TmfWithFolderElement to TmfCommonProjectElement since this base
  class does more than just managing folder.
* Consolidation of code for opening traces and experiments in the
  TmfOpenTraceHelper class.
* Changes so that experiment types can have their own event editor, event table
  and statistics viewer.
