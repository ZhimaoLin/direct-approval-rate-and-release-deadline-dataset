DESCRIPTION

Bug 482610 - Images and Containers View sometimes doesn't reflect connection state

Setting the selection to the added connection (when adding a new one) or to the
first remaining connection (or null) when removing one. Docker Images view
and Docker Containers view react to selection change, including when new selection
is empty.
