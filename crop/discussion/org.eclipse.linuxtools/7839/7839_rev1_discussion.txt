I likey!

Some general comments:
- Committed code should be deleted, not put in comments. If needed we can always get it back from the git history.
- TmfLongLocation.clone() (and probably the others) won't do what Cloneable expects it to do. See inline comment.

I'm all for merging this as it is right now (our old version of Gerrit doesn't make it easy to review different patchsets of big commits...), provided we review the clone/copy afterwards.

Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfLongLocation.java -> This is not the "correct" way to implement clone(). (It should call super.clone(), then deep-copy the fields as needed). If somebody extends this class and calls their clone(), it will return them a TmfLongLocation, and not an object of their class, and their cast will fail at run-time...

However, as you know, I'm not really a big fan of clone() in general ;)  I think it'd be easier/better to keep the implementation as it is here, but rename the method to copy() or something similar. This way it will not cause confusion with potential users wanting to extend the class.
