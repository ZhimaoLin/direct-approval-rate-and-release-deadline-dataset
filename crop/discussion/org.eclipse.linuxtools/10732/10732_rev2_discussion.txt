DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary methods in LTTng Tracer Control model

In many classes of the LTTng Tracer Control model convenience
methods exists that don't require passing a progress monitor and
that just calls another methods to pass a NullProgressMontior 
instance. This causes increased maintenance work and doesn't bring 
much gain.
