DESCRIPTION

Always regenerate the artifacts.jar from scratch rather than updating.

If a zip/jar archive contains a file that must be updated, Ant's zip
task will silently fail if the updated file's timestamp is within 2
seconds of the entry in the archive.

See http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/zip.html .
