DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add a new plugin for Tmf Developers Tools

This plugin is meant to provide utility classes for developers, for example,
custom XML traces to mimic CTF traces in unit tests and when designing
data-driven analyzes.

It will not come as part of TMF itself, but can be used in unit test plugins
or installed by analysis designers to test their analysis on a hand-made trace.

Patch Set 1:

As was discussed in the last sprint planning, this plug-in may also provide tools for the XML analysis development.

It was suggested, that the persons who will develop XML analyzes and views are not the end users themselves, but an analysis designer who would package the XML analysis files with TMF. So these tools should be optional and not come by default with TMF.

Patch Set 1:

Could this be part of the tracing.examples plugin? Or perhaps more realistically, have the examples be part of this?

Patch Set 1:

And if we end up with views to customize the XML files with, I think they *should* be part of the default TMF install. Then "end user" is typically an application developer, so they will like to be able to design their own analyses.

Patch Set 1:

This plugin is meant to contain tools for developers and designers to help them develop their own analysis, so if the examples fit in that description, then sure, the should by all means get in there!

As for it being part of TMF, then that's a matter for discussion. Maybe when tools are really user-friendly and easy then end users will become "trace designers", but in the meantime, I've been told that XML stuff just clogs the menus for everyone, when only a minority will want to design their own analyzes and views ;-)

So it should be in a separate feature. And that feature can be included in main feature eventually.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

With features like the XML providers/views, and eventual views/wizards to generate those files, we are now exposing "developer" functionality to "users". So the line between the two really becomes blurred. We cannot dump one group solely into "users that will never ever create a custom view". All applications are custom, our goal is to make it easy for those "users" to be "developers". If that makes sense.

> It will not come as part of TMF itself

This the part I disagree with. It SHOULD be part of TMF (and the RCP etc.), that's something we want users to use. The views could be in their own category, there could be a new perspective etc. but the functionality should be available.

Yet, it *might* be worth separating functionality in separate plugins, it's a bit more overhead but it can be cleaner. I'm working on splitting ctf-adaptor from TMF atm, and lemme tell you when it's not clean it's not pretty...

But before we go and add Yet Another Feature/Plugins, what do you have in mind for the list of views or packages that will go in there?

Patch Set 1:

Me, I mostly need the trace that is in the following patch to be in there.

It was previously suggested that the Import XML file and the view Amine and Gerson are developing should go in there, but personnally, I think it fits correctly in the XML package. What Meredith Scott (or was it Patrick? Or Marc-Andr√©?) said is that "designers" would be doing the XML files and view, and the "end user" would receive an RCP pre-packaged with the XML they'll be needing.

As for my trace type, it will need to be available in unit tests, and also for XML analysis developers, but an extra trace type would clog the UI of users who do not need this trace type in their list. Whence the idea to put it in a package that is not part of TMF by default, so users don't need to see it if they don't want to.

Patch Set 1:

Bringing this back on top of the list. Alex, does my answer convince you to put it in a separate plugin? Otherwise, I have no idea where to put my test trace type where it logically goes without troubling the user with a "fake" trace type.

Patch Set 1:

Alex, I'm leaning to be agree with Genevieve on this, tmf developers and tmf examples should have a right to exist, in an advanced pane somewhere. We will include it in the RCP. Let's get this done +2 or -2 ASAP. There's a chain of patches that can get in if we do.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Ok so we want developers to be users, especially vice-versa. So no developer tools plug-in and the trace that was to be part of this plug-in will go in tmf.core.
