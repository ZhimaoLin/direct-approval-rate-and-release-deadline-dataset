DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove unnecessary global action handlers

These actions were no longer necessary since the menu contributions were
changed to use the global command ids in commit 9625626.

The Delete action is also removed from the context menu when the
selection contains a mix of traces, folders or experiments.
