DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove unnecessary global action handlers

These actions were no longer necessary since the menu contributions were
changed to use the global command ids in commit 9625626.

The Delete action is also removed from the context menu when the
selection contains a mix of traces, folders or experiments.

The test failure is due the fact that double-click of on a trace doesn't open the trace anymore... I'm looking into it

Line:57, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/TmfActionProvider.java -> We need to keep the open action for double-click to work
