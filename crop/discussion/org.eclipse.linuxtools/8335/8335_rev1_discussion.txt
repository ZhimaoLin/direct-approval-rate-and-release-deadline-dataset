DESCRIPTION

Move perf test cases that perform a launch into separate test class.

Test cases that require the perf underlying tool to be present should
not be executed on the build server, but should run by default.

Since this affects the build system, please make sure to run the full build locally to confirm it works as expected. When run locally with "-P build-server" the perf Launch Tests should not run, but without it they should.
