Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Most these strings should be externalized instead.

Marking all the strings and NON-NLS is hardly the right thing to do. Please abandon or change and propose one with proper externalized strings

Line:61, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/action/OpenGCAction.java -> I would rather see this strings externalized. icu4j already provides nice way for templates and parameters.
