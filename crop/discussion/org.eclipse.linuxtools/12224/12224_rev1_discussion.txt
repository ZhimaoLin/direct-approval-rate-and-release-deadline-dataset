DESCRIPTION

ctf: Put Antlr-specific exceptions in a separate class

Since CTFReaderException is in the public API, any external
plugin using it would have had to import the antlr-runtime
packages.

By isolating the Antlr-specific stuff in a separate, non-API
class, external plugins can happily continue to use
CTFReaderException without fear of leaking dependencies.
