DESCRIPTION

lttng: Disable "Value of parameter is not used" warning

Recent versions of JDT in Eclipse 4.5 now include exception
parameters in the "value of parameter is not used" setting. This
throws upwards of 400 errors with our current settings.

Bug #439750 explains the problem. Bug #441933 tracks the addition
of a new UI preference to handle exception parameters separately
from method parameters.

For now, we can set the setting to Ignore to make Eclipse integration
builds useable. Once the two bugs above are fixed, we can revert
this commit.
