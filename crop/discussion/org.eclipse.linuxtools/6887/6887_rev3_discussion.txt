DESCRIPTION

Fix initialization problems.

If host is null we need to initialize the events tabs as this is local
project and project calculations doesn't work as both current and
previous are nulls the first run.
Check configSubTabs length in addition to 0-index element.

Line:194, oprofile/org.eclipse.linuxtools.oprofile.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/oprofile/launch/configuration/OprofileEventConfigTab.java -> I assume there is a mistake in the comment because if project and previousProject were both null, you would have already gotten an exception above and this "if clause" would trigger anyway.  So, do you mean that previousProject == project or are you referring to the host?  The previous suggestion was to add a previousProject != project to the clause after checking if previousProject == null
