DESCRIPTION

Bug 508655 - DockerException in DockerConnection.open

Removed the call to `Activator.log(e)` when a problem occurs
while testing the connection settings in the wizard. Instead,
the exception's message is displayed in the error dialog, which
is more explicit to the user (no need to look for the reason
in the Error Log). Same pattern is applied on both
`NewDockerConnection` page and `EditDockerConnection` page.

Also, fixed a few generics warnings in the `NewDockerConnectionPage`
class.
