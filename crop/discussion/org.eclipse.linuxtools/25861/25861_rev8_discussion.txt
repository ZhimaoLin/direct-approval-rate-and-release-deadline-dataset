DESCRIPTION

ctf: accelerate n-grams for ctf scopes

CTF-based LTTng traces have 30-40% of their requests directed to the
same fields, this makes looking up these field _names_ faster.

Small things.

Patch doesn't apply on master. Should probably be rebased on the Event headers one.

Line:199, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> This (exact?) same method is also in the Event header datatypes patch. Those two patches should depend on each other.

Line:73, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/ScopedDefinition.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx AbstractArrayDefinition

How about lookupArrayDefinition()? That way you won't have to change it again. Up to you.

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/ScopedDefinition.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx in javadoc + link to new method

Line:133, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/ScopedDefinition.java -> add javadoc too

Line:199, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> Let's get this one in first, it's the more important and better patch anyway

Line:73, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/ScopedDefinition.java -> Done

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/ScopedDefinition.java -> Done
