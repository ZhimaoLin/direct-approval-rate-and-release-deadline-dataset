Line:44, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/abstractviewers/AbstractPercentageDrawerField.java -> Please revert the documentation it was better formatted and adhered to javadoc standards.

Line:49, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/abstractviewers/AbstractPercentageDrawerField.java -> Don't remove dots at the end of sentence. Read http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html for details.

Line:66, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/abstractviewers/AbstractPercentageDrawerField.java -> I would rather see length being calculated based on the GC size as 20 pixels would make it almost invisible on modern high resolution monitors. Also hard coding size in pixels is considered really bad approach in creating UI and modern toolkits even move away from absolute sizing and the preferred way is relative sizing between components.

Line:97, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/abstractviewers/AbstractPercentageDrawerField.java -> Where is this 40 coming from ?
