Also, in TmfEventsEditor.timestampFormatUpdated() we need to check for if (fEventsTable != null). Please add this too.

Note that the NullPointerException could happen during restart of Eclipse when a trace was open before the restart. It depends on the timing.

Line:300, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestampFormat.java -> If this method is executed in non-UI thread the receiving components will have thread access problems. (org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Invalid thread access). In an internal plug-in we see this problem when getting the timezone during a request handling.
