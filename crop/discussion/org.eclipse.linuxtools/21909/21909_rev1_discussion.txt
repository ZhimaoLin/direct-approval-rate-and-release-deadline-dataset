DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use full history backend by default

Full history is used in most places, so instead of having to specify
it in every implementation, set it as such in the abstract state system
module. Sub-classes are then free to override it if they want.

I see a few other spots where it overrides the method and returns FULL:
StateSystemFullHistoryTest.java
AbstractProviderTest.java
AbstractCallStackAnalysis.java

Patch Set 1:

StateSystemFullHistoryTest should probably keep it, it's to test that particular backend. If we ever change the default, it should stay on FULL.

AbstractCallStackAnalysis was added in a recent commit, I didn't think about it when doing the rebase.

AbstractProviderTest I'm not even sure what that *is* >.>  I'll fix those last two. Thanks!
