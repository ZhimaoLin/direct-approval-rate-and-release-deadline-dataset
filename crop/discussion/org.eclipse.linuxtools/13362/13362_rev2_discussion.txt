Just once sentence that I think could be worded better.

Line:1014, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> To me "wraps" is more synonym with composition then implementation. Perhaps it should read "CtfTmfContext is the CTF implementation of a TmfContext" or something similar.
