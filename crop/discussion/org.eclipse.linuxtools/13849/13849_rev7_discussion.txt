Line:7, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp/feature.xml -> We should add the lines
  license-feature="org.eclipse.linuxtools.license.feature"
  license-feature-version="1.0.0.qualifier"
like the other plugins now do.

Also, is the
  plugin="org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.ui"
really needed, since it's also indicated in a <plugin> tag below?

Line:7, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp/feature.xml -> The plugin= is the Branding plug-in. It seems necessary so that the feature shows up in About Eclipse. Or something like that...
