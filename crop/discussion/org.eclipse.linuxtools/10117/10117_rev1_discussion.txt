DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update tmf.core unit tests to JUnit4

Refs bug 393449.

Also:
- Added missing dispose() calls in TmfExperimentCheckpointIndexTest.
  Not doing those would fail subsequent tests in TmfTraceTest (not
  sure why this wasn't needed with JUnit3).
- Made CtfTmfTimestampTest timezone-agnostic.

Just the time zone issue, otherwise looks ok.

Line:42, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTimestampTest.java -> You forget Nepal...
Could be fixed by either calculating the correct long value for "00:00:00" based on local time, or changing the timezone of TmfTimestampFormat.getDefaulTimeFormat() to GMT in the test case.
