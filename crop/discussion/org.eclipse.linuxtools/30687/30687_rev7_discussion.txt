Line:128, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinear.java -> I still don't like it, it is internal stuff to this transform, you shouldn't need this. At least not as part of the API, you may want to keep this package-private for now. I know you need it for the composeWith, but maybe that's what should be reviewed to use composition as in TmfTimestampTransformComposite with a List<ITmfTimetsampTransform>

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmOffset.java -> Again, any reason why you need a synchronization algorithm for your use case? A synchronization algorithm is typically used to process matches from many traces. In this case, since there is no event matching to be done, the synchronization algorithm is unnecessary.

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfConstantTransform.java -> As you once mentioned, this is a problem as other plugins may implement their own timestamp transform. This method could compose transforms of the same kind, but for other cases, it could return a composite transform containing all transforms to execute. It may be a bit more resource intensive at runtime when complicated composition actually happens, but at least, it would be API-clean[er].
