DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix Linux drawing weirdness in Histogram

- Set anti-aliasing to off when drawing histogram bars because it's on
by default in Linux

- Change order of drawing histogram bars and draw one pixel too far
because Linux doesn't draw last pixel of a line

- Clamp rounded rectangle arc size to rectangle width because Linux
doesn't
