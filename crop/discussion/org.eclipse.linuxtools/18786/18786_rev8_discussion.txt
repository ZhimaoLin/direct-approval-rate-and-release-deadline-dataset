DESCRIPTION

[ctf] Hoist getLong into BitBuffer.

Even if the ByteBuffer does not support getLong natively,
the abstraction should still stay in the BitBuffer and not
at each use site.

And the complex computation for signed-extension is useless
when you let Java do the signed extension and truncate
when the resquested number representation is unsigned.
