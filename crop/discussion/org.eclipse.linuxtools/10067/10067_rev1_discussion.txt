DESCRIPTION

StapNewWizard fixed to work in workspace.

New wizards are better creating stuff in the workspace and not in random
place in the filesystem. This fixes a problem where if you had some
project selected the wizard was failing because of different roots -
system vs. workspace. 
It's a common thing for wizards to create stuff in the workspace after
all.
