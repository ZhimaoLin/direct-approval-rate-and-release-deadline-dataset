DESCRIPTION

Fix profiling tools when no profiling provider exists

- if a profiling category has no participants (e.g. coverage)
  then disable it so it does not appear in the Profiling Tools
  shortcut menu
- in the Profiling Tools Configuration view, don't add a page with
  empty combo box; instead, add a label with a message that no
  plug-ins supply a tool for the given category
- bump up profiling.launch and subsequently, profiling-feature

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

This change looks fine to me, and makes the UI much simpler in case of capabilities that aren't provided.
