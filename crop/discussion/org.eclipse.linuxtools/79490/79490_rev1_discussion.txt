DESCRIPTION

Bug 499749 - Include Docker containers in Hierarchy view

The Image hierarchy view now displays the containers based
on an image.
From a selected image or container, the hierarchy view shows
the path to the root image and all descending images and
containers (but for the parent images, only the path to the
selected element will be shown)

Moved the logic to build the hierarchy view in a utility class
(DockerImageHierarchyNodeUtils)
Added a MenuAssertion class to the SWTBot tests
