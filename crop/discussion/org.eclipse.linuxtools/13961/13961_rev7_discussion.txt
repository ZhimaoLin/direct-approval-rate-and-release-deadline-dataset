DESCRIPTION

RPM: evaluate %{?...} macros

New "evald" functions will be used to evaluate strings
that may contain %{?...} rather than evaluate everything.
Some classes from eclipse-fedorapackager depend on these
functions.

Amend1: added test
Amend2: used SpecfileLog to log error, rather than print
 to console
Amend2: changed from evaluate everything to evaluate
 some things
