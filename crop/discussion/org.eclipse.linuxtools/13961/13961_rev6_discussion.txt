DESCRIPTION

RPM: evaluate scl macros whenever resolving name

Anything accessing getname from a specfile element will
be evaluated first to check for scl macros before being
returned

Amend1: added test
Amend2: used SpecfileLog to log error, rather than print
 to console

Line:80, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/editor/parser/SpecfileElement.java -> Please keep resolve method as is and add dditional one resolveEvaled(or better name) for the eval purpose. Oh and add Javadoc for it. I know there isn't much docs in this class but we need to improve documentation incrementalry (aka at least for new things).
