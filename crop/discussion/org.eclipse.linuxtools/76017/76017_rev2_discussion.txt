DESCRIPTION

Bug 496784: Enable mass stop/kill of containers regardless of state.

If a user wishes to stop/kill a large amount of containers (eg. by
selecting all containers, the operation will become disabled since all
selected containers must be in the running state. Relax this requirement
and permit silent failure when trying to kill a stopped container.
