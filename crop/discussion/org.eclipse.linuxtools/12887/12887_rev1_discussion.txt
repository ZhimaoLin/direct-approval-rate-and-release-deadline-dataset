a time range, they can send a separate TimeSynch signal.

In most case we have to send 2 signals to change the current time range and the current time. And these signals have to be sent in that order. However, the second signal might cause the time range to change in some receiving view. 

So, for me it feels that it is easier to keep the current selected time in the time range signal.

Line:383, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> We notice the 'time' that was set is simply the view's currently selected time. Whenever that time is updated, it should send a TimeSynchSignal already.

Line:325, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> As in the CFV, the 'time' here is simply the view's current time. Whenever that current time changes it already sends a separate signal, which is why I did not repeat it here.
