One small comment, will try it next, looks great!

Line:162, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> To be super pedantic, the "Indexing" here should not be NON-NLS. It's a translatable string, so should be stored in a messages.properties file

Looks good, I want my features though.

Line:164, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> I would add an events / sec here. 
Save the getNbEvents() before the sleep and after. 
then diff * 10.
