Patch Set 1:

This was changed to private in commit 20663aab34437a5b44d470266bbcd7add58163d2. I think FranÃ§ois wanted to avoid a Javadoc warning ;)

To be 100%-clean, it should have a quick Javadoc description. Or could this class be made package-visible only?

Well, Hudson failing > potential Javadoc warnings, so LGTM.
