DESCRIPTION

Bug 521211 - Docker launch fails debugging some C/C++ programs

- using normal logging doesn't always work when debugging via gdbserver
  (e.g. a program that printfs without a newline and then uses
  an fflush of stdout)
- add a new DockerConsoleOutputStream class to core that will
  accept listeners that will be notified whenever writes are made
- change openTerminal method in DockerConnection to accept a
  DockerConsoleOutputStream as input parameter and to use this
  to echo stdout and stderr output of the terminal
- change RunConsole.attachTerminal method to accept a
  DockerConsoleOutputStream argument
- change ContainerLauncher launch method to determine when
  called to do a gdbserver launch from CDT (look at
  ContainerListener class name)
- when it is determined that we are doing a gdbserver launch,
  set the TTY option on and pass a DockerConsoleOutput stream
  to RunConsole.attachTerminal which will pass this on to
  openTerminal
- set up the DockerConsoleOutputStream to echo output to the
  normal RunConsole used for running and debugging
- when the session is complete, remove any Terminal that was
  created on behalf of the session
- change all callers of RunConsole.attachTerminal appropriately
  to pass null as last argument
- remove ConsoleOutputStream from docker ui
