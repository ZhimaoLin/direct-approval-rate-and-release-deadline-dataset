DESCRIPTION

Gcov: Log test job failures.

Within a GCovTest, when a JobsRunning wait condition times out,
print information about the failure to standard output.
Also, increase the allowable timeout of the "dump CSV" job.

NOTE: the purpose of this patch is to aid in finding the cause
behind test failures, so the changes made to JobsRunning.java
should be reverted once the failures are fixed.
