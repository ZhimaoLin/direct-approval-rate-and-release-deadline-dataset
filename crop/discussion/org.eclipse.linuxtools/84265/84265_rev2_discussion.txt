DESCRIPTION

Bug 506312 - Add remote mount support to ContainerLauncher

- add isLocal method to DockerConnection to return whether the
  daemon is running locally or remotely
- fix ContainerLauncher to use the stdin specifier given by the
  CDT code which was previously being ignored
- fix ContainerLauncher to create a volume using the Container config
  if the connection is remote rather than binding in the Host config
- if non-local, perform a copy using the new CopyVolumesJob class
  which uses the docker-client copyToContainer method
- fix TCPConnectionSettings to add a new method to get the ipaddr
  for the host which is needed to check the daemon location
