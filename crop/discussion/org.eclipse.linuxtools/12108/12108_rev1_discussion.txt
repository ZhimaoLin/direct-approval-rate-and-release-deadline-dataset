Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks good to me, works as expected:
* Graphing configuration tab allows output parsing.
* Graphing follows launch configuration parsing regular expressions.
* When graphing is enabled, graphing perspective is opened after launching script.
