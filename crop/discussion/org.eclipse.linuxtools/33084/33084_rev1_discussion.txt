DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use the class name if no ID is specified for analysis modules

Since there is no abstract method or other compile-time check, we can't
expect all modules to know they have to specify an ID. If they don't, we'll
infer one from the full class name instead of filling the log with errors.

Yeah ok... I still would have preferred to force an ID and the message is a warning for developers who forget to give IDs, but... yeah ok.

If you want to "force" an ID, the getId() method could be abstract. This will enforce implementations to set one. A mere message in the log is not "pushy" enough ;)
