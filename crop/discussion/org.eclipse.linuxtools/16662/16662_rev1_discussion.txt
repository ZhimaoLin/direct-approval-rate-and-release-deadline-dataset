Keep in mind that the way this feature is implemented doesn't allow the script to be run if the Sample Output line doesn't match the regex given. It was done this way to effectively check for numeric output.

If it isn't worth making the Sample Output mandatory for this, though, I'll think of some other way to accomplish the same goal.
