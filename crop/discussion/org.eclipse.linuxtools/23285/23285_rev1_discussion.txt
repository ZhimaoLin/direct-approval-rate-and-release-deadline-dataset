Line:32, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventType.java -> can be private.

Line:45, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventType.java -> Don't we need to do the same thing for CustomEventType?

Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventType.java -> I looked into replacing CONTEXT_ID with the trace type id so that absolutely no clash can happen but getting the persistent property every time would be too slow. I also wanted to cache it in a field but keeping it consistent would be a hassle and likely buggy. I think this can be done as part of a trace type id revamp (removing it from persistent properties...).

Line:45, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventType.java -> probably, that would be a second patch.

Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventType.java -> I agree
