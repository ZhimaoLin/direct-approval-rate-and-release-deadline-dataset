DESCRIPTION

ctf/tmf: allow multiple traces to be open with name clashing events

This is a problem not yet encountered but that will be a showstopper.
If you have two traces with event definitions that have the same name
but different payloads the second one will override the first.

This means that if I have two traces with events that are named "bob"
and we have a state provider for each that looks up different fields
in "bob", one will no longer return the correct values and exceptions
will be thrown everywhere.
