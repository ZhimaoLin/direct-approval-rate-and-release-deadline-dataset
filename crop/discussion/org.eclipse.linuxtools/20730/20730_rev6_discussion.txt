It would be nice if the change comes with tests.

Patch Set 6:

The bar-chart is showing "Category:" in the hover help along with the value.  I don't think this is needed since the name of the bar is clearly displayed below on the x-axis.  If you or others feel it should be shown, it should be the name given to the row X in the legend (e.g. Exec:).

Patch Set 6:

The reason I display the category name in the tooltip is because it's possible for the names on the axis to be cut off (when there are several bars, or when the window is narrow). Having the name appear again in the tooltip ensures that they'll always be visible.

If you don't mind having the category name in the tooltip, I'll replace "Category" with the name of the x-axis. I'll also be adding a few tests for this patch.

IMO, less is more here.  There may be other opinions.  I believe that most of the time, the title will be visible.
