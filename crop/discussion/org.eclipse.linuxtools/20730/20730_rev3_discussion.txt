DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Implement chart data tooltips.

When the user places the mouse cursor over data points
in axis charts, bars in bar charts, or pie slices in pie
charts, have an appropriate tooltip/text marker appear
to indicate the value(s) of the data point being hovered
over.

Also improve the UI of pie charts by centering its title
text field relative to the pie area (instead of the entire
chart area), and by having its pie slice colors cycle
through the same set of colors used by axis & bar charts
(rather than assigning random colors after a set number of
slices appear).

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

The patch this is one based on (Chart scrolling & BarChart labels) is getting some changes, so this patch is on hold until that one finished.

Other than dependencies on BarChart, though, this patch shouldn't change too much when the other one is finished.
