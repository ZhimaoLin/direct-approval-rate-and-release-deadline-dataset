DESCRIPTION

ctf: avoid temporary array creation when parsing CTF-Array.

The temporary List<long> is useless and the conversion function too.

Patch Set 2:

We used to store the List<Long> as the "value" directly. Then it was changed to store a long[] instead, but since we know the length in advance, we don't need the List anymore. Good catch!
