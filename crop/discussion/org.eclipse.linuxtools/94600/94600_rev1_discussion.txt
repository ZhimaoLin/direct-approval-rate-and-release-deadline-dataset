DESCRIPTION

Bug 514873 - Image Run Network Tab causes NPEs to occur in error log

- switching network modes in the Run Image Launch tab causes
  the binding of the radio buttons to issue a momentary
  value of null which causes an NPE in the validation
- fix the ImageRunNetworkModel to not accept null as a
  new network mode and simply return
