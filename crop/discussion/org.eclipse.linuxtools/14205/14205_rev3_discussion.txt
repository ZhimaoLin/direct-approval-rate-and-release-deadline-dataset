DESCRIPTION

ctf: Update project compiler settings

Now that we have eliminated all compiler warnings in the code,
we could turn on "-Werror" to make sure no new warnings are
introduced (Brenden Conley would fail building any Gerrit patch that
has warnings).

NLS warnings remain as warnings, so that they can be
suppressed in Messages or constants classes.

This only applies to ctf.core and ctf.core.tests. For ctf.parser,
since Maven also looks at generated code, we have relaxed the settings
to ignore any error/warning coming from the generated Antlr code,
over which we have no control.

Patch Set 3:

I ended up leaving "unused variable" as an error. Just as I rebased this to latest master, I noticed such an unused warning slipped into the code. I considered it a sign ;)

My main concern was that it would prevent a dev from quickly testing code that might contain unused variables. Turns out, it's still possible to run the code, and it won't stop execution since it's not a fatal error (and the checkbox "Consider all errors as fatal errors" is not checked). So in the end it's not much different than as if it was a warning.
