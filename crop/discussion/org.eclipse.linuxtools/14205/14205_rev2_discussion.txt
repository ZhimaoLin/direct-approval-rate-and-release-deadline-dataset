DESCRIPTION

ctf: Consider compilation warnings to be errors

Now that we have eliminated all compiler warnings in the code,
we could turn on "-Werror" to make sure no new warnings are
introduced (Brenden Conley would fail building any Gerrit patch that
has warnings).

Only the NLS warnings remain as warnings, so that they can be
suppressed in Messages or constants classes.
