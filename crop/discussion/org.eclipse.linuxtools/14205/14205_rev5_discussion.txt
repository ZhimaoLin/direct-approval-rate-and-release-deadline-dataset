DESCRIPTION

ctf: Update project compiler settings

Now that we have eliminated all compiler warnings in the code,
we could turn on "-Werror" to make sure no new warnings are
introduced (Brenden Conley would fail building any Gerrit patch that
has warnings).

NLS warnings remain as warnings, so that they can be
suppressed in Messages or constants classes.

This only applies to ctf.core and ctf.core.tests. For ctf.parser,
since Maven also looks at generated code, we have relaxed the settings
to ignore any error/warning coming from the generated Antlr code,
over which we have no control.
