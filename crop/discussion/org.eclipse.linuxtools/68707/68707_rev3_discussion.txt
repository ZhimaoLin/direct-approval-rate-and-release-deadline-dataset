DESCRIPTION

Bug 489533 - NullPointerException in PushImageCommandHandler$1.run

Prevent NPE by checking the connection is not null in the
 command handler
Disable the command handler in the toolbar if there is no selection
Refactored the ImagePushPage to use the same createControl() code
 style as in the ImageTagPage. Also, page is immediately valid
 if it displays a combo (ie, there is at least one image name/tag)
