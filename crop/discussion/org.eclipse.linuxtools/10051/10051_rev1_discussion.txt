DESCRIPTION

tmf: Rename TmfEvent to TmfMutableEvent

In preparation of providing two abstract base class for events
(one for mutable, one for immutable events), renamed the current
TmfEvent to TmfMutableEvent.

It loses Cloneable in the process: it's up to each implementation
to specify how they want to handle object copies.

This required tweaking a LOT of the tmf.core unit tests to
decouple them from a specific ITmfEvent implementation.
