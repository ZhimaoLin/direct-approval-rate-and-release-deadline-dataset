DESCRIPTION

Bug 499745: Guard against bad return values in connection framework.

The connection settings framework expects a null return value when no
connection settings could be provided. However it is possible to return
a list of values with some potentially being null. We should ensure our
providers don't do this and guard against this happening from extensions
we don't control.

Line:59, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/core/DockerConnectionManager.java -> Can you make sure that none of the extension implementations of IDockerConnectionSettingsProvider return a 'null' list when their 'getConnectionSettings()' method is called ? This would be a cleaner approach, IMO.
