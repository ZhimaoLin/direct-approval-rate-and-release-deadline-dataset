DESCRIPTION

Bug 499745: Guard against bad return values in connection framework.

The connection settings framework expects a null return value when no
connection settings could be provided. However it is possible to return
a list of values with some potentially being null. We should ensure our
providers don't do this and guard against this happening from extensions
we don't control.
