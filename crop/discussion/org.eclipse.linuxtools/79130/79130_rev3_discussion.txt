DESCRIPTION

Bug 499745: Guard against bad return values in connection framework.

The connection settings framework expects a null return value when no
connection settings could be provided. However it is possible to return
a list of values with some potentially being null. We should ensure our
providers don't do this and guard against this happening from extensions
we don't control.

ok, fine. Let's go with the patch as-is, then.
