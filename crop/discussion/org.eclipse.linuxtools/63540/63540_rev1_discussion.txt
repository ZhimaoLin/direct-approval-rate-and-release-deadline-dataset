Other than the issue in .classpath this looks fine to me.

Line:7, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui.tests/.classpath -> I'm not sure why this is needed as I don't see any additional errors/warnings but even if there are, they should be visible.

Line:7, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui.tests/.classpath -> I got warning on missing Javadocs on public methods because of  workspace settings in Java>Compiler>Javadoc. I reverted the .classpath file and will adjust the workspace settings or apply Javadoc fixes as time goes by.
