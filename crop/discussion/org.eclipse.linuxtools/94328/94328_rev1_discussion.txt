DESCRIPTION

Bug 497010 - Pull new version of an image

- add new writeValue observable WriteValue and tie
  it as a dependency of the ImageSelectionValidator
  in its validate() method (using ObservableTracker)
- when an image is pulled successfully and is now
  part of the the images list, write the current
  time in milliseconds to the writeValue so that
  a revalidate will occur on the image field and
  clear any warning messages regarding the image
  needing to be pulled
