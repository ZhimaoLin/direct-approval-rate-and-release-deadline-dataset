DESCRIPTION

Add Connection button in Docker Explorer should always be active.

The 'Add Connection' button of the Docker Explorer View only activates
the New Connection Wizard when the view has focus. However, its workflow
does not require focus.

To reproduce :

1) Make sure the 'Docker Explorer View' doesn't have focus, by clicking on any other view (eg. Properties, Docker Containers, Docker Images, etc.)
2) Now click the 'Add Connection' button in the Docker Explorer view and notice that nothing happens.
