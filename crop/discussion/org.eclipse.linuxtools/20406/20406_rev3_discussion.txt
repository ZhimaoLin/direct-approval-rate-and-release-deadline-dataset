Here's a suggestion: keep the archive name as it is, but rename the extracted directory to just "linuxtools-trace-viewer. That way both start with the same thing, so should be close when sorting by alphabetical order.

This is similar to how Eclipse does things: the archive is called eclipse-4.4-BLABLABLA, and the extracted directory is just "eclipse".

Hudson won't even look at this parameter, no need to wait for the CI build.
