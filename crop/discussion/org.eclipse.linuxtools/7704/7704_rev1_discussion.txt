DESCRIPTION

Change how runStap is passed the systemtap arguments

Currently runStap assumes that the only two commands used with systemtap
to parse possible probe points and functions are stap -p1 -v -e 'script'
and stap -u -p2 -e 'scipt'.  This might not always be the case and it
would be better to simply pass the full arguments themselves as a
parameter.  The functionality already exists to add the options passed
as a parameter, so we just use that for all of them.

Please address the comments, and thanks for the contribution :)

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just need to fix this typo (scipt).

Line:188, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/structures/TapsetParser.java -> Does this need to be set, or can it be removed. It seems like it'd be overwritten when the options are populated.
