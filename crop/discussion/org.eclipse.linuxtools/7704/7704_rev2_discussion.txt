DESCRIPTION

Change how runStap is passed the stap arguments

Currently runStap assumes that the only two commands used with systemtap
to parse possible probe points and functions are stap -p1 -v -e 'script'
and stap -u -p2 -e 'script'.  This might not always be the case and it
would be better to simply pass the full arguments themselves as a
parameter.  The functionality already exists to add the options passed
as a parameter, so we just use that for all of them.  Due to the level
no longer being appended in runStap, the parameter was removed from the
call.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The patch looks fine to me. Thanks for confirming that the arg line in question may potentially not be set, and so setting it to be empty is necessary.
