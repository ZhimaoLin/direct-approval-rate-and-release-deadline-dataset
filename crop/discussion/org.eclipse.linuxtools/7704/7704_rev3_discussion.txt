DESCRIPTION

Change how runStap is passed the stap arguments

Currently runStap assumes that the only two commands used with systemtap
to parse possible probe points and functions are stap -p1 -v -e 'script'
and stap -u -p2 -e 'script'.  This might not always be the case and it
would be better to simply pass the full arguments themselves as a
parameter.  The functionality already exists to add the options passed
as a parameter, so we just use that for all of them.  Due to the level
no longer being appended in runStap, the parameter was removed from the
call.
