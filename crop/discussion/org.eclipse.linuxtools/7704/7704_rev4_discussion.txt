DESCRIPTION

Change how runStap is passed the stap arguments

Currently runStap assumes that the only two commands used with systemtap
to parse possible probe points and functions are stap -p1 -v -e 'script'
and stap -u -p2 -e 'script'.  This might not always be the case and it
would be better to simply pass the full arguments themselves as a
parameter.  The functionality already exists to add the options passed
as a parameter, so we just use that for all of them.  Due to the level
no longer being appended in runStap, the parameter was removed from the
call.  In order to avoid breaking API the original runStap method has
been marked @deprecated and the new runStap xxx@xxx.xxx 1.2 .

Thanks for addressing the API issue appropriately. This looks fine to me. Based on Comment #11 I'll be marking the IP review as +1 since this is less than 250 lines of change.
