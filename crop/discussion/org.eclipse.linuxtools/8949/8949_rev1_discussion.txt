Patch Set 1:

The move is necessary because org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch plugin has a dependency to its ui counterpart plug-in, which is not correct conceptually and could cause a circular dependency. The dependency exists because there is a launch configuration tab in o.e.l.p.launch which contains a widget that is in o.e.l.p.launch.ui.  Since o.e.l.p.launch.ui has only one package and the plug-ins don't make sense without each other, I think moving the launch.ui content to the launch plugin is a good solution. No package names have been changed, so I don't think there are problems with API.
