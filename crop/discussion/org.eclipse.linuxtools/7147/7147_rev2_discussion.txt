Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The plugin org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.backup.ui.editor is not used anywhere. I think someone did it to use it as a backup, but I am not confident enough to remove it.
I prefer to avoid touching it. So remove from your patch the changes in this plugin.
Everything else is just fine.
