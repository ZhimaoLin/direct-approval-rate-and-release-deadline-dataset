DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove TmfStatsUpdatedSignal

Rework the Statistics view to not need a specially-crafted signal to get
its results. Just make it spawn a thread for queries, like every other
view does. This is now easier to do, due to the fact that we can
.waitForCompletion() on the statistics analysis module object.
