Line:18, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Suggest bumping plug-in by minor release as you are adding functionality and the plugin hasn't ever been bumped from its 1.0.0 starting point.  You will need to bump up gcov feature by minor release to 1.2.0.

Line:14, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> We no longer put our names in comments (we put Red Hat Inc. instead).  Also, automatical is not a word and I'm not sure if "Lev" is a typo or another form of your first name.  Your change should be the last one in the list. 

I would suggest "Added automatic gcov enablement" to keep it short and sweet.

Line:15, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> "they" not "thery".  Moot if you see my previous comment.

Line:18, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> Gcov support is not enabled for the current active build configuration.

Line:21, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> For a Managed C/C++ project, gcov support is enabled as follows:

Line:22, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> No need for an arrow preceding Project Properties.

Line:27, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> For an Autotools project, gcov support is enabled as follows:

A little more specific that using "it" and since I have suggested changing the use of setting above to support.

Line:28, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> No need for arrow preceding Project Properties.

Line:33, gcov/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gcov.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/gcov/launch/GcovLaunchMessages.properties -> I think you should have:

"Would you like to retry with gcov support automatically enabled for you and a rebuild of the project performed?

This will illustrate you intend to not just set the option but rebuild the project.
