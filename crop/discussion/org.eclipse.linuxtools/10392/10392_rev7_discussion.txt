Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Very nice change, "CtfKernel" has always been a bad name... 

Could you plz:
- rebase on latest master
- not add "(non-Javadoc)" comments
- split this in two commits (the rename in one, and the getEnvironnementSetup addition in another). Renames are often very intrusive in git, and it's hard to review other stuff at the same time.
- Also rename CtfKernelStateInput -> LttngKernelStateInput in the rename commit
