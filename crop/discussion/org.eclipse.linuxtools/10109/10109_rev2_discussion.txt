DESCRIPTION

Revert 9aa720e and fix ChangeLogWriterTest.

This commit reverts 9aa720e5d4384393e1f3e1cbe9d315a7a7942c60 and fixes
ChangeLogWriterTest methods that open a file in an editor. If a file is
left open in the editor, subsequent openings of a new file at the same
location will not have the proper modification stamp. The EditorPart
must be closed.
