Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

The problem exposed by the warnings here mean "closeable resources are being exposed outside of an object". That is the problem that has to be fixed. Not storing local references because it happens to not trigger (hehe) the warning is not the correct way around it.

And you'd want to store local references here, the value of getTopStream() etc. could change from one call to the other.
