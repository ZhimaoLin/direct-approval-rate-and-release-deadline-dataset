Patch Set 1:

Additional comment: I wonder if we should keep some of the source code in internal packages (internal API) as we do e.g. in lttng.kernel.core or lttng.kernel.ui.

Very nice to see this coming to open-source!

Some comments, also:

* The (non-Javadoc) comments xxx@xxx.xxx methods are not needed anymore. Those were for Java 5 and below. Now the compiler automatically uses the superclass' doc and tags. We should not introduce it in new code.

* In all the MANIFEST files (except the feature plugin), the org.eclipse.cdt.* packages should be under Import-Package, instead of Require-Bundle. Since CDT does not come with the base Eclipse platform, this allows users to use another CDT than one installed in the same Eclipse installation (like a system-wide one from their distribution, for example).

Line:115, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/gdbtrace/trace/DsfGdbAdaptor.java -> There has to be a reason why those classes are internal... It's fine that we use them if we know what we are doing, but there should be a comment explaining this SuppressWarning.

Line:3, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/.classpath -> We just use

  path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER"

in the other lttng plugins. Why is the special debug.ui launcher required?

Line:5, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.core/.gitignore -> only bin and target should be there

Line:1, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace/sourceTemplateFeature/feature.properties -> Is this file really meant to be committed?

Line:79, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/gdbtrace/trace/GdbTrace.java -> These comments are unnecessary with Java >= 6, the compiler will use the superclass' Javadoc automatically.

Yes, we have a bunch of existing code that already have those, but we shouldn't add it in new code.

Line:5, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/.gitignore -> Only "bin" and "target" are needed

Line:3, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/gdbtrace/ui/views/project/dialogs/messages.properties -> the space should be in the code, not here ;)

Line:9, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.help/build.xml -> Make sure this will be the exact path as on the Eclipse wiki, or else the 'download' target won't work.

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/pom.xml -> That bug has been closed for a while, it's not needed anymore.

Line:5, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace/.gitignore -> you only need "bin" and "target" here. The other files don't exist xxx@xxx.xxx does nothing it seems).

Line:31, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.core/pom.xml -> That bug has been closed for a while, it's not needed anymore.

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.ui/plugin.xml -> We weren't tracking copyright headers in .xml and .properties file, but it might be a good idea to do so from now on.
