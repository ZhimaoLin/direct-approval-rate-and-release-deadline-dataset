I'm a bit concerned about calling .normalize() for *every* event of *every* trace type. The performance impact should be measured.

This could be mitigated a bit by doing a "return this;" for the trivial case in TmfTimestamp.normalize(). But then this might break other things, especially in the legacy plugins...

We will keep the normalize as-is for now.
