DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use background requests for the partial histogram

Since the current time range can be arbitrarily large (as big as
the full trace), we shouldn't use a foreground request. Those should
only be for event requests that are known to be capped in time/amount
of events.

This also has the nice side effect of always getting both histograms
to fill at the same time.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

+1 for coalesced views. 
I still think we should look into a better scheduler for the request model.

Abandoned

We will do away with manual request priorities, so this change will become irrelevant.
