DESCRIPTION

TMF: Fix resource leak when trace indexer is re-created

That happens when a trace was created with the default constructor, a
default indexer is set and when the trace is initialized, a new indexer
is created again, but the previous one is not disposed and the file
remains opened.

I hear you Alex! :p 

There must be a way to use constructors with many parameters even if we use the configuration element... Can we specify the signature of the constructor so that it can be looked for by reflection?
