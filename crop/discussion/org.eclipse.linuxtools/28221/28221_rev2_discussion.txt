DESCRIPTION

TMF: Fix resource leak when trace indexer is re-created

That happens when a trace was created with the default constructor, a
default indexer is set and when the trace is initialized, a new indexer
is created again, but the previous one is not disposed and the file
remains opened.

Patch Set 2:

Not sure... but what we could do is have a separate mutable "config" object, which gets created by the information from the extension point, and then we use that to create the actual trace object, which could have all its fields set at the constructor (those for which it makes sense at least).
