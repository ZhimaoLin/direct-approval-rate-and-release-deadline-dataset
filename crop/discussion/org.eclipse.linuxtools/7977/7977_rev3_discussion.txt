DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add an ID to the AbstractStateChangeInput

The Abstract version was still, wrongly, using "CTF Kernel"
as its identifier. Replace this with a configurable name,
provided as a constructor parameter.

It's only used for naming the thread that it starts, but it
makes it a bit more clear what is happening when debugging.
