Line:29, releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.target/linuxtools-e4.4.target -> Could we keep the Eclipse project update site instead?
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.4-M-builds/
Using the simrel update site can cause the strange error seen here:
https://hudson.eclipse.org/linuxtools/job/linuxtools-gerrit/9378/console

ERROR] Cannot resolve target definition:
[ERROR]   Software being installed: org.eclipse.jdt.core 3.10.2.v_OTDT_r232_201501201253

There's a weird patched JDT in there that gets picked up.
