Is that why all the builds on gerrit are aborted? If so, push it the minute Hudson says so!

But there's no commit id...?

That was just a guess. It still fails unfortunately. I think we should try restart the Hudson instance...

I forgot the change id but that's ok, I can use the generated one.

Line:137, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestCustomTxtWizard.java -> should we just put conditions and ctrl-shift-o?

Line:137, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestCustomTxtWizard.java -> I don't know why but it gave me a warning when I tried to do that. Now it's working fine. Probably a case of refresh/clean.
