DESCRIPTION

tmf: batch import wizard smoke test

This is a sample of how to make a test using SWTBOT.
It should be a useful stepping stone to gain test
case coverage and control what we're reading.

The test features:
* a kernel trace generator
* importing a trace
* opening a trace
* navigation in a trace
* testing tracing perspective
* testing lttng perspecive

What would be nice to have:
* closing a trace
* all the other functional test on all the trace types!
