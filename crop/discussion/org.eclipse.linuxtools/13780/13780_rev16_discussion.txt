DESCRIPTION

tmf: batch import wizard smoke test

This is a sample of how to make a test using SWTBOT.
It should be a useful stepping stone to gain test
case coverage and control what we're reading.

The test features:
* a kernel trace generator
* importing a trace
* opening a trace
* navigation in a trace

What would be nice to have:
* closing a trace
* all the other unit traces!

Matthew, those should help a bit:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/17675
https://git.eclipse.org/r/17676

With 17676, the test passes on Windows (7). It also passes on Mac OS X (10.9 wooo!) when I add a bunch of waits.
