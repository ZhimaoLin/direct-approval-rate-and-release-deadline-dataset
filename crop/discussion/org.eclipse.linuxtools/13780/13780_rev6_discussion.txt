DESCRIPTION

tmf: batch import wizard smoke test

This is a sample of how to make a test using SWTBOT.
It is not elegant, yet. It may be useful to gain
test case coverage.

The test features:
* a kernel trace generator
* importing a trace
* opening a trace
* navigation in a trace

What would be nice to have:
* closing a trace
* all the other unit traces!
