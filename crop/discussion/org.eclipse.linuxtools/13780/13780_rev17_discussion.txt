DESCRIPTION

tmf: batch import wizard smoke test

This is a sample of how to make a test using SWTBOT.
It should be a useful stepping stone to gain test
case coverage and control what we're reading.

The test features:
* a kernel trace generator
* importing a trace
* opening a trace
* navigation in a trace

What would be nice to have:
* closing a trace
* all the other functional test on all the trace types!

With patch 17, for me it passes 50% of the time on Mac (4/8), sometimes it gets stuck non the Project Name text field.
Windows I got 100% (8/8).
