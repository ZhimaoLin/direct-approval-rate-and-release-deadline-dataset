DESCRIPTION

tmf: batch import wizard smoke test

This is a sample of how to make a test using SWTBOT.
It should be a useful stepping stone to gain test
case coverage and control what we're reading.

The test features:
* a kernel trace generator
* importing a trace
* opening a trace
* navigation in a trace

What would be nice to have:
* closing a trace
* all the other unit traces!

Please add swtbot to the 4 target definitions. I suggest you use the stable release available at the update site

The test itself also fails in Hudson.

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/smoketest/ImportAndReadSmokeTest.java -> This trace does not exist? It's something you wanted to add but did not commit maybe?

Also, it should be exposed through CtfTmfTestTrace, and tests in tmf.*.tests should use CtfTmfTestTrace, not CtfTestTrace directly.

Line:458, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/tests/smoketest/ImportAndReadSmokeTest.java -> You can use CtfTmfTestTrace.getTrace() to do this.
