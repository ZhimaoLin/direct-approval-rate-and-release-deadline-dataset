DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Improve "Save Log" action.

Improve the UI of the "Save Log" button on script consoles to
better indicate when and to where script output is being logged,
and to allow logs to be saved while scripts are running.

Also, to make these improvements work, fix a bug that prevents
stap script Commands from being disposed when a running script
is re-run.

Line:32, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.structures/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/structures/LoggingStreamDaemon.java -> new protected fields must be marked with since or made private if possible.

Line:10, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.consolelog/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/consolelog/actions/ConsoleAction.java -> Anithra is not working and hasn't worked for Red Hat.

Line:32, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.structures/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/structures/LoggingStreamDaemon.java -> These aren't new fields; I just moved field declarations from the end of the class to the beginning.
