DESCRIPTION

Fix initial trace time range.

The initial start time of TmfTrace is set to BIG_BANG so that the
initial time range is equal to NULL_RANGE. This allows to prevent
unnecessary histogram requests when a trace is opened.

Since its base class defaults to NULL_RANGE, it is no longer necessary
to explicitly set it in the TmfExperiment constructor.

Unit tests updated accordingly.

A fix is implemented in custom traces for possible NullPointerException
that uncovered this issue.
