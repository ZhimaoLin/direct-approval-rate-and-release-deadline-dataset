DESCRIPTION

Improve performance of event cache when scrolling up

When an event index is requested that is outside of the cache, the cache
population request always starts at the requested index and the cache
contains the following 'cache size' events. Therefore when scrolling up
outside of the cache boundaries, a new cache population request is
triggered at every scroll event.

This patch changes the behavior of the cache to increase the cache to
two blocks of 'cache size', and ajust the cache population request so
that the cache is centered on the requested index.

Very nice improvement, it stop getting stuck all the time when scrolling up.

It exposes an annoying behavior of the Control Flow view too ;) When holding PageUp/PageDown (or arrow up/down), the CFV will try to resolve every single event that gets selected, even after it stop being the selected event.
