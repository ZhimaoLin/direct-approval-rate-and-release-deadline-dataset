DESCRIPTION

Bug 479592 - Support for Docker Compose

Also added a 'DockerConnectionManager#getAllConnections()' method that
returns a list (can be empty) to use Java 8 Streams API
Also added a 'DockerConnectionManager#hasConnections()' to verify if there's
any connection (avoids checking for null and size > 0)

Refactored the BuildDockerImageJob by extracting common methods in a superclass.
