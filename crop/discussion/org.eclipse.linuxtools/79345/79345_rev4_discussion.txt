DESCRIPTION

Bug 479592 - Support for Docker Compose

Also added a 'DockerConnectionManager#getAllConnections()' method that
returns a list (can be empty) to use Java 8 Streams API
Also added a 'DockerConnectionManager#hasConnections()' to verify if there's
any connection (avoids checking for null and size > 0)

Refactored the BuildDockerImageJob by extracting common methods in a superclass.

Line:34, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/core/ProcessLogConsumer.java -> I don't see anywhere where the ready flag is used.  Perhaps it is used below somewhere in process?  This can be fixed for RC2.
