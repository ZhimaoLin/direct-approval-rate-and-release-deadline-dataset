Couldn't really test it, but you're the authority on that code ;)

Some very minor comments, not really that needed, just for future reference.

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpEventMatching.java -> Autismal comments:
* Normally private methods are put after the public ones
* You don't have to mark parameters as final, we already have warnings/errors enabled for modifying parameters. (except in cases where the compiler whines if you don't, like if you want to use the parameter in an inner thread).
