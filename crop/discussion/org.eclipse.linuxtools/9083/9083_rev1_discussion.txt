Patch Set 1:

What's reason for duplicating most of the profiling.launch.provider classes? Most of the changes that you've made could be appended to the already existing classes.

Patch Set 1:

I didn't like the idea of using System.out.println in perf and in profiling. Why are these for? Debugging?

And I didn't get the patch for oprofile too.
You added some constants and are not using them inside the plugin. Are them being used somewhere else I didn't see?

And in my opinion, I would split this patch in smaller patches. You can create one for adding support to remote unified profiller (stuff in profiling) and one for each plugin you want to enable remote profiling (perf, oprofile, valgrind)

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Thanks for both reviews. I havent' configured a Change-Id when creating this patch, so I fear I can't change this review. I'll have to abandon it and create a new one.

@Camilo: I've added a more detailed explanation for that on the reviewed patch, but short version is: local framework wasn't prepared to support different kind of objects from the remote launchers and the remote unified launchers can behave differently from the local ones in the future.

@Otavio: that System.out calls were failures of my part :(. The Oprofile change was unintended, I've  undone that. And, as you've suggested, I've split this patch in smaller parts.
