DESCRIPTION

Bug 496432: static ICON reference should not be disposed.

The static ICON reference in IconColumnLabelProvider is used for all
icon measurement and rendering. If it's disposed by any specific
instance, it will be unusable going forward. Since only one instance
should exist for the entire runtime, it should be safe to leave it.
