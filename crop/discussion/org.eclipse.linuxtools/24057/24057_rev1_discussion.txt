(2 comments)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Leave an empty line between the commit title and description. Or else Git thinks it's part of the commit title, and it gets wrapped all weirdly.

Line:1006, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx 3.0"

Make sure you have the API baseline set up, it should show errors and quickfixes that add it automatically.
