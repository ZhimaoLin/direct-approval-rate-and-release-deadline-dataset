DESCRIPTION

tmf: Re-add null annotations to tmf.core.statevalue

Revert the revert in 9885a77c775e59e8ad72d5cc4495f4d1fea1c964.

Current master doesn't compile with Eclipse < 3.8 anymore, so since
this is our new oldest-supported version, we can put the null
annotations back in (those also require >= 3.8 to even compile).

Since the package is only needed at compilation and not at runtime,
it should not be added to the dependencies in MANIFEST.MF, but to
the build.properties file. As indicated in
http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-using_null_annotations.htm

So that we don't box code too much.

Line:25, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statevalue/IntegerStateValue.java -> It gets auto-boxed already in the .getValue(). Storing it as an Integer so we only box it once, instead of every time. It doesn't change how users receive it.

I changed it here because the current .getValue() gave a non-null warning.
