DESCRIPTION

tmf: Re-add null annotations to tmf.core.statevalue

Revert the revert in 9885a77c775e59e8ad72d5cc4495f4d1fea1c964.

Current master doesn't compile with Eclipse < 3.8 anymore, so since
this is our new oldest-supported version, we can put the null
annotations back in (those also require >= 3.8 to even compile).
