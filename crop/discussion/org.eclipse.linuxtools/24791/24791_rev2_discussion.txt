DESCRIPTION

tmf : add Leaf node and Extension node in the history tree

This patch allows the use of leaf nodes and extension nodes. The leaf node cannot contain children and thus saves 50x(int+long)=600 bytes for each node (64k).

The extension nodes support adding some extensions to a core node. The core node extends the new extension node.

This patch changes the structure of the history tree.
