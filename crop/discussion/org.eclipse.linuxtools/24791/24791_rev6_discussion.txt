DESCRIPTION

tmf : Add Leaf nodes to the History Tree

This patch allows the use of leaf nodes in the History Tree. A leaf node
cannot contain children, so we can save 50 x (int + long) = 600 bytes
for each node (64k).

Note that this patch changes the on-disk file format of the history tree.
FILE_VERSION is bumped accordingly.
