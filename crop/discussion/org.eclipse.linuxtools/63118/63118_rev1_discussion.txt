DESCRIPTION

Bug 484777: SSH command should support sequential connections.

We add new keys to the SSH preferences as the user tries to use them but
JSCH expects to only load them once. We must manually inform JSCH to
reload them (using setNeedToLoadKeys). Do not add the same key if it
exists and improve the key removal logic.
