DESCRIPTION

TMF: fix bug in XML getChildElements to return only the children of a node

The getElementsByTagName() method used returns all sub elements with the given
tag under the calling element. The returned nodes are not just the children,
but also the grand-children and grand-grand-children. We want only the
children.

Looks good. Would it be good to update the XmlUtilsTest.testGetChildElements to cover this case (not returning grand-children, etc)?
