DESCRIPTION

Fix UI for OSIO Mylyn Rest Connector Attributes page

- add new OSIORestTaskEditorAttributePart to replace
  Mylyn's TaskEditorAttributePart by extending it
- modify OSIORestTaskEditorPage to remove the default
  attribute page part and replace it with
  OSIORestTaskEditorAttributePart which has more reasonable
  values for column and label widths
- fix OSIORestClient postTaskData to get the correct space
  and not search by name
- add new editor constants to IOSIORestConstants
- add empty/null checks for area and iteration values
  for OSIORestPatchUpdateTask
