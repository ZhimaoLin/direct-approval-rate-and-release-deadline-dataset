DESCRIPTION

tmf: Merge TmfDataProvider and TmfEventProvider together

Initially, there was a plan to support "traces" that had no timestamps,
and this would be handled by a DataProvider. Turns out the whole
framework requires some sort of timestamp nowadays, so this distinction
is no longer necessary.

(If a trace really does not have any timestamp, they could just use the
event rank as a sort of dummy timestamp, which is quite intuitive anyway).

This also merges Tmf{Data|Event}Request and TmfCoalesced{Data|Event}Request.
