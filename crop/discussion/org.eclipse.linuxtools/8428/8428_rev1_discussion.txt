The time range histogram doesn't refresh very well when the new range
has no events either at the start or the end. This patch properly keeps
the range.

If this fix can/should be applied to master, then it should be pushed to target the master branch (it doesn't break the API by itself). We merge master to lttng-kepler regularly.
