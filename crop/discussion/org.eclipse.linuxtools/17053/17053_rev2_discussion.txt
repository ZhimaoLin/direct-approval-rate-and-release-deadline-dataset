DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move TmfEventRequest.ALL_DATA to the interface

No reasons for static defines to not be in the interface. And it was
always confusing that ExcecutionType was in the interface, but
ALL_DATA was not.

Makes sense to have it in the interface. Just be aware that many extensions will have to update as well as Gerrit reviews need to be rebased for that.
