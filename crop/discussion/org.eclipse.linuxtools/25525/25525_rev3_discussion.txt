Patch Set 3:

Thanks for the tip! I've added the lines to the p2.inf, and tested the upgrade with a local update site. It seemed to work fine (surprisingly!).

I've also updated the feature name in lttng2.control/feature.properties, to bring it in line with the other features.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The source feature doesn't upgrade. It should work by adding another p2.inf in sourceTemplateFeature/p2.inf

also, the update.id needs to be the full id from what I tested, i.e.
org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.feature.group
and for the source feature
org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.source.feature.group
