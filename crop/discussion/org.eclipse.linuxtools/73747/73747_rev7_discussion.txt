DESCRIPTION

Bug 471670 - better support cases where the Docker connection is lost

Refactoring the DockerConnection to handle 3 states:
- unknown (connection was not opened)
- established (connection was opened and Docker responded
  to ping)
- closed

Connections are in UNKNOWN state by default, and opened when
node is expanded in Explorer view or list of containers or
images is loaded.

Connection is set back to UNKNOWN state when the settings are
changed.
