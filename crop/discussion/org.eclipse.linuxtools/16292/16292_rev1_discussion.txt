DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move statevalue unboxing method implementations to the base classes

Tweaked IntStateValue's so that they can be unboxed into a long,
since this will always be safe. The opposite however is not permitted.

Also added some messages to the unboxing exceptions, to help when
debugging.
