DESCRIPTION

Handle certain functionality even with no associated project.

In the profiling framework, a null project reference should still return
a local proxy/launcher.

The OProfile plugin assumes that there will always be a project
associated with any execution of OProfile commands (ophelp, opreport,
opcontrol). The project reference is used to determine the
project's location, and thus whether to launch the OProfile
command locally, or remotely. If no project reference can be found,
OProfile's local functionality should be used.
