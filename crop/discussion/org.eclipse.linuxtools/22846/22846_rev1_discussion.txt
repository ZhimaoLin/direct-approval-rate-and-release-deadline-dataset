DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix NPE for persitent experiment index when using text traces

For text traces the end of a trace is indicated by a NULL_LOCATION.
The NULL_LOCATION has a null pointer for the location info object
(=TmfLongLocation). In an experiment some traces are finished being
read before other traces. When a checkpoint needs to be created
with a NULL_LOCATION for some of the traces an NullPointerExeption
is generated when serializing a checkpoint to the persistent index.
