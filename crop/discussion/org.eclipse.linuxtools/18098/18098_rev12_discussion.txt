Line:68, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/StateSystemAnalysisModuleTest.java -> In this test too the trace should be deregistered from the signal manager.

But I ran it many times, and it never seemed to hang. I've added a Timeout rule too, to be safe. Do you think it's sufficient? Or we could also do the .deregister, .traceOpened(dummySignal) dance here too.

But should the assertNull fail, then the deadlock condition is back.
