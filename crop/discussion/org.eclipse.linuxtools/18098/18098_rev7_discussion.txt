We're at comments on style/comments, so it's pretty close! I'll update it in a bit.

Line:330, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> specific what?

Yeah I probably wrote this, looks like my writing style >.>

Line:102, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> This could have remained in both case's, to scope the variable. Meh that's pretty minor.

Line:112, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> extra empty line

I personally put an empty line after break's, but if the cases are small like here it's fine either way.

Line:102, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Ok I'm bad, I conveniently forgot that case doesn't restrict the scope, unless you add {} manually...

Line:112, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> ...and I'm doubly bad, there is no extra line, the line length just happens to be equal to the max width for Gerrit.
