DESCRIPTION

remove dependency from profiling.tests to ptp

- there is undesired dependency from profiling.tests to
ptp, we cannot run valgrind tests because we don't pull in ptp
and valgrind tests depend on profiling.tests which require ptp.
- in reality profiling.tests plugin does not need ptp, there
is only one test plugin that use this functionality, 
so it is moved there for now and ptp dependency is removed from
profiling.tests
