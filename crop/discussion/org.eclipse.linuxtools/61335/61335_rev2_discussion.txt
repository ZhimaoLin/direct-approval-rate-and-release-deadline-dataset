DESCRIPTION

test to see which tests use ptp.rdt DO NOT SUBMIT

- there is undesired dependency from profiling.tests into
ptp, we cannot run valgrind tests because we don't pull in ptp
and these tests depend on profiling.tests which use this.
I need to run build to see who is actually using these functions
DO NOT SUBMIT
