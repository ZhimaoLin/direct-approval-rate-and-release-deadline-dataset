Line:364, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Is it really necessary? We are creating on demand a brand new map, so nothing to protect here and if someone else wants to add properties to it, at least they can. The fTrace.getEnvironment() was immutable, hence the gymnastic here to addAll and add a new element, but it was exposing a class's map. Here, the only victim of a map modification would be what would be displayed in the properties view, no object will suffer.

But i can make it immutable if you wish
