DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove height paint listener in TimeGraphCombo

The paint listener added in 4b7ea26f is causing big scalibility problems
in the time graph views. For instance, using a view with ~6000 entries made
scrolling vertically extremely slow.

Simply removing it pretty much removes the issue (the 6000-line view now feels
the same as "standard" Control Flow View). And it doesn't seem to reintroduce
the misalignment bug either, on Linux at least. Perhaps the rest of 4b7ea26f
was enough?

This will probably have to be discussed with Patrick. In any case, it fixes the scalability problem we observed, and can be cherry-picked in the meantime.

Abandoned

Yeah, the new patch includes this one, plus actually fixes what the listener was for.
