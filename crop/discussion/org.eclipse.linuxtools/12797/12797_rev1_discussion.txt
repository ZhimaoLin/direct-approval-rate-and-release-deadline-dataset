Keeps working fine, but out of curiosity, what problem was it fixing? I was not able to select more than one event or one editor at a time already.

1. You could give focus to any unrelated view and select Edit > Add Bookmark... and it would add a bookmark to you last selected editor. If you try the same thing with a Java editor the menu option would be disabled.

2. You could select the search/filter row of an events editor and select Edit > Add Bookmark... and it would do nothing.
