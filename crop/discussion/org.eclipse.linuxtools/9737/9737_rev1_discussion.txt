Patch Set 1:

I'll put the review of the whole branch here, it'll be more simple for both of us ;)

* You export a package tmf.core.synchronization in tmf.core's Manifest, but it does not exist. It should be tmf.core.event.matching?

* In TmfEventMatching you use Hashtable, but those are kind-of-depracated in recent Java versions (like Vectors). You should use HashMap. Also it's usually better to declare using the interface, in this case Map, and use that for return values and parameter. ie:

protected Map<String, Event> matches = new HashMap<String, Event>();

* There are some unused and unchecked conversion warnings. We should not introduce warnings in any new code, and the settings are now saved in git tree, so you should see them too. If you don't, let me know.
