Patch Set 1:

In Linux systems, the filter export would hint the user to save the filter as name.xml instead of name.filter.xml. Therefore, during the import, it would not recognize the xml as a valid filter (it was not possible to see the filter at all in the file browser).

This is a simple patch where filters are now saved as name.xml which fix this bug. This also preserve backward compatibility.

The problem does not happen on Windows.
