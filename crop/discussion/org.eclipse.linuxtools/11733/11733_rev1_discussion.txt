DESCRIPTION

tmf: Simplify ITmfEventField's API

Use a Collections.unmofiableMap to store the event fields
internally, which allows us to expose the map directly through
the API (no need for 2-3 getter methods).

Also removed the notion of index from fields (like getFields()[1]).
Fields can't be expected to be in a constant order from one trace
to the other (even if they are of the same type), a Set is a much
more representative structure. In addition, two separate fields
should NOT have the same name. Even if it makes sense internally,
it wouldn't make sense in the display. A unit test was wrongfully
testing this case.
