DESCRIPTION

ctf: avoid array creation to iterate through scope types.

The array creation is useless in this case.
It come from the exposed API of the scope which expose an "Array"
instead of an "Set".

The collection is not important to iterate through.

Patch Set 2:

Feel free to fix (or ask to be fixed) when you find some.
I'm a human and I'll forget some too. (Specially the "s" in english).

A "good" threshold to maximize "our" time should be the right decision between adding a comment or fixing it and committing it.
