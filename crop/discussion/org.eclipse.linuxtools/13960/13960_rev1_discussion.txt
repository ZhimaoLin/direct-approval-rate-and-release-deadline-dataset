Patch Set 1:

I haven't had a chance to look into Alex's suggestion of using http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.ca/2011/01/implementing-shared-licenses-with-37m5.html (http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2FwhatsNew%2Fpde_whatsnew.htm). I don't know if Tycho supports that property, and even that doesn't guarantee it'll be transferred over to the source feature.

I have nothing against approving this, and reverting later in the event that we can do it through the method mentioned above.
