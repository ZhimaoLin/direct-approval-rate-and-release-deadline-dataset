- do we xxx@xxx.xxx (supresswarnings everywhere)
- de we want final BitBuffers, change in way of working.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Does not apply on current master.

I would keep xxx@xxx.xxx stuff for a separate patch. It really bloats this one, and adding SuppressWarning everywhere isn't a huge improvement...

Maybe a tradeoff would be to keep the ByteBuffer xxx@xxx.xxx but have the constructor not annotated and do a nullcheck/throw IllegalArgumentException if it is null.
