DESCRIPTION

tmf/lttng: Migrate remaining users to the state system analysis

- Removed the VerifyHistoryFile program, this dates from long ago,
  these checks can now be done via unit tests.

- Removed the BasicStateSystemExample. Doing a range query on the
  full range of the trace?!? That's a good example of what NOT to do!

- Tweaked the GenerateTestValues program to use the analysis module
  instead.
