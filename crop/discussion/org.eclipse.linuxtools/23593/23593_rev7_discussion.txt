I like this, I would prefer if we merge it with the rest of live as a one shot (different patches but close time wise)
You ok with that?

Patch Set 7:

This has been approved more than one month ago now. Do we still want to delay merging this?

The more we wait, the more difficult it becomes to rebase. The goal of making small patches is to make it easier to review, but also to be able to merge big parts piecewise. If we decide only merge fully-reviewed branches, we lose the second point.
