I haven't reviewed the code, but I did try the patches. Looks ok, as far as session create, but if you try to import a trace from a live session, it's the batch import wizard that opens instead of the window to import the trace.

If it's a temporary drawback, please mention it in the commit message or in a comment, so I don't consider it as a fail ;-)  I'll review the code later if you guys don't get to it first.

Thanks for the comment! I'll look into the import issue. At this point, I'm not even sure what "import" should be for live. But at least, when the session is stopped, it should import correctly so I'll look into that.

I also want to add a few test and update the documentation as part of this patch (shouldn't be big). I'm also not sure about the term "Normal mode"...
