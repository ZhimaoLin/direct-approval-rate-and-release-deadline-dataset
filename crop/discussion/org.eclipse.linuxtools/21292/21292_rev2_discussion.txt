DESCRIPTION

oprofile: user-friendly error dialog when ophelp fail

On ophelp -X failure to parse the output it were throwing an generic
opcontrol-related error message which usual don't give
any hint about the problem.

Changed to print ophelp-specific xml parsing related error message
when appropriated.
