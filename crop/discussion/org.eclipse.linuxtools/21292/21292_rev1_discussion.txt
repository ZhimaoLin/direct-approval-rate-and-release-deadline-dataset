DESCRIPTION

oprofile: user-friendly error dialog when ophelp fail

On ophelp -X failure to parse the output it were throwing an generic
opcontrol-related error message which usual don't give
any hint about the problem.

Changed to print ophelp-specific xml parsing related error message
when appropriated.

Patch Set 1:

The reason for this patch is to instead of through an exception, print a nice error message then the ophelp -X output isn't an xml, for instance:

xxx@xxx.xxx org.eclipse.linuxtools]$ ophelp -X
Unable to open cpu_type file for reading
Make sure you have done opcontrol --init
cpu_type 'unset' is not valid
you should upgrade oprofile or force the use of timer mode
