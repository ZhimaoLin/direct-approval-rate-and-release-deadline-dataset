Looks good. Small changed. See the comment inline

Line:557, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> While this code makes sense. It does not agree with the idea of the function. In addition this gets called once for every child in the tree.
Perhaps after setting the enablement for the whole composite you can add a call to removeGraphButton.setEnabled(false); and
copyGraphButton.setEnabled(false);
