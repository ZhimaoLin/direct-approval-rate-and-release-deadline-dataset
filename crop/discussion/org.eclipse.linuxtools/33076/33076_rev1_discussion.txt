DESCRIPTION

statesystem: Remove duplicate empty state creation

The transient state already creates a "null" value for every state
attribute that is added. No need for the attribute tree to do an
explicit insertion immediately after (which gets ignored any way).

That attribute tree should also keeps its paws off the transient state,
but that's a different problem.
