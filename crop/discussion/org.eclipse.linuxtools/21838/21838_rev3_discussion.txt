Meredith Scott, does the small simplification look OK to you? I don't want to +1 my own code ;)

Patch Set 3:

Hi Marc-Andre

I'm ok with the simplification. However, I've noticed that there is already a selection listener added to fTraceTypes a few lines above. I'll move your implementation there and remove the the second listener part.

Thanks
Meredith Scott
