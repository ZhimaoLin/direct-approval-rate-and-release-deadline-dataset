DESCRIPTION

Bug 508657 - NoStackTrace in RunDockerImageLaunchConfigurationDelegate.launch

Externalized the deserialization of port bindings, converting a `List<String>`
containing serialized values into a `Map<String, List<IDockerPortBinding>>`.
Added tests on the `LaunchConfigurationUtilsTest` class.

Also:
- fixed a bug where the list of images displayed in the combo
would not be populated.
- fixed a bug where the current, selected connection in the Docker Explorer view
would be used instead of the selected connection in the launch editor, causing
some errors if the currently selected connection was not opened.
