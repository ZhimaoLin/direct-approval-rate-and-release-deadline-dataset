Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1 IP-Clean-1

I think I preferred the older version of the mole (not too zoomed-in so you don't see as much detail. But that's the point, you shouldn't see much detail in such a small icon).

The U is good, but the K is hard to see. Perhaps it should be green too? Also imo there should not be blur of any kind, the icon is too small for that.

If you wish to use Suchakra's icon, please have him sign-off on the commit too (which will require him signing the CLA), to have him approve of us using his art in Eclipse ;)
