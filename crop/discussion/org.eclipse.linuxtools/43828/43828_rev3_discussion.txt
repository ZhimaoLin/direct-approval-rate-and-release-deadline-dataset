DESCRIPTION

Bug 462090: Fix issues with working directory / binary lookup.

Always assume that if a binary's path is relative, it is relative to the
project's location. If a binary's path is absolute, don't assume the
working directory should be 2 levels above it. Instead, always expect
the working directory (whether local, or remote) to be the value set in
the launch configuration.

Patch Set 3: Verified-1

I need to figure out exactly how the remote capability is being used because sending the binary over is broken. Perhaps synchronized projects still work.

Roland, what's going on here? You submitted the patch and you gave it -1 and it stays for months and is not appliable now too. Would you please get this one finished?

Roland, what is the status here? We should try not having gerrits stay for months without action.
