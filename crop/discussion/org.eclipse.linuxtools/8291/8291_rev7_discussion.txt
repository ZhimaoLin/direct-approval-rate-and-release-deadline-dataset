Line:48, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> This author tag is not correct and in general it's preferred to not be used but only list people inthe contributors in the header.

Line:70, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> What is this logging buying us ? Do we really need so much of it?

Line:99, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> Please never catch Exception as this would catch RuntimeException too.

Line:149, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> Why do we need this method? Can't the one called be used directly?

Line:70, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> I am not a fan of logging either.
I have removed it.

Line:99, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> I have added a patch at the end of this series which cleans up the use of Exception in this and related classes.

Line:149, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptBaseAction.java -> I have added a patch deprecating this function and removing its use.
