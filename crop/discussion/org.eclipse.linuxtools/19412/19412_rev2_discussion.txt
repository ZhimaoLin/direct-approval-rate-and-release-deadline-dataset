DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move the trace statistics to the analysis framework

By itself, this patch causes a bug where the Statistics view will not be
populated unless it is re-opened *after* the trace has been loaded.

The patch following this one fixes this (and unfortunately, that one
depends on changes from this one, so it wasn't trivial to re-order them).
