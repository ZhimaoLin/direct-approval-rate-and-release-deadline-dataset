DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move the trace statistics to the analysis framework

By itself, this patch causes a bug where the Statistics view will not be
populated unless it is re-opened *after* the trace has been loaded.

The patch following this one fixes this (and unfortunately, that one
depends on changes from this one, so it wasn't trivial to re-order them).

(3 comments)

Ok, I'm digging out closed patches lately, I didn't review it when it was time, but here are some comments I see, now that I'm exploring the class ;-)

Line:85, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModule.java -> You could have overridden the setTrace method and add those there.

Line:89, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModule.java -> If one of them is ok, then a job is running for it, you should cancel both analysis before returning false

Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModule.java -> Again, one may have returned but the other may still be running, so cancel both here (it won't have any effect if it's already completed or cancelled)
