DESCRIPTION

TMF: [WIP] Implementation of LttngKernelAnalysis requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements as well as his
domain type. We also make a correction so that the abstract analysis returns an
iterable and not a list. The lttng2.core.session package is imported to make
use of the session configuration strings.

Patch Set 3:

I added a unit test to generate a session configuration file for both the ust memory analysis and lttng kernel analysis. I was able to load the kernel analysis and start a trace session, I will do the same for the ust with the liblttng-ust-libc.

See comment in ust about deleting the XML file after the unit tests.

I tried the generated XML session file and, it works, after editing the session path.
