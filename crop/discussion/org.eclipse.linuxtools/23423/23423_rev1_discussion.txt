DESCRIPTION

TMF: [WIP] Implementation of LttngKernelAnalysis requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements as well as his domain type. We also
make a correction so that the abstract analysis returns an iterable and not a list. The lttng2.core.session package is imported to make use of the session configuration strings.

How do you go from this to the session configuration XML? Is there a patch still in the pipeline to do that?

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> Requirements are an on-demand thing. I wouldn't put it as a list, but rather create the list on-demand. It's not called frequently, there isn't a lot of work involve, but it would use memory uselessly.

There is a path coming that will be able to use the requirements through the helper and generate the session configuration.
