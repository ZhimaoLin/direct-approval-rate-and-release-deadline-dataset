configuration strings.

Minor comments. And what happened to domain requirement type?

Also, if you had a few more weeks time, how would you go about linking this with the trace generator (lttng Control)? That should be worth mentioning along with the TODOs in the developer guide.

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModuleTest.java -> There should what?

Line:108, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> You removed the domain requirement type. Why?

By linking to the trace Generator, you mean adding a feature to lttng Control making possible the generation of a session configuration file with requirements?

Line:108, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> We used the domain requirement in order to generate a default session configuration. It could not be done without knowing the domain type.

Now, we add the minimal requirement for this analysis to work properly: the events. With only these, the session configuration will be able to be generated since a session with the domain type should be available.

We can add it back to assure we are using it for the good domain type. Should we?

Yes, that's what I mean. Do you have some thoughts on how we could do easily the whole chain, from the analysis to the trace with minimal effort by the user?

Line:108, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> Yes, I think it's quite necessary because you could have a session for a UST domain, but this is for Kernel, so you couldn't apply those requirements to it.

Patch Set 5:

========================================
Add events from an analysis to a session
========================================
From the Control view, once we create a session, with a right click on the session, we would have access to a new option: Enable event (from analyses). At the session level, that would spawn a default channel. 

Once clicked, we would have a list of the analyses with their needed events dialog. Optional priority events could be selected/unselected opposed to mandatory events that would be selected by default.

Finally, the user makes his choice and the session would be updated.

* I limited myself to events but it could be anything else since the requirements are quite generic. For instance, we could have the same thing for context.

======================================
Generate a session configuration file
======================================
A right click on a session would spawn a new option: Generate session configuration. The user would have to provide a path to where the session file would be saved.

Sorry for the previous weird formatting. There are two sections. The first: Adding events to a session from analyses. The second: Generate a session configuration file from a session.
