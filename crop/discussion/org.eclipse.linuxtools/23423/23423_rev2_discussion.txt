DESCRIPTION

TMF: [WIP] Implementation of LttngKernelAnalysis requirements

The events needed by the analysis are added as requirements as well as his
domain type. We also make a correction so that the abstract analysis returns an
iterable and not a list. The lttng2.core.session package is imported to make
use of the session configuration strings.

This patch is pretty much ready imho. I'll wait for the full series to be in to +1 it (or further comment it depending on the rest ;-)
