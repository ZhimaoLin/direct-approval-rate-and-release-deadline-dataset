Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> If Mathieu is also an author, you should use another Signed-off-by line. This will ensure that he has signed the Eclipse CLA when this patch is pushed to Gerrit.

Line:30, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModuleTest.java -> if this is your fixture, it should not be static/final. It should be re-generated for every test xxx@xxx.xxx methods.

Although here it doesn't matter, there is only one test method, but more may be added in the future.

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModuleTest.java -> else on same line as }

Line:88, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> If this array isn't meant to be modified aftewards, you can now use ImmutableList, which will have better read performance (and no potential synchronization issues).

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> same. in fact this list is constant, it could be defined statically, instead of regenerated every call. Perfect use for ImmutableList!

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/AllTests.java -> update the location. Or just say "Test suite", it's guaranteed to work everywhere ;)

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/AllTests.java -> put them in alphabetical order

I'll make the same changes on the other analysis implementation of requirements.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/LttngKernelAnalysisModule.java -> Good point! Does it matter even if this won't be called often?
