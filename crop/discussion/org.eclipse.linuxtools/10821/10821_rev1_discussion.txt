Export Script command works as expected, however, when trying to create a new dashboard module an NPE is thrown.

Line:72, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.dashboardextension/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/dashboardextension/actions/CreateModuleHandler.java -> NPE being thrown here when trying to create a new dashboard module.
