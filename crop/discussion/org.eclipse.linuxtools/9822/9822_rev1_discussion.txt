DESCRIPTION

Use the CDT CEditor instead of our own half-baked C editor.

The action is changed from double click to popup menu. It makes it
easier to find as double-click on the ruler is what everyone considers
as toggle breakpoint action.

Can CEditor be deleted after this patch ? If so might as well delete it now.

Line:47, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/hidden/KernelSourceAction.java -> This and a few other lines are missing //$NON-NLS-1$

Hmm... double clicking on the gutter inserts a breakpoint instead of a systemtap probe

It would not be just CEditor but it's whole package, preference page for it, modifying the stp editor preference page to not be tab, deregister stuff in project.xml. That's why I would prefer to have the functional change separated from the big deletion.
