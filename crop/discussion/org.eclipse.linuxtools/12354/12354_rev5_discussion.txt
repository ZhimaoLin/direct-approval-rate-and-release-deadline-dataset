Patch Set 5:

Small rework that puts "tm" as a field in TmfView, so that all views can access it easily.

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> Naming convention. Use a better name e.g. fTraceManager or similar

Patch Set 5:

Good point, I used "tm" at first to catch where it was already being used in the files (it gives a warning for duplicate name) but forgot to rename it.
