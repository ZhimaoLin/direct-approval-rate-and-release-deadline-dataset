Thanks for the fix. Very small style comments.

Do you have an example of such a trace that fails to parse with the current version?

Line:107, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDefinition.java -> If we're changing this line, might as well correctly space it out at the same time (ctrl+shift+f)

Line:400, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInput.java -> you can remove the extra set of parentheses

Hmm wait a minute, this is an API break (BitBuffer is in the public API, and its .position() methods change), so this will have to be pushed to the lttng-luna branch instead.

I'll take care of it...
