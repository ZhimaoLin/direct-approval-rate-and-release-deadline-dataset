DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Refactor regex generator into its own class.

The feature for generating regexs from the "printf" statements in a stap script was
originally included in SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab. Refactor it into its own
class so that it may be easier to use in tests.

Line:2, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapRegexGenerator.java -> Yes, this was a mistake, but I decided to keep it after all because I wrote this patch at the tail end of last year. I will correct the date.
