Line:162, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> Do we also need a protected setter? To have the same behaviour, then we need it. However, is it necessary?

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> Fix it :-) 

or use TODO instead of FIXME since nothing is broken

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/Utils.java -> I think there is a rule in sonar to have a private constructor so that nobody can create an instance of this class with only static members and methods.

Line:162, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> It's not accessed by anyone, in fact it should be final. But it's not yet because the constructor is weird...

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> ok, will externalize

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/Utils.java -> Yes, I'm pretty sure it's this rule who made me put that here.
