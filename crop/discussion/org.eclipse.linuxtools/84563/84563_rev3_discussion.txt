DESCRIPTION

Bug 507143 - DockerException in ProcessUtils$FluentProcessBuilder.<init>

Instead of logging an error when the user settings are invalid, the tooling
displays an error message and does not attempt to search for Docker Machines.

Also, refactored the code to use the ProcessLauncher utility class instead of the
ProcessUtils class that was deprecated (ProcessLauncher is a follow up for
the ProcessUtils).
