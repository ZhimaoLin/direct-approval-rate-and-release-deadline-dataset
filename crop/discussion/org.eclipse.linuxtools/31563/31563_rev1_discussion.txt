This patch is for a standalone PCAP parser feature. As we discussed we are going to deliver a PCAP TMF feature for analysing PCAP traces in TMF. This feature can be separately installed by the user without e.g. LTTng

As discussed I'll update the patch for that. Thanks for starting the feature.

Line:23, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap/pom.xml -> 1.0.0

Line:15, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap/build.properties -> after adding p2.inf file also add it in this file

Line:5, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap/feature.xml -> version should be 1.0.0

Line:32, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap/feature.xml -> PCAP UI is missing
