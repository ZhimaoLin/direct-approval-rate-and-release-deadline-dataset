DESCRIPTION

RPMStubby: Stub specfile in proper dir B#414589

it will place it into the SPECS folder, else it will be
placed into the base directory.

Line:2, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/AbstractGenerator.java -> See http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php for the rules on updating copyright notices. (ie. I think you could put 2012,2013 although leaving it as 2012 is just as valid).

Line:58, rpmstubby/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpmstubby/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpmstubby/AbstractGenerator.java -> I think this approach is fine for now. Please add a //$NON-NLS-1$ to mark the string as not needing internationalization.

See RPMHandlerUtils#getRPMProject for how the project layout (FLAT, RPMBUILD) of an RPM-natured project is determined.
