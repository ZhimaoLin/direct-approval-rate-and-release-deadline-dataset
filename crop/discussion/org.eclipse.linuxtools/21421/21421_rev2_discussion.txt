DESCRIPTION

[WIP] tmf: Move the tmftracetype extension point to tmf.core

Split the current "tmf.ui.tracetype" extension point into a
tmf.core.tracetype and tmf.ui.tracetypeui. "tracetypeui" refers to
the ID of the "tracetype", to add UI elements like type-specific icon
and events editor.

This separation makes it possible to unit-test the trace validation
without depending on UI/SWTBot tests. We will also eventually be able
to handle trace opening/validation in completely headless mode.
