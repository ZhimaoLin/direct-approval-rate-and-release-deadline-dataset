Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check in

Pretty cool! Before merging, could the author(s) please:

- add a sign-off line in the commit message (git commit --amend -s)
- add the IP statement as a comment on this page.

Also, there's an unused import in the file, might as well fix it at the same time.
