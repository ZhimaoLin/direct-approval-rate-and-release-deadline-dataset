Alexandre: I would, but I don't know how to do that. I tried to play with the gridlayout but the buttons stay on one line...

Patch Set 4:

Simon/Alexandre: The way to do it would be to have a GridLayout for the buttonComposite with 2 columns.

But the code is using method createButton() which assumes a parent Composite with a GridLayout initialized to 0 columns (as per method createButtonBar()), and the method increments the number of columns for each added button. So the number of Control can never exceed the number of columns in the layout, and therefore wrapping never happens.

You would need to instantiate each Button without using createButton(), or overwrite the numColumns to 2 in the layout after creating all buttons.
