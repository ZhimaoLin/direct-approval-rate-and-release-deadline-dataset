Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This is very useful to select ranges of entries quickly rather than selecting each one individually.

Patch Set 3:

Cute. But maybe I would put the check all/uncheck all buttons one below the other, like:

  Check All   <small spacing> Check Selected
  Uncheck All <small spacing> Uncheck Selected
