DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Allow >1 regexs to parse graph output.

In Run Configurations->Graphing, allow creation of multiple regular expressions
for parsing graph output. In other words, enable capturing data from more than
one type of pattern from a script's output. Include a test for this feature.

Also, deprecate features that are not compatible with this multi-regex setup,
such as "Import/Export Datasets" and "Modify Parsing Expression".
