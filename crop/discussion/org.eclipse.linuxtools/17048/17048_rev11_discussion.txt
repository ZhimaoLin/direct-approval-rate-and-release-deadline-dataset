DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Allow >1 regexs to parse graph output.

In Run Configurations->Graphing, allow creation of multiple regular expressions
for parsing graph output. In other words, enable capturing data from more than
one type of pattern from a script's output. Include a test for this feature.

Also, deprecate features that are not compatible with this multi-regex setup,
such as "Import/Export Datasets" and "Modify Parsing Expression".

Looks good.  I like this version much better.

Line:302, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/test/swtbot/TestCreateSystemtapScript.java -> You should add an additional test to ensure that the values can be found in the run configuration after hitting Apply.

Line:47, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/messages.properties -> Would suggest a newline before next stuff.

Line:51, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/messages.properties -> I would prefer this be Graph Set n with n starting at 1.  This makes sense to me since we don't name the regular expressions in this version and each expression might have multiple graphs.    You might consider adding the regular expression used somewhere on the Data tab for each Graph set.

Line:5, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.graphing/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> No need to jump to 2.2.0.  The versions don't match the linuxtools overall version number and should increase only as needed, in this case 2.1.0.

Line:21, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.graphing/pom.xml -> Same comment.  You should not jump by .2.  This should be 2.1.0.

Line:401, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/launcher/SystemTapScriptGraphOptionsTab.java -> Good.  Do you verify this in test?

Line:5, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.graphing/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I originally had this at version 2.1.0, but Alex requested for version numbers to match Linuxtools. We should probably talk about this together to come to an agreement on what number to use.
