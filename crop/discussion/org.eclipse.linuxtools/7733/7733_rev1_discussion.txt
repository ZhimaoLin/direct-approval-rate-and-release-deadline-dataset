Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please re-submit without tabs or trailing spaces. (I use a modified profile with Preferences > Java > Formatter > Edit > Indentation > Tab policy > Spaces only).

This change might also be useful and relevant in the TimeGraphCombo widget. The TimeGraphEntry menu listener could be passed to the TreeViewer's tree, and both the TimeGraphEntry and TimeEvent menu listeners could be passed to the TimeGraphViewer. It might require a wrapper to prevent filler tree items from invoking the menu listeners (see SelectionListenerWrapper for an example).
