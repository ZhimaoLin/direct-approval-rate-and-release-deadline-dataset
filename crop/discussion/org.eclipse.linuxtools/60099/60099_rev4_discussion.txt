The following change to VagrantConnection (which went in last week) would conflict with yours so you'll have to rebase on top of it : http://git.eclipse.org/c/linuxtools/org.eclipse.linuxtools.git/commit/?id=4346c1865a480ee1b473a2368e9261a2c454ced1

Line:195, vagrant/org.eclipse.linuxtools.vagrant.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/vagrant/ui/wizards/CreateVMAdvancedComposite.java -> This println statement should be removed.
