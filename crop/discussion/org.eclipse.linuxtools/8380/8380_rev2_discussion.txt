DESCRIPTION

tmf: Store totals separately in TmfStatistics

This allows the get*Total() methods to query the state directly.
With that, no need to get the map of events per type (which was
already longer by itself), and then add its contents at every
single query.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

The start.getValue() part should normalize the timestamp to nanoseconds, but this will be fixed in the next version of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/8376/ (where we will change both at the same time).
