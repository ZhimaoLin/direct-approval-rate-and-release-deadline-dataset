DESCRIPTION

Bug 440843 - High CPU usage for library hover generation at startup

- add check for modification time of the devhelp libhover file
  compared to the input directory
- rewrite the devhelp parser to collect all the function links
  based on file name and then to process each file one at a time
  and gather the whole set of functions at once
- bump up the minor release of the devhelp plug-in and libhover feature
