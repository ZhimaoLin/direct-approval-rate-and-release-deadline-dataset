Patch Set 2:

We actually use org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui since the bundle contributes extensions to some extension points for building C/C++ projects. Without the bundle, building the project fails to produce executables.

See commit 9319bcfc8cc3b4ddd5700a30d19e53d01de23cf9 for more details.

org.eclipse.ptp.remote.remotetools.core, org.eclipse.ptp.remotetools.environment.generichost, org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui also contribute extensions to extension points needed to run the remote tests.

If you take a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/11612/ you'll see that I've tried to keep the set of ptp bundles we depend upon to a minimum, but those 3 were necessary to get the remote tests passing locally when run as a tycho/maven build.
