Patch Set 1: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this; Unclean IP, do not check in

Marking as "unclean IP" for now. This will most probably require a CQ, so I'll move it back to +1 once it's sorted out.

Code looks good, although there are many whitespace errors (Gerrit makes it easy to see those ;) ). You can go to Java -> Editor -> Save Actions in the Preferences and turn on "Remove trailing white spaces on all lines" option to easily fix those.
