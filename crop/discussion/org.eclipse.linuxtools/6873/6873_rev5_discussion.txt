Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Cleaned up the Javadoc, xxx@xxx.xxx annotations etc. I moved the message.properties update to this commit since TimeGraphFilterDialog uses them.

Marking as IP-clean, after verification, since most of the TimeGraphFilterDialog comes from an existing file in Eclipse (org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.CheckedTreeSelectionDialog), it does not count in the number of "new" lines of code.

Looks good to me, I just want to make sure you are aware that the prefix TmfTimeFilterDialog is used for another concept within the messages.properties/messages.java files. We might want to rename them to avoid confusion.

Will verify, 
looks good. 
IP-wise, are we allowed to push a 480 line patch?

>the prefix TmfTimeFilterDialog is used for another concept within the messages.properties/messages.java files

Yeah I noticed that, but I don't think it matters ;) We'd get warnings for duplicate entries in the .java file anyway, so until we get actual clashes we should be fine.

Long term, we should aim to have message.properties files per package, and not just per plugin, but that's another beast...

> IP-wise, are we allowed to push a 480 line patch?

See my comment from Jan 24 5:29 PM. Most of the file comes from an existing file in Eclipse. I verified with the legal team and in such cases, the existing code does not count towards the size of the "new" contribution.

this patch appears to do nothing at all! nothing at all! +1 (It allows another patch to filter the cfv. )
