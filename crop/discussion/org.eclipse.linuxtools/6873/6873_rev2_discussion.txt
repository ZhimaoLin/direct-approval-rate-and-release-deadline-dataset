Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; Unclean IP, do not check in

Looks good, thanks François.

Marking as "Unclean IP" until I get the OK from the legal team.

Patch Set 2:

Ok some news. This will have to go through the CQ process after all. One last thing to do before that, François can you update the file header in this file to add Poly's name, like:

Francis Mclean, École Polytechnique de Montréal - Did this and that...


Thanks, and thanks for your patience ;)
