minor point, we can discuss in depth if you wish. I don't know if there's a right answer to it.

Line:66, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/ITmfEventMatching.java -> Do we really want this or a structure that we can format as we wish... I am being annoying. :)

Line:66, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/ITmfEventMatching.java -> I implemented it this way for now, so it works with unit test.  But as these functionnalities develop and integrate with the UI, this will change for something else yet unknown

-1 to mark that this was reviewed, not because it's bad or anything :)

Line:25, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatches.java -> Plz wrap Javadoc comments to 80 columns (Ctrl+Shift+F).

Code or inline comments don't matter as much.

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatches.java -> Since there is already a getter, does this need to be protected instead of private?

Also, if it's not meant to be modified (re-new'ed), the field should be marked as final ("private final", or "protected final")

Line:55, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatches.java -> Typically, it's safer to expose the getter only, instead of the whole map:

getMatches(int index) {

return fMatches.get(index);

}

You wouldn't want people deleting or adding entries using the getter.

Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/ITmfEventMatching.java -> Interface methods are by definition abstract, no need for the keyword.

Perhaps what you wanted is a static method in TmfEventMatching?

Line:25, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventDependency.java -> If you make a new version, add an empty line here plz.
