DESCRIPTION

Bug 513029 - Fix open retry logic to be quiet and properly clean up

- change DockerExplorerContentProvider openRetry job to be
  a system job to avoid it showing up in Tasks view
- properly cancel and remove an openRetry job if the connection
  URI has been removed
- remove a job once it is complete or cancelled
- fix dispose() to loop through all open retry jobs and cancel them
- add a more accurate title for the open retry jobs (won't be
  displayed due to the job being marked system)
