This change looks fine to me. Just some minor things.

Line:88, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/NewDockerConnectionPage.java -> Did you intend to move this here ? I thought the databinding context was attached at its previous location.

Line:486, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/wizards/NewDockerConnectionPage.java -> This might as well become if (enable) since the for loop will end gracefully whether it's > 0 or not.
