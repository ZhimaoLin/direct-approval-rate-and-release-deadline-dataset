Fix NLS-related Javadoc warnings

Some new warnings slipped through in 9a9673c.

It was also externalizing strings in a test plugin, which is
not needed.

Patch Set 2:

It's a bit inconsistent, some Messages file do SuppressWarnings (especially large ones), smaller ones sometimes don't...

But I agree, I'd rather we *don't* suppress any warnings, and have some actual javadoc. Here the doc was already there, so I will just add it back and remove the annotations.
