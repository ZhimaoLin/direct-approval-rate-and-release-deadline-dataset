DESCRIPTION

Bug 468754 - Images view shows all elements at startup even if the "Show all Images" filter is unselected

Problem appeared on both Containers and Images view
- enforced the filters at the end of part creation
- changed to form title to include the number of items displayed (and the total number of items
  when filters are enabled)
- changed a method signature to simplify the refresh in CommandUtils
- Used constants to refer to the DockerExplorerView ID
- reset the toggle commands and apply the filters when the view is created
