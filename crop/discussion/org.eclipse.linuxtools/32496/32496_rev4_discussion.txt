Very nice, that's much cleaner!

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/commands/ExportToTextCommandHandler.java -> to be pedantic we should check the instanceof of each element to make sure they are of type TmfEventTableColumn... but if we have a List here, there's a good chance we have what we're expecting anyway.

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/commands/ExportToTextCommandHandler.java -> This is true for the check. But we know what we put into the List TmfEventsTable. Also this command is internal and shouldn't be reused externally.

I meant "... we put into the List in the TmfEventsTable class"
