DESCRIPTION

Fix deficiencies in our build system.

The javadoc:aggregate goal (maven-javadoc-plugin) executes on modules in
parallel. It also requires that modules resolve their dependencies for
the 'compile' scope. If it is not executed last, there is a risk of
dependency failure when linuxtools is not in the reactor cache.

The javadoc:aggregate goal (maven-javadoc-plugin) also triggers the
'generate-sources' phase of the lifecycle, which causes the 'initialize'
phase to be executed. However, packaging types of 'eclipse-repository'
perform a clean during this phase, so this wipes out our built zip/p2
repo before they can be copied over. We need to preserve our build
directory for later use.

Line:65, releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.releng-site/pom.xml -> Maybe these 2 executions can be replaced with something else like a copy-plugin.
