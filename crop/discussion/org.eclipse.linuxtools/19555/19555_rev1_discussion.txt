DESCRIPTION

tmf: Remove back-reference from HT-Node to HT-Tree

The HT-Node needs to know about the layout of the node (size, n-child)
but not about the tree in which it belongs to. Any back reference
is typically a bad design. It complicated unittests and maintenance.

  HT-Tree --->  HTNode--\
   \                     \
    \---------------------> HTConfig

This patch-set is one of multiples to refactor the HT-Tree API.
The API refactoring will lead us to a easier algorithmic refactoring.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

At most, the references could have been WeakReferences. But it's clearly demonstrated here the back-reference is not needed, only the config is important. Thanks for the cleanup!

Patch Set 1:

Weak reference is also a bad idea.

It's always better to build layer over layer, than spaghetti design.

Now, the HT_IO is fully isolated and more concepts can be insert under the hood.
