(13 comments)

This change looks mostly fine to me and can confirm it works. I've annotated the files in this review with various comments that should be addressed.

Also, please go through all your .java source files and make the whitespace consistent. There should be no red whitespace marks (inconsistent space/tab usage) for the new files you submit.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would add description below briefly mentioning what the Javadocs plugin is/does and how it works.

See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Git#Commit_messages as an outline.

Line:77, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/JavaDocTopic.java -> You could just do 'return subTopics.toArray(new ITopic[0]);'

Line:14, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/preferences/JavaDocMessages.properties -> Are these needed ? If not, they should be removed.

Line:50, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/JavaDocPlugin.java -> Is the JavadocStartupJob doing anything ? I recall Devhelp had to do some pre-processing at startup, but the Javadoc plugin lists the folders/serves the files later on.

If this isn't doing anything it can be removed.

Line:6, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/build.properties -> Can you try seeing if things work without the html files ? I don't see them being used anywhere in the devehelp plugin, or in yours, so if they aren't used they should be removed.

Line:1, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/Changelog -> This file can be removed. We don't use ChangeLog files anymore to track changes. Anything you feel is worth mentioning can always be put into the commit message.

Line:3, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This should probably be 'Javadocs Plug-in'.

Line:7, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This should probably become Eclipse Linux Tools

Line:40, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/JavaDocToc.java -> I don't think this is a special key-word. It's the label shown in the Help System, so it shouldn't be ignored. This is exactly the kind of string we'd want translated.

Line:101, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/JavaDocToc.java -> You can do 'return topics.toArray(new ITopic[0]);'

The array will of course be too small to populate so a new array will be generated of the proper type without you needing to define one.

Line:123, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/JavaDocToc.java -> Does this part of the code ever get triggered. As far as I could see, href is only called once by the underlying framework and it's null.

Is the code below from when href was an absolute file path ?

Line:24, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/pom.xml -> This should probably be just 'Javadocs Plugin-in' to match the name given in the project's pom.xml file.

Line:81, javadocs/org.eclipse.linuxtools.javadocs/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/javadocs/ui/JavaDocContentProducer.java -> This exception, if caught, should probably be logged using the logging framework, instead of just printed out. JavaDocPlugin has a getLog() method it inherits. Have a look there.
