I can confirm that this fixes the issue I was having. Just some small typos to fix, and I can approve.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just need to fix the typos on this line.

Line:163, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptAction.java -> Just some typos to fix. (belongs and to)

Line:355, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptAction.java -> setLocalScript(..), getRunLocal(), and runLocal were introduced for 1.2 so they should have xxx@xxx.xxx tag as well, but given that they aren't in the scope for this commit, they can be fixed in other commits.
