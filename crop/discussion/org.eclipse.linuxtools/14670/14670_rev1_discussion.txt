DESCRIPTION

lttng rcp: Drop Eclipse platform version requirement

We haven't exactly tested up to which Eclipse version this should work,
so might as well keep the requirement low, instead of refusing to compile
on anything < 4.3.

In fact, the RCP requires Eclipse 4 (I just tried it with 3.8 and it fails miserably). So I'll drop it to 4.2 instead. Now to find the matching version numbers...

Abandoned

Ok I get a weird exceptions at launch with 4.2. So I will assume the RCP feature needs 4.3 after all. Let's leave it like it is then.

Yannick, update your Eclipse ;)
