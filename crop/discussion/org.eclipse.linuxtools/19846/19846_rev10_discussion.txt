DESCRIPTION

DRAFT: createrepo different executions.

Testing various execution cases with createrepo.

Only command "createrepo directory" passed from direct call to execute
command. Others failed so I added tests to test each switch that was
being passed.

Some commands with 1 arguments passed (such as, "database" or
"verbose"). Testing what happens if combining passing cases in 1
execution. Also outputing results.
