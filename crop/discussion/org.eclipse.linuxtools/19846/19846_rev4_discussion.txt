DESCRIPTION

DRAFT: last check for createrepo pom.xml failure

Last test to check if fix added works on top of the change done in
G#19736.

Activate the shell "Resource - Eclipse Platform" before doing any SWTBot
tests. For some reason, it was not being focused on from the start.

Testing how far execute goes, without checking exit status.
    o gets as far as creating the content folder

Testing running of "which createrepo" to see if createrepo command
exists.
    o createrepo exists

Testing a direct call to Utils.runCommand
