DESCRIPTION

tmf/ctf: add new interface to get pre-defined data types

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be queried on
the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis who can query
traces to know whether or not they might contain the events it needs to
execute.

This can be used by many traces. The TmfSetHelper class should help
extract useful information from the set of events. At least until Java 8 comes
out.
