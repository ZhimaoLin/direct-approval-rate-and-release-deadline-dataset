DESCRIPTION

tmf/ctf: add new interface to get pre-defined data types

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be
queried on the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis
who can query traces to know whether or not they might contain the
events it needs to execute.

This can be used by many traces. The TmfSetHelper class should help
extract useful information from the set of events. At least until Java 8
comes out.
