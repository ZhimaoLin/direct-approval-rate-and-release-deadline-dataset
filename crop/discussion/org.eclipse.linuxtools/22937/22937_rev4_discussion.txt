DESCRIPTION

TMF: Replace has*Event(s) methods from CtfTmfTrace by an interface

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be queried on
the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis who can query
traces to know whether or not they might contain the events it needs to
execute.
