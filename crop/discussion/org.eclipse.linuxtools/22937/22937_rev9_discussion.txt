DESCRIPTION

tmf/ctf: add new interface to get pre-defined data types

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be queried on
the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis who can query
traces to know whether or not they might contain the events it needs to
execute.

This can be used by many traces. The TmfSetHelper class should help
extract useful information from the set of events.

I would suggest this works, I can't come up with a way to break it. :)

I see nothing wrong here. A few comments since you'll have to push it again anyway, because the chain of patches has lots of conflicts with master. I'll test it when I can fetch on master again.

Line:30, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/CtfTmfEventType.java -> Why remove private here. Should this really be package visible?

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTraceWithPreDefinedEvents.java -> You could put xxx@xxx.xxx Tmf...}
