DESCRIPTION

tmf/ctf: add new interface to get pre-defined data types

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be queried on
the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis who can query
traces to know whether or not they might contain the events it needs to
execute.

This can be used by many traces. The TmfSetHelper class should help
extract useful information from the set of events.

I like this approach. Genevieve, what do you think?

Line:127, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> white space

Line:128, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> white space

Line:361, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Get the list of declared events ?

Line:38, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTraceWithPreDefinedEvents.java -> Return a set of *event types* declared

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTraceWithPreDefinedEvents.java -> before reading a trace (after initTrace)

the compare -> in order to compare

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfSetHelper.java -> main final instead? There would be no point in extending this.

rename to TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper ?

I'm not against this approach, it looks good. Here are some comments. I'll review the 4 patches in more details when the chain of failure is corrected.

Line:126, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> why did you add this block of code?

Line:50, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTraceWithPreDefinedEvents.java -> Maybe you should mention the existence of the helper in the interface. It exists so it can play with the returned iterable and someone looking for event names (or something else supported by the helper) will eventually hover over this method and he should pointed to the right direction.

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfSetHelper.java -> +1 This name doesn't mean much, especially given what the class does.
