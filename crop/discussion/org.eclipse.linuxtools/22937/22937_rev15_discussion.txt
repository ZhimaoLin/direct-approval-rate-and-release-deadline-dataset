DESCRIPTION

tmf/ctf: add new interface to get pre-defined data types

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be
queried on the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis
who can query traces to know whether or not they might contain the
events it needs to execute.

This can be used by many traces. The TmfSetHelper class should help
extract useful information from the set of events. At least until Java 8
comes out.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> comments from PS11 weren't addressed

Line:97, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpLttngEventMatching.java -> same comment as previous file

Line:97, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpEventMatching.java -> This immutableSet could be defined statically, instead of recreating a new Set every time this method is called.

Line:96, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/CtfTmfTraceTest.java -> why add this to the constructor test? You test this in testGetEventType below.

Line:198, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/CtfTmfTraceTest.java -> getEventType() and getEventTypes() are not the same method!!!! Means this naming is confusing then.

Not against the rename, but it was gerrit AFAIK that was messed up, not puny flesh humans.

Line:198, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ctf/core/tests/CtfTmfTraceTest.java -> that was gerrit diff.
