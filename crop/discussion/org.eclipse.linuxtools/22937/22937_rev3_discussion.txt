DESCRIPTION

TMF: Move has*Event(s) methods from CtfTmfTrace to an interface

This way, other trace classes may implement this interface and be queried on
the events it might contain. This will be useful for analysis who can query
traces to know whether or not they might contain the events it needs to
execute.

Point to discuss

This would be much more powerful: 
public Set<String> getDeclaredEventSet();

then you can 
set.containsAll(set2); (this is hasAll)
set.addAll(set2) (union)
set.retainAll(set2) intersection, if s2 has 1 element, 
set.removeAll(set2) - difference operation

Line:366, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> this should maybe be in an abstract, or a java8 interface?

Patch Set 3:

gerrit reflowed my comments:

If we use sets, we have the following set operations: 

cardinatlity (#) -> size

elementof (?) -> contains

subsetof (?) -> containsAll

Union (?) -> addAll

Intersection (?) -> retainAll

Difference (\) -> removeAll

I think this would be a much better api.

Patch Set 3:

You mean the interface only contains that one public method getDeclaredEventSet and the caller can do whatever with it? Yeah I guess that could make sense. Then as Marc-Andre mentioned you would get the "has at least 2 events", etc
