DESCRIPTION

Issue warning when Polkit Configuration files for libvirt are found.

The presence of Polkit configuration files for libvirt means that
prompts for credentials may occur. Java's native command execution is
not a proper shell so credentials aren't 'remembered', and the prompt
will occur every time.

Given how close we are to the release, and that this is mainly for Linux distros, I don't mind applying only to master.
