DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add unit tests for the CPU usage analysis

The unit tests make use of the XML development trace.

Also correct the fact that a process that hasn't run yet started at -1 instead
of 0. There probably was a reason in the original implementation, but 0 works
fine now.

Patch Set 2:

Those result reflect what was before, but this patch should correct this. It's weird... though if the supplementary files were cached from a previous run of hudson... Could this be? I delete the supplementary files after the test, but maybe I should do it before as well?
