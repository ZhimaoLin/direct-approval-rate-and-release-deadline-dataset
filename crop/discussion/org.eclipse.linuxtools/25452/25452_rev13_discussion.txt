DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add unit tests for the CPU usage analysis

The unit tests make use of the XML development trace.

Also correct the fact that a process that hasn't run yet started at -1 instead
of 0. There probably was a reason in the original implementation, but 0 works
fine now.

Looks good, one minor thing though, should be 3.2 instead of 3.1.

Don't forget to update your baseline kids!

Line:130, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> 3.2
