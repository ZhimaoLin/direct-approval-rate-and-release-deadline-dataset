DESCRIPTION

ctf: Use "meta events" for lost events (bug 408373)

Instead of sending one event object for every single event reported as
lost in a CTF trace, only send one CTFEvent indicating how many events
were lost, in which time range.

On the TMF (ctfadaptor) side, we add a new CtfTmfLostEvent class to
wrap those. This way, only one entry shows up in the Events table,
indicating how many events were lost at that point in the trace.
