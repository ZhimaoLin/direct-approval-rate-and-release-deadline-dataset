DESCRIPTION

DRAFT: test change before review

Test build before review. Must pass.

Enabled build for createrepo and createrepo.tests as well as added check
for createrepo for valid createrepo version. Only continue tests if the
current system's createrepo version is higher than 0.9.8 (latest
development release as stated in main createrepo site), as well as a yum
version of >= 3.2.23.

Added a check in case the output of --version fails.

Focus on Eclipse platform shell before doing any SWTBot tests.
