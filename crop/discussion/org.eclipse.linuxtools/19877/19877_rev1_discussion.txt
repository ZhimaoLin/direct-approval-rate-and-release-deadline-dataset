Test build before review. Must pass.

Enabled build for createrepo and createrepo.tests as well as added check

current system's createrepo version is higher than 0.9.8 (latest
development release as stated in main createrepo site), as well as a yum

Focus on Eclipse platform shell before doing any SWTBot tests.
