DESCRIPTION

Provide interface for showing state type names per time graph entry

This change adds an interface to the ITimeGraphPresentationProvider to
allow user to define state type names per entry instead of one name
for all entries. This change also provides a default implementation.
In case that the entry specific name and the global name are define 
then the entry specific name takes precedence when displaying the
tooltip information during hovering operation.
