DESCRIPTION

ctf: Close CTFStreamInputs owned by CTFTrace explicitly

CTFTrace has ownership of a set of CTFStreams in fStreams. Each stream has a
set of corresponding CTFStreamInputs. Those specific instances of
CTFStreamInput do not get closed. This means that the file handles they
contain are leaked until the Finalizer thread calls finalize which is
unpredictable. On Windows, this is more problematic since this will prevent
the deletion of the trace until this happens at an arbitrary moment.
