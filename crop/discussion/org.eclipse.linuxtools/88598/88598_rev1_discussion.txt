Patch Set 1:

This doesn't seem to be working for me. I brought in the target through the API Baseline preference page but even when I attempt to delete methods from interfaces, no error messages pop up.

Would it make sense to name the baseline target after the release (4.6) or after the project (5.2) ? I only mention it because I did have to look in the file to see the Neon repository and then figure it was based on 5.2.

The problem seems to be with the Docker Tooling only. I'm getting things like :

Errors occurred during the build.
Errors running builder 'API Analysis Builder' on project 'org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core'.
java.lang.NullPointerException

It works fine on other projects.

Ok, I think I found the problem. It's not related to this change.

Patch Set 1:

The reason I named it linuxtools-baseline is that it doesn't require a user to figure out what the last release should be.  In truth, we should also have a next release target so they know to load the next release target and baseline the baseline target.  The other targets would be for users who want to work on the next major release such as eclipse-oxygen and we could name it as such instead of using 4.6 and 4.7.  So, we should have linuxtools-neon.target and linuxtools-oxygen.target.  Thoughts?
