DESCRIPTION

statesystem: Clarify that a backend can return 'null'

The "state system" itself should always return an interval and not 'null'.
The backend however may contain "holes" while it is being filled up, so it
is not its responsability to check for nulls.

Remove the assertion that did so.

Refs bug #443127.
