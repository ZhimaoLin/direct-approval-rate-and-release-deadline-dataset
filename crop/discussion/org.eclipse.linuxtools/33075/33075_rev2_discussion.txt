DESCRIPTION

statesystem: Clarify that a backend can return 'null'

The "state system" itself should always return an interval and not 'null'.
The backend however may contain "holes" while it is being filled up, so it
is not its responsability to check for nulls.

Remove the assertion that did so.

Refs bug #443127.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

See comment #3 in the bug. The problem was that with the ThreadedHistoryBackend, we could miss some intervals because we didn't look in the queue between the two threads. By also looking there, we can guarantee to always return the interval.
