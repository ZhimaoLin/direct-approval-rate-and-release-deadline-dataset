DESCRIPTION

tmf: Rename TmfLocation.fLocation to .fLocationData

and the corresponding methods (getLocationData(), etc.)

Simple rename, to make it more clear the contained value is
(usually) not a Location itself. This way we don't get things
like foo.getLocation().getLocation().

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Legacy LTTng hasn't been upated to this. I know it will be removed but as long as it's in the kepler branch we have to update it.

Be also aware that any other TMF extension (internal and external) will have to update to this renaming.

Patch Set 1:

Yes, I forgot to mention it, but this depends on the legacy-removal too.
