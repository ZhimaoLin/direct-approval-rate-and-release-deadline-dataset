DESCRIPTION

tmf: Rename TmfLocation.fLocation to .fLocationData

and the corresponding methods (getLocationData(), etc.)

Simple rename, to make it more clear the contained value is
(usually) not a Location itself. This way we don't get things
like foo.getLocation().getLocation().

This is really a cosmetic change that doesn't address the shortcomings of ItmfLocation. Good enough I guess.
