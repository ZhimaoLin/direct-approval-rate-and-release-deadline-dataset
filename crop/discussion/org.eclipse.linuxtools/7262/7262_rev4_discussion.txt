DESCRIPTION

tmf: Rename TmfLocation.fLocation to .fLocationData

and the corresponding methods (getLocationData(), etc.)

Simple rename, to make it more clear the contained value is
(usually) not a Location itself. This way we don't get things
like foo.getLocation().getLocation().

Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Simple rebase, no merge conflicts (but this Gerrit is configure to not even try to merge if one of the affected files has changed).

Kinda sucks that rebasing loses all the reviews though...
