DESCRIPTION

ss: Add a StateSystemUtils for advanced queries

We want to offer convenience and advance query methods for the
state system, but these should not be part of the ITmfStateSystem
interface. That one should only be for the "basic" types. Everything
else should go in a separate utility class.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I like the approach. The state system utils makes sense. And indeed the untilNotNull is the only one we need right now. We can bring back the functional interface for condition when the needs come. But for now it will be ok.

But with the .api_filter thing, I think this patch should wait for API breakage before being pushed.

I'll do some more code review later.
