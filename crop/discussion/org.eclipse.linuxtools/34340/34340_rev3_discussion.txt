DESCRIPTION

ss: Add a StateSystemUtils for advanced queries

We want to offer convenience and advance query methods for the
state system, but these should not be part of the ITmfStateSystem
interface. That one should only be for the "basic" types. Everything
else should go in a separate utility class.

oops, I didn't notice you pushed another patch in-between. Did you change anything? I had mistakenly removed a "interval = ..." in the test file, which is why it was failing. I reworked that test a little bit.

> But with the .api_filter thing...

Indeed, this is not a super-clean solution. However .api_filter is exactly for cases like that. That interface was not meant to be extended by anybody, so it's not technically an "API". It's just an organizational subset of methods.

And a nice thing with API filters, once you bump the major version, you get warnings for places where you have filters that are no longer needed!

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

How is ITmfStateSystem not API? Anyone can get one using TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.getStateSystem() and call the deleted methods. This is a textbook example of API break ;)

Patch Set 3:

Well, you have a very good point Patrick ;)

I was too focused on the fact that this was not an API break due to "modifying abstract methods". Because nobody outside of state system is supposed to implement ITmfStateSystem. But it is indeed an API break, simply because it's "removing public methods"!

Abandoned

Will push to TC instead because of the API breakage.

FYI, I had a need for this while rebasing my experimental branch, so the conversion to Trace Compass is already done.
