DESCRIPTION

ss: Add a StateSystemUtils for advanced queries

We want to offer convenience and advance query methods for the
state system, but these should not be part of the ITmfStateSystem
interface. That one should only be for the "basic" types. Everything
else should go in a separate utility class.
