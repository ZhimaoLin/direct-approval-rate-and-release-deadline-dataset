DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add a meta-plugin to run all the unit tests

Do not mention the new plugin in pom.xml's, this is for use from
within Eclipse only.

This also required changing many test plugins from fragments to
singletons, so that they can be accessed by the new separate plugin.

I think I would prefer a slightly more explicit name for the plugin, like
org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.alltests
What do you think?

Patch Set 1:

Good point, it would highlight that it is different from the other, "real" test plugins.
