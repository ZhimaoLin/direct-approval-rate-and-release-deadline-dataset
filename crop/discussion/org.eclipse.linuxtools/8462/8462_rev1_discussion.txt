Side note, make sure you remove the Conflicts line in commit messages, as you can see the Change-Id line got totally ignored by Gerrit because those are in-between.

About this patch, master shouldn't track the bugfix releases, should it? Shouldn't master be at 1.2 at this point?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

After discussion, those plugins don't necessarily have to be bumped to 1.2, so this solves the problem.
