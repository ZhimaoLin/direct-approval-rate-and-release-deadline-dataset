Awesome first patch! 

I think you need to take a look at this, also some comments are in the code. 

Failed tests:   testGetColumnData(org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tests.statistics.TmfBaseColumnDataProviderTest): getColumnData expected:<0> but was:<9>

Line:164, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> this could be stored as a map <trace, long>, something like fTraceTotalsMap In that case they can be updated when the events are being populated

Line:172, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> This would look nicer right aligned for the % and left for the stat... I think
