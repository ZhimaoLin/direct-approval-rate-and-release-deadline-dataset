Line:87, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> This does not look like it is needed in this class at large. It could be confined to the anonymous TmfBaseColumnData objects below (or new separate class, see comment below).

Line:92, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> mark it final (variables should always be final as much as possible. If it really needs to change during the lifetime of the object, then it can be non-final).

Also, NumberFormat seems to supply what you are using, why not use it, so you do not need to cast?

Line:99, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> put this with the other protected static defines above. Typically you want to go:

  public static final
  protected static final
  private static final
  private others

When defining fields

Line:176, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> This inner class is becoming quite big, it should be moved to its own file (TmfStatisticsColumnData or such).

This will allow scoping fTotalMasterNode better.

fFolderLevels should be moved to that new class too (and made static final)

Line:234, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> those two methods can go with the new class, and made static

Line:246, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfBaseColumnDataProvider.java -> You're comparing a boolean, this cannot happen, you could just do a if/else

Line:169, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfStatisticsTreeNode.java -> Excellent to mark this Nullable, however write in the javadoc in which case to expect a null value.
