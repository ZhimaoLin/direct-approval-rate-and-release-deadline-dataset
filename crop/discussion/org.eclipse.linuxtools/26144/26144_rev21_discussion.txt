Nothing left to complain about :)

Nice job!

Line:61, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/model/TmfStatisticsFormatter.java -> would have been slightly better to explicitly list the cases above the default to have them trickle down into it. Then we would have gotten a warning if we added new states to the enum. Minor thing though, not worth pushing yet another patch.
