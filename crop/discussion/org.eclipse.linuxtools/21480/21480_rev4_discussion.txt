DESCRIPTION

tmf : fix for CtfIterator getCurrentEvent()

This function is very costly and is called 3 times per event.
The previous CurrentEvent is cached to accelerate the process of building the state system

Benchmark for the TMF sample trace (13.4 Mo with 697343 events) :

Before :
Build of the state system : 8.896 s
Call of createEvent function : 2 091 982

After :
Build of the state system : 6.829 s
Call of createEvent function : 697 343

Benckmark with a 100Mo kernel trace :
Before : 48.1s
After : 38.0s

Possible gain of the state system building time : 23 %

Nobody at /// modified the header, I though we didn't need to update it.

Let's get this merged!
