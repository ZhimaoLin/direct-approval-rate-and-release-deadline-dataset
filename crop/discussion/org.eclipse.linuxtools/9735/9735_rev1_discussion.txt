Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> wrapping :P

Line:23, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/TcpEventStrings.java -> Now that they're in the same package you can just use xxx@xxx.xxx LttngStrings}.

You can also do this with any public class, if you import it.

Line:151, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatching.java -> There is still a lot of in-fighting about this ;)  but personally I prefer /* C-style comments */ for permanent comments, even if they are on one line.

The main reason is that if you use Ctrl+Shift+C you don't risk un-commenting stuff that's supposed to be a comment.

Line:156, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatching.java -> Here a // is fine, but it should be prefixed with TODO or FIXME.
