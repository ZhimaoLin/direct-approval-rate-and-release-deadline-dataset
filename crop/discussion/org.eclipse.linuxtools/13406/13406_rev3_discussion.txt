DESCRIPTION

Resolve API problems detected xxx@xxx.xxx tags in profiling framework.

In preparation for our 2.0 release, some API additions were made to
components of the profiling framework (mainly dataviewers) which required
only a minor version bump (eg. 4.x). Later on, API breaking changes were
made so xxx@xxx.xxx tags referencing 4.x would need to be changed to 5.0.
