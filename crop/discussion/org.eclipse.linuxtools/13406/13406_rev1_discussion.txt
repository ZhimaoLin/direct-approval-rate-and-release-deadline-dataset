DESCRIPTION

Resolve API problems detected xxx@xxx.xxx tags in profiling framework.

In preparation for our 2.0 release, some API additions were made to
components of the profiling framework which required only a minor
version bump (eg. 4.x). Later on, API breaking changes were made so all
@since tags referencing 4.x would need to be changed to 5.0.

Line:111, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.binutils/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/binutils/utils/STSymbolManager.java -> It shouldn't, because the binutils bundle is only at 4.1.0. For the dataviewers bundles, they were initially at 4.1, and then finally 5.0, but since none of these have been released yet, all the previous references should be 5.0.
