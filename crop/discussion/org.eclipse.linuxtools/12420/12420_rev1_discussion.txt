DESCRIPTION

lttng2: Fix version handling for older eclipse platforms

Older implementation of org.osgi.framework.Version have different
API for the compareTo method which causes a NoSuchMethodException.
This commit is to fix the version handling so that it is possible
to run it on older Eclipse versions (e.g. 3.6).

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Haven't tested with old Eclipse/LTTng versions, but seems to build fine and work with recent versions of both.
