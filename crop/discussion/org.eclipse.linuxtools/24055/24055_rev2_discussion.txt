There is already a resourceChanged listener in the TmfEventsEditor. It doesn't react to IResourceDelta.ADDED because it didn't support your use case of a bookmark created externally. But perhaps handling that delta case to call refreshBookmarks() on the table is all you need?

Line:594, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> You would have to remove the listener from the workspace when the table is disposed.
