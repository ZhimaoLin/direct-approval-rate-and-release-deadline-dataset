Line:110, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/launch/ProfileLaunchShortcut.java -> Do not catch Exception as this would cause catching runtime exceptions too which is something we definetely don't look for.

Line:89, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/schema/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.provider.exsd -> Please in the documentation state that the value is supposed to be integer >= 1 and that invalid values will cause the extension have lowest priority (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
