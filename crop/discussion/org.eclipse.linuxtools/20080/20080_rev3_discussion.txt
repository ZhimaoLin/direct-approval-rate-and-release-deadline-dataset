A few more comments, in case you want to make another patchset, but otherwise, it is good enough for me!

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> that used to normalize -> that is used to normalize

Line:87, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> Now that's better! Thanks!

Line:94, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> where t0 ... tn are times used externally and t0' ... tn' are times used internally by the SWT chart.

Line:42, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> why is this internal by the way?

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> Ahhh. I'll fix it when I touch this file again.

Line:94, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> Good suggestion!

Line:42, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> It is internal for now. I hope the API is ironed out for Luna and I will remove the x-internal. However, if we don't feel the API is not sufficient for Luna we'll keep and we can buy some time for finalizing it.
