Thanks for acting on my comments :)
There's a few typos and I'd like a bit more precision on the time offset (I definitely prefer this new name!)

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> shwon -> shown

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> that is* used

scaling values time values -> scaling time values

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/ITmfChartTimeProvider.java -> The way I understand from the examples in the bar chart viewer and the previous version of ust memory chart is that t0', t1' are the values we are giving to the x axis of the series, and the time offset will be added to those values at display time. Is that right?

So here, t0, t1, ... tn are the actual time values for which we want the values we will send to the y axis and t0', t1', ... tn' are the values we give to the x axis.
