DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Implement selective tapset loading.

When the list of imported tapsets is changed (with
Preferences->SystemTap->IDE->Tapsets), instead of
triggering a new tapset load operation to re-load
all tapset contents, only load in the newly-added
tapsets and delete the ones that were removed.
