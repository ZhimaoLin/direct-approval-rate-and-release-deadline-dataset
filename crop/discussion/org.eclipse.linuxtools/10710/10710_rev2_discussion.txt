Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Good start.  Please change the Tabs to something like: General, SystemTap instead of Settings and Settings.  Please make the --runtime=dyninst option available somehow.  Please make it easy for a user to specify a command/module via a browser.  Also allow for a user to get help on the command (e.g. simply run the --help option and display in console) and to specify command options themselves.
