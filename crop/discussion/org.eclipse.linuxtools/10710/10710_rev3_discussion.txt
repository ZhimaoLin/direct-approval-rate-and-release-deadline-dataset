Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I have a few comments.

1. The hover help for the commands should be consistent (i.e. start with an upper-case letter). 

2. Hover help should be more than listed on the UI (i.e. don't just reiterate what the user can already see).

3. The Other Commands text box should line up with the other text boxes for set commands.

4. The Target Executable should note that it is providing the -c Command option

5. The runtime=dyninst option should mark an error if the -x Pid or Target Executable field or the equivalent commands cannot be found in the Other Commands text field.  Up to you if you mark any other errors.
