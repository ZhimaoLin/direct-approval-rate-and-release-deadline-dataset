DESCRIPTION

systemtap: add some missing copyright headers

Added copyright statement missing in some of the codes contributed in bugzilla #266667 and also committed in c4b0aed398bd7cacae09d1451c580292b7bcee0f.

I've used "git log --follow" to track down their origins since some files/packages got renamed over time.

It was assigned copyright to the company where the submitter/committer belonged at the time of the contribution.
