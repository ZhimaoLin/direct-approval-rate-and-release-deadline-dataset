Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(5 inline comments)

Still some comments, but those are quite minor.

More importantly:

- The patch introduces warnings. The auto-generated parser files in particular should have SuppressWarnings{} added like it had before.

- Some tests now fail. testAddStream errors out, and testGetClock_1 fails. I don't know if it's because those were not run automatically before, but if they're enabled they should pass.

Line:46, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/CTFCallsite.java -> should be private too

Line:50, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/CTFCallsite.java -> "private final" ?

Line:108, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/CTFCallsite.java -> The Javadoc should explain what the method does, not "how" it does it.

It's a very good explanation though, but it should go as a comment inside the method.

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> unused import

Line:782, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> why is "int index = 0" not in here?
