Patch Set 3:

I was trying this out and informed Arianna Johns that it doesn't seem to handle symbolic links very well.

The Daemon returns a 500 code saying 'Could not find the file /etc/mtab in container 95535c0fe4833951387b5859e558e96fa4a453592265b03f27b93c7749b5b966'

In my case '/etc/mtab' is a symbolic link, and although it failed there, it did copy out the files that came before it.
