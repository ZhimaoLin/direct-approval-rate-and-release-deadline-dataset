LGTM, once again we could merge this right now, I can provide a patch afterward for the return type thingy (see inline comment).

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfLongLocation.java -> TmfLongLocation.getLocationData() could be overriden to return a Long type. This way we do the cast ourselves and users of the class don't have to cast it everytime.
