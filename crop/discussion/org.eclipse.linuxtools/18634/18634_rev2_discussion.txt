Nice changes! You could have added "fixes bug #xxx" referencing the Bugzilla bug, but it doesn't really matter (let's just not forget to close the bug!)

I was concerned about the non-discoverability of scrolling sideways, but the default views shows the Control Flow View, which has an horizontal scrollbar. So the user is not COMPLETELY lost (assuming a kernel trace...) We could add a similar bar in the histogram view, but that could be done later.

+1 verified for this series.
