Patch Set 7:

Couple small tweaks:
- Prevent exception being thrown if the user clicks on the row called "Custom Attributes" (getEditableValue() should not return null).
- Removed the displaying of the "Model URI" row, it's now shown in the custom attributes.

Line:294, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> The display of the IModelLookup property was removed. For CTF traces it would not be needed and we will have duplicate entries in the properties table for the model but other trace types may implement just the ITmfModelLookup interface and therefore we have to display in the properties view.

Please put it back.

Line:294, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> Good point, I removed it because it would cause duplicate entries, but that's only for CTF traces.
