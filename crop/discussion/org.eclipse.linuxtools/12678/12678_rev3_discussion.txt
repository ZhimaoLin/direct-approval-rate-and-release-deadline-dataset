Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> TmfEventPropertySource is at the "TMF generic" level. It should not use anything specific to ctfadaptor.

Line:292, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> instanceof checks are never  good practice... Perhaps it'd be worth adding a getCustomAttibutes() method to ITmfEvent directly. We should talk about this with the team.

Line:319, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> this should be using a switch/case. It's existing code, but it could be a good occasion to fix it.
