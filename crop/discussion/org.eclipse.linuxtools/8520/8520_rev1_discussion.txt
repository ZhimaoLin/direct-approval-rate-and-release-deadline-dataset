DESCRIPTION

tmf: Handle race between state system queries and diposal

It's possible that a state system gets disposed while a query
is ongoing (happens between two successive .getNextChild()
calls, for example).

Instead of implementing a convoluted reader-writer-lock, we can
just catch the ClosedChannelException and rethrow a
StateSystemDisposed exception.
