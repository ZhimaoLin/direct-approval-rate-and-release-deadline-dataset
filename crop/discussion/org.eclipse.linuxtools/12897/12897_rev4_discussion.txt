One small comment, if it doesn't apply then I'd say +1 CR.

Line:542, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/BatchImportTraceWizard.java -> Does the order in the UI depend on the iteration order of this set? If not, it could use a hashset which will be much faster with strings.
