DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add missing Javadoc to tmf.ui

This goes a long way into fixing the remaining warnings!

This commit contains only documentation and formatting fixes,
no actual code changes. Except for some protected fields in
TmfEventsTable, which were changed to private to remove them
from the API.
