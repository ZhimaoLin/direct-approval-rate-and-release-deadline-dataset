DESCRIPTION

pcap: make PacketStream compute useful information

The PacketStream now computes Nb of packets/bytes, duration of
the conversation, Bytes per seconds, etc. Also, it now does not
store indexes to packet, since it makes the size of PacketStream
proportional to the size of the trace. This is unwanted since we
have to be able to open traces that are bigger than memory.

Line:28, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> nooo, don't depend on a specific version! (unless you know for sure that it is required, DoubleMath is 11.0 for instance).

Line:129, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/pcap/core/stream/PacketStream.java -> This code gets removed, but just fyi, there's Guava's Joiner.join() that's quite useful to do things like these (so you don't have to worry about not putting a comma after the last element, etc.)

Line:133, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/pcap/core/stream/PacketStream.java -> sb.toString() cannot return null, at most it will be an empty string. You could do xxx@xxx.xxx trick here.

Line:70, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/pcap/core/stream/PacketStream.java -> if timestamps can't be negative you could have kept -1, but it works either way.

Line:156, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/pcap/core/stream/PacketStream.java -> you could do getNbPackets()
