This is not yet API, so let's be sure this is what we want, once the perf tests are up, it will be difficult to change this. 

would we rather have <component>/<metric>/<test> or <metric>/<component>/<test> or ...

I don't think a priori the metric should have its own element in the full name. It is already saved in the database as the dimension used for the scenario, so it's not even mandatory to put it in the scenario name.

But we'll see how it turns out.
