Looks good. I'm not sure about making it a level higher though. It's still a view like the other ones under Lttng. But I don't feel strongly about it either way.

Patch Set 1:

We want to move LTTng Control out from LTTng and create LTTng UST Analysis chapter. I think it makes sense to have LTTng Tracer Control, LTTng Kernel Analysis and LTTng UST Analysis as top chapter. 

Another reason to have LTTng Tracer Control out of LTTng Chapter is that in the LTTng chapter will be only TMF specific features described (I think) after this change.
