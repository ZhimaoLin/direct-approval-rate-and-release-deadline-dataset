DESCRIPTION

tmf xml: Add the possibility to display value delta in XML XY views

addition allows to show also the difference between the values at timestamp t
and timestamp t-1.

Line:1, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/kvm_exits.xml -> Was this file added unintentionally? I don't see it getting used in this patch.

Line:135, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> Maybe you could extract the FileLocator part to a common method? You did something like that in another patch.

Line:118, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlView.xsd -> Are you sure that you want to use the word "type" for this and not reserve it for something more type-ish (String, int, float, etc). I don't really have ideas what else to call this... relativeness? :p We can keep "type" but just in case you have a better idea...

Line:1, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/kvm_exits.xml -> It is used in the XmlUtilsTest#testXmlValidateValid method where all files listed in the test_valid directory are tested. It's just so we can cover more cases of valid stuff while providing some standalone use cases
