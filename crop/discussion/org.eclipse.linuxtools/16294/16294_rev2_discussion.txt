DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move statevalue unboxing method implementations to the base classes

Made the default methods in TmfStateValue always throw exceptions.
Implementations can then override those for the types they support. Also
added some messages to the unboxing exceptions, to help when debugging.

Tweaked IntegerStateValue's so that they can be unboxed into a long,
since this will always be safe. The opposite however is not permitted.
