DESCRIPTION

Bug 497357: Occasionally unable to commit container in Docker Explorer.

When the only attempts to commit a container get activated from the
Docker Explorer View, nothing happens due to legacy connection retrieval
code. Also because handlers seem to be re-used, it's a good idea to
avoid storing connection/container fields to avoid strange behaviour.
