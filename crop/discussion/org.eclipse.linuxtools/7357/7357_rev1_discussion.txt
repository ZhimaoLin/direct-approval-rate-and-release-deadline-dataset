Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Other teammates might disagree, but I find "fix bug #xxx" to be an awful commit title. It doesn't tell you at first glance what the change introduces.

Ideally the commit title should be a short summary of the change, and if needed you can expand on it in the description.  "Fixes bug xxxx" is very useful to have, but in the description.

Line:128, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Any reason you don't use a Lock object? It would be a tad clearer what it's for.
