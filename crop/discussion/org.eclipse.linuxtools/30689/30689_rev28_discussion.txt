Patch Set 28:

I reviewed and tested the change and it looks good. I think maybe we should make "Basic" the default so that the users is not too confused at first. Also, do you think it would be possible to add any tests in the core part? Or is it pretty much already all done by the synchronization framework?

It looks good from my side, too. 
Basic mode as default is ok with me as Marc-Andre suggested.
