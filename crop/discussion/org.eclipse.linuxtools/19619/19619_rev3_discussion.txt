DESCRIPTION

ctf: modify data-structure in CTF-Trace holding streams.

CTF allows multiple events to have the same ID as long as
they are not part of the same stream.

Thus, a unique event is represented by <stream-id, event-id>
and not only by event-id.

In this case, the CTF-Trace contains multiple streams
but maps all event-id into the same map (without stream-id).

Back-references are always a bad design.
In a future patch-set, the plan is to remove
CTF-Trace from CTF-Stream.
