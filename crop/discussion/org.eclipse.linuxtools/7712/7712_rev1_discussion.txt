DESCRIPTION

New profiling type configurations should follow same logic as shortcuts.

When a new profiling type configuration is created, the tabs shown are
from the default provider. Instead of using the default provider, the
preference page should be consulted, followed by the highest priority
provider, and then the default provider.

Line:65, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/provider/launch/ProviderLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Minor nit: it would be better to simply declare a variable called type which you set by calling getProfilingType().  Then the code is less cluttered and you avoid 2 additional calls, though the overhead is neglible.
