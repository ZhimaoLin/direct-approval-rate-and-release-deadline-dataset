Seems to be unused, except for the test, so good thing to remove it.

It was actually used for debugging purposes. I don't have an opinion whether it should be there or not. The reasoning was that it helped sort the streams in the vector when we were testing better seek algos... way back in the day...

And StreamInputReaderTimestampComparator could not be used for that? What is the difference?
