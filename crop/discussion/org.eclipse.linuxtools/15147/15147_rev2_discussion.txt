Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

+1 For the way it is handled with the Hide Arrows functionnalities.

But on the control flow view itself, as you slowly scroll left or right when zoomed out, arrows appear and disappear.  I guess it has to do with how the sampling is done.  Would there be a way to avoid that?  Either having a higher resolution for arrows or keep the previous arrows that are in the same time range so they do not disappear.

Patch Set 2:

The problem is that when the zoom thread is cancelled due to another zoom thread, we exit early and return a partial list and update the time graph with that list.

We should return null when the monitor is cancelled and not refresh the time graph.
