Patch Set 4:

I'm investigating a

Logging exception:
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded

It happens when I play around with a trace (zoom, scroll, next/prev event, etc) and at some point, it gets slow and runs out of memory.

But it may not be related to this patch as when I go back to master, it still does that.  But it never did that before.  I wonder if the patch triggered something in java that impacts subsequent executions... Anyway, more on this next week probably.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

It's ok, the problem is not related to this patch.  It's all good, though I'd stay tuned on the comments after this patch is in, on whether or not the arrows should be there by default.  When I mentioned this feature here, there were some sceptics...

Patch Set 4:

I could store the 'Hide Arrows' state in the dialog settings, it would be persistent across restart. Would you like me to add this to the patch?
