Patch Set 3:

They still appear and disappear when you side-scroll, even if you let the zoom thread finish.  But so do the state intervals, that change as you scroll left and right, but there is the dot showing that there are many states there and that the one shown is just a sample. 

I don't know if it's possible to know there should be an arrow in a given pixel and put some indication there or make sure you sample it

Patch Set 3:

When you are zoomed out, you only see a subset of all the possible arrows. That subset changes as you scroll because the state system query 'with resolution' returns a completely different list of state intervals.

It's the drawback of making the faster query with resolution, otherwise it would be much slower and there would be no limit on the number of arrows drawn.

For states, it's easy, we draw a dot when the sampled state interval covers less than the full pixel range. But for arrows we'd have to look at every state change in the pixel to know if an arrow (or many arrows) belongs there.

But you can tell yourself, if there's a dot, there might be an arrow there.
