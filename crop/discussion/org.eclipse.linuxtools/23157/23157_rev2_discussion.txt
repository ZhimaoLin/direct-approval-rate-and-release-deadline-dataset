DESCRIPTION

TMF: Refactor XML model code, using factories to re-use element parsers

The same XML syntax (and thus parsing) can be used for many XML components'
element, like state providers and views, but the behavior of each component
may be different. We use a factory to define create the classes with the
various behaviors.
