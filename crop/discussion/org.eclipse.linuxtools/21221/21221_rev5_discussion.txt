DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Fix/improve data filter UI.

Make the following changes to DataGrid's filter UI:

-Add names to filters when they are shown in the "remove
filters" menu, and disable that menu when there are no
filters.

-Implement singly-bounded range filters.

-Prevent bugs that are caused by trying to get data from
an empty table/data set.

-In the Select Filter wizard, only create a filter if
"Finish" is clicked when a wizard page with a valid
filter is the current page.

-Always cause a full update to the DataGrid on each update
event, as filters may change the order of table entries.
