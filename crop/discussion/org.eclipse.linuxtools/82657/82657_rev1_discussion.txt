DESCRIPTION

proxy: fix in RuntimeProcessFactory#whichCommand method

After executing the which command in the machine, the method
was checking if the process error stream was not null and if
it was not null, it was supposing that the command was not
installed. This checking can be error phrone because you can
get any errors from the machine bash or things like that and
it will suppose that the command is not installed.

As the method already check the process input stream to get the
command path (or empty if not found), I am removing the error stream
checking.
