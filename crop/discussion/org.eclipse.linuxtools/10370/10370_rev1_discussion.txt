Patch Set 1:

This change is fixes the NPE being thrown from whichVersion when RuntimeProcessFactory.getFactory().exec(...) returns null. However, a simpler alternative would be to throw an IOException in readIntoBuffer when the process p is null, this way you can delegate the exception handling to callers of whichVersion.

Patch Set 1:

I think either approach would be ok, since both would result in an exception being thrown and logged in the "Error Log" view. However, this hides the fact that RuntimeProcessFactory.getFactory().exec(..) is returning null. Why is this happening ?
