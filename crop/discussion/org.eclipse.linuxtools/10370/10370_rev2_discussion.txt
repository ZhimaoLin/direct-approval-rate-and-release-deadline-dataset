Patch Set 2:

Roland, I thought initially error were caused by lack of valgrind in the system but it turned out not true. Then I tried to reproduce the problem without success.

I would recommend apply this patch although I didn't find the error cause because it is going to make the code better.

Patch Set 2:

It still might useful to figure out why the process was returned as null to justify adding this change. I have not been able to reproduce the issue locally.

Patch Set 2:

Camilo, neither I. Although intermittent, at least the patch ensure valgrind will catch the error when it happens again instead of show an NPE message at user display.

If you guys prefer to debug it and find the root cause before applying it, OK for me either.
