Patch Set 1: Fails

(1 inline comment)

Fix is needed. However, another fix needs to be added to ensure that scroll also works right after loading the trace.
(for fix see comment in HistogramView)

Line:449, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/histogram/HistogramView.java -> This line has to be changed (see below) too. Otherwise the small histogram is not re-initialized and the mouse scroll in the small histogram will fail.

boolean drawTimeRangeHistogram = fTraceStartTime == fTraceEndTime;
