DESCRIPTION

Fixing Gcov parser for newer versions of Gcov

GCNO file format changed in newer versions. Gcov parser must reflect
this new format. The reading of the version number (and ANY of the data)
should be postponed until we have the determined the byte order
(Little/Big Endian).

Note: This is Daniel's original patch with a small modification. I've postponed the parsing of the version number to happen after we know the byte order.

Roland changes taking bit order into account (that didn't occur to me) are well done and ready to go.
