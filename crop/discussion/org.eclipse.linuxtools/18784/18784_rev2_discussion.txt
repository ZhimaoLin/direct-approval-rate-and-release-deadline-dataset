DESCRIPTION

[ctf] Simplify the logic of the unsigned long comparator.

To understand this modification, let assume the "char 8-bits" domain.

unsigned [0 .. 255]
signed [-128 .. 127]

By receiving the parameters encoded in a signed number, the method receives

left:  [0..127,-128..-1]  (which represents [0..127,128..255])
right: [0..127,-128..-1]  (which represents [0..127,128..255])

By definition (on an unconstrained domain), this assertion holds

 left < right  <==>  left + k < right + k

Thus, the idea is to rotate the domain by k to allow a signed operator to
be able to compare to full domain.
In this case k must be -128.

By rotating the domain, left and right range become [-128..-1,0..127],
and are now comparable with the signed operator.
