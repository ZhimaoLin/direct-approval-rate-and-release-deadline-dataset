Patch Set 4:

I would rather see the test class in a new fragment org.eclipse.linuxtools.valgrind.ui.tests instead of exporting one more internal class for the sake of tests. 
Valgrind plugin is heavily screwed in terms of API so let's not make it even harder.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

The points that I mentioned above regarding javadoc and quick-fix code style have been fixed in this latest update. The other points still stand; failing tests and changes needed in the manifest. I agree with Alex in making a new a new fragment o.e.l.valgrind.ui.tests for the test class.
