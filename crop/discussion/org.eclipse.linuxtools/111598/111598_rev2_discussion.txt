DESCRIPTION

Add OSIO Label support to OSIO Rest Connector

- add new Labelxxxx classes to support Label data
- modify OSIORestGetTaskData and OSIORestGetSingleTaskData
  classes to read "labels" relationship
- add new OSIOLabelAttributeEditor for showing labels
  in the Task editor and allowing a user to add a
  label to a work item and to select labels for removal
  similar to how assignees works
- add new OSIORestPostNewLabelTask to create a new label
  for a space (there is no corresponding delete function
  defined by the fabric-8 design at present)
- add support in OSIORestPatchUpdateTask to handle new
  and removed labels; for new labels check to see if the
  label exists in the space and if not, create it first
- add labels to space relationships and also add a
  Map of all labels for the space
- add support in OSIORestClient to load all labels for
  a space and use these values as suggestions for the
  Add Label field in the Task editor
