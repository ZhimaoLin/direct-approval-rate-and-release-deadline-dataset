DESCRIPTION

Bug 467931 - adapt proxy to changes in o.e.remote and PTP

Following o.e.remote and PTP changes have broken remote proxy:
- rdt and remotetools no longer supported in PTP
- o.e.remote implements OSGi services now

Any reference to unsupported schems will throw CoreException

Added a new plug-in (org.eclipse.linuxtools.remote.proxy.tests) with
 tests. It is neeed to export TEST_HOST, TEST_USERNAME and TEST_PASSWORD
 variables to activate them, otherwise they will be skipped.

Also updated PTP/remote build target to Mars milestones
