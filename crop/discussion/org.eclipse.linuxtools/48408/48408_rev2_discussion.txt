Patch Set 2:

Hi Akurtakov and Arianna Johns,

This must get in 4.0.0 due the breakage introduced by newer PTP and o.e.remote.

I just noticed Linuxtools build is pointing to Luna's update of PTP/Remote. That's why the code didn't show broken.

Also I am working on profiling.tests that must be changed accordingly.

I will send another patchset soon.

Patch Set 2:

I have probably missed updating ptp in the target file (http://git.eclipse.org/c/linuxtools/org.eclipse.linuxtools.git/tree/releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.target/linuxtools-e4.5.target) or it might have not been even available back then. Please update the target platform in your patch or as a separate patch that would have to go in first.
