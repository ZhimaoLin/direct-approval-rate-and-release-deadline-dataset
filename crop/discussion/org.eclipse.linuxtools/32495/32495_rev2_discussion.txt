Patch Set 2:

What is the maximum number of characters for this new data type? Can it support over 9000 characters? 
I think the maximum size of a string is also limited by the size of the history tree nodes. What is the behaviour if a string is inserted that cannot fit inside a single node?

Patch Set 2:

Fran√ßois: with this new type, 32767 characters. If we do this change, we might as well add another type with 3 or 4 bytes for the size. If you try to add an interval that doesn't fit in a node, I wouldn't be surprised if it went through an infinite loop of "tryInsertAtNode": try to insert node, fail, create new node, repeat.

Here I just did some copy paste, so it's really not maintainable. The proper solution would try to re-use the code as much as possible for all string types.
