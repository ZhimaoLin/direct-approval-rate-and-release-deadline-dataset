DESCRIPTION

RPM: createrepo project property pages

Added project property pages. Shifted "Deltas" options from the plugin
preferences to the project specific preferences. Also added a createrepo
project nature so that eclipse knows when to display the project
property pages (for createrepo natures & .repo files).

Changed when the "content" folder is to be created only when importing
RPMs or executing the createrepo command, so that when a .repo file is
created in a different project, a content folder won't appear.

Added an abstract class for createrepo property pages.

Patch Set 1:

"oldpackagedirs" delta option will be added in a separate patch due to current patch being large enough for review.

New delta option will require modifying the deltas project property page to add a path list and a dialog to prompt user for the path to add/edit.
