DESCRIPTION

Revert some of the changes made for RunImage wizard

- the RunConsole needs the additional ids to allow a permanent
  console for launching in a Container (e.g. gdbserver for C/C++)
- the findConsole() methods need to be reinstated so a default
  Container console doesn't match the special permanent console
