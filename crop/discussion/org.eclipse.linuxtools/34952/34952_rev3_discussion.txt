DESCRIPTION

tmf: fix concurrency issue in analyses modules (bug 447434)

The access of member fTrace in class TmfAbstractAnalysesModul was
not thread-safe. The attribute was set to null when cancelling
the analyses (e.g. in the UI thread).

With this patch this attribute will be accessed (read and write)
using a synchronization lock and it will be checked for null
references before using it.

Additionally, this patch takes care of count down initialization
latches in case of cancellation.
