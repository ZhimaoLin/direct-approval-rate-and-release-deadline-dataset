DESCRIPTION

lttng: Handle the statedump events

Back when the state provider was first developed, LTTng did
not support the statedump (dummy events that show the current
state of all the running processes).

This support was added to upstream LTTng since then, so the
TMF viewer should make good use of this information!

Looks great. for others: this will load pids in the cfv that don't have any events during the run, but are running.

Line:371, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/stateprovider/CtfKernelHandler.java -> maybe some comments here explaining what will be done would help? I see them lower down but I feel that they should be unified.
