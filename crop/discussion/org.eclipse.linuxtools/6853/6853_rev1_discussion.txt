DESCRIPTION

tmf: Update the ctfadaptor tests for the new formatting

Since 9dc3ba9, the .toString() method for integer CTF fields
will correctly format the value as per the formatting info
in the metadata.

Some unit tests have to be updated to cope with the new values,
for octal and hex integers.
