Line:36, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/SourceDisassemblyData.java -> Currently the source disassembly view is generated as part of a standard perf launch. However it could eventually be extended to show up upon a user double clicking a particular session (much like our default tree view currently does). This would require we work out some details though (do all views show up, does the user choose which ones, etc.)

Line:36, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/SourceDisassemblyData.java -> What about having the source disassembly view accessible as an action from the toolbar or menu?
