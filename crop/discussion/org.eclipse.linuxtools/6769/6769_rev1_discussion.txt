Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/headless/Benchmark.java -> Just noticed it gives a "unused" warning too.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks good, but it introduces a warning, see previous inline comment.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/headless/Benchmark.java -> Just to be pedantic, I'd do

boolean hasMore;
while () {
  ...
  hasMore = traceReader.advance();
}

so the stack doesn't get pushed/popped every iteration.
