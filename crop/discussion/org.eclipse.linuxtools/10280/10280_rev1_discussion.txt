DESCRIPTION

tmf: Move some logic outside of HistoryBuilder

Move the input.assignTargetSS() call outside of HistoryBuilder's
constructor. This will allow more flexibility for input/backend
types that need to instantiate their objects in a different
order than the typical "kernel input -> ss -> history tree"
trinity does (for example, partial histories).
