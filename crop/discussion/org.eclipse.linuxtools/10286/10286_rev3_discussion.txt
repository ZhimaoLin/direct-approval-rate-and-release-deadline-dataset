DESCRIPTION

ctf: Avoid re-downloading the test traces

Do not download the test traces if they are already present
on the file system (skipexisting="true").

The extraction was also moved to a conditional task, so that if
the traces cannot be downloaded for some reason, at least it
doesn't fail the complete build. Some unit tests will probably fail,
but that's the lesser of the two evils.

References bug 400459.
