DESCRIPTION

ctf: Avoid re-downloading the test traces

Do not download the test traces if they are already present
on the file system (skipexisting="true").

ignoreerrors="true" was also added, so that if the traces cannot
be downloaded for some reason, at least it doesn't fail the
complete build. Some unit tests will probably fail, but that's
the lesser of the two evils.

References bug 400459.

Patch Set 2:

You're right. It would likely just fail on the next step. I guess you could try putting the unzipping/untar commands in a conditional task based on whether those files exist.
