I have a minor aesthetic issue with one of the try with resources, but if you like it, I will abide.

Line:63, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/indexer/AllBench.java -> this looks better.

Line:219, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/indexer/AbstractCheckpointCollectionTest.java -> 3 lines replace 3 lines, not sure if it makes the code clearer, looks like java 7 for the sake of java 7  here.

Line:219, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/trace/indexer/AbstractCheckpointCollectionTest.java -> We get a warning in any case.

If the writeInt() operation throws the IOException (that is thrown by the method), we are guaranteed to close 'f', which was not the case before.
