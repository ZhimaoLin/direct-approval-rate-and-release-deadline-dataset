Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There's an externalized string at org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/localization.properties (StapPreferencePage.StapPreferenceDescription) that can be removed as well along with this commit.
