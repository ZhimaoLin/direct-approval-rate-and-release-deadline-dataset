DESCRIPTION

Name remote java launch after container and fix connection opening.

- The Remote java launch configuration name is seen in Debug view so it
should be named after the container
- Attempt to open a connection if it exists but isn't in an active state
- Use different error messages for the case of a connection not being
found, and a connection not being active
