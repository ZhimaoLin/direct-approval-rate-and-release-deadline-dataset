DESCRIPTION

RPM: createrepo fragment test + simple test case

New fragment for createrepo that handles test cases.

First test case is a simple 1 that just checks if the
project creator correctly creates a project with an empty
content folder and uninitialized .repo file (due to not going
through wizard initialization).
