DESCRIPTION

TMF: Consolidate some view code into the AbstractBarChartView

This new view is a base view for all views using the TimeGraphCombo widget.
As a first step, the lttng2 kernel Control flow view and Resources view have
been modified to extend this abstract view.

Mostly all of the interface management code (build thread, zoom thread, signal
handling, etc) is in the base class.  Final views need only implement to code
to fill the entries' list and events.

This patch includes:
- The abstract view class that all new bar chart views may extend.  The default
   weight of each sash can be set in the constructor.
- A BarChartEntry class that can be used as is if the view does not require
  extra data of its entries
- A BarChartEvent class that can be used as is most of the time
- A BarChartPresentationProvider that present the mechanics of what the view's
  presentation provider should look like.  A view may or may not extend it.
- Added a ITimeGraphDrawingHelper interface to pass to the presentation
  providers to help them get the information they need to know where to draw
  some things (see ResourcesPresentationProvider)

It is a first step before adding new features to the bar chart views.  Some
more abstraction may need to be done as well as other reorganizing of the
code.

Patch Set 4:

For resources, I went back to the original code with an extra Type field in ResourcesEntry instead of the hierarchy of classes.

Closer to original, more consolidation, less changes
