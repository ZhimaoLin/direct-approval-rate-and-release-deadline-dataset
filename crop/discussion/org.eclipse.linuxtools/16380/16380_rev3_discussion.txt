DESCRIPTION

RPM: Add menu for building RPMs B#279648

New menu items have been added, as well as reorganized,
to accomodate 3 new RPM options: Build SRPM, Build RPMS,
and Build All.

The purpose is to remove it from the export page and make
it similar to eclipse-fedorapackager building functions.

The code does not belong to rpm.ui.editor but to rpm.ui or even rpm.core if it doesn't have UI dependency. I understand that you tried to follow the way things were done but these are legacy errors because in the past everything was in rpm.ui.editor and code is still not refactored to have proper logical structure. We should not make it harder to fix in the future.

Line:19, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/actions/SpecfileEditorBuildAllDelegate.java -> This class belongs to o.e.l.rpm.ui bundle as it's not part of the editing experience.

Line:19, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/actions/SpecfileEditorBuildSRPMDelegate.java -> This class belongs to o.e.l.rpm.ui bundle as it's not part of the editing experience.

Line:23, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/Builder.java -> This looks like a duplicate of RPMBuild class. It's third additional layer - this class calling RPMProject which calls RPMBuild. It definetely doesn't have to be that way.

Line:18, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/actions/SpecfileEditorBuildRPMSDelegate.java -> This class belongs to o.e.l.rpm.ui bundle as it's not part of the editing experience.

Line:40, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/actions/AbstractSpecfileEditorBuildDelegate.java -> This class belongs to o.e.l.rpm.ui bundle as it's not part of the editing experience.

Line:20, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/editor/BuildType.java -> There is already BuildType enum in rpm.ui why add this one too?
