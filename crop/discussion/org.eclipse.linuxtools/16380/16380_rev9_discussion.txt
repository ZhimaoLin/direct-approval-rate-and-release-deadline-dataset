DESCRIPTION

RPM: Add menu for building RPMs

New menu items have been added, as well as reorganized,
to accomodate 3 new RPM options: Build SRPM, Build RPMS,
and Build All.

The purpose is to remove it from the export page and make
it similar to eclipse-fedorapackager building functions.

Line:40, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/ui/RPMExportOperation.java -> API class constructor with non api parameter is a clear no go. Either export BuildType too or find some other way.

Line:185, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/rpm/ui/rpm_strings.properties -> AbstractSpecfileEditorBuildDelegate loooks suspicious - there is no such class.
