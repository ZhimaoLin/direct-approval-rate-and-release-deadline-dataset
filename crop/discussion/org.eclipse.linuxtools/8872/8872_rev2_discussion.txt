Line:38, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.consolelog/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/consolelog/actions/StopScriptAction.java -> Stop button hangs sometimes for me. It appears that this behaviour is originating from the above line. More specifically, it seems that the hanging is occurring when trying to execute the pkill command in ScriptConsole#runLocally.
