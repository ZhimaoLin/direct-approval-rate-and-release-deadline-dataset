Patch Set 1:

I tried to build it with Maven locally, but I'm getting a crash in libwebkitgtk during the tmf.ui unit tests. This might be due to my weird setup though (Eclipse 4.4 + webkit 2.2 from Debian unstable), I'm trying to see if it also happens with master.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1

Indeed. I was able to build/run unit tests from Eclipse by forcing GTK2 (and the crash also happened with master anyway. yay more things to debug!)

Brenden Conley was able to build it anyway, so it must be good.
