DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Fixes to Graph(ing) preferences.

-Allow changes made to SystemTap->Graphing(->Graph) preferences to be
applied immediately, instead of only on graph sets created after having
made changes.

-Provide functionality to the "X/Y Series Ticks" options, which had no
effect previously. Rename them to better indicate their purpose.

-DataGrids now properly jump to the newest entry (when the option is
enabled), instead of getting stuck at the top of the table.

-Remove "Max Data Items" from Graph preferences, as it is a duplicate
of the option shown in Data Table preferences.
