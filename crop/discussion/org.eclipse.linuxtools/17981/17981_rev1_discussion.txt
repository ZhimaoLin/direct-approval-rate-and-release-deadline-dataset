DESCRIPTION

tmf: Optimize the ETERNITY time range

TmfTimeRange.ETERNITY is often used in requests and the like, when
you do not want to filter on timestamps at all. Implement it as
a subclass which does not even bother checking the range borders,
since any other timestamp or time range is definitely included.

Line:201, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimeRange.java -> Would it be better to make the class and its constructor private, so that it can only be accessed through the public constant?

Line:201, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimeRange.java -> I tried that at first, but it complained when trying to statically-initialize something that depends on the class itself. Some kind of circular dependency problem, I guess.

The class is not public, but we could make it 'final' to make sure nobody else in the package extends it?

Line:201, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimeRange.java -> You can make the class static since it doesn't access any member of TmfTimeRange. Final also make sense since there is no reason to extend this class.
