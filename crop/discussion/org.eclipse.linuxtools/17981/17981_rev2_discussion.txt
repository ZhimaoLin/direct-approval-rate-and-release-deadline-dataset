DESCRIPTION

tmf: Optimize the ETERNITY time range

TmfTimeRange.ETERNITY is often used in requests and the like, when
you do not want to filter on timestamps at all. Implement it as
a subclass which does not even bother checking the range borders,
since any other timestamp or time range is definitely included.
