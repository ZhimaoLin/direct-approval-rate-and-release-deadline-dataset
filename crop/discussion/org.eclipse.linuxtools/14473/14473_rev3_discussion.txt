DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add vertical events (links) to time graph view

Add the isLink method to ITimeEvent, for events that occur between two entries
instead of in one entry only.
Add the getLinkList method to AbstractTimeGraphView to get the links for a
given zoom level and other methods to propagate those changes to the time graph
control

Looking good, almost there, but can it be based on master branch?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This needs to be updated

Line:168, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> would we want to have null be used to clear the list? now it does nothing

Line:769, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> ... returns an empty list

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> leftover comment

Line:346, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> who says they are vertical? ;)

Line:1317, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> we probably want to exit if either index is -1

Line:1328, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> y1 = dst.y + dst.height / 2;

Line:1357, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> you wouldn't get here (TRANSPARENT < 0)

Line:2249, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> That sounds like a reasonable way to handle it. You can remove the TODO...

Line:61, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLinkEvent.java -> Just an idea, do you think users would like to have another pair of constructors with srcTime, dstTime (constructor would calculate the time and duration to pass to super)?

I reduced the visibility of some fields in TimeEvent, but it's really not necessary, I'll put them back to protected and base it on master then.

Line:61, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLinkEvent.java -> I certainly would ;-)  But it would have the same signature as this one...  And just to be coherent with the TimeEvent, I wouldn't change this one.
Unless we do, (srcentry, srctime, dstentry, dsttime, value)...
