Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

while I agree with removing of the wizard I don't agree with the removing of RPMExportOperation. It should be used as a base (or some other class extending Job) and provide a standalone export operation that would even be exposed as API for possible usage in other tools like fedorapackager. This patch would be changed a lot together with the it's parent.
