DESCRIPTION

tmf: Fix SWTBot test plugins' dependencies

SWTBot and log4j are third-party dependencies (not part of a base
Eclipse install), so they should be listed under Import-Package
instead.

I'm not sure what you mean by base install but swtbot is an Eclipse project so I would keep it in require bundle.

Patch Set 1:

This is how we're dealing with other dependencies (like Antlr, Guava, etc.), they come from separate sources than the Eclipse install. By putting them under Import-Package, it allows the dependency to come from another source (for example, distro packages).

Less of a problem now that we use target definitions, but it still decouples the dependencies a bit more, which is a good thing, at least according to Lars.

I guess it doesn't really matter either way. But we don't really have a clear rule of when to do it or not. SWTBot will be part of Eclipse of Java starting 4.5M1.
