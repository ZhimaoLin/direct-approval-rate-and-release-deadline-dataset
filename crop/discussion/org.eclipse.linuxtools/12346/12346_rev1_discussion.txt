The change works as expected.

Line:148, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/SourceDisassemblyView.java -> Although we don't gain that much from wholeWord, we may need to implement it to be consistent with the options available.

Line:151, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/SourceDisassemblyView.java -> This should probably be set to either -1, or nothing to avoid any ambiguity.

Line:155, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/SourceDisassemblyView.java -> It should probably be mentioned that this condition is triggered specifically when a wrapped search hits the begining/end of the text.
