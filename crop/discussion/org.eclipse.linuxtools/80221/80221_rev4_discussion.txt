DESCRIPTION

Bug 500638 - Properties do not show information about selected image/container in respective tab

Fixed the value returned by 'getContributorId()' in
DockerImagesView and DockerContainersView to re-enable linking selection
with properties view (was a regression introduced in fix for bug 499750
(Add commands in Image Hierarchy view).

Added tests to verify that the properties view displays the expected tab
upon selection in DockerExplorerView, DockerContainersView, DockerImagesView
and DockerImageHierarchyView.
