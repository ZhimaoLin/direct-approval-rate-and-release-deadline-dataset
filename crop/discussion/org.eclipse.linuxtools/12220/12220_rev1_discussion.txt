Minor issue with the copyright header. Change looks good, more common stuff!

Line:11, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/EventIterator.java -> You could keep add ", fix for split events" on the first line. Up to you.

Line:2, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/EventIterator.java -> The file should still be (c) 2012, 2013, even if it was just moved. It's not a new file written from scratch ;)
