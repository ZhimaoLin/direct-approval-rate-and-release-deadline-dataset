DESCRIPTION

proxy: resolve conflict between ssh.proxy and rdt.proxy

Both ssh and rdt proxies implement remote handlers for the ssh scheme.
Added the 'jsch' scheme so that clients can request the ssh.proxy implementation over rdt.
Rdt.proxy is default ssh handler. But the ssh.proxy is called if 'ssh' and rdt.proxy is not installed.
