DESCRIPTION

tmf: Make TmfEventField immutable

As with the immutable TmfEvents change, this required some
minor adjustment with the CustomEventContent. Those can still
extend TmfEventField, but it requires creating a new Content
object if you want to change its values.

Line:244, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> It would probably be better to just create our own ITmfEventField implementation then...

Line:244, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> Yep that could be an option too. But then it would add more lines of code! O.O
