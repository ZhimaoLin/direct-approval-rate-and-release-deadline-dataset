DESCRIPTION

lttng: Correctly skip tests if test traces are missing

It used to be "unsafe" to do assumeTrue() xxx@xxx.xxx methods,
but since Luna it seems to be the other way around: it skips
correctly when put in xxx@xxx.xxx but results in a failure
if it's within xxx@xxx.xxx Makes perfect sense!

Now add this to abstract and extending test classes, both with
xxx@xxx.xxx and you get a recipe for disaster.
