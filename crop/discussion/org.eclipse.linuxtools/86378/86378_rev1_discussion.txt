DESCRIPTION

Bug 508657 - NoStackTrace in RunDockerImageLaunchConfigurationDelegate.launch

Externalized the deserialization of port bindings, converting a `List<String>`
containing serialized values into a `Map<String, List<IDockerPortBinding>>`.
Added tests on the `LaunchConfigurationUtilsTest` class.

Also:
- fixed a bug where the list of images displayed in the combo
would not be populated.
- fixed a bug where the current, selected connection in the Docker Explorer view
would be used instead of the selected connection in the launch editor, causing
some errors if the currently selected connection was not opened.

Patch Set 1:

To verify the bugfix, you'll need an existing launch configuration in which the "Publish all ports" option was unselected, ie, where ports are explicitly set. Then, from the launch wizard, you'll need to press the "Run" button to see the error occur. Basically, the "port bindings" attribute was accessed as a Map instead of a list.
