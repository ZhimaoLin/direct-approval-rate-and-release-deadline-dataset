DESCRIPTION

tmf: Replace event matching API to use Collection

instead of straight arrays. This is more flexible, and indicates
that there is no notion of ordering of the traces. Had to replace
one instance of List.get(i) with a map of traces.

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> This is getting a bit confusing... perhaps the inner Map could be separated into its own class. TODO

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> This could be redone with Iterator's, but the algo using an array was already made, and I didn't dare touching it.
