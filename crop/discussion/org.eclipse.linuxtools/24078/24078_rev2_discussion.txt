DESCRIPTION

tmf: Replace event matching API to use Collection

instead of straight arrays. This is more flexible, and indicates
that there is no notion of ordering of the traces. Had to replace
one instance of List.get(i) with a map of traces.

Very minor comments

The only reason it was using ITmfTrace[] in the first place is because that is what the experiment has.

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> Yeah... I'm not so proud of this type ;-)

Line:117, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> missing a doc for param trace

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> extra space before []

Retriggered the build, failure seemed to be unrelated. Still a couple issues to fix.

Makes sense, I did this patch because I was working on switching TmfExperiment to use Collection too, and hit this ;)

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> That was actually on purpose (yeah yeah :P). I found that I like the separate [] when declaring arrays. Altough at this point it's more important to be consistent, so I should probably put it back to ITmfTrace[]

Line:117, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> it's an overriden javadoc, which is why there was no warning. Quite observant ;)

I'll just remove it, since it's the same as the interface's doc.
