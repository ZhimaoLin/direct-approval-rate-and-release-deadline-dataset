DESCRIPTION

tmf: Replace event matching API to use Collection

instead of straight arrays. This is more flexible, and indicates
that there is no notion of ordering of the traces. Had to replace
one instance of List.get(i) with a map of traces.

Patch Set 3:

Ok that took me a while to figure out... a List of something becoming a Map. And then a in  "for int i = 0, i++" loop:

  variable.get(i).blah

turns out both List and Map have a .get(), but they don't look for the same thing! And Java's old Map.get(Object) API didn't really help.
