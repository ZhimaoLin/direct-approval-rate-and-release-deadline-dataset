Just a small comment that you may or may not act upon.

Line:1892, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Good thing you have an example, because this is not obvious at all!

Maybe add a header === Example === below to show clearly that it's ok not to understand the above, an example will clarify all this.

Line:1892, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I prefer not to create a sub-header because the last paragraphs have some information not specific to the example.
However we think the advanced dialog might be a bit more clear if the Offset column is left in the same position as in basic mode, and the extra columns are added to the right, with Reference Time and Target time next to each other. This will be done in a separate patch and the user guide screenshots will be updated accordingly.
