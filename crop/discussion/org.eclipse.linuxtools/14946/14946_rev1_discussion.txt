Line:153, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/request/TmfDataRequest.java -> Block size was used when background requests were split in chunks. As this is no longer used, it should be removed completely.

Line:185, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/request/TmfDataRequest.java -> If that's what the copy constructor does, there should probably not be a copy constructor ;)
