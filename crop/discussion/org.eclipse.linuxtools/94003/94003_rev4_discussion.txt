DESCRIPTION

Further improve support for authenticated registries.

- Disable the default NetAuthenticator (uses UserValidationDialog for a
prompt) and use our DockerAuthenticator to provide authentication details.
- Ensure password from RegistryAccountInfo gets loaded when checking if
account contains authentication credentials.
