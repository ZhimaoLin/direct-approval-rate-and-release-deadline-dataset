DESCRIPTION

Disable resolution warnings for PDE API Tools.

Bundles will fail to resolve because the full underlying stack of
dependencies is not present. We could prevent this error by doing a
proper installation through the p2 director, but this has a very large
overhead.

Abandoned

Did not disable what I was expecting. Seems it may not be possible to fix problem in this manner.
