Please update the copyright header and also rebase the patch.

Line:23, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/mi_lttng.xsd -> Thanks, Jonathan and Oliver for resolving the license issue. One more things though. You need to change the copyright header to EPL license. Otherwise we still cannot merge it.

After discussion, we'll merge this file as third-party content. Not too sure what the process is for that, let's keep this patch on standby.

Patch Set 4:

We will not merge this in Linux Tools after all. The IP process is holding up the release, and it's not really worth it. We should merge this straight to Trace Compass instead. Someone please port the patch over ;)

Note that I specifically left out the sign-offs of the original authors, since we are now considering this a 3rd-party dependency, and not a contribution to Eclipse from them.
