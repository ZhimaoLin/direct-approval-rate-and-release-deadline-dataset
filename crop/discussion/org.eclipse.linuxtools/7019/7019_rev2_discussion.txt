Patch Set 2:

Now it is fine!
There is only one small api issue. Can you add xxx@xxx.xxx tag to the new runCommand function and increase the version number of the rpm.core plugin?
It is a good idea to set up your eclipse to show api breakage errors. Take a look at http://rgrunber.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/setting-api-baselines-in-eclipse/
