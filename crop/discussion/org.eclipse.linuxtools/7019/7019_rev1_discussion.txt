Not a blocker to the patch, but it would be nice if there is a way to inform the project to RemoteProcessFactory. This is necessary for the factory to decide if the command should be run locally or remotely.

Line:46, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/core/utils/Utils.java -> Isn't there a way to get the project and inform it to the RuntimeProcessFactory, instead of using null? If you inform the project it will try to run the command remotely when using remote projects
