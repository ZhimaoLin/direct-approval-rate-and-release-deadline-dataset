The change seems to work as expected.

Perhaps we should also update http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/PERF/User_Guide with some of the new functionality.

Line:165, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/PerfPlugin.java -> Even though this method is only used where curWorkingDir exists, it could still be used by someone in cases where no launch has occured. As a result, perhaps this method should have a documented return value of null when curWorkingDir is null.
