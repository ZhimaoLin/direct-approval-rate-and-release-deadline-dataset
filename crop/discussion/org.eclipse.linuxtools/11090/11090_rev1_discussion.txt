Simple enough fix ;)  Should be defined as an the interface type though, if possible.

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/types/StructDefinition.java -> Does this use any HashMap-specific methods? If not, it should be declared as a "Map". Might as well fix it while we're here.
