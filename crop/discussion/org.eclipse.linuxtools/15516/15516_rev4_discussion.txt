Abandoned

Doesn't rebase easily due to the TmfDataProvider -> TmfEventProvider change. I tried fixing it, and it ended up breaking a bunch of tests and basic opening of a trace. It was a good change, unfortunately not worth the effort to bring it back to latest master (might as well rewrite it at this point).
