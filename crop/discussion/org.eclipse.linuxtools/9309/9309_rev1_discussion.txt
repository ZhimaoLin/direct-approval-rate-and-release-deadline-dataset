Just some small issues to deal with.

Line:24, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/provider/tests/stubby/StubbyTimingLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> I think this class should extend StubbyLaunchConfigurationDelegate given their similarity, and that it would eliminate the need to override the 2 null-returning methods.

Line:4, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Are these options necessary ? They seem to enabled already in global settings by default.

Line:15, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.provider.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please put these swtbot packages under Require-Bundle (using the containing Bundle-SymbolicName) if possible, or clean them up as necessary.
