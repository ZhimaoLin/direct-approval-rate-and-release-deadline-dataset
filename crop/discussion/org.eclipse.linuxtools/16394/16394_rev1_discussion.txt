DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add Callstack View support for UST traces

UST traces using the lttng-ust-cyg-profile library will contain events
about function entries and exists. We can leverage(!) this information
to populate the generic TMF Callstack view.

For now it will only print the function addresses. Until the whole
function-names-in-the-trace debate is resolved upstream, we will provide
a mechanism to import a mapping file manually. This will come in a
separate commit.

I'm working on adding unit tests for this as a separate patch. In the meantime, if you want to test it, you can use the trace at http://www.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~alexmont/data/glxgears-finstrument-functions.tar.bz2

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I will add support for the cyg-profile-fast probes, which mean you don't have the function names in the func_exit events. In this case we should skip checking completely. Thanks Matthew for pointing this out!
