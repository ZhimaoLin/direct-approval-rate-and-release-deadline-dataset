Patch Set 7: Verified; IP review completed

(4 inline comments)

Looks good, just some pedantic comments on the comments.

Line:355, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTrace.java -> 2 spaces!

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIteratorManager.java -> This should xxx@xxx.xxx 1.1, since this is class was last updated in 1.1

Line:82, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIteratorManager.java -> This is pretty much a #define, it should be static

Line:24, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfLightweightContext.java -> versionj?

It's not part of this change, but might be worth fixing it.
