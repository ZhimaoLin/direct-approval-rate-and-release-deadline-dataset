DESCRIPTION

Add new Systemtap Wizard for new scripts

This patch adds the initial systemtap wizard implementation.  The
manifest and plugin.xml file have been modified for this extention.  The
use is prompted for script name (must end in .stp) and can broswer to
their desired folder.  '#!/usr/bin/env stap' is applied automatically to
the beginning of the new file and the proper perspective is
automatically shown. Strings have been externalized as required.

Patch Set 2: Verified; IP review completed

The IP issue has been addressed. The original image is dual licensed under GPL and EPL.

The localization changes look good, but the strings should be moved to a closer .properties file. I suggest systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/plugin.properties
instead of profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/profiling/launch/messages.properties

Otherwise the patch looks good to me. Approved with the above change.
