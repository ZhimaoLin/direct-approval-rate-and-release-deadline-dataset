DESCRIPTION

Add new Systemtap Wizard for new scripts

This patch adds the initial systemtap wizard implementation.  The
manifest and plugin.xml file have been modified for this extention.  The
use is prompted for script name (must end in .stp) and can broswer to
their desired folder.  '#!/usr/bin/env stap' is applied automatically to
the beginning of the new file and the proper perspective is
automatically shown. Strings have been externalized as required.
