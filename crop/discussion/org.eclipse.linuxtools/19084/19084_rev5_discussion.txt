DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Pre-run autosave for projectless scripts.

When a Systemtap script that lacks a parent project is run,
have that script be immediately saved before the run begins.

This adds to the functionality of fa6613e, which only saves
scripts that belong to a project. This improvement also fixes a
bug introduced in that patch which caused a NullPointerException
when running a projectless script.

This patch also fixes a bug in fa6613e that allowed non-*.stp
files to be run as Systemtap scripts.
