DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Pre-run autosave for projectless scripts.

When a Systemtap script that lacks a parent project is run,
either with the Run Script button on the toolbar or through
its editor's context menu (Run As->Systemtap Script), have
that script be immediately saved before the run begins.

Note that saving does not occur when a script is run with the
Run Configurations menu, or with the Run As button on the toolbar
and its associated keybinding.

This adds to the functionality of fa6613e, which only saves
scripts that belong to a project. This improvement also fixes a
bug introduced in that patch which caused a NullPointerException
when running a projectless script.
