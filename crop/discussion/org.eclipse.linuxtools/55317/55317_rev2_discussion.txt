DESCRIPTION

Bug 468966 - New Connection Wizard fails when no settings are detected

Refactored the wizard page to use Databinding and to validate
connection settings input:
- the unix socket exists and is readable/writable
- the TCP connection scheme is "tcp", "http" or "https"
- the TCP connection host and port are valid
- the path to certificates exists and is readable
  (those values are validated according to the connection
   mode)
- automatically insert a "unix://" prefix (scheme) in the
  "Unix Socket" field when the user selects a file from
  the FileDialog
