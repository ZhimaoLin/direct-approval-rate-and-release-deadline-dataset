DESCRIPTION

Bug 480813 - Should provide a launch shortcut for Build Image Launch

- add a new launch shortcut: BuildDockerImageShortcut
- fix the BuildImageJob to build the image with a default name so
  it can be tagged in the future and will show up even when Image
  filtering is on
- fix BuildImageJob to use Dockerfile as the name to look for
- add a config_id to IBuildDockerImageLaunchConstants so that it is
  centralized
- add a getActiveWorkbenchShell method to Docker UI Activator plug-in
- add a toString() method to DockerConnection which returns the
  connection name
