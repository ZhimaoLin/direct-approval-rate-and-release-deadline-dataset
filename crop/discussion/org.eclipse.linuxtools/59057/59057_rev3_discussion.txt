DESCRIPTION

Bug 480813 - Should provide a launch shortcut for Build Image Launch

- add a new launch shortcut: BuildDockerImageShortcut
- fix the BuildImageJob to build the image with a default name so
  it can be tagged in the future and will show up even when Image
  filtering is on
- fix BuildImageJob to use Dockerfile as the name to look for
- add a config_id to IBuildDockerImageLaunchConstants so that it is
  centralized
- add a getActiveWorkbenchShell method to Docker UI Activator plug-in
- add a toString() method to DockerConnection which returns the
  connection name

Patch Set 3:

in the future, the user will be able to set build options (I have a patch almost ready for that), so saving the configuration makes sense. In particular, setting a tag for the image to build is very relevant and the user may not want to input it for each build. So I would rather keep the part where the launch config was saved.

Patch Set 3:

Ok, launch will be named Dockerfile[PROJECT_NAME] and will be saved.
