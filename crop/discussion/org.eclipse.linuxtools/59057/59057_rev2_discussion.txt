DESCRIPTION

Bug 480813 - Should provide a launch shortcut for Build Image Launch

- add a new launch shortcut: BuildDockerImageShortcut
- fix the BuildImageJob to build the image with a default name so
  it can be tagged in the future and will show up even when Image
  filtering is on
- fix BuildImageJob to use Dockerfile as the name to look for
- add a config_id to IBuildDockerImageLaunchConstants so that it is
  centralized
- add a getActiveWorkbenchShell method to Docker UI Activator plug-in
- add a toString() method to DockerConnection which returns the
  connection name

Code works fine but I added two comments relative to UX improvements

Line:179, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/launch/BuildDockerImageShortcut.java -> If a user has multiple projects with a Dockerfile at their root, the launch configuration names will all be "Dockerfile" or "Dockerfile (n)". Could we include the project name in the config name to distinguish them ? 
Eg: "Dockerfile (<projectname>)"

Line:183, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/launch/BuildDockerImageShortcut.java -> code works fine but since the Dockerfile was selected from the Project explorer, I still believe that the path should be relative to the workspace instead of being absolute.

Line:179, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/launch/BuildDockerImageShortcut.java -> I have decided not to save the configuration.  A saved configuration has no real advantage.  A user wouldn't do this again without editing the Dockerfile.  All the info is in the Dockerfile and so right-clicking on the Dockerfile or in the editor is more direct for the end-user.  Saving the data just clutters the workspace and the run configurations dialog.  This solves the naming strategy dilemma.  I will name it using the workspace relative path before the non-save.

Line:183, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/launch/BuildDockerImageShortcut.java -> Done
