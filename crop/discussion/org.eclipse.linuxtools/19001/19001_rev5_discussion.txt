DESCRIPTION

[rfctf] ctf: Add a check for sequences

Since sequences are of variable size, defined at every instance,
they could be arbitrarily large. While the CTF spec does not
mention any limit for sequence size, there could easily be an out
of memory error. This will check quickly if we run out of memory
before allocating this space. The reason is that this is a particular
point of failure that will incapacitate eclipse. This allows a more
graceful failure.
