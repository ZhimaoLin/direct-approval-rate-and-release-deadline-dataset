DESCRIPTION

ctf: Add a hard limit on sequence sizes

Since sequences are of variable size, defined at every instance,
they could be arbitrarily large. While the CTF spec does not
mention any limit for sequence size, we'll enforce a (reasonably
large) limit in our implementation to keep control on the memory
usage.

How about this?

The exception is caught somewhere on the way up though, we'll have to see if it should be let through up to the API.
