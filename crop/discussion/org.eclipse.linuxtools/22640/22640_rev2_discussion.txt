Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This would be better as a comment in the code. Nobody reads commit messages after the fact.

Line:163, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Why instantiate them lazily? The declarations could be in the top-level class (and static too). Would also save some lines.

Line:195, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Oh ok there is a comment
