Hi Ansgar,

I did a small update on the patch, including some of the build system fixes I mentioned earlier. Please Review and +1 it if you are fine with the changes ;)  (in side-by-side view you can use the numbered buttons at the top to compare two consecutive patch sets).

I also simplified the commit message. Gerrit will add a link to this page, so people wanting to see the review history can follow that link.
