Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This is coming along nicely!

Some small inline comments (they are on Patch Set 1).

I think we're fine with adding a dependency to EMF, but the o.e.l.tmf/feature.xml should be updated also to let Maven know of this new dependency. You can check how it's done in o.e.l.lttng2 for the RSE dependency (or we can push an update to the patch before merging it).

Patch Set 2:

Oh yeah I forgot to add, would it be possible to reduce the dependency to EMF 2.5? I maintain a Debian package of TMF/LTTng, and current Debian/Ubuntu have 2.5.0.
