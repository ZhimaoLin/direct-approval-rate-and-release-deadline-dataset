Small comments.

Make sure you introduce no new warnings before pushing a patch.

Very good practice to add unit tests for new functionality, thanks!

Line:13, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> You can add yourself to the list of contributors, saying like "Correct handling of unsigned integer fields".

Line:202, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> any reason to use Long instead of long? This might cause unneeded boxing/unboxing.

Line:220, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> Please add a comment inside the if explaining what's going on, like

  /* Since there are no 'unsigned long', handle this case with BigInteger */

Line:222, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventField.java -> Please use /* C-style comments */ for permanent inline comments.

  /*
   * Mutli-line comments
   * would look like this
   */

Line:28, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventFieldTest.java -> unused import

Line:203, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventFieldTest.java -> for consistencyâ€™s sake, the method could be called testFormatNumber_unsignedLong()

Line:220, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfEventFieldTest.java -> These 3 last steps are for signed values. Maybe they could be split in a separate "testFormatNumber_signedLong" method.
