DESCRIPTION

pcap: Make all the packages internal

The Pcap plugins are quite new and experimental, it's a bit early
to commit to a final API right now. Keep them internal for the
moment (and tmf.pcap could remain internal forever, since it's
a "leaf" plugin).

Oh good point, the examples still import the old locations... which is why all example code should be in the examples plugin, not in text files ;)
