Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please wrap this to <= 72 chars.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> You can indicate this by just adding a 'Signed-off-by' below Wainer's. See http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html#Signed-off-by for more details. This can be done in EGit by selecting to amend the commit and adding the 'Signed-off-by' from the commit dialog. From the command line you can do 'git commit --amend -s'

Line:5, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ssh.proxy/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This only needs to be bumped to 1.1.0 (and in the pom as well) (ie. to indicate api additions). Plugins can evolved at a different rate from project version.

Line:5, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rdt.proxy/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This only needs to be bumped to 1.1.0 (and in the pom as well) (ie. to indicate api additions). Plugins can evolved at a different rate from project version.

Line:21, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/launch/RemoteEnvProxyManager.java -> I think I missed this, but there should be xxx@xxx.xxx tag here as well since this would also be API.

Line:5, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tools.launch.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I would say that the minor number need not be incremented here because the change is not externally visible. If anything this is more of a bug fix, but the version could stay the same.
