DESCRIPTION

tmf: Code cleanup in the history tree

The method preOrderPrint wasn't thread safe because it was using
a "global" field. This is not a big issue, but it's cleaner this
way.

I did a cleanup pass on this file.

Looks good.

I haven't used the debugging methods in a while, but I think Florian is using them at the moment to test his change. Florian, can you confirm the output still works as it should?
