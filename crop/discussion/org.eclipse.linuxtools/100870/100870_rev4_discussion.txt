DESCRIPTION

Bug 518929 - Invoking CDT code coverage with gcov tmake eclipse freeze for 10 seconds

- change CovView displayCovResults(String, String) to run the other displayCovResults
  method that takes a CovManager and a String in the UI thread, thereby allowing
  callers not to have to run the whole gcov parsing inside the UI thread
- fix GcovLaunchConfigurationDelegate LaunchTerminationWatcher to not run its
  code in the UI thread (let displayCovResults handle it)
- fix OpenGCAction autoOpen method to not run its last call in the UI thread
- fix OpenGCAction open to kick off a thread at the end so that control of the UI
  thread will be returned immediately and any subsequent work will use the UI
  thread as needed
- fix OpenSourceFileAction openAnnotatedSourceFile to run in the UI thread
  so callers needn't run their code in the thread
- add dataviewers dependency to gcov.launch manifest
