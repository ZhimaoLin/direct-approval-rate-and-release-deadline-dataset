Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

The patch introduced a warning: the Javadoc for a deprecated method was referring to a method that was removed. I just removed the method altogether.

I'm all for code removal! In my test (loading from scratch a 50 MB trace), it goes from ~18s on average to 19.5s. Not a big change, but it may affect the high-level scaling more.
