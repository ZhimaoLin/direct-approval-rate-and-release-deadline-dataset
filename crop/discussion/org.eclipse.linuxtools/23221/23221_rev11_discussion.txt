Looks like a good idea, but some minor details

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> the "investigation" should be done before proposing this commit for merging ;)

Line:189, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputReader.java -> There a Javadoc comment in CTFTrace which refers to this method, and now gives a warning because it doesn't exist.
