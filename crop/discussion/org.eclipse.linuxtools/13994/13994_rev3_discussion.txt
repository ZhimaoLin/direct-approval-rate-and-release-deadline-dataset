DESCRIPTION

ctf: Fix seek bug with multi-threaded access

Store the map of event definitions per stream reader, not per
trace. This allows multiple parallel stream readers to work
correctly (same with multiple CtfIterator's).

Fixes bug #405411.

I tested it with the new proposed scheduler and this patch fixes the problem of the incorrect long Histogram after an Eclipse restart

yesss a reason to put a -1 :P

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> duplicate sign-off

I always thought git commit -s was smarter than that...
