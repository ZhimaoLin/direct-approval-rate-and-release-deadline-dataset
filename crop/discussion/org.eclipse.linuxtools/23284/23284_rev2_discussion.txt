Line:256, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> Looks simple enough. Are we OK with exposing those objects though? One could iterate and modify the readers individually. Just making sure...

Line:256, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> I'm not a super fan of showing exposing my junk in public, maybe an interface with only getters would be better? I will think about it.
