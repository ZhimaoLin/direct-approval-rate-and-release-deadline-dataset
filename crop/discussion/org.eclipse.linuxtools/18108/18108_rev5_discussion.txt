Line:29, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I would rather see us not importing internal packages. Looks like we need this one only for CompareAction which itself is just thin wrapper around CompareUI, am I right? If this is the case it would be better to make our own action on top of CompareUI which is defined API.

Still need to create some toolbar button for the compare view to reverse the comparison, and resolve issues regarding internal class use.

Line:29, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I'm considering exposing the CompareAction's action ID as a proper command ID, allowing us to use IHandlerService in order to execute through the extension point framework. I just have to make sure that doing so still properly sets the context for the command (we inject the 2 selections we want the comparison to use)
