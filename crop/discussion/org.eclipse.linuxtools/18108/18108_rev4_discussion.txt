Patch Set 4:

Compare latest menu item should be left in Perf Stat view as the new way is more work than before.  Feel free to simply open the compare view as if user had selected files and compared with each other.

Three-way compare is offered when three files are selected.  Should it, can it, be disabled as it cannot be relevant to this situation?

There doesn't appear to be a way to choose the order of comparison as this would be necessary when comparing two files the user has saved (since comparison colourization is numerically based).  Might suggest ability to switch the order from the view via a button iff this isn't automatically dictated by time-stamp or historical date/time.

Rewriting of the perf.stat file does not result in history being generated.  Please open a separate work item to look into this.
