DESCRIPTION

tmf: Improve time graph combo responsiveness

- Optimize computation of visible expanded items list and prevent
unnecessary recomputation.

- Optimize alignment of tree and time graph item heights and only align
currently visible items.

- Remove the paint listener used to align item heights and add a common
method to simultaneously align the top index and the item heights when
necessary.

Patch Set 2:

Matthew: There are two main modifications in the patch. First, getting the list of visible expanded elements, which is a recursive operation, will return the cached list unless explicitly stated that the list must be recomputed. Second, the alignment of item heights will only be done on the subset of items in this list which are currently visible based on the top index and the tree/item heights.

Line:1064, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> should something special happen when itemHeight == 0?

Still as fast, the bug of the scrollbar is gone and everything seems to work at first sight, at least in Linux.

Line:1064, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> If it happens it is yet another Linux glitch. We'll just ignore that item for now, and make sure we don't overwrite its default item height with an invalid one. We'll catch it on the next call to the method.
