Looks good to me, scrolling, expanding and collapsing.

Patch Set 5:

A delay was added to the alignment after the tree collapsed event, since the listeners can be called before the tree itself is actually collapsed.

It seems that this was the reason for the out-of-sync cached list of visible expanded items, so perhaps the cache can stay, with the speed improvement that comes with it.

I'll submit another patch for testing. I'll also clear the cache immediately whenever the alignment is queued using an asyncExec, to make sure an out-of-sync cache is not used.
