DESCRIPTION

tmf: Improve time graph combo responsiveness

- Optimize computation of visible expanded items list and prevent
unnecessary recomputation.

currently visible items.

- Remove the paint listener used to align item heights and add a common
method to simultaneously align the top index and the item heights when
necessary.

With this change it's now super fast. But I noticed a strange problem with the scrollbar (both overlay disabled or enabled). When I scroll down a bit, suddenly the scrollbar becomes very long, as if the content of the view was very small. I don't know if it's related to your patch or not.

Indeed, it is much faster, but I confirm Marc-Andr√©'s comment. The right scrollbar when scrolling down takes all the space, as if the item count to generate it was the visible item count instead of the total?

Patch Set 1:

If I understand correctly, this patch offers two code paths, one recursive and one on the top level elements only. then the top level only (which is much faster) will be run for the vast majority of queries. Is this correct?
