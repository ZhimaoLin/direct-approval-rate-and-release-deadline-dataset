Line:48, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlStateSystemModule.java -> since the fXmlFile field is mutable, it could technically go back to null, and throw a NPE here (if another thread calls the setter at the same time and you are very unlucky with timing).

Put the field xxx@xxx.xxx it will show the error. And you'd have to extract fXmlFile to a local variable, and do the null check on and use that one.
