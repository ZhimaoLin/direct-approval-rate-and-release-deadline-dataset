Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

Nothing strikes me as bad. tmf.analysis.xml.* is your playground anyway, nobody knows what really happens there ;)

A note for splitting big patches: it's a bit weird to add a file with parts saying /* TODO code will be added here */  and have that part in a separate patch. We still wonder why the file is for, and have to go read the next patches to know more. The whole file should come at the same time, if possible.

Of course it's very case-by-case... but for example, if I had to push internal.tmf.core.statesystem, I could put "Attribute" in the first patch, then "AttributeTree" in the second and "StateSystem + TransientState" in the third. This splits the functionality in independent parts (Attribute doesn't depend on anything, then AttributeTree makes use of it etc.) It also forces to have the design done in layers, which is a good practice in general.

just sayin'

It may be my playground for now, but I dearly hope it will be mature soon enough and then it will become everyone's playground! I hate playing alone!
