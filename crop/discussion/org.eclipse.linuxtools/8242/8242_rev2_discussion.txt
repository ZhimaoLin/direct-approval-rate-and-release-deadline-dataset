DESCRIPTION

tmf: Store the generic statistics timestamps in nanoseconds

Since the TmfStatistics can be used with any trace type, and not
just LTTng kernel traces, we can't know exactly what scale its
timestamps are in.

To be safe, convert all timestamps to nanoseconds before saving
them in the history database. When we want to display the
information, the query timestamps will also be converted to
nanoseconds.
