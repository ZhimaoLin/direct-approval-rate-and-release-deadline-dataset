Patch Set 2:

Nice patch! The developer guide should also be updated, since now, it is not necessary to have the exact same name (PcapProtocol vs TmfPcapProtocol), and that the PcapProtocol must be passed at the constructor.

Patch Set 2:

Good point! I'll prepare a patch to udpate it.

Ideally, long code examples should go in the tracing.examples plugin (and then the doc can refer to it). This way we can see right away if the example doesn't compile anymore. ;)
