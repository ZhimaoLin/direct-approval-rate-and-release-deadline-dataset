DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add new analysis module listener called when module are being instantiated

Those listeners are managed by the analysis manager and the helpers need to
call a method from the analysis manager when they instantiate new module
objects so that the listeners are run on this module.

This will allow among other to associate the applicable outputs to the
analysis module being created.
