DESCRIPTION

TMF: Add new analysis module listener called when module are being instantiated

Those listeners are managed by the analysis manager and the helpers need to
call a method from the analysis manager when they instantiate new module
objects so that the listeners are run on this module.

This will allow among other to associate the applicable outputs to the
analysis module being created.

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisManager.java -> Would it make sense to have a method to add listeners so that other clients can add their own? It seems pretty limited to have an observer pattern but the manager both knows about which listeners it wants to notify (see initializeNewModuleListeners in next patch) and also takes care of notifying without letting other clients add more listeners.

Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisManager.java -> Indeed some other clients may want to do something else when a new module is created, I guess it would make sense to do that. Actually, the XML views may need it (a few unsubmitted patches away). 

If you don't mind, I'll add the addListener method along with that, to test it with a real use case and make sure the initializeNewModuleListeners do not erase those listeners.
