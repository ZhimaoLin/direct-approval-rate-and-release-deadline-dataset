Patch Set 2:

I added a copyright header to get-traces.xml (not sure who the original author was, but it was from Red Hat).

However my Eclipse Copyright Tool didn't pick it up, in fact it doesn't seem to pick up any XML files, even though the option is set. So these headers might not be updated automatically. Could be a problem on my end, since I'm using 4.3 but the tool from 4.2?
