DESCRIPTION

tmf: Improve Delete Supplementary Files command

- Make all checkbox elements checked by default in the dialog

- Allow multiple selection as long as at least one of the selected
elements has supplementary files

- Update trace handler to support both traces and experiments, and
delete the experiment handler

- Ensure supplementary files for a particular trace are only shown once
in the list (e.g. same trace selected both under Traces folder and under
experiment, or two experiments selected that contain the same trace)

- Ensure only traces and experiments that have supplementary resources
to delete have their editors closed, and that their project is refreshed
only once.

Line:87, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceSupplementaryFilesHandler.java -> That's pretty clever!

It will look nice with lambdas ;)
