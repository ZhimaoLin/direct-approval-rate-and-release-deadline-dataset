DESCRIPTION

tmf: Improve Delete Supplementary Files command

- Make all checkbox elements checked by default in the dialog

- Allow multiple selection as long as at least one of the selected
elements has supplementary files

- Update trace handler to support both traces and experiments, and
delete the experiment handler

- Ensure supplementary files for a particular trace are only shown once
in the list (e.g. same trace selected both under Traces folder and under
experiment, or two experiments selected that contain the same trace)

- Ensure only traces and experiments that have supplementary resources
to delete have their editors closed, and that their project is refreshed
only once.
