Line:50, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/tests/ctfadaptor/CtfTmfTimestampTest.java -> Why not make the test timezone-independent by either calculating the correct long value for "00:00:00" based on local time, or changing the timezone of TmfTimestampFormat.getDefaulTimeFormat() to GMT in the test case.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm with Patrick on this, the test should not work in only one timezone.
