Problem: this can only be merged when the stats view, the histogram and the events list are fixed, then this will be acceptable. until then, the information is insufficient.

Patch Set 2:

@Matthew
Fair enough, we might not want to cause regression wrt the current behavior.

Event list is already "fixed", as in nothing special had to be done, it Just Werks(TM) ;)

Histogram and stats view would have to be updated (in separate commits, which would depend on this one). I updated bug 408373.

After some review, the generated CTF meta-event should also indicate the time range of lost events (not just one timestamp).
