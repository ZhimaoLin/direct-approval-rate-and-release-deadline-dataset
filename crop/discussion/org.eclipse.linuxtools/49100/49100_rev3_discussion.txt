DESCRIPTION

Bug 468964: Pass script path as array to ensure proper tokenization.

Some paths may contain spaces, so passing elements to
Runtime.getRuntime.exec() as String arrays will avoid tokenization by
spaces.

This is change looks fine to me. This should preserve all previous functionality with the added effect that paths with spaces will not be tokenized incorrectly.
