Line:27, libhover/org.eclipse.linuxtools.cdt.libhover.libstdcxx/pom.xml -> It is used by all our source plugins at the moment which is why the comment of the patch is "consistency".  A problem came up in a release which has an older Tycho.  When that tycho gets updated, I imagine all of these can be removed at once.  This entire block was copied from another plug-in.
