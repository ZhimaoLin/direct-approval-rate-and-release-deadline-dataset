And here comes the callstack view. This is definitely a killer feature/view! People will fall off their chairs! :)

Some initial comments.

Is it possible you forgot to git add your state provider file? I don't see it anywhere.

I'm also a bit concerned with adding another ~1500 LOCs of code that is redundant with code in the Control Flow and Resource views already. If we want to get this view in for Kepler we might not really have a choice, but we should limit ourselves afterwards and stop copy-pasting thousands of lines of codes until we do some consolidation first.

Line:13, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfCallStackStateSystem.java -> tmf.core.statesystem is for the plumbing of the state system itself. Here you're using it to build something else, so it should go in a packages like tmf.core.callstack ?

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfCallStackStateSystem.java -> This doc (and the defines below) should go in the state change input a.k.a the state provider a.k.a. the event handler.

Also, why do you need a separate interface? Can't you use the CallStackStateChangeInput or w/e directly?

Line:372, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/StateSystem.java -> Comment should be updated too. Yeah it's easy to forget those ;)

Line:287, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/Messages.java -> I think we were moving to having Messages/messages.properties files per package. This should go in the tmf.ui.views.callstack package.
