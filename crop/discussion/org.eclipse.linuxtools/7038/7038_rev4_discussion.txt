DESCRIPTION

Add preselection of launch provider backend to launch provider's config tab.

When the launch provider's config tab is opened, a previously selected
provider is preselected; if no provider is found in the launch configuration,
the provider with the highest priority is preselected. This change required
refactoring that allowed for a fix of the launch configuration persistence
problem with the launch provider config tab to be made.
