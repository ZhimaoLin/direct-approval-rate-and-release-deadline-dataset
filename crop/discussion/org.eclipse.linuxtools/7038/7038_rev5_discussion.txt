DESCRIPTION

Add preselection of launch provider backend to launch provider's config tab.

When the launch provider's config tab is opened, a previously selected
provider is preselected; if no provider is found in the launch configuration,
the provider with the highest priority is preselected. This change required
refactoring that allowed for a fix of the launch configuration persistence
problem with the launch provider config tab to be made.

Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Just some minor issues to fix. I've tested the change itself and it works for me.

Line:135, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/launch/ProfileLaunchConfigurationTabGroup.java -> This should xxx@xxx.xxx 1.2 (If you look at the Manifest file, you'll see that it is still at 1.1, but all these API additions will end up in 1.2).

Line:213, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/launch/ProfileLaunchConfigurationTabGroup.java -> The previous method can't be removed as it's part of the API (It was shipped in 1.1). Instead you can make the old method, call the new one. Then just make sure the old method has @Deprecated added and make sure the new one xxx@xxx.xxx 1.2 added.

Line:243, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/launch/ProfileLaunchConfigurationTabGroup.java -> This should also xxx@xxx.xxx 1.2, since it is an addition to be part of the 1.2 API.
