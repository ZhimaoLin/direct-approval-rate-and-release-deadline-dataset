Line:110, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/launchers/DockerAllBotTest Mockito.launch -> This xml item is not properly ended.

Line:37, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/README -> should be e.g. instead of ex. if you mean for example

This is done throughout document.

Line:39, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/README -> This is confusing.  You don't mention dockerMachineName which takes precedence over both unixSocket and server URI.

I would suggest mentioning just the precedence for URI and docker machine name like you do for dockerMachineName.  Then mention in unixSocket that if neither uri or docker machine is specified, this is defaulted with unix://var/run/docker.sock as the value.

Line:40, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/README -> Don't assume "he".

If not specified, a unix socket with default value...

or "If the user doesn't specify, a unix socket with...

This is done elsewhere.

Line:60, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/integration/tests/image/HierarchyViewTest.java -> Why is setupDataForMockito() called here when it is designated with xxx@xxx.xxx keyword below?  I have seen this in a few other tests as well.

Line:37, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Did you not mean to just export this internal package to the new test plug-ins that need it?
