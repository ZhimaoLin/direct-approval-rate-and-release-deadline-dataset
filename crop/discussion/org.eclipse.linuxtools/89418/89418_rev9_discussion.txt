minor review

Line:44, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/README -> would be nice to explain how to have it working on Windows too

Line:2, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/integration/tests/AbstractDockerBotTest.java -> shouldn't be updated to 2017?

Line:214, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.integration.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/docker/integration/tests/AbstractDockerBotTest.java -> job.getName() can be extracted as variable for more readability
