DESCRIPTION

lttng: add support for kernel-only in tracer control (bug406120)

This commit allows the user to connect to a remote LTTng node 
where UST is disabled and only the kernel tracer is available. 
For LTTng tools 2.0.x, the command lttng list -u causes a 
segmentation fault on the remote side. This segmentation fault
makes it impossible to use the kernel-only mode. This bug is fixed
in later versions of LTTng tools starting from 2.1.0.
