DESCRIPTION

Add functionality and API to run script locally

Running a systemtap script should not require the sshd service,
especially when simply trying to run the script locally.  This patch
adds the functionality to bypass the scp/ssh portions of the code and
simply run the command locally.  A get/set style api has been added to
modify and read a protected boolean representing the local/remote
choice.  The default remains to use sshd in order to keep the current
implemenation the same.  A section in the systemtap preferences should
be set up to modify and set the local/remote settings.
