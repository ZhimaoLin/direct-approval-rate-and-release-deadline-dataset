DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add missing test files in jars and make XmlAnalysisModuleSource safer

If the analysis.xml.ui.tests binary plugin is present in an installation,
XmlAnalysisModuleSource looks for an inexistant file and throws a NPE.
In this patch, the missing files are included and XmlAnalysisModuleSource
is made safer in case an extension throws an exception.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Should I verify, or can you? I think this is rather hard to reproduce.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

I verified it with and without the patch.

Just to put things more in context... I have a downstream project that pulls the dependencies from Linux Tools using a Target Definition so that's why I don't have the code in the workspace. When I run some tests, at some point it runs XmlAnalysisModuleSource.populateBuiltinModules and this is when the problem occurred.
