DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add missing test files in jars and make XmlAnalysisModuleSource safer

If the analysis.xml.ui.tests binary plugin is present in an installation,
XmlAnalysisModuleSource looks for an inexistant file and throws a NPE.
In this patch, the missing files are included and XmlAnalysisModuleSource
is made safer in case an extension throws an exception.
