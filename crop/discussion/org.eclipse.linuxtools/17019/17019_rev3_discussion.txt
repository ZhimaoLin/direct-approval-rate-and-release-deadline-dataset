Patch Set 3:

Hi Patrick & Alexandre,

Please find here a third patch set.
- I've added a "Delete" handler, as suggested by Patrick.
- Cut/Copy/Paste actions are now available on both toolbar and popup menu, as suggested by Patrick.
- Nodes are no longer copied by default when dropped on a children. By default, it does nothing, as requested by Patrick.
- Fix various typos (thanks Patrick)

Not done yet:
- Dnd to/from XML text
- Insert ADD/OR node when adding a second child condition to a node
- Support of cut/copy/paste/dnd filters in color view
- Still use the same LocalSelectionTransfer instance for both Copy&Paste and Drag&Drop

Patch Set 3:

I'm not sure why, but if I cut the last FILTER node from the FiltersView, then the 'edit' commands do not show up in the popup menu, even though 'Paste' is enabled and works from the Edit menu (and PasteHandler.isEnabled() returns true).

I also notice in debugging that the 'isEnabled()' method of all four handlers are constantly being called (more than once per second) as long as the FiltersView has focus. Maybe it's due to the popup menu contribution in plugin.xml and is normal? Perhaps it wouldn't happen if the 'edit' commands were added programatically. But I'm OK if that's the way it should work.
