DESCRIPTION

gdbtrace: Prevent hang when a lot of commands are sent to GDB

This can happen when commands are sent to GDB on the UI thread
and the GDB traces console gets full. The UI thread is responsible of
doing the "flush" of the console buffer so if the UI thread waits for
the flush it will wait for itself forever. The solution is to not send
GDB commands on the UI thread.
