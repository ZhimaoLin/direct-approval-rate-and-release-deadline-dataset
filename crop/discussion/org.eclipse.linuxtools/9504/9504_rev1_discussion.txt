DESCRIPTION

tmf: Store a StateSystem's ID in the object itself

We are already using different state ID's since we can have more
than one state system at the same time. It would be useful to
know the ID of a SS we're holding a reference to.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Not a good idea after all, if we ever need the ID in the state system, we can add it back at that point.
