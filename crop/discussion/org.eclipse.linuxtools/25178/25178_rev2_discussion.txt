DESCRIPTION

profiling: Java 8 javadoc generation.

With doclint enabled by default this is needed to make javadoc
generation in profiling dir without an error (still ~100 warnings).
The patch has some side effects like removing code, making methods
private and other changes that are easier to do than writing the javadoc
for things that are unclear what do they do.
