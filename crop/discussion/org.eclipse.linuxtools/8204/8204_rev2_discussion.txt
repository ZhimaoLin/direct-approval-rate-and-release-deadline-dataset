Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Also need to import and update test plugins to make sure they are aligned with these code changes.

Line:148, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeDataProvider.java -> The enum value in code is actually ABSOLUTE, but CALENDAR would perhaps be better...

Line:149, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeDataProvider.java -> RELATIVE format currently only displays seconds/ms/us/ns.
