Since this patch includes API breaking change and requires stepping to 2.0, you might want to wait to submit it until we merge lttng-kepler branch and 'officially' step master branch to 2.0 (this should be done soon). Otherwise your patch might be missing some peripheral updates to plug-in files due to the version change.

Line:155, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng/ui/viewers/timeAnalysis/widgets/TmfTimeTipHandler.java -> Ok, but not necessary change since legacy LTTng plugins are being removed in 2.0.
