Sorry for the delay in reviewing this.

Line:143, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeDataProvider.java -> We can not add a method to an interface in a minor version change (1.1 to 1.2). We need to have a major version change (2.0).
What we can do in 1.2 is create a new interface ITimeDataProvider2 that extends this one. The other classes would need an instanceof check before calling the interface.
Then in 2.0 we can merge the two interfaces back into one.
But now that stable-1.2 branch is created, this might not make it in 1.2 release, so we could just do the change in 2.0.

Line:145, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeDataProvider.java -> Having unformatted display of the time value is a valid requirement but not necessarily restricted to cycles. There is also an ambiguity when both cycle format and calendar format are set to true.
What I would suggest is to remove isCalendarFormat and replace it with getTimeFormat that returns an enum defined in the interface, with 3 possible values, for example NUMBER, SECONDS, CALENDAR.

Line:167, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphScale.java -> Suggest to rename cycle to number.
