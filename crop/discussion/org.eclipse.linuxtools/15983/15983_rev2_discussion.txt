Some of this patch overlaps with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/13787/ wrt to opening experiments vs traces, but they take a different approach.

This patch could be transitory until experiment types get in though.

Line:261, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> There's quite a bit of common code with the openTraceFromElement.  I had proposed something similar as part of the patch for experiment types, but using the same function for both traces and experiments.  See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/13787/4/lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java.

A good part of that patch is factoring out common behavior of both trace and experiment so that they are treated the same as much as possible.

Since the consolidation of common code in the open/reopen methods are done together with consolidation of review https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/13787/ of Genevieve, I'm ok to push it as.

Line:261, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> I agree with the comment, but I suggest to let you re-consolidate the methods when you rebase your patch (13787), since you have already done most of the work and refactored some common code (e.g. TmfCommonProjectElement). Is that OK?
