It solves the bug.

Only that small comment...

Line:181, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> Could the description (and function name?) be changed to "Open or make active" or something like that? This way, we know this function could be called also if the trace was previously opened to set it as the current trace

Line:181, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> I'm ok with the name, but the description could have more details.
