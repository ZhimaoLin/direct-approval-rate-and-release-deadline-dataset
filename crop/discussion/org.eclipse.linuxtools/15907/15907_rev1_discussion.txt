It does look like an interface more than a class.

I'm fine with pushing this as is, but please check the comments, there's a slight chance they can be insightful...

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit titles should use present tense.

Line:125, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfNetworkEventMatching.java -> Not sure if you want to fix this in this commit or another...

But you could do a "instanceof ITmfNetworkMatchDefinition" check before the cast, to insure it's safe. Such a check also counts as a null check ("null" will always fail all instanceof checks), so you wouldn't need the separate null check below.
