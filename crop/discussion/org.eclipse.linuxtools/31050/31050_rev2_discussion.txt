DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Attempt to fix failing tooltip test.

TestCreateSystemtaptapScript.testGraphTooltips() often fails
because an expected tooltip cannot be found when the mouse
hovers over a graph's data point. Attempt to supress this
problem by retrying the test multiple times before failing.
