DESCRIPTION

Expect the zipped p2 repository to be in the target_save folder.

This takes into account the fact that executing mvn clean install
followed by mvn javadoc:aggregate will require backing up the target
folder for 'eclipse-repository' types.

See 7ad467290a4371eb668f6009ba06a5a624603f04 for more details.
