DESCRIPTION

[TMF] Handle custom traces in TmfTraceType in a more consistent way

Instead of storing the custom trace types by human readable name, store them by traceId like the other trace types.
The trace Id is the canonical name + the definition name. This makes it consistent with TmfTraceElement.getTraceType.
Also, consolidate code that can reuse TmfTraceType.setTraceType.
