Looks good, I was able to test it using a dummy MenuManager. Indeed, the current behavior really conflicts when using a right-click menu. Your patch fixes it. Thanks!

Line:2150, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Hahaha! Is that a counter to Patrick's common "Bug in Linux" comments? ;)

It's not a bug it's a feature!
