DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add plugins and trace type for UST traces

These plugins add support for a new "CTF : LTTng UST" trace type, which
are generated by the LTTng-UST library (and not the kernel tracer).

For now this type will be pretty much identical to the Genric CTF Trace
type, but it will allow us to eventually add UST-specific features, like
specific Events view, Statistics view, state systems, and whatnot.
