DESCRIPTION

lttng: Add plugins and trace type for UST traces

These plugins add support for a new "CTF : LTTng UST" trace type, which
are generated by the LTTng-UST library (and not the kernel tracer).

For now this type will be pretty much identical to the Genric CTF Trace
type, but it will allow us to eventually add UST-specific features, like
specific Events view, Statistics view, state systems, and whatnot.

I can't install the UST feature from the Linux Tools repo. You need to add it to:
releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.releng-site/category.xml

The source feature also needs to be added in the same file.

Line:13, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust/feature.properties -> Rename to "LTTng Userspace Analysis" to be in line with "LTTng Kernel Analysis"

This brings up a good point actually. Do we want UST to be selectable as a separate feature, or should it be included with lttng2.kernel into a "LTTng analysis" feature?

IMHO, There should be only one "LTTng 2.x support" selectable feature that ships the control (lttng2.*), the kernel (lttng2.kernel.*) and thew new UST plugins. If you look at the other Linux Tools projects, they only expose one feature to install in the Eclispe UI. We're kind of the black sheep with "LTTng - Linux Tracing Toolkit" and "LTTng Kernel Analysis". Which are not very informative...

Line:13, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.ust/feature.properties -> I was expanding the formal "LTTng-UST" name (vs "LTTng kernel"), but I agree LTTng Userspace Analysis sounds better.

Was there a request to make them separate? I think they make sense together but it really just depends on how users want to consume LTTng. If a considerate amount of people don't want to Kernel support, I think it makes sense to leave them with the option to not install it (more UI clutter like extra perspective, etc). But at the same time, it's nice to provide a feature that includes "default stuff" that's just easy to install. So one way to go would be to have a bigger feature like "Tracing tools" including all of this stuff we think is good to have by default and then provide the other features as piece meal. TMF, CTF, Lttng Kernel, UST, Control, etc. A bit how one can get the Eclipse Platform then add JDT instead of downloading the Eclipse Standard EPP.

It's a bit confusing to me. It there a difference between those two anyway? It seems they would end up installing the same plugins anyway.

Patch Set 3:

"LTTng - Linux Trace Toolkit" will only install the control plugin. "LTTng Kernel Analysis" will install the support for kernel traces (control flow view etc.)

After some discussion, I think we'll push it like this for now (not linked to the installable features) and when we get some useful functionality in, we could expose it if we want.
