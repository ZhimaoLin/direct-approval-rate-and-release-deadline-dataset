DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary get/set selection calls from Vagrant views.

The get -> refresh -> set logic is not what's responsible for preserving
a selection after refreshes occur. The UI already knows how to preserve
a selection. As long as the objects given to the content provider
override equals() and hasCode(), the selection will be preserved without
any intervention.
