DESCRIPTION

ctf: Reformat and remove debugs in the CTF-Grammar.

This is mostly a grammar reformatting.
My plan is to change some rules in the grammar.
I prefer to land the reformatting before playing with the grammar.

The 'debug_print' is useless in the grammar.
Antlr (and antlrworks) provides a really good debugger for debugging
this kind of grammar.

Patch Set 2:

There is propably no need to update the "jar" file now.

In fact, I just removed some debugging code in the grammar.
Thus, the previous antlr should be able to manage it as-is.

There is probably a stupid mistake in the file (line newline conversion, etc...) that I missed.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.parser/src/main/antlr3/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/parser/CTFParser.g -> this * is what is causing issues. I do not know why.
