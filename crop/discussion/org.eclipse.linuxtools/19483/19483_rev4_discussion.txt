ctf: Reformat and remove debugs in the CTF-Grammar

This is mostly a grammar reformatting.
My plan is to change some rules in the grammar.
I prefer to land the reformatting before playing with the grammar.

The 'debug_print' is useless in the grammar.
Antlr (and antlrworks) provides a really good debugger for debugging
this kind of grammar.
