DESCRIPTION

lttng: Sort the entries in the Resources View

Make the ResourcesEntry Comparable, so that the view can specify
how they should be sorted when entries are added to the list.

This also works for entries that are being added while the trace
is being read ("live" reading).

Line:180, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/resources/ResourcesEntry.java -> We could avoid making setParent() public if we use rEntry instead here?

Line:180, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/resources/ResourcesEntry.java -> Hmm, rEntry was meant to be "temporary", but I admit for now it would probably be cleaner to use if we can keep the setter protected.
