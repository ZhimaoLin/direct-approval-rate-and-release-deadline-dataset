Will have to be rebased on master to build.

This is a VERY good change! We have many utility classes with getInstance() methods where it's not needed, since the whole thing can be static. Then you avoid having many components repeatedly calling the synchronized getInstance() and blocking each other.

One very small thing though.

Line:154, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/project/model/TmfTraceType.java -> keep the private default constructor, but make it empty. This will prevent the class from being instantiated (and it's already final)
