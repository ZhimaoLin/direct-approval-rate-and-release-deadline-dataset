Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

Just fixed my previous comment.

I also experimented with using ImmutableMap's instead, but those fail if duplicate keys are added. Since we don't really check for duplicate keys currently (the latest key just overwrites the previous ones), this would become too big a change in one go :)
