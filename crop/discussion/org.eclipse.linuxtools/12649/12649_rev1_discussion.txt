DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use the signal's trace in the traceOpened handler

In a trace's trace-opened handler, to verify if the trace is the
target of the signal, use the new TmfTraceManager.getTraceSet()
method instead of relying on the currently-active trace set.

In practice, the behavior should be the same, but it's a bit clearer
and cleaner this way.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Should also use new method getTraceSet(ITmfTrace) at every occurrence of getActiveTraceSet() which can then be removed.

Line:645, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> would prefer 'trace' instead of 'expTrace' as it is not an experiment in the normal case
