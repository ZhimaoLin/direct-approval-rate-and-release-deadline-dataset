Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Please add the plugin name in the first line of the commit message (oprofile: ) and remove "worked on review".

It would be good if the customize button worked even after moving the event from one list to another. What could be done is that when a user clicks an event of a list, if there are selected events on the other list, it should get unselected.

Also, did you check if opcontrol is working properly with more than one counter (like in ppc)?
