DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: make fixes to script start/stop actions.

1) The Stop Script button now terminates a Systemtap script
if it is clicked before the script actually begins.

2) The Stop Script button now becomes deactivated when a
script exits on its own.

3) Starting and stopping scripts is now much more stable.
For instance, starting & stopping scripts quickly and
repeatedly no longer causes script run failures.

This looks fine to me. I've also noticed some NPEs in GraphSelectorEditor at this.setPartName, but they seem unrelated.

Line:47, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.consolelog/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/ui/consolelog/structures/ScriptConsole.java -> I would consider renaming these to something more indicative of what they do.

stopWatcher with runOnStop seems to wait for the original stap script command to notify it has stopped/finished, which seems a little vague.

startThread with startOnStop seems to be what run the script followed by the stopWatcher thread but the names are also a bit vague.
