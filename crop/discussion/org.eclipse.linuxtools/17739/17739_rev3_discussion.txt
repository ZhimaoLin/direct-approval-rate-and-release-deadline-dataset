DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: make fixes to script start/stop actions.

1) The Stop Script button now terminates a Systemtap script
if it is clicked before the script actually begins.

2) The Stop Script button now becomes deactivated when a
script exits on its own.

3) Starting and stopping scripts is now much more stable.
For instance, starting & stopping scripts quickly and
repeatedly no longer causes script run failures.
