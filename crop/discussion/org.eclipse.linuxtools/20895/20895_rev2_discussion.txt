DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Warn when about to overrun a script.

Running a new instance of a running script terminates the
old one. If a user tries to run a script in this way,
a warning dialog now appears to ask the user if they
want to terminate the old run, rather than terminating
it automatically (See EBZ #394999).

Line:208, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/actions/RunScriptHandler.java -> I would rather see this become dialog.open() != Window.OK so one doesn't have to remember the constants open returns.
