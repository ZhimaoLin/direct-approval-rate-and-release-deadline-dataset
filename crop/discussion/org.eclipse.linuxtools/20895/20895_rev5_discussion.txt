DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Warn when about to overrun a script.

Running a new instance of a running script terminates the
old one. If a user tries to run a script in this way,
a warning dialog now appears to ask the user if they
want to terminate the old run, rather than terminating
it automatically (See EBZ #394999).
