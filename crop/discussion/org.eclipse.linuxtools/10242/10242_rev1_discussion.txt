Line:115, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/SourceDisassemblyView.java -> It's better to just set an integer and increment for every new view (assuming we proceed with allowing multiple views). There won't be any threading issues since we only create new views of this type here, one at a time.

Line:142, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> Should every single perf command get its own view? Maybe we should use the same view and draw widgets according to the data. With this approach we could identify what type of command is run in the view's content description. For example, adding "[Source Disassembly]".

Line:115, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/ui/SourceDisassemblyView.java -> Agreed, makes sense to me.

Line:142, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> Following this suggestion,  if I chose to view source disassembly, I woudn't get to see the perf events tree?

Line:142, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/launch/PerfLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> We could show any number of views as long as that particular view's extension point is set to allow multiple instances. We could determine from the data being passed in what type of widgets layout need to be displayed.

I guess this change could ultimately be done after we get this commit in. To be honest, the difference to the user would be minimal (differently labeled views vs. same view with different content description).
