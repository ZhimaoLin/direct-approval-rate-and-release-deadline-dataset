DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a trace-getting method in TmfView

Instead of calling the getSite.getPage.getEditor mantra every
time, if anyone has a reference to a view they can now use this
convenience getActiveTrace() method to get the currently selected
trace.

Kind of replacement for the old TmfExperiment.getCurrentExperiment();
