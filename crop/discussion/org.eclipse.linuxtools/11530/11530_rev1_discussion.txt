DESCRIPTION

tmf: Add a trace-getting method in TmfView

Instead of calling the getSite.getPage.getEditor mantra every
time, if anyone has a reference to a view they can now use this
convenience getActiveTrace() method to get the currently selected
trace.

Kind of replacement for the old TmfExperiment.getCurrentExperiment();

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Unfortunately, we cannot reuse the code in TmfUml2SDSyncLoader. The SDView class doesn't extend TmfView and we cannot easily change it because of the sequence diagram extension point.
