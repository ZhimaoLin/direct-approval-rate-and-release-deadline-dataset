do you have a way to test this? I'd like to see what it looks like ;)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> analyses

Line:135, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfAnalysisElement.java -> can't the styler be defined statically?

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfStyledProjectModelElement.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfStyledProjectModelElement.java -> don't put public, all interface methods are necessarily public

This is what the other 2 patches in the series are about: having some analyses to strike out.

Line:135, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfAnalysisElement.java -> Yes yes it can, and in this case, it probably makes sense

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfStyledProjectModelElement.java -> I know! Why WHY do I always do this then? :p
