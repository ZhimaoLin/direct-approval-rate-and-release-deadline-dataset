DESCRIPTION

Add support for perf diff command.

* Added perf diff view, handler, data manipulator and SWTBot test.
* Perf diff feature behaves similarly to perf stat diff. That is, it runs
  on user specified perf data files and displays the comparison result in
  a text view.

All tests pass, and everything looks fine to me. Just needs to be added to the swtbot test suite. Are there any issues with accepting a feature so late in the release cycle?

Line:21, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/swtbot/tests/ReportComparisonViewTest.java -> I think this class would need to be added to the AllPerfTests testsuite in this package.

Considering how long this was added and that documentation is present I would say no.
