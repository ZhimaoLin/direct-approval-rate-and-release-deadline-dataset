Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

I was concerned about the constructor that was calling init(), so that it could still create a thread at construction time (which is the bad thing FindBugs etc. warns you about).

But actually that constructor isn't used in anything except tests! So we could just remove it next.

I have tested this, and it works, a later patch needed will be to remove the ctor(string, class) and make the tests use this constructor and an init, but that is another patch.
