DESCRIPTION

tmf: Don't use assumeTrue() xxx@xxx.xxx in ctfadaptor tests

The behavior of a failed assumeTrue() placed within xxx@xxx.xxx
method is really inconsistent between Eclipse and Maven. It can lead
to test failures, when it should really only skip the class.

Patch Set 4:

I'll leave the state system tests as they are right now, since it seems to cause more problems. At least this change should prevent the CTF tests from failing if run from Maven without the relevant test trace.
