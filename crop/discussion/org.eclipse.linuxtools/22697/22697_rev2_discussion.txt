DESCRIPTION

tmf: Don't use assumeTrue() xxx@xxx.xxx

The behavior of a failed assumeTrue() placed within xxx@xxx.xxx
method is really inconsistent between Eclipse and Maven. It can lead
to test failures, when it should really only skip the class.

Move all the uses of assumeTrue() xxx@xxx.xxx methods. That way they
get associated to a particular test, and that test is then marked as
skipped.
