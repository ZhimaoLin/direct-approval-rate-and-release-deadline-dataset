The problem should also be fixed for the XML wizard.
We might also want to consider adding a "Clone" button to the Manage Custom Parsers dialog in order to keep the possibility to modify an existing parser without changing the original.

Line:54, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/CustomTxtParserWizard.java -> The design error is that def is always equal to definition (if it is not null) because the wizard pages just modify the source definition object and do not create a new one. I would suggest instead to save the editDefinitionName in this class (which could be null when creating a new parser).
