DESCRIPTION

Remove -v and -p1 parameters from stap '' -v -p1 -L ** command

When parsing out the probe points for the systemtap IDE mode,
the command $stap '' -v -p1 -L ** was used.  However, -v and -p1
have no effect on the probe points listed and can be removed without
effecting the functionality of the IDE

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Thank-you for contributing this as per the guidelines. The proposed change would return the exact same stream of data (with only stderr being empty, but it's ignored anyways). The contribution itself is 4 lines (3 javadoc updates, and 1 actual code change), so I'm approving this change.
