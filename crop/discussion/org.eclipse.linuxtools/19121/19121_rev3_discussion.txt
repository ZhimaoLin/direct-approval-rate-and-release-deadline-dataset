DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Make improvements to pie charts.

1) By default, put a title label on a pie chart legend, using
the title of the x-series data as the contents of the label.

2) Ensure that all names given to pie chart slices/colors (which
are provided by y-series titles) are unique, to prevent data from
being ignored when a pie is drawn.

Line:59, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> Can we use instanceof here ?

Line:91, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/charts/PieChartBuilder.java -> Hmm.. A LinkedHashSet, as opposed to a HashSet, is used to maintain insertion or access order as well as the usual hashing functions. I think a HashSet should suffice here. Otherswise nicely done. Looks much cleaner

Line:59, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.dataviewers.piechart/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/dataviewers/piechart/PieChart.java -> I don't think so, since these classes are from internal packages. If I try to import them, Eclipse gives me an Access Restriction error on swt-chart.jar.

Line:91, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/charts/PieChartBuilder.java -> I need to preserve the order of the labels, otherwise chart categories & their labels will be jumbled.
