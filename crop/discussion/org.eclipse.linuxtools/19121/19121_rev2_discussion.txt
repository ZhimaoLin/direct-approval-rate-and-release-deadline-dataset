DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Make improvements to pie charts.

1) By default, put a title label on a pie chart legend, using
the title of the x-series data as the contents of the label.

2) Ensure that all names given to pie chart slices/colors (which
are provided by y-series titles) are unique, to prevent data from
being ignored when a pie is drawn.

Line:105, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.graphingapi.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/systemtap/graphingapi/ui/charts/PieChartBuilder.java -> The above could probably be more easily done with a HashSet.
