DESCRIPTION

Bug 508233 - Fix copy from container

- add support to ContainerCopyFromPage when the container is stopped
  to just add a text widget for specifying container directories
- fix CheckboxTreeAndListGroup to access children when new tree
  entries show up (get children's children, then check the new
  elements for white and gray listing
- also add new logic for finding the white list items which will
  return a directory when the user has clicked the entire directory
- fix the logic in CopyFromContainerCommandHandler for reading
  the tar file to handle directory (make directories and read
  next entry, but read tar file for file entries)
- also switch to use org.apache.commons.compress for
  TarArchiveInputStream
- add check for container being stopped to ContainerCopyFrom wizard
