DESCRIPTION

changelog: Refresh repos; streamline Prep Commit.

When executing either Prepare Changelog or Prepare Commit, refresh the
repository being contacted for out-of-sync resources before contact is made.
Resolves EBZ #466632 and issues with Prepare Changelog.

Also change Prepare Commit so that it doesn't need the log file's editor to be
in focus in order to work properly.
