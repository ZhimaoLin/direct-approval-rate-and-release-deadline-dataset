I'm not sure I understand this patch. In the follow-up you change Map to List, so that ID has to become a int. Why do the IDs here become longs?

I am basically fixing comments on the header patch that was merged. Even if later we convert to ints, it is probably good to keep the information as "raw" as possible as long as possible. (No pun intended"

Line:112, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/EventHeaderCompactDeclaration.java -> it's fine to save it into a long here, but check the limits etc. before calling the constructor below.

Line:57, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/EventHeaderDefinition.java -> If IDs are meant to be int's across the board, then this should remain an int too.

Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/EventHeaderDefinition.java -> should remain int too
