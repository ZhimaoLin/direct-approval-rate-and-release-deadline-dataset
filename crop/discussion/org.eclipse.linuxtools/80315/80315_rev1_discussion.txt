Line:918, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/plugin.xml -> properties are exposed API and should not be removed on our minor release.  Leave the old property and add the new one.

Line:36, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/propertytesters/ConnectionPropertyTester.java -> Technically, you shouldn't remove this property since it is exposed publicly.  Just add the new one.

Line:53, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/propertytesters/ConnectionPropertyTester.java -> This only solves your immediate problem.  You should support other items such DockerContainersCategory, DockerContainers, DockerImages as you are exposing this property in the public plugin.xml.  It might be nice to have an Adaptor for all these classes that returns the DockerConnection, but I would be ok with a case statement.
