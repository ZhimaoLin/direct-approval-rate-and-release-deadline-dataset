DESCRIPTION

Oprofile view delete and save default session issue

we found two issue in oprofile view 
1.selecting "Delete session" from the View Menu to delete the current
session silently fails.
2.The "Save Default Session" option from the View Menu copies the
"current" session to the new session specified by the user, and the
OProfile view then has both the current and the new session (duplicates
of one another).
we fixed both problem. sending it for review
