DESCRIPTION

Systemtap: Attempt to stabilize UI tests; log4j.

Add log4j logging to TestCreateSystemtapScript to better identify
& diagnose SWTBot failures/errors. Also, in an attempt to prevent
test failures, increase the default SWTBot wait time and manually
re-apply focus to shells in critital (ie fail-prone) locations.
