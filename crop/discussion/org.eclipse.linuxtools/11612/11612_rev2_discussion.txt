Hi Roland, Camilo,

Ive modified the build operation to be performed by RDT for the remote testing, hence in theory it is possible to use any system user/pass, not only the one running the tests. Modified the search for the binary for the remote tests also. Not sure what is the maven dependency problem. Could you give more details? Thanks.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

Tests run successfully with eclipse by providing the user/pass of the user running the tests. I will try to run the tests with maven and different system user/pass soon. In the mean while, I provided a few comments.

Line:94, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/tests/AbstractRemoteTest.java -> Would it be possible to provide more comments to have a better idea what this method is doing/testing?

Line:232, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/tests/AbstractTest.java -> Specific exceptions should be caught here.

Line:234, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/tests/AbstractTest.java -> What was the purpose in reorganizing the  build job method calls?

Line:340, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/tests/AbstractTest.java -> This should be an abstract method.

Patch Set 2:

Tests run fine using user/pass from different users on the system. Also, like previously reported, I'm seeing the retrieval of the ptp remote service returning null when running the tests through maven. Maybe another reviewer can run the tests and report their results, it might just be my local build configuration.

Line:340, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/tests/AbstractTest.java -> If this is made abstract, it would force a lot of the classes implementing this class to provide some implementation for it (ie. in most cases returning null anyways if they don't wish to create a remote external project)

Line:340, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/profiling/tests/AbstractTest.java -> Yeah, makes sense. We don't want to implement a method returning null for all the non remote profiling tests that depend on this class.
