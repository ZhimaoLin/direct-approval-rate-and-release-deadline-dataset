Thanks for the update. Please rebase on top of master, there have been some recent changes to the perf tests that might cause some merge conflicts.

Patch Set 8: (1 inline comment)

This patchset is failing for me on the 2 remote tests. See my comment in the perf.tests manifest for details.

Line:6, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There are 2 Require-Bundle's here (I noticed patchset 8 varies slightly from patchset 7 + the changes proposed). Also org.eclipse.linuxtools.rdt.proxy is now missing, which explains why this patchset was failing for me.
