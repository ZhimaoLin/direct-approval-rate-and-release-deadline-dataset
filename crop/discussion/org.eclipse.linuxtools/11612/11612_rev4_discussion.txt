Patch Set 4:

Great! Tests runs fine with maven now. A few things I'd like to mention:

* Tests only pass by using the credentials of the user running the tests. Running with a different system user I see the following: http://www.fpaste.org/RgYe/
* A StorageException(http://www.fpaste.org/VOwP/) is thrown when running the tests. This doesn't affect the results, but it would be better to suppress the exception from being printed on the build log.
* It would be a good if the tests ran successfully without having to provide system users' credentials (e.g. mocking the remote connection), allowing us to include them in the hudson builds.
