Line:47, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Most of these packages are not needed as their respective plug-in is already added as a dependency.

Line:51, profiling/org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't see this patch making use of any swtbot functionality, is this needed?

Line:10, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There should only be one Require-Bundle definition.

Line:11, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Junit is already required in the original Require-Bundle definition.

Line:18, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> These bundles are already brought in by profiling.test, you can require that plug-in instead.

Line:65, perf/org.eclipse.linuxtools.perf.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/perf/tests/LaunchRemoteTest.java -> Could this method be moved to AbstractRemoteTest? This would be to avoid the ptp dependencies on perf.tests.

Patch Set 7:

I was able to get things working with the following patch : http://rgrunber.fedorapeople.org/11612-7.patch (applied against Patch Set 7). It reduces the dependencies listed in the manifest by quite a bit and runs as a maven build.
