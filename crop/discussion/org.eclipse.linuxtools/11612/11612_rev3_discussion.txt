Patch Set 3:

As pointed by Roland, the org.eclipse.ptp.remote.remotetools.core and .org.eclipse.ptp.remote.remotetools.ui plug-ins contribute to the remote tools extension point that these test is trying to find. It seems that these are not present, at least locally, when running the build/test with maven.

Patch Set 3:

It would be preferable for the tests to run successfully without needing credentials of a system user. The main reason is that these tests will be running in several remote and publicly available builds. These would mean having to change the credentials for the test on each server, and of course exposing system users' credentials.
