* Indentation support properly handles unformatted stp code.
* Indentation shorcut appears under the 'Keys' preference page to set key bindings.
* Modified auto indent test passes successfully locally.
--
* It appears that code commented out using multi-line comments is still being treated as uncommented code when applying indent correction, is this expected?
* The auto-edit strategy does not take multi-line comments into consideration.
* Imported code style should be corrected to avoid sonar warnings: trailing whitespace and if-else conditions without curly braces are what I saw the most.

Line:119, systemtap/org.eclipse.linuxtools.systemtap.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/systemtap/ui/ide/editors/stp/STPAutoEditStrategy.java -> should STPPartitionScanner.STP_MULTILINE_COMMENT be included in this condition check?
