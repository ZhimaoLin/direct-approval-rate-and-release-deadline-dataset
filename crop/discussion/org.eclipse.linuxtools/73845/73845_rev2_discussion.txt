DESCRIPTION

Bug 494521 - NPE when New Docker Connection dialog is open on Windows

Prevent returning connection settings when the DOCKER_HOST
environment variable was not found.

On environments where Docker Toolbox was installed, there
might not be any DOCKER_HOST, etc. env variables set, but there
is a 'DOCKER_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_PATH' env var, which means that
the exit code of the script is '0' and from there, the
'createDockerConnectionSettings' is called.
This method noew returns 'null' if the DOCKER_HOST property
is missing.
