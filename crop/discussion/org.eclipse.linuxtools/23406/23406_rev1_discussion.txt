Patch Set 1:

Let's let this build successfully a few times before merging it. The failure that happened in [1] was likely due to a 1sec wait (rather than 5sec) for the "Delete Resources" shell to open, which I lengthened in this patch. If that still doesn't fix things, I have alternative methods to more rigorously find shells that are being missed.
