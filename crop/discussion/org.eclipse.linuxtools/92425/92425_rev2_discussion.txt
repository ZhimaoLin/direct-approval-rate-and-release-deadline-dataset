I know that it is already merged but I think that several little things requires an improvement

Line:73, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/views/DockerImageHierarchyView.java -> this.getCommnViewer() is used the line before so if it is null, it would have already thrown a NPE the line before

Line:74, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/views/DockerImageHierarchyView.java -> isn't better to use a logger instead of sysout?

Line:75, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/jobs/RetrieveImageHierarchyJob.java -> the if can be collapsed with the previous else to make an else if

Line:80, containers/org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/internal/docker/ui/jobs/RetrieveImageHierarchyJob.java -> the case of selectedElement null is now completely ignored. Would be better to provide another log exception
