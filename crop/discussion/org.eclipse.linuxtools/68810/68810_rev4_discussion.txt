DESCRIPTION

core: fix RuntimeProcessFactory#whichCommand method

The whichCommand on local projects throws exception if the command
not exist whereas on remote projects it returns the command name.

Also:
 - added plug-in and tests for RuntimeProcessFactory#whichCommand method.
 - re-organized remote proxy test plug-ins
