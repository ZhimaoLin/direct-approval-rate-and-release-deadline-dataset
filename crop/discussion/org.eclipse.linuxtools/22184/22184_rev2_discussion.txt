Patch Set 2:

Hi Meredith Scott, 

I added the column provider, as it may be useful for some cases and it doesn't add any overhead. But except for the interfaces, the classes themselves are too statistics centric to be re-used here. 

The statistics is a special use case of the tree viewer and it can be made to use these new classes. I'll leave that to someone else though, maybe as an exercice for the new students to start with TMF views?

I took the column data and provider from the statistics framework. But for the abstract tree viewer and entries themselves, it is inspired from pretty much all other TMF views (time graph, xy charts, statistics)
