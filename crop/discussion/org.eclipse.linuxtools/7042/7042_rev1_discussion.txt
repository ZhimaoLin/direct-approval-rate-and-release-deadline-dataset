DESCRIPTION

Statistics: Creates tabs for each trace in the selected experiment.

When an experiment/trace is selected, the statistics view creates a global
viewer and a specific viewer for each trace contained in the experiment. These
viewers are placed in tabs and shown in the statistics view. Also, a factory is
now used to create a viewer based on his definition in the plug-in.xml from the
trace type. An extension point has been added to provide custom statistics
viewer.
