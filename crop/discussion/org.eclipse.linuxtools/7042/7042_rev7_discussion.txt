DESCRIPTION

tmf: Use tabs in statistics view for each traces

When an experiment/trace is selected, the statistics view creates a
global viewer and a specific viewer for each trace contained in the
experiment. These viewers are placed in tabs and shown in the
statistics view. Also, a factory is now used to create a viewer based
on his definition in the plug-in.xml from the trace type. An
extension point element has been added to the trace type extension
point to provide custom statistics viewer.

Patch Set 7: (1 inline comment)



Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> I'm using a temporary parent until the method createPartControl is called. I could also create a default constructor in TmfViewerFolder, and called, later on, setParent and create, in this method, the CTabFolder with the right parent. I think this would be cleaner actually. Tell me what you think!
