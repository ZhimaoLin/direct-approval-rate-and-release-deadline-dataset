I agree with Roland.  I did not like the initial setting myself.  I have uploaded a patch which defaults to true for the Containers view.  The preference is still saved so users like Max can filter out as they wish.

ok, I thought that the DockerContainersView used the same filter for the list but I should have double-checked that for the consistency of the patch. Thanks for fixing that part !
