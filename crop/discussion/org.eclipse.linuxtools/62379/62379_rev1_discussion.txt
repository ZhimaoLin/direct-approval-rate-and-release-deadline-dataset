This works for the Explorer View, but why not do the same for the Containers View ?

@Arianna Johns thoughts ? Do we expect users to consantly be clicking to "Show All Containers" to start ones that have stopped, or is it more likely that they'd always be creating newer containers (and likely removing old ones, --rm when they've stopped)

Patch Set 1:

This actually wouldn't be that bad since it seems the state is remembered on subsequent startups.. although it would be a case of the Explorer View and Containers View not matching on what's displayed by default.
