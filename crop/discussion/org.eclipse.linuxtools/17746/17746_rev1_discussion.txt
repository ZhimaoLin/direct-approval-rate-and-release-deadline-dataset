DESCRIPTION

[TMF] Make OK the default button when deleting trace

On Ubuntu and Mac OS X, the default button is Cancel istead of OK which is inconsistent
with the other delete dialogs. On Mac OS X, the icon is also wrong. Using MessageDialog
instead of MessageBox fixes this.

I'm not 100% against it, but let's resolve the discussion in the bug first.

We really should follow the eclipse standard. Ubuntu does not even give a prompt, and most traces are linked, so it's even safer than the OS's delete.

If you did some research instead of hammering +2's, you'd notice the Eclipse standard is voluntarily vague about this, and the platform standard (the Gnome HIG in the case of Linux, since SWT uses GTK) specifies to not use "destructive" actions as the default. See my reply in the bug.
