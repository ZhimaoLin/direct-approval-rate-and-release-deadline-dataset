Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Thinking about it some more, I don't think those columns should be extendable. We *want* people to use the default columns, because then those get merged together inside experiments.

If someone extends the Timestamp column to just change the title to "Time" for example, then in an experiment that would give 2 columns, one "Timestamp" and one "Time". I don't see it unreasonable to keep those final to preserve some uniformity.

Patch Set 1:

That's not going to prevent anyone from doing it if that is what they really want. It's just going to make it slightly more annoying for them to do so.

The easiest alternative is to directly call the desired base column implementation for each of the abstract methods of the new subclass. For example:

public @NonNull String xxx@xxx.xxx ITmfEvent event) {
    return TmfEventTableColumn.BaseColumns.REFERENCE.getItemString(event);
}
