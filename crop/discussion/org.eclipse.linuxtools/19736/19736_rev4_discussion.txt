Patch Set 4:

i think there may be a problem whenever hudson runs a Process (i.e., running "createrepo" command in Createrepo.java)

Trying to find out if that is the case and if there are other tests within linuxtools that runs a Process in a test.

Patch Set 4:

Nevermind, i don't think this is a problem as RPMProjectTest runs a process to evaluate the arch macro. I am currently rebuilding to see if a change in using SWTBot fixes it
