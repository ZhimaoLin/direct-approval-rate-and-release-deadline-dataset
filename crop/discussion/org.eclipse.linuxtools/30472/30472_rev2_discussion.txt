DESCRIPTION

pcap: use a larger trace for parser benchmarking

The previous trace contained only 640 events, so the parser finished parsing the whole file in a couple of microseconds. Thus, the variation of the results was a large percentage of the total CPU time, which is bad.

This new trace contains 100k events (and is totally anonymized), so the benchmark gives more precise results. This allows to really see the influence of future commits on the parsing speed.
