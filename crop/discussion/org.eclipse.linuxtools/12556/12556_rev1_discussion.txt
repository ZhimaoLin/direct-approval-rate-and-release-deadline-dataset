There is a change of behavior with this solution. When a part is activated that is not a trace editor (for example a Java editor), it did not previously mark the trace as unselected. With this path it does, so an unnecessary TmfTraceSelected signal could be broadcast. Receivers can however ignore it if the signal's trace is the same that they are currently handling.

Line:642, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> It should check that the part being deactivated is 'this'.
