Line:127, rpm/org.eclipse.linuxtools.rpm.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/rpm/core/utils/RPMQuery.java -> I don't think this would properly handle the case where the tree element selected in the active page doesn't correspond to the element that is about to be evaluated, or if no tree element is selected but the eval should be done remotely.

I think there needs to be a nicer way to determine whether the eval should be done locally or on a remote system.
