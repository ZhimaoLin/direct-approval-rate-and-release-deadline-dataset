This patch is becoming a pain to review... the formatting fixes + adding CTFReaderException in the API should be in a separate initial patch, so we can then concentrate on the algorithm changes in BitBuffer.

Line:208, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketReader.java -> Add description (cause) to the exception

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/tests/io/BitBufferIntTest.java -> Making the parameters final is not needed, we already have errors if you try to modify them (is it also enabled in test plugins? I'm not sure, if not it should be). It makes the code heavier for nothing.

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> why did you remove Etienne's email? It's better if there is one technically.

Line:129, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIterator.java -> Be a bit more descriptive "True if seek was successful, false if there was an error".
