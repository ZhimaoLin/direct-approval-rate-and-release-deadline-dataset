After looking at the next patch-set you want to submit.
getLong() is not the right API you need.
You need to be able to read from 33 to 64 bits values.

+ fix the invalid merge.

Line:12, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> ???? This is a bad merge.

Line:115, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> like getInt, you will need a version

public long getLong(int length, boolean signed)
