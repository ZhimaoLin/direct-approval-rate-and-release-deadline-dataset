Line:400, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> Take note for an other CL, I think this test should be move up if CTF accept writing a 0-bits struct (or int). I know, it's stupid.
Keep it as a separate commit.

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIterator.java -> Better comment is always appreciate.
It seems obvious to the writer, but for a third-party reader like me, those comment are helpful to me.

Line:129, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/tmf/core/ctfadaptor/CtfIterator.java xxx@xxx.xxx boolean true on success, false otherwise.
