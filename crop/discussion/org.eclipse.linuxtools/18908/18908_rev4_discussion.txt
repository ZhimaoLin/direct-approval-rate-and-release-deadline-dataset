more nits

Line:114, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> You don't need this TODO.
GetInt already take care of that.
It will read the int aligned.
Which is fast enough.

Line:145, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> remove useless blank line

another nit.

Line:161, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> this line should go back to where is was.
With the gotIt declaration.
No reason to keep it here.

Patch Set 4: Verified-1

I cancelled the builds manually, FunkyTrace unit test was still hanging.

Please rebase this on latest lttng-luna, it has the patch to timeout instead.
