There is still an issue with reading a int of zero bit.

Line:150, lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/linuxtools/ctf/core/event/io/BitBuffer.java -> This wasn't already fixed by one of my patch-set?
Not sure you integrated it.

Anyway, the lengh == 0 should probably before can_read.
It is valid to read a struct of zero bits at the end of a stream.
More unittests to come on CTF.
