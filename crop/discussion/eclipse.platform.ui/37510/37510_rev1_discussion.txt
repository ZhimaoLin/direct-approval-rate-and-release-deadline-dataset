DESCRIPTION

Bug 432480: Show workspace location in pref page and window title

- Show the true workspace location in the Workspace preference page.
- Add an option to show the workspace location in the window title.
  Support the -showlocation command line switch such that UI toggle is
  disabled if it is specified, and show the specified location from the
  command line in addition, if this one differs from the workspace 
  location.  This is why we call the UI text "Show location" instead of
  "Show workspace location".
