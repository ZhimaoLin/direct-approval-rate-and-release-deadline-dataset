DESCRIPTION

Bug 432480: Show workspace location in pref page and window title

Show the true workspace location in the Workspace preference page.

Add an option to show the workspace location in the window title.
Support the existing -showlocation command line switch such that it
overrides the preference.  For simplicitly reasons the UI does not show
that -showlocation is set.

Looks way better (I still need to test the change). Please find minor correction suggestions in the code.

Line:800, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEWorkLeon OchoachAdvisor.java -> Do we still return null? We should also describe the priority of the logic: If user has specified the -showLocation command line argument this overrides the preference setting.

Line:251, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> I dislike that we call the parameter twice SHOW_LOCATION once here and once in the preferences Maybe FORCED_SHOW_LOCATION would be a better semantic?

Line:800, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEWorkLeon OchoachAdvisor.java -> Done. Will describe the logic in the next patchset.

Yes, null must be returned if no location is to be shown.

Line:251, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> Done.  But anyways we need a separate constant for the real command line argument.
