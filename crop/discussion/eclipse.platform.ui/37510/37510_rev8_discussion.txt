DESCRIPTION

Bug 432480: Show workspace location in pref page and window title

Show the true workspace location in the Workspace preference page.

Add an option to show the workspace location in the window title.
Support the existing -showlocation command line switch such that it
overrides the preference.  For simplicitly reasons the UI does not show
that -showlocation is set.
