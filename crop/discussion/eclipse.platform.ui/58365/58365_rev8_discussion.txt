We can't change the API page like this. We can e.g. add a new constructor where clients can tell to use the filtered tree.

@Dani: this feature IMO has a high-value for end-users. I would love to see it in 4.7. So I'll advocate for it.

I have trouble to understand what parts exactly breaks API? Is this only the JavaDoc comment replacing tree by filtered tree? As a filtered tree is a tree, we can probably adopt this change and leave the javadoc intact.

Line:16, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/contentoutline/ContentOutlinePage.java -> Why not a regular org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.FilteredTree ?
