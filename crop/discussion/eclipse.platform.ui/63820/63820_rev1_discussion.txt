The IDE class should not know about the possible strategies. Consuming the AskUserViaPopulUnknownEditorStrategy in IDE class seems a bad dependency.
Strategies can be contributed via extensions, we cannot rely on workaround for this or that strategy in IDE.

Interesting approach, but I think this schould be more generic - what about a new method in the strategy interface which will return IStatus?

Or may be better to allow getEditorDescriptor()  to throw Exception, and in our case this could be OperationCancelledException? Have no IDE right now, so just guessing.
