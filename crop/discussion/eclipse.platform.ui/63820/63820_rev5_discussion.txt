DESCRIPTION

Bug 485201 - Cancel button in "Ask via popup" strategy opens the select

Document that the IUnknownEditorStrategy can throw
OperationCanceledException or CoreException while performing an editor
descriptor lookup.

Throw OperationCanceledException if user cancels the editor selection
dialog in AskUserViaPopupUnknownEditorStrategy and ignore this exception
in the caller to avoid superfluous error popup.

Patch Set 5:

Mickael: I think showing "Cancel" is OK, since otherwise user MUST wait for opening a mistakenly double clicked 10 GB dump file :-)

Patrik, I've changed the code in the way that it does NOT show the silly error message if user cancels the selection. User just clicked on "Cancel", why do we need to show him scary looking error dialog?

All: I've updated interface to document that the implementers can throw either Core or OperationCancelled exceptions.
