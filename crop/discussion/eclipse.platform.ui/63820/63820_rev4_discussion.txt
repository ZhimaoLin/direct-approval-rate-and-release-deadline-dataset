DESCRIPTION

Bug 485201 - Cancel button in "Ask via popup" strategy opens the select

Document that the IUnknownEditorStrategy can throw
OperationCanceledException or CoreException while performing an editor
descriptor lookup.

Throw OperationCanceledException if user cancels the editor selection
dialog in AskUserViaPopupUnknownEditorStrategy and ignore this exception
in the caller to avoid superfluous error popup.
