Could you please point me to the changes that are fixing the bug. They are currently drowned in generification changes. Even better yet, it would be to create two separate patches, one for generification and another one for fixing the bug.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/SelectionListenerAction.java -> 20015 -> 2015

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/SelectionListenerAction.java -> Fits into previous line.

Sergey, please check the first review https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675/

This one is just code cleanup.

Patch Set 4:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/41675 does not look like a code clean up only

Patch Set 4:

The first review https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675/ is the actual fix.

This second review (https://git.eclipse.org/r/41796/) is just code cleanup.

Patch Set 4:

Would it be possible to do the code clean up before the fix? Makes the fix easier to review IMHO

Patch Set 4:

Sometimes the fix includes code which is needed for cleanup. Sometimes one just fixes the code and applying the cleanup later is easier then reverting the patch, applying the fix and merging with the patch. 

While CPD fixes it was clear where the fix must be done, so I did cleanup upfront. Here the fix "just happened" - I was just looking if the initial assumption works, wrote a prototype and it was the fix already.

In the future I will try to run cleanup first, if possible.
