DESCRIPTION

Bug 511198 - Save Resource should use "Save" / "Don't save" instead of 

.. Yes / No

Now the save resources dialog is clearer as it asks "Save" / "Don't
save" instead of "Yes" / "No" (see #1)
Also the SaveableList$MyListSelectionDialog displays "Save" / "Don't
save" instead of "Yes" / "No" (see #2)
Furthermore, tests are modified.
