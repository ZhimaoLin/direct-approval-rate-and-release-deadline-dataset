I took a very quick look and here are some comments.

We have an implementation of much of this in org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt.cocoa, written at the E4 level.  It would be better to pull those out rather than implement them at the E3.x layer.

I like the notifying that they've entered full-screen mode: it can be puzzling if the user accidentally triggered full-screen mode.  I haven't tried the use of the PopupDialog; I wondered if MessageDialogWithToggle might be better as having the dialog popup up repeatedly could be annoying.  Although I like the encouragement to use the Quick Access to get out, the fullscreen should be a toggle, so the user should be able to re-do their last action to get out of the full-screen mode.

Line:414, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> The keybinding should be filled in at runtime.  It's Cmd-3 on OS X, plus it can be re-bound to another key by the user.

It is a toggle, but (at least under Linux) toggling full screen hides the menu so we need to tell the user how to leave it. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=491572 will hopefully find a good shortcut for that for now we need to use Quick Access.

Done

I think moving that the to e4 layer is something we should postphone to 4.7, for 4.6 M7 I would prefer not adding additional complexity by starting a migration towards e4 command handling.
