Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Brian, MessageDialogWithToggle didn't looks really good in our opinion. Once we have a real shortcut for the Toggle Full Screen functionality, we should also add the option to hide the popup for the user.With "only" Quick Access as "shortcut" we think we should not yet persists the user choice to hide the popup.
