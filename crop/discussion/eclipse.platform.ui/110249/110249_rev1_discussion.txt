Minor improvements.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesImportWizard.java -> Alex recently taught me that, as opposed to what I told you earlier, a comma is expected as a separator and not a dash.
Can you please change it? (and sorry for misleading you earlier)

Line:100, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesImportWizard.java -> It would be better to use the display to make sure the pop-up doesn't move too far away.

Line:102, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesImportWizard.java -> This would better be a MessageDialog.CONFIRM.

Line:103, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesImportWizard.java -> It would be better to use parent shell from mainPage to make sure the pop-up doesn't move too far away.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/messages.properties -> Let's be more precise: "Preferences Import"

Line:37, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/messages.properties -> You cannot say Eclipse SDK here because it can be any RCP. For the the message, you can include the product name (Platform.getProduct().getName()).

Also, I'm not sure the message is accurate enough: preferences are already applied at that point, it's just that the workspace may be in an inconsistent state.
I suggest a message such as "Importing preferences might leave workLeon Ochoach in an inconsistent state. It's recommended to restart."

Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/messages.properties -> You cannot say Eclipse here because it can be any RCP. For the button, just "Restart" would be enough.
