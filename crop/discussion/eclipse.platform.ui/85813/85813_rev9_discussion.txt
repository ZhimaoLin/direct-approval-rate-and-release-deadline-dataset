Hey Ian, sorry I missed a point in previous reviews. Can you please just remove the deprecated flag as it's internal?
Sorry again for asking that after asking for the annotation...

Line:919, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchMessages.java -> Actually, I didn't realize this class is internal, so can you please try simply removing this label (from both the class and messages.properties)
