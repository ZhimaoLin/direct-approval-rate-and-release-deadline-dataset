DESCRIPTION

Bug 266030 - Simplify usage of "other projects" working set

The "Other projects" working set is now always present whenever
top-level elements are working sets, without need for user to select its
enablement.
So now, working sets are used for filtering when top-level elements are
projects, and for grouping when top-level elements are working sets.

This makes the Others working set appear (good), but in the 'Select Working Set...' dialog, the Others working set is not available.
