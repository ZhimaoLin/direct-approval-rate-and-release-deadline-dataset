Ok, Dark Theme modified directly. 
Also used COLOR-TRANSPARENT instead of transparent - but currently does not work (will result in solid black background - see Bug 459961 for details)

Main issue here is the re-write of the contribution copyright. We should not change the original contributor of a development

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark.css -> We should not change the original contributor of a development.

Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark.css -> If you want to change the original text, I suggest
"initial contribution and implemnetation", I assume you dislike the "API" part of the comment?

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_mac.css -> We should not change the original contributor of a development.

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_mac.css -> If you want to change the original text, I suggest "initial contribution and implemnetation", I assume you dislike the "API" part of the comment?

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_win.css -> We should not change the original contributor of a development.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> Update also the year

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> We do not change the original contributor.

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> If you want to change the original text, I suggest "initial contribution and implemnetation", I assume you dislike the "API" part of the comment?

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> We prefer to use the bug number instead of a description

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> The default platform themes should  not set mru-visible to true. This was the result of a long discussion in the past.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please update description

sorry - the header changes were unintentional.
Changeset 3 coming up ...

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> Sorry, didn't intend to rewrite the headers.
I had created new files in Changeset 1 and copied them over the existing files for Changeset 2 and just forgot to notice the header changes. 
Restored original headers now (but updated the year to 2015)

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> Don't know where that came from. Must still have existed in some part I copied ... Is now removed.
