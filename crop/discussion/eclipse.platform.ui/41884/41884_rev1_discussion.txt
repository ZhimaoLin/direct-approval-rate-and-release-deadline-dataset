Patch Set 1:

This is my first step towards a more simplified dark theme.
It still has issues (especially with forms) and maybe the ".MPart"-Rules could be removed as well, but at least it is a first step.

I have created a copy of the dark theme for now. Maybe, if it is a bit more mature but not finished, we could include it in Mars as an optional alternative...

(BTW: this needs the 'transparent' patch to work, but not the 'initial' one, I didn't remove the erroneous dependency before pushing, sorry :-()

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I suggest to modify the existing dark theme, instead of making a copy. We are still in the development mode and thus are allowed to make errors (we still have cycles to fix them)
