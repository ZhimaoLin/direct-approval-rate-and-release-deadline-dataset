Line:93, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/MoveFilesAndFoldersOperation.java -> Good name! :-)

Line:116, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.views.properties.tabbed.hockeyleague/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/views/properties/tabbed/hockeyleague/ui/wizards/NewHockeyleagueProjectWizard.java -> use 2, 2000 was a workaround AFAIK

Line:125, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.views.properties.tabbed.hockeyleague/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/views/properties/tabbed/hockeyleague/ui/wizards/NewHockeyleagueProjectWizard.java -> Use 1

Line:128, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.views.properties.tabbed.hockeyleague/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/views/properties/tabbed/hockeyleague/ui/wizards/NewHockeyleagueProjectWizard.java -> Use 1

Line:303, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardNewFileCreationPage.java -> We should have one name for situation like that. iterationMonitor feel good, but loopMonitor is also fine but it should be consistent.

Line:116, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.views.properties.tabbed.hockeyleague/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/views/properties/tabbed/hockeyleague/ui/wizards/NewHockeyleagueProjectWizard.java -> Good point. FYI, it's a workaround for a problem in the root monitor, which doesn't report good progress if the first call to beginTask uses a small number of ticks. I believe SubProgressMonitor has (or used to have) the same problem.

SubMonitor works around this internally by always using 1000 as the argument to beginTask on whatever monitor it converts.

Line:125, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.views.properties.tabbed.hockeyleague/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/views/properties/tabbed/hockeyleague/ui/wizards/NewHockeyleagueProjectWizard.java -> Done

Line:128, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.views.properties.tabbed.hockeyleague/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/views/properties/tabbed/hockeyleague/ui/wizards/NewHockeyleagueProjectWizard.java -> Done

Line:303, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardNewFileCreationPage.java -> I generally use "iterationMonitor" when it monitors a single iteration of a loop and "loopMonitor" when it monitors the entire loop, as in this case.
