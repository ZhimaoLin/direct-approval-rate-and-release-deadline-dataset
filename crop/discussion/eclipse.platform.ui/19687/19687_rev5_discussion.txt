DESCRIPTION

Bug 423882 - Warn if workspace is newer than IDE

Refine the workspace version check and show up 
* a warning if workspace > IDE
* an info if workspace < IDE.

Compare against only major and minor version of the IDE, so that
for a change of just the patch segment no info is shown.

Compatibility note: the former check implementation can only handle
simple numbers as versions.  It would fail if it read the new version
string.  Fix is to use a different version key (reference bundle).
"org.eclipse.core.resources" is chosen since it
org.eclipse.ui.ide.application anyways depends on it.

Patch Set 5: Verified-1 Code-Review-2

I didn't do a full code review yet, but I can see the following issues:

- Starting any existing workspace will cause a dialog to be
  shown the first time. This is too intrusive. We should 
  not do this when going from "1" to the "real" version.

- Using a concrete bundle to get the version is doomed to 
  fail, since there's no guarantee that its version will
  change in the next (service) release. You should use the
  version of the platform feature or at least its branding
  plug-in.

- The change should also improve the situation when going
  back (to e.g. 4.3). This could be done by also writing
  the legacy property as:
  org.eclipse.core.runtime=2
