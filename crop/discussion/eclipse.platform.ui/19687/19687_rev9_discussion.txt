DESCRIPTION

Bug 423882 - Warn user if workspace is newer than IDE

Refine the workspace version check and show up 
* a warning if workspace > IDE
* an info if workspace < IDE.

Compare against only major and minor version of the IDE, so that
for a change of just the patch segment no info is shown. As a reference
bundle use org.eclipse.platform since its feature is most likely to
change when the "IDE" changes.  Don't want to check against the feature
itself as that might not be installed at all.

Compatibility notes:
- If coming from legacy workspaces, we don't complain since that might
  be too intrusive.
- We also write an incremented legacy version, so that when going
  back from an updated workspace to a legacy workspace the old IDE would
  complain as well.

Sorry for the delay Christian. I like the patch. There are just a few minor tweaks:
- We use American English, hence: "behavior"
- may -> can
- needs to be updated -> will be updated
- I know it already does so in 'master', but please don't use "Press ..." - I could also click, or tab + enter. Try to express it as a normal question.
- You always use 'WORKSPACE_VERSION_LEGACY + 1', which means
  this could be captured by one single constant.
- Platform.getBundle(WORKSPACE_VERSION_REFERENCE_BUNDLE).getVersion() should only be computed once.
- Copyright date needs to be updated to 2014 in all files
- You should add your credentials to the copyright notice, e.g.
