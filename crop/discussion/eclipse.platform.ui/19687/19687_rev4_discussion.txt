DESCRIPTION

Bug 423882 - Warn if workspace is newer than IDE

Refine the workspace version check and show up 
* a warning if workspace > IDE
* an info if workspace < IDE.

Compare against only major and minor version of the IDE, so that
for a change of just the patch segment no info is shown.

Compatibility note: the former check implementation can only handle
simple numbers as versions.  It would fail if it read the new version
string.  Fix is to use a different version key (reference bundle).
"org.eclipse.core.resources" is chosen since it
org.eclipse.ui.ide.application anyways depends on it.
