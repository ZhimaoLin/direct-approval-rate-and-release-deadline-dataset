Patch Set 5: Verified-1

The patch does not seem to work. I installed the example plug-in and the patch and tried File > New > Other...  and got an empty General and an empty General > Folder category being shown.

Comments on the change:
- I would not add WizardCollectionElementFilter but simply
  add the static helper method to WizardCollectionElement
- new Javadoc is not complete
xxx@xxx.xxx tag is wrong
- make sure to keep #select and #filter in sync (didn't
  verify that)

I'm probably using wrong steps again. Please post the exact steps into the bug report that show the wrong and the correct (after applying the patch) behavior.

I thought that it has been already adjusted to the comments above (filters are order independent, api is not changed). Could you please provide more details about what has to be changed in the current version of the patch to make it valid?

thanks,
Daniel
