Patch Set 3:

It looks strange to me, that the filter order makes any difference, i.e. it should not.

Patch Set 3:

The issue is caused by improper filtering the WizardCollectionElement.wizards list. To fix it the list has to be narrowed during filtering. 
I was able to fix it by modifying the WizardActivityFilter class and changing the filtering order (I always try to fix issues with the smallest portion of changes). 

So let me try to fix the WizardPatternFilter as well, to make the code filtering order independent.

Patch Set 3:

Something looks fishy if the order of the filter really matters.
