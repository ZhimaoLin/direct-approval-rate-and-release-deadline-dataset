Patch Set 8:

Hi Daniel. Sorry it took me so long - very busy days! The fix looks good. I have two minor changes which I will apply once the fix is submitted:
- the static helper does not need to be public
- I'll remove xxx@xxx.xxx on the constructor as we've not added it on other warnings in the same file so far.
