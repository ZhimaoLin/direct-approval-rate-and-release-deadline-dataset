Patch Set 6: Verified+1

Looking at it again in more detail, I don't like to add a clone() method and #filter can be made much simpler/readable by:
- create an empty adaptable list (modifiedList)
- add the matching elements to modifiedList (in the loop)
- when the modifiedList is empty return 'null'
- when it has the same size as the input return the input
- otherwise return: new Wizard(input, modifiedList);
- add the new private constructor

With these changes we should be good to go.
