DESCRIPTION

Bug 513901 - Starting Eclipse runs into a lot of "Illegal Thread Access"
SWTExceptions

Added a new SHOW_PROBLEMS_VIEW_DECORATIONS_ON_STARTUP preference,
disabled by default. Changed IDEWorkLeon OchoachPlugin to use that preference
and do not initialize hidden problems view if preference is "false".

Additionally fixed the init code to not access Display.getDefault() in
non-UI thread to avoid SWTExceptions.

Looks good to me. Still surprised to see such eager activation code in our code base.

This does not fix the problem once the preference is enabled again.

It should be covered by a separate enhancement request.

I was able to reproduce the issue and test with this change (I'll document details in the bug). 
I can confirm that the patch solves the issue for me both with activated and deactivated Show Problems View Decoration setting.

Sorry, I thought this only adds the new preference.

Looks good after review.
