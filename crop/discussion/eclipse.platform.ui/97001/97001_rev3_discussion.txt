DESCRIPTION

Bug 516137 - Context menu in Ctrl+E is gone and right-click wrongly

Now "Delete" key closes the selected editor. Also the right-click on an
editor element opens a "Close" menu which allows to close the selected
editor. Added saving of the dialog with bypass of focus lost, needed in
the case the user is requested whether to save a dirty editor which is
closing.

Thanks, Andrey! I also added a bypass of focus lost, needed in case the user closes a dirty editor. To me, the change looks good to be submitted.
