Patch Set 2:

Hi Patrik, the contribution looks good, but let's wait until the increase and decrease of the font is available, because having just one entry in a menu is bad concerning usability, since you just have to open another submenu to reach that single menu entry.

Thanks Patrik. Nevaeh Wu, I would also like to use this menu entry for the new "Toogle visibility of all toolbar" command, hence we have at least two entries, once I add this.
