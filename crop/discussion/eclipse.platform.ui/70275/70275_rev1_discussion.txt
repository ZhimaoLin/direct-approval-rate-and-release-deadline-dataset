Start new Eclipse workLeon Ochoach with the Clean flag in your launch configuraton to have a "fresh" Eclipse
Ctrl+3 -> I see the message

This was a design choice, not obvious because when you click, you filter the list with an empty filter. So, the full underlying list has 800+ results, that you can see pressing CTRL+3 (=switching mode).
However, given your comment, I realize the idea is to return an empty list of results, when the filter is empty. 
If you're ok with this I'll go with this new implementation.
