Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/ProgressMonitorPart.java -> Since the inner code is checking isDisposed(), you also need to check that, since you get a null display eventually.

Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/ProgressMonitorPart.java -> Not sure if you are correct here. The Throttler instance is created in initialize(), and I think the Label's display can't be null here. Throttler#throttledExec() checks that the display isn't disposed. So I guess this is already checked properly.
