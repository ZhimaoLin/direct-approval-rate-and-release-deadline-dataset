Patch Set 2:

I'm not sure if I or you are confusing something here. To me it looks like this is the ProgressMonitorPart _without_ any throttler. This change is not based on your other change introducing the throttler (I only find an abandoned version of that change). Am I missing something?

Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/ProgressMonitorPart.java -> Don't we send too many execs here? Ie if we invoke updateLabel twice with text being the same value, shouldn't we skip this event fully?
Can we place the asyncExec around the setText and update() only (which I believe are the expensive operations)?

Abandoned

Sorry for the noise. From the discussion in Bug#520720 I created another patch which uses the Throttler class.
This one gets replaced by https://git.eclipse.org/r/102809 and https://git.eclipse.org/r/102810. First Throttler has to be moved and then it could be used by ProgressMonitorPart.
