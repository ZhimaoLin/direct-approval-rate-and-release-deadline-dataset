Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

I would avoid creating API, see detailed comment

Line:35, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/views/IViewRegistry.java -> I would put that into ViewRegistery to avoid creating new API.org.eclipse.ui.ide.application is already listed as x-friends of org.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.

API is almost impossible to remove.
