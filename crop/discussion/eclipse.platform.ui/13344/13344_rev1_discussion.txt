DESCRIPTION

Bug 396418 - Command org.eclipse.ui.file.save always disabled

Update Save and SaveAll handlers to use the current workLeon Ochoach saveable
story.

Replace ActionFactory actions with WorkLeon OchoachCommandActions

Fix EvalutionService so requestEvalution(*) takes into account variables
as well as properties.
