DESCRIPTION

Bug 366608 - [KeyBindings] [Compatibility] Failures in KeysTestSuite

Close VerifyDialog instances left open after the UIWizardsAuto and
DeprecatedUIWizardsAuto tests. Those opened dialogs affected somehow key
binding tests below.

BindingPersistenceTest.testAboutBinding - OK now
BindingPersistenceTest.testAboutBindingIn3x - OK now
BindingPersistenceTest.testAboutBindingEmacs - still failing

If one excludes either org.eclipse.ui.tests.dialogs.UIWizardsAuto or
org.eclipse.ui.tests.dialogs.DeprecatedUIWizardsAuto or both (included
in the UIAutomatedSuite) all tests pass. So there is still something in
those wizard tests which makes BindingPersistenceTest unhappy.
