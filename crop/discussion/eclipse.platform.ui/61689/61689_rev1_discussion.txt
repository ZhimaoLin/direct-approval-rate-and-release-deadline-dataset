Line:2734, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> First time I saw this code, without to check what the method is doing, I've understood it like : "for each area install D&D support". 

However, the installAreaDropSupport() has a guard to be installed only once *per page*.

Please add break; after that method OR change the "for" loop to something like snippet below

if(!elements.isEmpty()) {
Object widget = elements.iterator.next();
...
}
