My general issues with the patch, in this state:

- We're using Binding<?, ?> all over the place, which isn't useful and suggests we did a bad job generifying it. Can we think of something better?

- I seem to recall I hadn't completely removed all the refactoring and new APIs. We need to comb through this to see if there's anything left.

- We shouldn't commit this without lots of concrete examples, to prove that the generification is useful. We only get once chance to get this right, so let's take our time and test it properly.

- I seem to recall that there were some classes that weren't generified that really should have  been.

Line:156, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/DataBindingContext.java -> Can we find more specific generic parameters than just <?, ?>

-------------------------------------
