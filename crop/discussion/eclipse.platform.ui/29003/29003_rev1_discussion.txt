DESCRIPTION

Workaround bug 436645: [CommonNavigator] NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.EvaluationCache#getDescriptors does not work

Disable NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.EvaluationCache as it does not
work and will only waste memory.

Proper fix for cache usage will be in 4.5.

DO NOT MERGE
Will be superseded by the proper fix in "newer" branches.
