I tried this patch very quickly and didn't see my "Problems" view now featuring any button (so no Filters one). Did I miss something?

Works for me, 'Filters' appears as a button.
Maybe your child eclipse didn't have the correct projects open? (org.eclipse.ui.ide) or some dependency on SWT was not set? 
Try to make sure your workspace is problem free when launching a child eclipse.

Works for me too after another tentative. Leo was probably right about my workspace being messy.
