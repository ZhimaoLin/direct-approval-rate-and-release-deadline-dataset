DESCRIPTION

Bug 417258 - trying to make IAggregateWorkingSetTest stable

org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IAggregateWorkingSetTest.testWorkingSetSaveRestoreAggregates
seem to have timing (real multi-threading) issues - the code it tests
triggers some jobs and they are running in parallel to the test. I
cannot make it fail locally, but looking at the code in
AggregateWorkingSet, the "components" field seem to be r/w accessed from
multiple methods without any locks - and if some of the methods are
called from different threads, the failure is guaranteed. I do not see
however why the code should be accessed from any non UI threads... 

The patch adds toString() methods to working set implementations and
also modifies the test to see how "bad" the damaged working set looks
like.
