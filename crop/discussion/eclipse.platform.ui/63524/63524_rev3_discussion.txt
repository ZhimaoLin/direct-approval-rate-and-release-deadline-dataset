DESCRIPTION

Bug 417258 - trying to make IAggregateWorkingSetTest stable

org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IAggregateWorkingSetTest.testWorkingSetSaveRestoreAggregates
fails sporadically because of bug 479217.

I think some code in other module acts as listener on working set
manager and manages to call AggregateWorkingSet.restoreWorkingSet() on a
working set *before* the child working set is added to the working set
manager (also in the middle of
AbstractWorkingSetManager.restoreWorkingSetState()). Unfortunately
restoreWorkingSet() can be called from many places, so I was not able to
find the "bad" caller.

This not only a test issue, but a real bug in AbstractWorkingSetManager.
To fix this, AbstractWorkingSetManager.restoreWorkingSetState() must be
significantly changed (it must construct and restore all aggregated
working sets *without* sending events before each working set is
restored).

The patch "mutes" the instable "testWorkingSetSaveRestoreAggregates"
test and adds a stable "testWorkingSetSaveNeverRestoresAggregate" which
demonstrates bug 479217.

The patch also adds toString() methods to working set implementations
and modifies the original test to see how "bad" the damaged working set
looks like.
