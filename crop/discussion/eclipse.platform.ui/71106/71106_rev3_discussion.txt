Thanks for taking another stab at this.  A few things:
- viewMenuImage is a field on the StackRenderer instance, so dispose of the image in xxx@xxx.xxx â€” that will dispose of the image when the renderer itself is destroyed. With a disposeExec(), the image will only be disposed of when the SWT system is taken down (usually when the JVM exits), so still effectively a leak.
- you need to check that viewMenuImage != null and that it hasn't already been disposed
- resources like images should be disposed off the SWT thread
