This looks like a nice contribution! Rather than obtain the IContextService directly, could you please modify KeyController#init() to initialize the ConflictModel with the ContextModel, much as it's doing with the BindingModel?

Line:289, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/keys/model/ConflictModel.java -> We want to avoid using PlatformUI.getWorkbench() at (almost) all costs.  We should instead use the ContextModel, just in case we're making multiple modifications.
