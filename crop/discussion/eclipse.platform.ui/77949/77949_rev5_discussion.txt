@Oleksandr: Please have a look at the failed tests. We cannot merge any change that introduce test regressions. However, those test may suffer from bug 498540, in which case you can update them to behave and test better.

Patch Set 5:

> Since there is space left under the details section, it would also seem a good idea to add a 'Overrides' section too.

Looking at it again, it would make more sense to merge overrides/overridden-by into the conflicts view: saves space and the refresh logic is already implemented.
