Line:34, tests/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application.tests/pom.xml -> I think instead you should add ${tycho.testArgLine}. Leaving Xmx by default is not very good on some machines. It's 1/4 of physical memory I think? On a large server, it can mean a lot.

Line:34, tests/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application.tests/pom.xml -> I'm not a committer on platform.releng, but I could for sure propose a patch. However, maybe it's better if you do it as the idea is originating from you. The more people we have patching parent pom, the better it is.

Line:34, tests/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application.tests/pom.xml -> Maybe I'll make a patch. I'm a bit weary of setting the heap (too low?) for *all* platform tests though. So I think you should go ahead with this patch, the risk is low.
