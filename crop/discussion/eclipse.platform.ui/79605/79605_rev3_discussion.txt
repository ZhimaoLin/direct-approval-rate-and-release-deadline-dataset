Sorry for delay, I've lost this one.

Some really small corrections, and one surprising (related to the authorship).

Line:2, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/markers/MarkerViewUtilTest.java -> IBM?

Line:9, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/markers/MarkerViewUtilTest.java -> Are you really IBM employee?

Line:11, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/markers/MarkerViewUtilTest.java -> the empty line is not needed

Line:60, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/markers/MarkerViewUtilTest.java -> super.tearDown should be executed after, not before this test code

Line:67, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/UiTestSuite.java -> This is a no-op change on unrelated file.
