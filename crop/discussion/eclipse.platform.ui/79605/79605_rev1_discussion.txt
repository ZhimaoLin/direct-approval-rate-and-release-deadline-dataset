Please add some trivial tests to org.eclipse.ui.tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.markers package which would check all the boundary conditions of the new API (null array, empty array, mixed content array etc).

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> following markers do not belong to this view, they would not be shown

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> Please add check if the markers is null or empty or first marker is null and return in this case.

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> the "marker" variable is not really needed now => remove it.

Line:149, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> please add if(marker != null &&
