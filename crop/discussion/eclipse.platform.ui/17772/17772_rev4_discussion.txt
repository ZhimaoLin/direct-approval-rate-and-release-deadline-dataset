Hi René, it doesn't look like you've updated the add requires method to deal with re-exported packages, similar to http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.framework.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.osgi/container/src/org/eclipse/osgi/internal/framework/legacy/PackageAdminImpl.java?id=I20131023-2000#n415

Hi Paul,

that's right. I just added the generic definition to the Activator, because on the Re-Export stuff I have to rethink/recheck my implementation and also do some additional tests.

The original topoSort used the PackageAdmin#getRequiredBundles(String) to resolve all bundles with the given name. On the returned array of RequiredBundle it called the #getRequiringBundles() method to resolve all the Bundles which require this RequiredBundle. This information was than used to fill maps which reflect the other way. So for example the “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt” is required by the bundles “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench” and “org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests”. The call PackageAdmin#getRequiredBundles(“org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt”). getRequiringBundles() returned a list of bundles which require the “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt” and this list includes “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench” and “org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests”. This information was than used to fill 2 maps with the information “ org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench” requires “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt” and “org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests” requires “ org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt”.

My solution those this in the other way round and asks directly what are the required (and imported)  bundles of “org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests” and “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach” which in both cases returns the “org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt”. So you think I'm missing some entries because of leaving out the “re-export” check of the bundles, right?

Right.  The old way getRequiredBundles() took care of re-export for us, AFAIK.
