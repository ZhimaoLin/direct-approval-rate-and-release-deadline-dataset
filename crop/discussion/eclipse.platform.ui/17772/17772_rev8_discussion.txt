I tried to remove only the whitespace characters but a save added them again ;-( . I tried to find the formatter setting but I wasn't able to find it and so I removed the entire "blank" line. I hope that's OK too.

If you use Luna M6 the whitespace should not be added anymore.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review+1

Looks good to me.  The code had the same functionality as before.  The only thing that I will point out is that the patched and existing code does not take import package into account, only require bundle.  I do not imagine this patch should be changing that behavior, but I do find it strange.
