Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

I'd favor an implementation who allows me to decide if I want to remove the background selection or not

Two possible solutions:

Solution 1:
-----------
* check if the viewer is SWT.MULTI and only keep the selection background in that case

Solution 2:
-----------
* introduce a field removeSelectionBackground
* add a 2nd constructor FocusCellOwnerDrawHighlighter(viewer,removeSelectionBackground)
* make the original constructor call the new constructor with true
* use removeSelectionBackground to decided whether the selection could be removed

I'd prefer the 2nd because it allows the developer to decided.

One thing that we could do is that we don't strictly pass true when calling the new constructor but could do "(viewer.getControl().getStyle() & SWT.MULTI) == SWT.MULTI"

Patch Set 5:

Both checking MULTI or adding an additional constructor with a boolean would work for me.

The let's go with a boolean - can you prepare a patch for that?
