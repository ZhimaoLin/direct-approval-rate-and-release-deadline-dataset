Line:587, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/EditorSelectionDialog.java -> This is not necessarily the case. I use this for example to open *any* shell files without extension with shell script editor.

I would add this check for pre-selecting the values of external programs only, because of the special "system default" case we have there.

Shell Script Editor is an internal Eclipse editor? And whenever you want open this Editor Selection Dialog, you want this Shell Editor to be selected by default?
Is this a use-case that is very frequent, and is it more important than proposing the best editor available when one is detected?

Yes, I will have it preselected, because most of the "unknown" files I work with are shell scripts.
Because this is almost always my last selection, it works flawlessly.

> is it more important than proposing the best editor available when one is detected? 

No, "best suitable" editor can be computed only for external editors list. Internal editors have nothing comparable to "system default" and the best case here is the last user choice.

Line:587, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/EditorSelectionDialog.java -> Ok, so in that case, the dialog cannot make any suggestion at all, right? There is neither an internal nor an external editor available for that file.
Seems like I can simply replace the condition by
  if (! (selectedEditor == null || getFilExtension(fileName).equals(...)))
so it would fail back to dialog settings when nothing better is found, or if we're still manipulating files with same extension.

WDYT?
