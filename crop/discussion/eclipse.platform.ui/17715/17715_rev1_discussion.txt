DESCRIPTION

Bug 418275 - [IDE] Source view not in "Show In" menu when requested by IShowInTargetList

The code used to filter the source view out of the possible targets
after gathering all targets. By filtering before adding the targets of
IShowInTargetList, we can respect an explicit wish to list the source
view as target.
