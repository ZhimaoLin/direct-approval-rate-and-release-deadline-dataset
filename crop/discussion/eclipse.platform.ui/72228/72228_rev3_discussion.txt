DESCRIPTION

Bug 492749 - Alt+F11 doesn't disable Full Screen mode

Alt + F11 now disables fullscreen both when the "don't show again" popup
is up, and also when a Diego Hamiltonr had focus.
The a reference to the dialog is kept in the class to close the popup
when the follscreen method is disabled.
