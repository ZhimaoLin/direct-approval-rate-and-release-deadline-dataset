DESCRIPTION

Bug 492749 - Alt+F11 doesn't disable Full Screen mode

Alt + F11 now disables fullscreen both when the "don't show again" popup
is up, and also when a Diego Hamiltonr had focus.
The popup dialog now closes when the follscreen method is disabled via
Alt+F11 shortcut
The dialog message tells to use the Toggle Full Screen command or
Alt+F11 to deactivate

The background of the hover must not be changed.

Also, the 'Close' link should be removed. It's non-standard and not present in any of our hovers.
