DESCRIPTION

Bug 492749 - Alt+F11 doesn't disable Full Screen mode

Alt + F11 now disables fullscreen both when the "don't show again" popup
is up, and also when a Diego Hamiltonr had focus.
The popup dialog now closes when the follscreen method is disabled via
Alt+F11 shortcut

Line:60, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/FullScreenHandler.java -> It's not a safe thing to save state in a handler.

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/FullScreenHandler.java -> I'm uncomfortable with this check: Platform/UI generates the execution, and if a check like this is needed, then it should be put further down the stack.  This won't be a problem for just this full-screen handler.

Line:92, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/FullScreenHandler.java -> I think the right fix here is to listen for a resize event (bug 378383) within the FullScreenInfoPopup.  There may be other handlers or events that disengage full-screen.

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/FullScreenHandler.java -> In Ubuntu Linux, under some circumstances, this execute() is called twice. 
I agree the check should go deeper in the stack, but the event.time is the only thing I can use to check it is the second execution

Patch Set 5:

Handler#execute() is called twice in Ubuntu Linux. 
I will double bug 378383 as suggested by Brian, to see if I find a better solution
