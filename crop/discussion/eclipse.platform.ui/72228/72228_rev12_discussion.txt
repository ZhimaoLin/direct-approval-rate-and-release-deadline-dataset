DESCRIPTION

Bug 492749 - Alt+F11 doesn't disable Full Screen mode

Alt + F11 now disables fullscreen both when the "don't show again" popup
is up, and also when a Diego Hamiltonr had focus.
The popup dialog now closes when the follscreen method is disabled via
Alt+F11 shortcut
The dialog message tells to use the Toggle Full Screen command or
Alt+F11 to deactivate
