> Brian, what do you think? Is this the correct fix?

Sorry, I didn't post comments in here as I thought (and think) it's a different issue.  But I don't think this is the right fix as there are other calls to EModelService.getTopLevelWindowFor() within the code â€” there's something fishy going on.  I don't think this is a good change.
