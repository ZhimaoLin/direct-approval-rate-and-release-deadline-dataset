I think a name like AbstractControlSelectionBackgroundCustomizationElement and uses of instanceof indicates a slightly different approach is needed.  We'll also want to support List widgets too in the future, and possibly Combos?   Rather than try to reuse code using a superclass, can you use composition instead that could be specialized by the respective *Element classes?

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/AbstractControlSelectionBackgroundCustomizationElement.java -> Why's this required?

Line:138, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/AbstractControlSelectionBackgroundCustomizationElement.java -> Shouldn't you be restoring the GC's foreground?
