Patch Set 7:

The multi selection now looks ok. But there is still one little issue. If you select a cell of the table and then focus something else, e.g. another part, the overlay appears on the table selection.

BTW, I still don't understand what effect swt-hot-background-color should have. I don't see any effect if I set the value for example to yellow.

Hi Dirk,

Unfortunately the issue when the focus is not available is not fixable at this level (SWT itself does not provide a way to change that in this case and I'm not really sure on what's needed on SWT to make it work -- I did debug a bit on SWT, but it's not trivial to fix).

Related to the swt-hot, SWT says that hot items are the ones hovered, so, for instance, if you hover over the items of a tree it'll show them highlighted.

OK, but the hot styling seems to not getting applied in a table. Is it also not working from a SWT point of view?

Unfortunately yes (not sure why, but the Table isn't on-par with the functionalities that the Tree has in the SWT level in this regard).

In that case +1. I can't make this contribution responsible for SWT issues. :-)
Looks good as far as plain SWT tables can look good. ;-)
