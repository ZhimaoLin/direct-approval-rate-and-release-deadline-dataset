Line:1256, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> You could also remove the element with the ID "PerspectiveSwitcher" form the model. This element will be created anyhow during startup in the WorkbenchWindow#populateTopTrimContributions() method.

This would resolve the ordering problem you mentioned.
