Dirk, AFAICS this class is not used. Can you confirm that?

Patch Set 2:

AFAIK the MenuItemRenderer where replaced with MenuManagerRenderer. So also the HandledMenuItemRenderer should not be necessary anymore.

I can't find any usage in my platform workspace. If I understand it correctly, it should be referenced in a renderer factory.
But are we sure that nobody created a custom renderer factory and uses this renderer somewhere?

Thanks for the feedback Dirk. This class is internal API so we are allowed to remove it, if we do not use it.
