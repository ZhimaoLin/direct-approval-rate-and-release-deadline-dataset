Patch Set 2:

Why did you only fix the width/height? I would expect x/y to be synced then as well.

/me thinks that we also need a replacement for the scenario i described earlier in the issue because otherwise the functionality present today is lost

Patch Set 2:

You are right. The x/y values should be synced as well.
Furthermore, I think we need a discussion about the (size and location) persistence bahavior of a maximized window.
