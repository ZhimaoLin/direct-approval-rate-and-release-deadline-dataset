DESCRIPTION

Bug 410068 - Keybinding Context switching stops working after reporting
a conflict when switching to sibling context

When deactivating a context with an expression, cancel the RAT and
deactivate the context immediately.  Deactivating the context when the
RAT goes away only happens on the next active part change.
