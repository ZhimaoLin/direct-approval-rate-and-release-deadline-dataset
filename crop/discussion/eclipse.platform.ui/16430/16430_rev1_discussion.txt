Mickael,
have you run those tests in a regular way (as Eclipse foundation does) to ensure that no test failures is caused by this patch?

Patch Set 1:

No I didn't.
Actually, running Platform tests is something that appears quite difficult and quite time-consuming to me (need to rebuild locally the whole platform). That's the whole purpose of this change: make it easy to run tests.

Patch Set 1:

I know, you're right. The point is that if you didn't run the tests, I will have to do it, because improving tests is fine and desired as long as it does not break existing workflows (I don't want to make anyone complaining about unverified contributions).
