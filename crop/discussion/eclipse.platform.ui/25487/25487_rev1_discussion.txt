I think that generally this looks good.  Just a few comments inline.

Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/HandledContributionItem.java -> Yes, we don't want this as API right now.

Line:39, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/help/CommandHelpServiceImpl.java -> Do we have to throw the not defined exception?  Can we just return null and turn it into a no-op?

my answer to inline comments

Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/HandledContributionItem.java -> I agree. I asked rather if we should 'hide' the warning. The warning is a good 'reminder' that something should be improved here in the future.

Line:39, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/help/CommandHelpServiceImpl.java -> Initially I removed the exception. Then I realized that there a test dedicated to the exception. I was not sure if there is a real need for throwing this exception, so I reverted this part of code.
