Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

2 things:
1) Please create a bugzilla request for this feature and link with the gerrit
2) Please add tests for the change. I haven't found existing tests but this does not mean we should not add new tests, especially if we change such basic things like JFace decorators. Please take attention to test equals and hashcode, since they are important for decorators caching (see LocalResourceManager &Co).
