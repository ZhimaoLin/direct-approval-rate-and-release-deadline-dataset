Patch Set 3:

Looks OK, but someone else must review it.

The objection I have is that I would prefer to have two separated classes - one working with images, another with descriptors. Mixing both together requires this Suppliers and one extra field, means increasing memory consumption.

I'm relatively busy at the moment, so I most likely will not be able to give feedback on this one at the moment.
