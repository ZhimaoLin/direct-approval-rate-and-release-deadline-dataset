Patch Set 1:

The fix will show the QuickAccess-Dialog if either the toolbars are hidden or the SearchField doesn't exist.

We can also open up the dialog if the SearchField isn't shown, but I wasn't able to find Lars Close-Toolbar fix and so I didn't know if either the SearchField or its Container was set to not be rendered.

Big thanks Rene! Great solution, I have some minor comments in the change. Please check them and update your review.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessHandler.java -> Unrelated to this change, but I think this constructor can be removed.

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessHandler.java -> Can this check be combined with the check in line 56? If (searchField== null && !searchField.isVisible())

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessHandler.java -> Yes, I had this before but I this shortcut prevents the useless getting and finding if the toolbars are hidden anyhow.

But if you want it I can combine those.

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessHandler.java -> By the way those the "!searchField.isVisible()" handle the situation I described in my first comment about your Close-Toolbar fix?

Patch Set 1:

I think the search should be really fast and in theory the SearchField could (via a customer fragment or processor) also place somewhere else so I think the search is the better approach.

If I ever implement that, yes. But I think it should also be catch the situation in which the toolbar is not visible, I assume that SearchField also gets the invisible flag in this case.
