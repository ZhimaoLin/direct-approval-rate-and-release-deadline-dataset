DESCRIPTION

Bug 426224 - [QuickAccess] Quick Access field duplicated after moving from 4.4 to 4.3.2

Add code to reastablish workspace backward compatibility after a switch from a 4.4 workspace
is made back to a 4.3 one. It removes the "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application.trimcontribution.QuickAccess"
contribution element from the application, which is made by 4.4, and adds the elements
manually again (order of the elements is taken into account).
