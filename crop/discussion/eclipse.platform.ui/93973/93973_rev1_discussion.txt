DESCRIPTION

Bug 514297 - Eclipse is not showing workspace prompt at startup

Don't access preferences store before scheduling the job because this
would cause instance area to be initialized before user selected the
workspace location. See
org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.DataArea.assertLocationInitialized().
