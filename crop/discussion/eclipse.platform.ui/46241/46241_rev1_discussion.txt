The Javadoc of the class states: "message area with a non editable text that can take focus for use by screen message area with a non editable text that can take focus for use by screen readers".

Changing to the Label will probably break it.

Abandoned

Abandoning, as this solution is bad for accessibility and this should probably be handled SWT-side, as per bug comments.
