> I wish we could target some of these pieces a bit more precisely. Perhaps we should tag the MPE's CTabFolder?

Brian thanks for valuable comments. I see that the part of the patch connected to the Bug 433723 can produce some unexpected site effects so let's skip it for now and concentrate on the bug 436106 only. 

The Bug 433723 is another minor issue and we can go with it now. I will prepare the proper fix for the refreshing issue reported with the Bug 433723 at the beginning of the 4.5

thanks again for your help,
Daniel
