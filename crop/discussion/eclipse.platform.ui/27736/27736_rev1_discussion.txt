I wish we could target some of these pieces a bit more precisely.  Perhaps we should tag the MPE's CTabFolder?

Line:345, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTColorHelper.java -> I can see the difference this makes for the show-list on CTabFolders, but it disables an optimization that seemed to make a difference for editors with lots of controls.  Could we tune this to only be disabled for CTabFolders?

Line:207, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_basestyle.css -> Can we not tailor this to only apply to the top-level CTabFolder for the multi-page editors?  (I don't know of any MPEs with a page containing a CTF, but â€¦)

Line:211, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_basestyle.css -> ditto
