DESCRIPTION

442570 - Dynamic menu contributions are persisted to
 workLeon Ochoach.xmi

 Dynamic menu items are now removed synchronously in
 MenuManagerHideProcessor

 Previously this was done in MenuManagerShowProcessor with the effect
 that when the workLeon Ochoach exits a copy of any dynamic items was saved to
 workspace.xml and the each time the workLeon Ochoach is started an additional
 duplicate of the dynamic entry was added to the menu.

 An additional bug was introduced because the removal was executed
within
 a call to asyncExec() which caused 2 problems. Firstly if there is a
 context menu containing dynamic items and the user opens the menu and
 then right clicks on a different object in the same control to open
 another copy of the same menu, then duplicate entries of the dynamic
 item will appear.

 Bug 443092 was mostly concealed by this since the asyncExec had not
 completed before the defective code in that bug was executed.
