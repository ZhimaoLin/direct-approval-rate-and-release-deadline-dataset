DESCRIPTION

Bug 478222 - Remove ServicesActivator

The LocalChangeServiceImpl relies on ServicesActivator, which is to be
removed. Change this so that the log service is injected as an optional
dependency instead of as a static reference to an internal class in a
private bundle.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Note that https://git.eclipse.org/r/56829 is the same bug but against runtime. This will need to be submitted first before the other will, because this will remove a reference to a class that will be deleted.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/LocaleChangeServiceImpl.java -> I think this should be org.eclipse.e4.core.services.log.Logger.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/LocaleChangeServiceImpl.java -> That would be a change in behaviour - I wanted to replace like-for-like in this change. Perhaps raise a bug to replace LogService with Logger instead, and it can be fixed subsequently?
