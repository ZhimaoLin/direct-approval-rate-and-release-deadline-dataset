DESCRIPTION

Bug 205678 - [Clipboard] Using x11vnc with clipboard transfer causes
eclipse to OOM

Sometimes Eclipse can misinterpret native data received from clipboard.
No one seriously would copy/paste or drag/drop more then 1.000.000
resources: only creating an *empty* array of 100.000.000 resources will
cause OOME on 512 MB heap size (default for shipped Eclipse packages),
same with copy/paste of a *full* array of 10.000.000 elements.

The patch introduces a maximum limit for ResourceTransfer of 1.000.000
elements. In case the elements count exceed this limit, an error message
will be logged to the error log and the transfer operation will be
cancelled. JUnit test for the new limit is added too.
