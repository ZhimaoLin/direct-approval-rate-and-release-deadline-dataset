DESCRIPTION

Bug 472614 - Smarter import

This wizard and framework allows contributors to contribute a project
detector and configurator. Those detectors are used by this import
framework to automatically identify projects in a given directory. Then
matching projects that have been detected and selected for import are
automatically configured as specified in the contributed class.
Contributors are expected to look at details in the various files to set
as much project properties as possible.
Contributors are expected to be language or framework support, such as
Java support looking for Java file and enabling Java nature and setting
classpath; OSGi support looking for MANIFEST.MF and enabling the
necessary nature...
From user perspective, the operation is only about providing a folder,
reviewing some proposals and hitting finish, and to enjoy project(s)
ready to work with in the IDE.

@Noopur: Patch set 11 should fix all comments you made on bugzilla. However, I didn't manage to reproduce the issue with archives locally. I tried something that might help, but cannot guarantee it's working.

Thanks.

I am still getting the exception saying "Could not delete... The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process". Try importing the archive from bug 484686 and deleting the imported projects. You should see the issue in a couple of trials.

I just tried it and didn't manage to reproduce the issue on Linux. I guess you're running on Windows, which doesn't allow modifying files that still have a stream open. In any case, that is a bug that should be fixed; but since I don't manage to reproduce it locally, I'm failing at finding a valid fix. Your help would be highly welcome.
