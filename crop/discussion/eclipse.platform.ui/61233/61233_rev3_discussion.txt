DESCRIPTION

Bug 472614 - Smarter import

This wizard and framework allows contributors to contribute a project
detector and configurator. Those detectors are used by this import
framework to automatically identify projects in a given directory. Then
matching projects that have been detected and selected for import are
automatically configured as specified in the contributed class.
Contributors are expected to look at details in the various files to set
as much project properties as possible.
Contributors are expected to be language or framework support, such as
Java support looking for Java file and enabling Java nature and setting
classpath; OSGi support looking for MANIFEST.MF and enabling the
necessary nature...
From user perspective, the operation is only about providing a folder,
reviewing some proposals and hitting finish, and to enjoy project(s)
ready to work with in the IDE.

Some minor suggestions

Line:164, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/DataTransferMessages.java -> Maybe use SmartImport as prefix instead of Easyimport?

Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/DataTransferMessages.java -> I suggest to use here also the SmartImport/Easyimport as prefix so that we also know is 5 years that this belongs to the SmartImport.

Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/EasymportWizard.java -> Option to use try with resources to avoid the final block?

Line:364, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/EasymportJob.java -> You can use the new SubProgressMonitor.split API to check automatically for cancellation.

Line:56, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/EasymportJobReportDialog.java -> Should that be renamed to SmartImportJobREportDialog?

Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/EasymportWizard.java -> Unfortunately, the TarFile class doesn't implement Closeable, so the finally block remains necessary. And since it's necessary, it seems better to me to keep very similar instantiation/close for both ZipFile and TarFile.
Also, as the instantation is conditional, I'm not sure how well it would fit in a try with resources.
