DESCRIPTION

Bug 472614 - Smarter import

This wizard and framework allows contributors to contribute a project
detector and configurator. Those detectors are used by this import
framework to automatically identify projects in a given directory. Then
matching projects that have been detected and selected for import are
automatically configured as specified in the contributed class.
Contributors are expected to look at details in the various files to set
as much project properties as possible.
Contributors are expected to be language or framework support, such as
Java support looking for Java file and enabling Java nature and setting
classpath; OSGi support looking for MANIFEST.MF and enabling the
necessary nature...
From user perspective, the operation is only about providing a folder,
reviewing some proposals and hitting finish, and to enjoy project(s)
ready to work with in the IDE.

Some initial trivial comments before testing the feature.

Line:173, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> Is this really needed? Couldn't you extend ProgressMonitorFocusJobDialog or ProgressMonitorJobsDialog instead?

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is not needed - JFace already comes via org.eclipse.ui.

Line:6, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/schema/projectConfigurators.exsd -> Should be "Project Configurator"

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/schema/projectConfigurators.exsd -> Descriptions are started with a lowercase letter (applies to all attributes in this file).

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/schema/projectConfigurators.exsd -> Missing description

Line:173, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> I believe it's the piece of advice I needed to improve greatly the reporting. I'll give it a try, thanks.
