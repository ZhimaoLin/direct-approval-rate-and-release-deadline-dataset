DESCRIPTION

Bug 472614 - Smarter import

This wizard and framework allows contributors to contribute a project
detector and configurator. Those detectors are used by this import
framework to automatically identify projects in a given directory. Then
matching projects that have been detected and selected for import are
automatically configured as specified in the contributed class.
Contributors are expected to look at details in the various files to set
as much project properties as possible.
Contributors are expected to be language or framework support, such as
Java support looking for Java file and enabling Java nature and setting
classpath; OSGi support looking for MANIFEST.MF and enabling the
necessary nature...
From user perspective, the operation is only about providing a folder,
reviewing some proposals and hitting finish, and to enjoy project(s)
ready to work with in the IDE.

Patch Set 17:

Very nice that the menu entry is now in the file menu but I suggest to rename it from "Import Projects from Folder..." to "Open Projects..." because:

1.) it is simpler and easier to understand
2.) Import implies that the project is copied, which is optional
3.) It aligns with other applications

Also I would avoid the "intermediate" step and show directly 
"SmartImportWizard" instead of a folder selection dialog as later I can also select a zip file.

Patch Set 17:

I imported all projects from ~git/eclipse.platform.ui. Here are some bugs I noted:

1.) Import dialog "hangs" with "6 operations remaining".
2.) Progress reporting seems broken, the progress bar is immediately at the end
3.) The text labels switching to often at the beginning "Opening and import" is not readable. I would not distingih between these two steps.

Ok, I take the report into account.
However, as we're appraoching M6 and API freeze, what's necessary right now is to agree on APIs, and maybe extract a subset we can include for API freeze.
For example, what if I remove all the UI entries, so the code is in; the API are set up, but the UI doesn't show up to user until it's considered as mature enough?

@Lars: did you try the latest patch set? because the menu has been changed earlier to "open projects..." (see plugin.properties)

xxx@xxx.xxx did you try the latest patch set?

Yes, but there was some caching. I used clean workspace in the launch config and it becomes visible.

Mickael, once eclipse.platform.ui import works (it does not yet) I'm +2 for merging this and have it visible in the ui to get more user testing, if you can confirm that you will be available to fix issued discovered after the merge.

Patch Set 17:

I can reproduce the issue for eclipse.platform.ui and other project containing Eclipse plugins. It seems like there is always 1 job/operation remaining for such project.
Non-PDE projects seem to complete just fine.
