Patch Set 4: Verified-1

The viewer supports multi-select of WorkingSets, but manual sorting works only when single WorkingSet gets selected. Do you want to fix it using current bug and prepare new patch set or you prefer the separate bug for it?

I think for now we can update the current patch in order to disable the 'Up' and 'Down' buttons when more than one WorkingSet gets selected. However moving multiple items and switching between 'Up' and 'Down' buttons when last/fist item of selected items reaches bottom/first position on the list should be also good solution for that.

Sorry for spam, but I haven't noticed it during my last review,
Daniel

Patch Set 4:

It seems as easy to support multiple working sets (like package explorer does) than it it to make the Up/Down button disabled when multiple workingSets are selected.
I'll provide a patch with better handling of multi-selection in the viewer.
