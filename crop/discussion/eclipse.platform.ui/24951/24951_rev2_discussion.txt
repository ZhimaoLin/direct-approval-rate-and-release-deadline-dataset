Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I'm not sure whether this feature will be valuable to users. I expected that the 'up' and 'down' buttons will sort the WorkingSets with ascending/descending order. I think it will be better to expose such manual reordering by DND in order to keep the consistency with other pieces of IDE.

Anyway, I have noticed small issue with 'Up' and 'Down' button - when the 'Up' button reaches the top position on the list or the 'Down' button the bottom one, the user has to select the viewer in order to switch enabling of the buttons. I think it should be done automatically after reaching the top/bottom position on the list
