Patch Set 7: Verified-1

Sorry, but I have to put -1 again for the new patch. I have found the issue with the 'Up' button and the minor one with the 'Down' one there. Please re-test the following steps:

1) add several workingsets, i.e. a, b, c, d, e

2) select 'b' and 'd'

3) move selection with 'Up' button - when 'a' riches the top position on the list, you can still move the 'd' untill it joins 'b'. When it is done the 'Up' button gets disabled that is fine

4) repeat similar selection and move workingsets in the opposite direction with the 'Down' button - the selection seems to be moving fine. The only issue is that, when 'd' reaches bottom position then the 'Down' button is still enabled. I think it should be disabled since the user is not able to move the selection further

I think we are really close to the final version,
Daniel
