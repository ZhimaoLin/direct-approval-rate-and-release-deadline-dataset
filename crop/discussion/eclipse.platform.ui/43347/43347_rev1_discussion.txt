Thanks Tomasz.  A few comments:

Your safeClone() should do a disconnect implicitly: it's an error to have two working sets with the same name.

To be honest, I'd just name your safeClone() to clone().  fireWorkingSetChanged() takes an object anyways.

You updated the copyrights, but you should add to the contributors section.
