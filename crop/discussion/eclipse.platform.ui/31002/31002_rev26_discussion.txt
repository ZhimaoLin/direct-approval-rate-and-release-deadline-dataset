See inline comments. In general I think the code is good to go after these minor changes. Please ensure that the pom.xml actually work (does not at the moment for the test plug-in).

Any other concern which others may have can be solved later via new bug reports, I would like to have that in M2 to get broader feedback.

Do you have already a Gerrit review to add these plugins to the IDE feature?

Line:7, tests/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> .qualifier is missing

Line:22, tests/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring.tests/pom.xml -> Should we define the TestSuite here also? This way all tests fitting the default include schema would be executed which means the suite and the tests including EventLoopMonitorThreadManualJUnitPluginTests which according to the Javadoc should not always run

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/monitoring/FilterHandler.java -> Please use blocks for control statement blocks, i.e., {}

Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring/README.md -> Is this still true? I think we moved it to tracing.

Please also add a README.md to the test plug-in. See org.eclipse.ui.test for an example.

I'd love to, but I don't know where to look for it. I see org.eclipse.platform and org.eclipse.sdk in eclipse.platform.releng. Is it what you meant?

Line:7, tests/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:22, tests/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring.tests/pom.xml -> I'm having trouble with running monitoring tests with Maven. No matter what I do, Maven complains: "Unable to satisfy dependency from org.eclipse.ui.monitoring.tests 1.0.0.qualifier to bundle org.eclipse.ui.monitoring 1.0.0.; No solution found because the problem is unsatisfiable.". I also tried adding monitoring tests directly to eclipse.platform.ui/tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/pom.xml, but there they get silently ignored. Do you have any suggestions?

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/monitoring/FilterHandler.java -> Done

Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring/README.md -> Done
