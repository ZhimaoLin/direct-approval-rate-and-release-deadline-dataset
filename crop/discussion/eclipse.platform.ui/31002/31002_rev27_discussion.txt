Lars, what do you think of an idea to enable the monitoring by default to get Eclipse committers to use it, then disable it before M6 or M7?

Patch Set 27:

To solve the pom issue, run mvn clean install on the org.eclipse.ui.monitoring plug-in. That installs it into your local Maven repository.

-1 for enabling it by default but we should definitely announce it at the platform.ui and cross mailing list asking people to try it out.
