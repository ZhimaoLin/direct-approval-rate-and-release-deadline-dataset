DESCRIPTION

Bug 483789 - [Dark Theme] Progressbar turns white on update

Changed setColor() behavior so that it only checks to see if widget has
been selected. Removed color setting feature as this breaks the Dark
theme/any custom theme. The method setColor() use to set a color to the
widget which took priority over the theming of the .css. 

The Dark theme .css file has also been edited to fix progress item color
issues for a more fluid dark color.
