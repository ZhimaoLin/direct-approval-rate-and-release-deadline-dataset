DESCRIPTION

Bug 483789 - [Dark Theme] Progressbar turns white on update

Changed setColor() behavior so that it only checks to see if widget has
been selected. Removed color setting feature as this breaks the Dark
theme/any custom theme. The method setColor() use to set a color to the
widget which took priority over the theming of the .css. 

The Dark theme .css file has also been edited to fix progress item color
issues for a more fluid dark color.

I seem to have fix the color issue of the progress items with some changes in the .css. I tried to make it so the e4-dark_globalstyle.css (which hosts the .css for ProgressInfoItem) to have highest priority of color, but it only worked for me when I also change the e4-dark_partstyle.css. I am not very experienced with .css, so perhaps you may have a better solution to this.

Thanks. I have a look at the CSS changes later (today or tomorrow). Marking with -1 for now to prevent people from merging this.

Line:84, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> This one looks scary as it affects lots of widgets. I test later.
