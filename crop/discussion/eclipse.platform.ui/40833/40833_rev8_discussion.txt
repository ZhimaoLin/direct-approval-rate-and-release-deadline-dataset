Thanks Ada Valentine, looks almost good. Please review the detailed comments

Line:47, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/PerspectiveViewsBug88345.java -> Comment can also be deleted

Line:320, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindowConfigurer.java -> Also add the comment // not supported anymore

Line:3141, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.java -> If I look at APITestUtils this still looks correct. Is the test failing without this change? I think the isFastView method checks now if the view is minimized. Maybe simply rename the method to isViewMinimized?

Is the test failing without this change? I think the isFastView method checks now if the view is minimized. Maybe simply rename the method to isViewMinimized?

Line:69, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/APITestUtils.java -> If think this method is still valid, it checks for the tags which is the e4 way. Maybe simply rename the method to isViewMinimized?

Line:259, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/StickyViewTest.java -> No need to keep dead code, this can be deleted

Line:268, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/StickyViewTest.java -> No need to keep dead code, this can be deleted

Line:23, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/PerspectiveWithFastView.java -> I think the whole class a be deleted. Tests are not API so we are OK to delete stuff
