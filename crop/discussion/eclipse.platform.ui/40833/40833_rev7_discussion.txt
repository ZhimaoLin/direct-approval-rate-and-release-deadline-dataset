Thanks Ada Valentine, I think you also want to update WorkLeon OchoachWindowConfigurer

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Lets rename that to [FastView] Deprecated Fast View API

Line:2661, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> Replace method with // not supported anymore

Line:2679, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> I suggest to make this "false" and remove the field.

Line:2717, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> return false and also update WorkbenchWindowConfigurer

Last but not least I think you can also remove a few outdated test cases. I suggest to do a full text search on "fastview" in platform.ui and see what you find and replace as much as possible.

Thanks Ada Valentine for help the platform project with that. I personally think cleaning up the old code basis is one of the most important tasks we have.
