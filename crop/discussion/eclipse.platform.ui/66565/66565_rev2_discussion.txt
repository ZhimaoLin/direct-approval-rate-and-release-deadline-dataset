Patch Set 2:

I don't normally use Windows, but I fired this up in a Windows VM and I don't see any difference in behaviour.  I expected to see pulsing or progress shown on the task bar icons on startup (mirroring the splash progress), and on job progress (I repeatedly tried cleaning all projects to trigger a rebuild).

What are some definite ways to trigger this behaviour?

Patch Set 2:

I would like to confirm the functionality myself, but when I'm trying to test my attached test program (see bug 471310) this won't start the legacy workLeon Ochoach at all (Regardless whether I have performed changes or not), it just starts a very empty application without activating the workbench configurer. If you cannot confirm this non-functionality of the legacy application startup: Could you please provide me a specific way against which target platform I should try to start the test application?

I was seeing this too, and I see *nothing* on the console <sigh>.  I haven't tried delving into the issue, but I found that loading in all of the bundles in platform-ui seemed to solve the problem.

Patch Set 2:

Alex: I tried to do the same, but when trying to do so, I got an NPE in org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workLeon Ochoach.ResourceHandler. The @Inject c'tor gets called, but not xxx@xxx.xxx method. Within the getResource method the resourceSetImpl field is null, if called by E4Application.loadApplicationModel. Could you successfully start my test program and if so, could you explain me, which other bundles you did got from any other git project? I'll give it a second try during this weekend, but any hints from you before that would be very much appreciated.

Patch Set 2:

Brian: (My apologies for the inappropriate "Alex") I checked now also the project eclipse.platform.runtime out which seemed to solve my startup problems and I can now run my test program. Two relevant observations from my Windows 7 machine:

(a) The tool bar contribution ("Task!") runs now and triggers the system task bar as expected. This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.

(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:
(b.1) Previous 3.x WorkLeon Ochoach code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the line

IStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();

could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkLeon OchoachConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.
(b.2) Now WorkLeon Ochoach.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.
(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.ini

Therefore my action items for this week end are:
- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup
- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitor

My most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY. If I fail to complete my tasks during that weekend I would suggest to split the missing startup progress report using the system task bar into a second issue. Does that sound like a feasible approach?
