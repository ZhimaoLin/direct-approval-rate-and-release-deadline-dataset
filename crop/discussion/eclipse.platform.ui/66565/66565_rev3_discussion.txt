Patch Set 3:

This commit removes again the previously restored TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor, because it has no effects, since during its invocation there is no OS window available to which the system task feedback could become visible. I needed to cleanup some generic warnings because their huge number made it nearly impossible to work within the WorkLeon Ochoach class.

Thanks Daniel.  It took me ages but I was able to verify the functionality.  Could you back out the changes to WorkLeon Ochoach.java: they look to be generalizations of the code, and should be done separately.
