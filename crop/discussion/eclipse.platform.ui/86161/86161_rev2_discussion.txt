I personally dislike this approach. This would force us to maintain the old import wizard forever. I think it is better to enhance the new import wizard to cover all desired scenarios.

Patch Set 2:

@Lars: the use-case reported in the bug goes beyond what's covered by the smart import wizard, and the Import wizards in general are meant to remain. Note that the link here doesn't enforce maintenance of the Eclipse project import wizard in particular, it just allows to see all specialized import wizard from the Smart Import one.
Let's keep this discussion on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500117 , in the meantime, the link is an helpful thing to offer to some user who do need specialized wizards.

I missed in the review that you are not hard-coding a link to the old wizard but offering an option to start any import wizard. Great idea.
