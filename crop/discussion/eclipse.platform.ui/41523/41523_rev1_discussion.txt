Line:1272, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> If a running save job is already half way through the saving operation, some changes may remain unsaved. Since the penalty for loosing changes is high, it is safer to allow each save job to run, but use a scheduling rule to prevent the jobs from stepping on each other.

The lowest interval is 1 minute, so I guess we can avoid the overhead here. WDYT?

The next job (or shutting down Eclipse) will save a workspace state with new changes.
We have just increased "save interval" in the case it is too small, i.e., saving the workspace is a bit delayed.
A user can also increase/decrease this interval which won't affect the functionality.
