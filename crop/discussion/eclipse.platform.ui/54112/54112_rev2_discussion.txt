Look ok to me. But the diff shows a "big change". I could not tell if that was just formatting ... or if more than one thing changed. But the part about the "wrapper profile" looked right.

It's not a good sign that Maven could parse that pom.xml with duplicated contents. It's not even syntactically valid xml.
