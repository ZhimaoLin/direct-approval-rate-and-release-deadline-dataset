DESCRIPTION

Bug 489335 - PartServiceImpl.getActivePart() returns part from the
different perspective during perspective switch

During perspective switch give the part service a chance to know that we
are in inconsistent state and provide him a helper function to compute
the active part.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

This approach still looks wrong to me. Introducing extra temporary states slows everything down and can introduce bugs by adding extra corner cases.

It should be perfectly valid to create a TabbedPropertySheetPage while the old part is still active. If that occurs, the TPSP should have had a call to setInput AFTER the new active part was assigned.

Either the workLeon Ochoach fired notifying about the active part change too early or the property view wasn't listening to the correct event -- neither requires the introduction of temporary states during a perspective switch.
