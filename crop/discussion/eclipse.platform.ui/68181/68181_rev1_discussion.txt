DESCRIPTION

Bug 489335 - PartServiceImpl.getActivePart() returns part from the
different perspective during perspective switch

During perspective switch, mark the old prespective as being de-selected
so that the part service has a chance to know that we are in
inconsistent state and the old active part should not be used anymore by
client code.
