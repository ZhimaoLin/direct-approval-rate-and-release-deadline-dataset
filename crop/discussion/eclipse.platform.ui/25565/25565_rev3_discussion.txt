DESCRIPTION

Bug 391430 - Dynamically creating / deleting menu items in Menu and MPopupMenu doesn't work

WORK IN PROGRESS - DO NOT SUBMIT

Reactivate the fix of Sopot and modify it so it can handle the remove
and add of many elements. Additionally some changes to the existing code
are made which update the E4 model with the values of already existing
MenuManager (usually they come from the legacy workLeon Ochoach).

You're direction doesn't seem unreasonable, but I'd need to see a more final patch to fully understand it.

This seems to be good for me, but I'm still testing.
The big plus is that this patch allows us to see more elements in the CustomizePerspectiveDialog, see bug 378849.

Line:1322, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> mi can be null, so I've seen some NPE's here and there.
The NPE check should be added:
if (mi == null) {
	continue;
}

Line:1330, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> ci can be null, as above
The NPE check should be added:
if (ci == null) {
	continue;
}
