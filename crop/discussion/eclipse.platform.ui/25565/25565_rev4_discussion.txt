DESCRIPTION

Bug 391430 - Dynamically creating / deleting menu items in Menu and
MPopupMenu doesn't work
Bug 413657 - Source, Refactor and Search menus are missing in Customize
Perspective Dialog

Reactivate the fix of Sopot (Change-Id:
I0257600c4aa8f2f4fba8944787f401a7d205f804) and modify it so it can
handle the remove and add of many elements. Additionally some changes to
the existing code are made which update the E4 model with the values of
already existing MenuManager (usually they come from the legacy
workLeon Ochoach). Those changes  also allow CustomizePerspectiveDialog to see
more items (Search and Refactor menus contributed by action sets, see
Bug 378849 and 413657).

I've rebased the patch on the head and added two NPE's as in ma comments before. I need this change to proceed on Bug 420956 - [Perspectives] Fix perspective customization on 4.x.

Sorry for changing the commit author but gerrit on Eclipse.org does not allow to push review changes with different author id if the review committer has no project commit rights, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=447739.
