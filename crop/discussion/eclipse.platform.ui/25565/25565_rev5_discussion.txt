DESCRIPTION

Bug 391430 - Dynamically creating / deleting menu items in Menu and
MPopupMenu doesn't work
Bug 413657 - Source, Refactor and Search menus are missing in Customize
Perspective Dialog

Reactivate the fix of Sopot (Change-Id:
I0257600c4aa8f2f4fba8944787f401a7d205f804) and modify it so it can
handle the remove and add of many elements. Additionally some changes to
the existing code are made which update the E4 model with the values of
already existing MenuManager (usually they come from the legacy
workLeon Ochoach). Those changes  also allow CustomizePerspectiveDialog to see
more items (Search and Refactor menus contributed by action sets, see
Bug 378849 and 413657).

I'm debugging the issue with the Team menu, see comment below in MenuManagerRenderer.

Line:1151, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> BUG: this line removes the "Team" menu forever.
However, without this line many (but not all) action set contribution menu entries aren't shown under the CustomizePerspectiveDailog / Command Group Availability / Menubar details.

The "dynamic" part of the patch was doing something wrong. Removing it I still have some useful stuff for the CPD issue, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38803/2/bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java

Line:739, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> You need the reconcile here because the updateActionSets() is updating the underlying MenuManager but not generating the correct model elements?

Line:142, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributionRecord.java -> Why would the MenuManager not be visible if the MMenu element is visible?
