DESCRIPTION

Bug 391430 - Dynamically creating / deleting menu items in Menu and MPopupMenu doesn't work

Reactivate the fix of Sopot and modify it so it can handle the remove
and add of many elements. Additionally some changes to the existing code
are made which update the E4 model with the values of already existing
MenuManager (usually they come from the legacy workLeon Ochoach).
