DESCRIPTION

Bug 107436 - [IDE] navigator: show file/folder in "Windows Explorer", Finder, Nautilus

Fix problems with spaces in path and quotes being taken literally.

The code previously used the exec(String, ...) method. The problem with
this is that it just splits the command by space and then executes the
parts as a command, so each part after the first is an argument to the
executable. A path with a space in it would be split and then passed as
two arguments, which does not work.

Also, the single String variant does not interpret quotes in any way, so
they are also passed to the command and will be interpreted as being
part of the path.

Both problems can be fixed by removing the quotes from the default
commands and splitting the string before replacing the variables.
