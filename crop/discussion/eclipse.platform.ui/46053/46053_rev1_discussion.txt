DESCRIPTION

Bug 457214 - [Contributions] Redrawn in ToolBarManager should always
turned of independent of the number of items

Looks like the whole block can also be wrapped into a
if(!clean.isEmpty() && !toRemove.isEmpty()) block but that would IMHO
require that we move the setDirty(false) out of this block and should be
handled by another bug.
