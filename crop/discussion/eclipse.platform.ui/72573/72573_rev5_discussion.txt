Patch Set 5:

The Hudson failure is an infra issue and isn't related to your submission. I don't know whether this was already escalated to sysadmins.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Build says that the version of the bundle must be updgraded. It should probably be 0.12.200.qualifier/-SNAPSHOT. Please try to update the MANIFEST.MF and pom.xml accordingly.

Patch Set 5:

Re copyright update: Do you mean the copyright of the modified java files or also for the pom.xml?

Patch Set 5:

OK, I checked the history of the pom.xml and previous version updates didn't update the copyright of this files. I'm therefore only updating the modified Java files.

I would like to apologize to the review team, but I couldn't manage it to update this patch, therefore a new patch has been started: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/112200/. I will now abandon this older one.
