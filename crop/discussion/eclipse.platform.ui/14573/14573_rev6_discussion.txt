I've added an inline comment, could you please switch finalize to dispose.  Other than that, this looks good.

Line:65, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/handlers/BuildProjectHandler.java -> I'm pretty sure we don't use finalize() for this.  You can override dispose() from AbstractHandler
