Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Added a comment inline, it needs to deal with multiple IWorkLeon OchoachWindows.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/handlers/BuildProjectHandler.java -> This handler is at the application level.  That means with multiple windows, you need to return the build action for that window and also add a window listener so that you can clear a window entry if that window closes.
