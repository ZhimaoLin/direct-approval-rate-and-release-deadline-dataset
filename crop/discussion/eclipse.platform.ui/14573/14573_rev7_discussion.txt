Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

I originally complained that creating a new BuildAction is overkill. This is now addressed, but the new code is even more overkill and probably slower than creating the action each time.

So you want me to remove the caching?

Patch Set 7:

Yes, listener and caching makes things way too complicated and probably also slower than the original fix which created the action each time.

But let's wait what Paul says before attaching the next patch.

Patch Set 7:

Looks like Paul has updated the codebase with the pre-caching fix. Is there anything else that I need to do here?
