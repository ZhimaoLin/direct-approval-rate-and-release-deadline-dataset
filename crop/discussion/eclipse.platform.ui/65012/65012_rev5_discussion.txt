DESCRIPTION

Bug 371756 - [DataBinding] ObservableMapLabelProvider with
ILazy(Tree)ContentProvider gives empty labels in viewer

The ObservableCollectionContentProvider and
ObservableCollectionTreeContentProvider ignored the elements currently
in the input list during setInput. They correctly added a change
listener to the input, but that only reflected further list changes to
the knownElements.

Change looks good to me, one minor thing with the comment.

Conrad, AFAICS we do not have JFace Snippets for ObservableCollectionTreeContentProvider and ObservableCollectionTreeContentProvider. Could you add them, so that we can easily validate this fix?

Line:56, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/internal/databinding/viewers/ObservableCollectionTreeContentProviderTest.java -> I don't think that comment adds value.
