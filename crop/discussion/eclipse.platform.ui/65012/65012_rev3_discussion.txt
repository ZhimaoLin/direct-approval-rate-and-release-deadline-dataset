DESCRIPTION

Bug 371756 - [DataBinding] ObservableMapLabelProvider with
ILazy(Tree)ContentProvider gives empty labels in viewer

The ObservableCollectionContentProvider and
ObservableCollectionTreeContentProvider ignored the elements currently
in the input list during setInput. They correctly added a change
listener to the input, but that only reflected further list changes to
the knownElements.
