DESCRIPTION

Bug 459964 - [performance] WorkLeon OchoachPage.findEditor is slow on not
initialized editors

Don't parse XML memento each time getFactoryId() is called on
uninitialized editor references - calculate it once and use it later.

Cleaned up initialization of EditorReference and saved the factory
information into the factoryId field for later use.
