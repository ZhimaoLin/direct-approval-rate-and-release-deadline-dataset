>>The change to select the right tab must happen on the link selection >>inside p2's software installation dialog.

Yes that is the right approach. But then I will need to use discouraged class InstallationDialog from within p2.ui and have a public static variable to ensure that tab saving doesn't happen only for this. Is that is OK, I can create a patch with that.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I don't think the proposed patch fixes the issue. If one opens the "What Is already installed?" dialog for the 1st time, there is no guarantee it would show the right tab.
I think a more proper solution would be to introduce a new setInitialTabSelection(String id) method or to add a new constructor allowing to pass an initial tab id; to allow this id to be null or non-existing, and to use the introduced method/constructor to set "10.org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.ui.sdk.InstalledSoftwarePage" as preferred initial tab id (I think at this point, it's ok to copy the string, and just have the InstallationDialog logging a warning for unknown id to detect a possible change in the id later).

I didn't have the patch yet.

I will evaluate this but again it will require InstallationDialog  to be called from p2.ui. When I use InstallationDialog   from p2.ui, compiler complains of discouraged class. I can probably add a supress warning and evaluate this approach. Thanks Michael for your feedback !
