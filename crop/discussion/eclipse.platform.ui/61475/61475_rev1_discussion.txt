This should use generics in the long term, your change would prevent that

No, please look at the API again.

The comparator that is passed to ViewerComparator is specified to be a comparator for the *label strings*, not for the model objects. The comparator has no relationship to the method parameters of type Object.

Patch Set 1:

I.e. releasing this has no consequences for an eventual generification of the StructuredViewer APIs. It just follows the generification of the Policy class and has a much smaller scope since it doesn't introduce new type parameters.
