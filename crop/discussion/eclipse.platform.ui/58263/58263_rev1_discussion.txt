Line:440, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation.java -> I have no strong opinion here, but in other places you call it iterationMonitor, which I think is a better name.

Line:440, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation.java -> Suggest fixing that in a follow-up change. I wanted this patch to contain a pure search-and-replace, to make it easier to review.
