Patch Set 1:

Maybe you could separate the changes in this from the JUnit tests? This change request depends now on the change of the JUnit tests and changes also the viewers.

I suggest you rebase your JUnit work from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/16398/ onto the change in the viewers so that we get basically two changes to review:

1.) The Viewer 
2.) The JUnit tests
