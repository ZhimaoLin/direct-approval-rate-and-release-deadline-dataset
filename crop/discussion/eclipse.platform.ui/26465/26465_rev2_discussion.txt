DESCRIPTION

Bug 385565 - [Contributions] Menu contribution processing has different
results in 4.2 than 3.8

For a given locationURI (like popup:view.id?after=group) the menu
contributions are processed in order, and insert their children (the
menu items) in order.  In 3.8, each menu contribution started its
insertion at the group (so its children were inserted before the
previous menu contribution's children).

The merge strategy we used processed the menu contributions in order,
but appended their children to a list of merged children.  Each set of
children should have been inserted in order into the beginning of the
merged list.
