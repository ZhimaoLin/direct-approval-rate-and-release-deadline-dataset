Made the comment a bit more explicit since we may not track the source of this bug down for a while.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> This is a workaround for bug 401439.

Line:83, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> Do not return disposed items to the CSS engine by not including any elements after this disposed item.  Worst case is that several visible items will not be styled.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> That's funny.  Lars just told me not to put a bug id in the code ever.  See patch set 1!

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> I like having the bug ids for workarounds there so we can go back and see why something was done.  Much of platform.ui outlived CVS and may yet outlive git!

Never is such a strong statement. For workarounds I also sometimes put them in to have the reference. I personally don't like comments like:
