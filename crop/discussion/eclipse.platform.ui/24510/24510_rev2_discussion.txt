Patch Set 2:

There is an issue with CTabFolderElement getting left in the css system.  I left a system.error message to track it down.  Once left in the system, the message will print upon opening an editor with a CTabFolder, even after closing all editors and then opening a new one.

syserr is a bit less intrusive than the stack trace that was getting spit out to stdout upstream, and I though we would like to know if end users are still having issues.  This is such an intermittent issue.

If we should record this, then we need to use whatever eclipse logging is available in this plugin.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Steven: Interesting find in #401439c11.  This patch isn't quite adequate though as item(int) will still return the disposed item. Could you please update your patch noting that it's a workaround this finding in the comment, and remove the System.err.println().

> patch isn't quite adequate though as item(int)

The calling code asks for the length first, so I don't see how it will return the disposed items.  I've witnessed it firsthand.  

I could throw and exception, but that would be bad for the Engine.  I could yank the items out of the array, but would also be bad for the CTabFolder and whatever kept it around.

I think avoiding the current exception and not messing with the internal item array is a good first step.
