> Why did the regular png changed?

The rendere in org.eclipse.platform.images.renderer project is used to produce the PNGs out of the SVGs. It creates "binary" different versions depending on the platform (WIn, LInux, Mac) it runs on. Visually they are identical.
And for simplicity reasons I simple drag-and-drop-ed all the renderes PNGs form the the org.eclipse.images project to the org.eclipse.ui.ide project

Ok, since there is no payload difference, can you please exclude them from commit so it keeps git history slimmer?

Images that were not modified are rather not being included in commit to keep repository slim.

Sorry. My previous answer was wrong. The old PNGs already existed and we did not have any SVGs (or other "open format") version of them. So I have re-created them from scratch. So then new PNGs are in fact visually different (but as similar as I could get them). You can see this in the compare gallery in the curresponding bugzilla.
That's the reason for the changes in the "normal" resolution icons.
If I exclude these changes the icons would visually change if you move your eclipse window from a non-retina display to a retina-display (e.g. in multi-monitor mode).

To make it short: I think we should keep this commit as it is.

Ok, thanks for the explanation. I agree it makes sense to keep them if they're different. However, I let people with more experience in that field have a look too.
