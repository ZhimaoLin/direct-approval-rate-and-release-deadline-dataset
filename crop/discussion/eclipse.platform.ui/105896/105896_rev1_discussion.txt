DESCRIPTION

Bug 525207 - Multi-page editor not on focus after opening

Test to reproduce the problem. The test defines a multi-page editor with
only one editor, opens the multi-page editor and expects a focus gained
event in the only editor. A stress test case is provided, since the
focus gained event is lost about 1/3 of the time.
