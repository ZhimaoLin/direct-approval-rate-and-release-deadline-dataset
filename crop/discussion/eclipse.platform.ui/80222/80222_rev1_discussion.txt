DESCRIPTION

Bug 500617 - [problems view] Add buttons to Problem View, to open Filter

Problems view will include the filter dialog on the toolbar. Clicking
the button will pop the filter dialog for users to choose how they would
filter the problems view. Changed openFiltersDialog() to protected so
problemsView can call the method.
