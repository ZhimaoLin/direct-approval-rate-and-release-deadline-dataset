Dani, a while you agreed that you do not overuse -2. A formatting error might be a -1 but not a -2. Also, AFAIK no one every committed on purpose something which had a -1 from you.

Sorry, was not only formatting but still does not qualify as -2 IMHO. -2 should be reserved for strong disagreement.

Line:486, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEApplication.java -> I don't understand the comment. The bug proposes to change the "OK" label in favor of "Continue". So I removed the IDialogConstants.OK_LABEL, and replaced with a new custom label: IDEApplication_version_continue. Then, since changing the label is not enough, I had to make sure also the return value for the new label is the same as IDialogConstants.OK_ID. 
Please, let me know where I am wrong.

I usually use -2 when I want to have the last say and/or am sure that the current change must not be submitted.

Using -1 now, but it still must not be submitted ;-).

Line:486, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEApplication.java -> I see the point, but you don't use the same constant as the one being checked later. Plus it is a lot of code to change the label. You can achieve the same by just changing the string and then make the return code check with:
			int returnCode = dialog.open();
			if (returnCode == Window.CANCEL || returnCode == SWT.DEFAULT) {

But, your solution is also OK as long as you use the correct Window.CANCEL constant.

I think -1 is sufficient for this, the issue with -2 is that if you are unable (vacation, busy, etc), we cannot proceed even if the reported issue has been solved. I know Sergey from Google brought that up a while ago and IIRC you agreed to use -2 only for very critical things like the other committers.

Thanks for reviewing the change. Please, let me know if formatting is good. As I started working with a different OS (MacOS), I assume some settings that could be wrong.
