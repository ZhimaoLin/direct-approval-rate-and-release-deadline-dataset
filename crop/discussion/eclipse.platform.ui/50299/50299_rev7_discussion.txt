Patch Set 7:

I also had UpdateListStrategy.fillDefaults in mind as only place where type information is really used, but I still think this is not relevant to have to type at runtime, because the converter also have a generic type and the default IdentityConverter converter can also handle the conversion by getting the type from the object, which is supposed to be converted. So sorry for not being precise in my comments.
