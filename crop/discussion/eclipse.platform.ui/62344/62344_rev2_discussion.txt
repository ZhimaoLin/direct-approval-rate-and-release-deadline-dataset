Thanks Brian for looking into this. I would suggest to do the non annotation cleanup work in another commit. Should we also set the NotNull as default via the package info file?

Line:58, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ErrorEditorPart.java -> Is this related, or should this done in a separate commit?

Line:47, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ErrorViewPart.java -> Should we handle StatusPart separately?

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/IViewPart.java -> Why is this commented?

Line:163, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbenchPart.java -> ?

Oops, I actually did that, but I must have missed it in the commit!

> xxx@xxx.xxx

I really wasn't sure about these methods: they don't return null in the normal stage of their lifecycle, only before the part has been initialized, or after the part has been disposed.  Marking this method xxx@xxx.xxx would create false positives (at its essence).

> Should we handle StatusPart separately?

Ok.
