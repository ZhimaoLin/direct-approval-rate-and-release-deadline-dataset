Brian, any chance to finish this change for M5?

I'll try to get this done.  There are a bunch of possibly null locations that were identified.

Thanks Brian. I think this will be an important issue for our code quality and I assume once you finished this initial work, others might chip in with other areas.

Patch Set 4:

I'm ashamed to admit I'm going to miss M5.  This has turned into whack-a-mole.  Every time I come back, more null-related errors appear (6 -> 320).  For some reason, JDT has inferred that IEclipseContext#get() xxx@xxx.xxx  It's hard to do without also annotating JFace.
