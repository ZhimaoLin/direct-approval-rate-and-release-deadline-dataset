already merged, but you might want to consider my comment

Line:168, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/GradientBackgroundListener.java -> If you already have an RGBA here, you could also add it as an additional parameter to the Color constructor. Won't change anything right now, because we don't support alpha blending in gradients, but could be more future proof.
