Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Hi Patrik, this code will definitely end up in a StackOverflow Exception since observeDelayed is called over and over again.

Please have a look at the original code of the deprecated SWTObservables class and move/copy it to the Property implementations.

Patch Set 1:

If this piece of code is likely to get into an infinite loop, it would be great to have an automated test that for it.
