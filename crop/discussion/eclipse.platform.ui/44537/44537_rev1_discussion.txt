The patch looks good (see comments inside), but I'm wondering why File->Switch Workspace dialog *can* be closed by escape *without* this patch, but the prompt on startup can't?

Line:62, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/ChooseWorkspaceDialog.java -> Style nit: I prefer not to initialize fields to *Java default* values. Just adds noise while debugging. Same below.

Line:89, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/ChooseWorkspaceDialog.java -> style nit: can you add braces around if block?

I've just stumbled upon the old comment in org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.ChooseWorkspaceDialog.prompt(boolean): "// 70576: make sure dialog gets dismissed on ESC too"

I'm guessing: on File->Switch Workspace you have an E4 Context key binding. But in the startup dialog you have no  context, because there is no MPart to associate this context. (similar to Bug 378861)

I agree the comment is wrong now. Just reject the patch; I'll submit a second one with the comment deleted.

Patrik, you don't need to abandon/create new patch, just amend the commit and push again. Gerrit can detect that the commit is the "same".
