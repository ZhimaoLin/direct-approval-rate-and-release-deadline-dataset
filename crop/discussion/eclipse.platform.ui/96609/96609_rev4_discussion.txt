Line:462, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/ExpandableCompositeTest.java -> Should this variable be renamed to control?

Line:362, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/SizeCacheTest.java -> Why is this suppressed?

Line:325, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/forms/widgets/ExpandableComposite.java -> What is the logic here?

Line:462, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/ExpandableCompositeTest.java -> Done

Line:362, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/SizeCacheTest.java -> It was failing on osx and we don't have time to fix the underlying problem in SWT for this version of Eclipse.

Line:325, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/forms/widgets/ExpandableComposite.java -> It mirrors the M6 behavior, which had a (seemingly arbitrary) +1 here. Dani has asked for the control to be put back in the position in had in M6.
