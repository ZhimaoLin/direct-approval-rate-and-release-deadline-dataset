Hi Paul,
Initially I tried to fix this bug in MenuManger but I didn't manage to implement reliable fix. In the patch I provide a simple check in ObjectActionContributor.
Alternatively this duplication check can be added directly to the PluginActionBuilder, but I am not sure if it can cause some unwanted side effects.

* In the previous comment I meant PopupMenuExtender - not MenuManager

Unfortunately this is the wrong place to fix it.  We cannot guarantee that the IDs are unique.
