Good find.  But I think we can just call Resource.delete()?

Line:1189, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Can you not call delete()?  The javadocs implies that it unloads and removes the resource from the set.

Patch Set 1:

delete() says it deletes the URI as well ... does that mean it deletes the actual file (I don't want that).

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Oops, good point.  It seems surprising that there isn't a nicer way.
