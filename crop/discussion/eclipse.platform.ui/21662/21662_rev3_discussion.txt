Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The restore code is not nearly specific enough, it blindly sets the TBR to 'true' for *every* element in *every* trim.

I'll comment further on the defect...

Patch Set 3:

Eric, the real visibility of the toolbar is handled by the visible-when expression so only the toolbars relevant for the perspective are shown.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

I tried this solution and it works, because the toBeRendered flag on the MToolbar was not responsible for perspective specific toolbars. Toolbars and perspectives were never thight coupled, a visible-when condition was always in charge for this functionality.
