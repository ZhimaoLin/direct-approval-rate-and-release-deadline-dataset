DESCRIPTION

Bug 364735 - [Viewers] ViewerComparator violates its general contract

Don't use DecoratingLabelProvider for sorting, see bug 364735 comment
60. The results from this label provider are unstable by design and may
change during the sort operation. Instead, use the original label
provider enclosed by the DecoratingLabelProvider.

A new system property is introduced to restore the old behavior in case
someone relies on the decorations for sorting:
"eclipse.disable.fix.for.bug364735". If this system property is set to
"true", this fix will be disabled.
