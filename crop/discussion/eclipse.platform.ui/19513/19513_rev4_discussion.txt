I'm -1 to this patch, as is, as it will change the behaviour for any composite-based widget providing a gradient and could lead to UI appearance differences.

But isn't the real problem here that CSSPropertyBackgroundSWTHandler doesn't have special-case code for CTabFolder, and really should have some of the special-case code as in CSSPropertyUnselectedTabsSWTHandler?

Line:178, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/GradientBackgroundListener.java -> I'd much rather we limit this to CTabFolder than Composite in general since this patch will otherwise change the effect of any existing uses of CSS.
