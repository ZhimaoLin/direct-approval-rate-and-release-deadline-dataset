Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

We could get rid of the PackageAdmin use too, since it also requires the compat.state bundle.  It's only used by WorkLeon OchoachSWTActivator#getBundleForName() which is never called.

Patch Set 1:

We could get rid of PackageAdmin in some other bug, but I've checked with Tom and it does not use compat.state so it won't cause a problem here.
