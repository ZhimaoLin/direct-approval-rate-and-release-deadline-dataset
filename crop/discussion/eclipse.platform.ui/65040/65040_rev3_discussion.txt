DESCRIPTION

Bug 409633 - Lock the toolbars command not working 

Implemented setLockLayout(boolean) to toggle the "locked" status of the
toolbars. 
The status is changed by adding/removing the IPresentationEngine.NO_MOVE
tag to all the MToolBar of the window, not tagged as TOOLBAR_SEPARATOR.
The "locked" status is persisted across restarts.

I'm somewhat torn here.  Having a rendering object make a change to the model tags doesn't seem right. It would seem to me that you should look at the callers of CSSRenderingUtils#frameMeIfPossible(), which installs the drag handles, and figure out how their logic should change for determining if the drag handles should be installed.

If you continue with this approach, this code won't be adequate as it also needs to deal with additions and removals from the toolbar.

Line:531, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> So from a readability perspectiveâ€¦ deliberately having two loops implies that there's something different about the two loops. If you combine them into one loop with the logic inside.

I looked at the callers of I looked at the callers of frameMeIfPossible(), which is called only in createWidget().
I would proceed fixing this way, so the lock toolbars start working.
Then, I will add a second bug, to display/hide the drag handle.

Line:531, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> Done
