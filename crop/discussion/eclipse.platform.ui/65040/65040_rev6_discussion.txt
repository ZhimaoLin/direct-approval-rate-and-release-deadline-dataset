DESCRIPTION

Bug 409633 - Lock the toolbars command not working

Re-implemented the LockToolBarHandler, by setting the values of
IPresentationEngine.NO_MOVE and IPresentationEngine.DRAGGABLE, and then
forcing the call of ToolBarManagerRenderer#createWidgeg(), followed by
the call of CSSRenderingUtils#frameMeIfPossible.

I checked how to reuse the #frameMeIfPossible, as suggested by Brian. The code looks good enough to be submitted. I already verified the feature works as expected.
