DESCRIPTION

Bug 409633 - Lock the toolbars command not working 

Implemented setLockLayout(boolean) to toggle the "locked" status of the
toolbars. 
The status is changed by adding/removing the IPresentationEngine.NO_MOVE
tag to all the MToolBar of the window, not tagged as TOOLBAR_SEPARATOR.
The "locked" status is persisted across restarts.
