Line:48, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ViewerTestCase.java -> This should be a static and reduced to this:
System.getProperty("org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.version", "").startsWith("3."); //$NON-NLS-1$//$NON-NLS-2$//$NON-NLS-3$

Line:51, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ViewerTestCase.java -> I would test against "3." to avoid matching e.g. 30.

File Comment: tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ListViewerRefreshTest.java -> Same comments as for the other file.

Moved the code to check for GTK3 to testcase setup. the system property is not always available when the static block gets executed.

When I run individual test cases static block works but when I run the whole suite static block doesnot work so had ti use this approach
