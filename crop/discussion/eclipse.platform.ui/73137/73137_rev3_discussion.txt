I'm running those tests locally to validate that change.

Line:79, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ListViewerRefreshTest.java -> Can we use Junit4's Assume.assumeThat(!disableTestBug493357, message) here? It would mark bug as skipped on this environment rather than successful?

Argh! I've hit the wrong button to "submit" my comment. Sorry. 

Mickael, hope you like the patch. Otherwise we have to revert it again.

Line:79, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ListViewerRefreshTest.java -> I'd prefer not to. The tests aren't JUnit 4 tests yet and I don't want to add more code/complexity in RC2.

Yes, the code looks ok and not much error-prone.
I'm run the tests anyway with/without patch with GTK2/GTK3 and will ping you ASAP if tests are still failing for me with the patch on GTK3.
