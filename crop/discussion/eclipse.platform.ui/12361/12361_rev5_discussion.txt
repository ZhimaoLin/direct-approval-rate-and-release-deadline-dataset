The patch is good, except that it does not use the advice given in my first review:

Regarding the code: I would remove 'enableMainMenu' and instead put the menu into 'mainMenu' if we disable it. We can then use that variable to enable it again:
if (mainMenu != null) {
mainMenu.setEnabled(true);
}

I would still recommend to do this before submitting.
