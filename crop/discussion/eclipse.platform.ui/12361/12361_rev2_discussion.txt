Patch Set 2: Fails; Do not submit

The code does not block the keyboard and hence I can e.g. press Ctrl+F4 do close the editor while work on it is performed. I suggest to take a look at the 3.x code which does disable the keyboard. The perspective switcher is also not disabled.

Regarding the code: I would remove 'enableMainMenu' and instead put the menu into 'mainMenu' if we disable it. We can then use that variable to enable it again:
if (mainMenu != null) {
    mainMenu.setEnabled(true);
}

From the 2 patches, I think the second looks better.
