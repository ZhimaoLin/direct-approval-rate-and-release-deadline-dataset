Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This patch doesn't do much except stop the crash. If I close the editor area then dragging the last stack out of the perspective leaves me in a state where:

- I can't drag the stack back into the main window (nothing to split against)
- I can't reset the perspective

I'm trying to rig up a proper fix that prevents the drag that will get us into trouble...

I was trying to fix it in the following way:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/commit/?id=85badafae0721c8c6ad9e5416f408a802222fcc9

but there is some issue with this approach, see #Comment 18

thanks,
Daniel
