Sorry for the late review.

Line:17, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/build.properties -> This file doesn't exist.

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> .core.runtime shouldn't be here

Line:7, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/bindings/keys/IKeyBindingInterceptor.java -> "for a contribution" (no "an")
xxx@xxx.xxx KeyBindingDispatcher}

Line:21, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/bindings/keys/IKeyBindingInterceptor.java -> Called when a keybinding has been successfully matched to a command and should be dispatched.

Line:27, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/bindings/keys/IKeyBindingInterceptor.java -> - xxx@xxx.xxx true}

Maybe:

@return {@code true} if this interceptor has handled the command dispatch, and the xxx@xxx.xxx KeyBindingDispatch} should not execute the command.

Line:37, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/bindings/keys/IKeyBindingInterceptor.java -> Generally no periods since these aren't sentences.

Line:41, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/bindings/keys/IKeyBindingInterceptor.java -> It's better to spell these out explicitly: xxx@xxx.xxx true} if the command is actually defined

Line:43, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.bindings/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/bindings/keys/IKeyBindingInterceptor.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx true} if the command was actually handle

I was actually thinking more about this and ended up doing a version which only uses the IExecutionListener (and throws a non-checked exception in preExecute). While the end result is not final, it gets the work done for now (and works for any action, even coming from the menu)...

So, maybe an option would be allowing IExecutionListener.preExecute to actually throw a checked exception (or create another interface for IExecutionListener which would do a checked pre-execute which could be intercepted).

Anyways, right now is too late for actual changes, so, for now I'll withdraw this patch and work on getting the plugin onto the marketplace so that it can be worked more and hopefully included in 4.7.
