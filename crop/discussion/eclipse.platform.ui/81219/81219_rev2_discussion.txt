Patch Set 2:

@Brian: the new patch set should address all your concerns, except that for legacy, the "Other projects" working set is still off by default. Keeping it off can allow to consider inclusion in Neon.2.

Looks good. Are you sure exposing the Other Projects is a problem for Neon.2 (since we're introducing a new menu item).  Maybe a question for the PMC.

Patch Set 2:

I understand that whatever changes the default behavior (when this behavior is not a bug) requires more negociation for getting into a maintenance release. Here, I have the impression that first getting this in Oxygen, then in parallel negociating for having it in Neon.2 and enabling it by default in Oxygen (via a next patch set), then negociating to have it default in Neon.2 will be the most efficient approach.
