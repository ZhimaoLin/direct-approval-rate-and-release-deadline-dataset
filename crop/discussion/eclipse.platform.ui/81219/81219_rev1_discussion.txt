Thanks for tackling this Mickael and sorry for the delay in reviewing.  My only real comments:

I think we should align the text used to match the Package Explorer: so 'Other Projects', rather than 'Other'.

I think the different placement of Other, as compared to the Package Explorer, makes sense: the user has chosen to emphasize working sets, so projects that aren't in a working set are different.  But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.

I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this ("â€¦and show remaining projects in ") looks rather bizarre.  And I can't really think of a reason why you would to remove any other projects from view: the 'Other' is easy to ignore, and it helps to discover if there are projects that aren't included in other working sets (which happens to me periodically).

Line:28, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/WorkingSetSorter.java -> Maybe a comment to note this ensures OTHERS is sorted to the end?

Line:163, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/WorkingSetsContentProvider.java -> stray 't' in "not": "there's *no* content'
