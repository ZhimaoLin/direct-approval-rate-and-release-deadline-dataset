Line:1204, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.xml -> This isn't correct style!  Please look at the other bindings for examples.  And please unbind this for Cocoa and Carbon, which already has an existing binding.

Line:1204, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.xml -> Brian. Ok for the style, I'll push a separate change using M3 instead of ALT. Do you have suggestions for binding this to Cocoa and Carbon?
(I'll copy this question to the bug)

I think there is already a bindign for Mac. So you only have to define a keybinding for Linux / Windows
