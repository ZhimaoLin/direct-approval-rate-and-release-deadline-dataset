Line:194, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/engine/AbstractCSSSWTEngineImpl.java -> So this redraw() should only ever have applied to Tree widgets?

The original version of the patch gives better abstraction and when we want to add the support for the new Widget, all what we will have to do is updating the 'needsRefreshListeners' method appropriately.

I think we should consider the current patch as a temporary workaround for the flicking issue during redrawing of the Widget and file the proper SWT bug for it. We as one of the the SWT consumers shouldn't take care about flicking during redrawing. In my opinion it is the SWT component responsibility. In order to eliminate the flicking they can reimplement the redraw method and use double buffering. It should be easy to implement, especially on the Windows 32 platform using the BitBlt method (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/dd183370%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)

For sure the GTK as well as the Cocoa provide their version of the BitBlt function
