Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

I suggest to change the parameter of the private method. Line 1320. Line 989 is more a question and the rest is a suggestion for a follow up Gerrit clean-up as we want to focus on the fix of the generic warnings.

Line:989, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/WizardDialog.java -> Javadoc says element type is Boolean

Line:1007, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/WizardDialog.java -> Is state the same Map as in restoreEnableState(Control w, Map<String,?> h, String key)? If, maybe allign the variable names.

Line:1082, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/WizardDialog.java -> Is state the same Map as in restoreEnableState(Control w, Map<String,?> h, String key)? If, maybe allign the variable names.

Line:1103, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/WizardDialog.java -> Same comment as above. If the Map is the same, I suggest to align the variable names, maybe in a follow up Gerrit review as this is about the Generics.

Line:1320, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/WizardDialog.java -> Private method, should be save to change the parameter from Object to Map<>

Line:90, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/WizardSelectionPage.java -> Candidate for conversion to enhanced for loop.
