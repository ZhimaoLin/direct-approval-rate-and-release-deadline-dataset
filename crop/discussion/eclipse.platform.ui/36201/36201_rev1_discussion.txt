Thanks for the patch. I have one clarification question.

Line:448, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarManagerRenderer.java -> How is this related to the memory leak of the part?

Patch Set 1:

You can take a look at CompatibilityView.java, lines 168-208. The code creates runnable that has to be called when disposing a toolbar.
ViewActionBuilder.dispose() is called in this case.
BTW
I think this patch will also fix some more memory leaks related to disposing toolbars.
