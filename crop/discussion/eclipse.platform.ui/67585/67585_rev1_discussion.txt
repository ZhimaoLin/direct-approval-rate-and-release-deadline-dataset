As a fix for 4.5.x this looks ok (I can only quote on the code not if it still does what the original one supposed to do) - but I question why this method is in the e4 layer if it only deals with CompatView, so I think org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach is the correct code to the handleNullRefPlaceHolders(), not?
