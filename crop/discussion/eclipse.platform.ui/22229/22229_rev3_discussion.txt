I get the following exception using the patch:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: A theme with the id 'org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_classic6.1' is already registered

We need another patch that deletes themes in the 'platform/eclipse.platform' repo

Let me add Paul as 2nd reviewer for the patch,

Works fine for me. However I would modify the order of the CSS themes in the combo. Currently I have: Dark Theme, Classic and Windows *. Maybe would be better to have the alphabetic order. What do you think?

Alphabetic sounds like for me, I updated the Gerrit review
