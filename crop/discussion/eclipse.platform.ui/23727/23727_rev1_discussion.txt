Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

The Patch Set 1 fixed the issue for a provided test project (See Bug #392876). 

It'll take much more time to check it on our real project (it's a pretty long time issue), but I'd like this fix to be merged.

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/menus/MenuAdditionCacheEntry.java -> Yes, I've seen it, but it returns incorrect value - for dyminac we get 'false'. Let me investigate it deeper

Line:829, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/MenuManager.java -> This part removes the duplicated separators. Maybe the cause of duplications is connected to the Bug 385565
