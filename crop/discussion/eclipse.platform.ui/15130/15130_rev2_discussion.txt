Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

See detailed comments + I see some trailing whitespace, which I suggest you remove.

Line:45, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ComboViewerGenericsTest.java -> Main? Why not running a test, e.g. xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:52, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/ComboViewerGenericsTest.java -> TODO?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Fix typo and explain why you add these tests (reference to Bug for update)

Line:52, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/CComboViewerGenericsTest.java -> I don't get this TODO

Patch Set 2:

I suggest to update the original tests and not add new tests. At runtime the generics are erased hence if the generified test works, it works also without generics.

Abandoned

instead of new testcases the original tests should be updated.
