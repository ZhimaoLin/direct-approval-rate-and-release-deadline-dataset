Patch Set 2:

Hi Dani, in this approach I get the current icon directly from SWT controls. I think this is the simplest way to fix this bug in 4.2.2+.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review-1

The fix is good, but for safety reasons we should keep the original constructor (just in case).

I would add a variable for items[i] in #findItemForPart, but that's a question of taste.
