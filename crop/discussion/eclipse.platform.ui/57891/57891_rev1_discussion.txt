Stefan ask me for feedback on this. I find it hard to judge, I have not seen the deadlocks in real life which Stefan reports.

Patch Set 1:

Not deadlocks -- crash-to-desktop. :-)

They're fairly easy to reproduce if you have a way to invoke Display.asyncExec before WorkLeon Ochoach.runUI gets invoked (which admittedly I haven't yet figured out how to do in a simple test case).

A runnable containing this single line will cause a crash:

PlatformUI.getWorkLeon Ochoach().getAdapter(ICommandService.class)

...but accessing any workLeon Ochoach service should also do the trick. Bug 178875 discusses the same problem in more depth.

I could ask Sergey for a review if you prefer.
