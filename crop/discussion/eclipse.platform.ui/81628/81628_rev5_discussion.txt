DESCRIPTION

Bug 501918 - Remove dependency org.eclipse.osgi from o.e.e4.ui.services

Added service reference to EventAdmin in EventBrokerFactory to ensure
that it only gets activated if an EventAdmin service is available.
Therefore removed the Activator and the error logging statements
completely. Also removed the static init code in EventBroker that should
start the bundle org.eclipse.equinox.event manually.

The changes in general look good to me - the only draw back is that if event-admin is missing we get no feedback log messages but i think this OK

Line:34, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.services/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/services/events/EventBrokerFactory.java -> is storing this field really mandatory? I don't think this is needed right?

Thanks for the feedback. I will remove the field.

With regards to the missing log statements, actually there will be injection errors for EventBroker as there won't be any without an EventAdmin available.
