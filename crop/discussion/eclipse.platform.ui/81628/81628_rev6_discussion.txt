DESCRIPTION

Bug 501918 - Remove dependency org.eclipse.osgi from o.e.e4.ui.services

Added service reference to EventAdmin in EventBrokerFactory to ensure
that it only gets activated if an EventAdmin service is available.
Therefore removed the Activator and the error logging statements
completely. Also removed the static init code in EventBroker that should
start the bundle org.eclipse.equinox.event manually.
