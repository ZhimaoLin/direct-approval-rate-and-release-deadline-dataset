DESCRIPTION

Bug 441877 - Include all test suites in org.eclipse.ui.tests in the
Tycho test scope

This runs the JFace and UiTestSuite via Maven. I get several failures, 5
of them I can also reproduce by runnnig the UitestSuite manually but
JFace shows 6 additional errors. Will investigate via a separate bug.
