DESCRIPTION

Bug 441877 - Include all test suites in org.eclipse.ui.tests in the
Tycho test scope

This runs the JFace and UiTestSuite via Maven. I get several failures, 5
of them I can also reproduce by runnnig the UitestSuite manually but
JFace shows 6 additional errors. Will investigate via a separate bug.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

This makes the test suite work via Maven. To me it looks like this did not work before, at least the pom.xml was incorrect in several places.
