The build error seems unrelated, I merge this. David, I hope I do not break the build.

ERROR: No artifacts found that match the file pattern "tests/*/target/work/data/.metadata/.log". Configuration error?

ERROR: 'tests/*/target/work/data/.metadata/.log' doesn't match anything: 'tests' exists but not 'tests/*/target/work/data/.metadata/.log'

David, any idea what is wrong with the build?

You ask if I know what's wrong with the build ... I assume you mean the Gerrit build? And, no, I do not know anything about these Gerrit builds. But, if you have a more specific question, I might be able to help more.

Patch Set 3:

The build is reported as failing because no tests were run whereas job expects some. On 4.4 branch tests are disabled, so any contribution for 4.4 branch will provide similar feedback from Hudson. In such case, one need to look at the build log: if it's a change for branch and if it's failing because of "No JUnit reports found", then it's not a blocker to merge the patch.

Thanks Mickael, I think the Gerrit branch is configured that a failing build prevents people from merging.

Patch Set 3:

If you want to merge, you have to first remove the review from Brenden Conley user (hitting the cross beside its name does that). Then you can submit the patch and it will work because there will no longer be a -1 from Hudson.

Thanks Mickael, I see no cross beside the review, I guess I'm missing authorization. Can you please remove the -1 so that I can merge?
