DESCRIPTION

Bug 475941 - View docked along with shared editors are causes
NullPointerException and broken window 

Analysis
It is reproducible only if you try to dock any view that is outside of
any perspective into editor area.
It was observed that relTo is passed to
EModelService.insert(MPartSashContainerElement toInsert,
MPartSashContainerElement relTo, int where, float ratio), but
relTo.getParent() return null. 

Solution:
Add support for the case when relTo element is located in the UI but not
in an MPerspective.
