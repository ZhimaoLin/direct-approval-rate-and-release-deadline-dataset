Patch Set 3: -Code-Review

With some more thought, I think this approach can work.  We can modify ResourceAndGroupContainer to make the folder-path area optional.

Will review your changes tonight.

Patch Set 3:

I have tried to remove containerGroup from ResourceAndContainerGroup, but that causes the change of the WizardNewFileCreationPage.getContainerFullPath() method. Since the container doesn't exist anymore, I am not sure what to do with this method.

Line:898, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardNewFileCreationPage.java -> You can reproduce it in the following way:

- enter an invalid file name ("/", for instance)
- click the Advanced button

You will get the "Unhandled event loop exception" exception.
