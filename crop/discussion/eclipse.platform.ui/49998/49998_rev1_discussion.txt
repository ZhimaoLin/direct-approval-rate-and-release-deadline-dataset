Patch Set 1:

Should that review have been marked as WIP? The functionality to zoom is still missing AFAICS.

Patch Set 1:

The handler to actually zoom will be contributed to another review, since it has to be implemented in the eclipse.platform.text repository. Both reviews are/will be meant to be reviewed together, so yes, until the other review is ready, let's just leave that one as it.

Can you use png files instead of gif files?

Patch Set 1:

The icons are the one that are in the GMF project, and only exist in gif so far. I don't have enough skills in icon edition to turn them into png.

Patch Set 1:

The binding for zoomOut seems to be conflicting with the one from GEF, but I believe the Platform command should take precedence over GEF.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Gerrit review https://git.eclipse.org/r/50042 shows how these commands and bindings can be used to enable Zoom In/Out on text editors. I believe this validates this patch.
