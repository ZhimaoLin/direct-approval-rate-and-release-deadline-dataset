Patch Set 1:

Strange, I used the same change-id as in the original contribution from Jonas, but it seems the change-id in the commit message is not the same as in the patch itself.

Nevertheless, I took the abstract class from Jonas and applied the changes and modifications that happened since the contribution manually. 

@Jonas
Could you please verify that I didn't miss anything.
