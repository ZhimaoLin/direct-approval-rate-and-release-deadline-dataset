DESCRIPTION

Bug 481604 - ExpandableComposite with NO_TITLE flag - size calculations

- fixed title bar height calculation between size of textLabel,
textClient and toggle
- same calculation applied in layout (there is another bug in layout
that it did not take into account toggle size)
- also sync conditions for margin calculation between computeSize and
layout when client is null
- fixed issue where computeSize were returning 3 pixel more than it
should (clientVerticalSpacing when not expanded)
- added junit tests for ExpandableComposite
