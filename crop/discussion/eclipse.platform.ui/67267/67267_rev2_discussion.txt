After cherry-picking this change onto an older Eclipse version which I am using as target platform, NPEs occured as mainMenu was already null when WorkLeon OchoachWindow.tearDown was called (see comment). I didn't check whether this happens with the current version.

Line:796, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> Missing null check for mainMenu can lead to NPE when closing

The System.out.println need to be removed, and Bernhard report about a NPE need to be addressed. Also, it would be nice to have a test case that reproduce the potential NPE.

I've rebased to fix the merge conflict and fixed the possible NPE + unconditional system.out.printf calls.

Feedback is welcome. Please also check related patches: https://git.eclipse.org/r/82956/ and https://git.eclipse.org/r/89545/
