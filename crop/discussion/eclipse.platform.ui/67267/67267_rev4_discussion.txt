Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

I've changed the sys.out code to use the logger and rebased two other patches on this one, so that we can see the results. If you wonder you don't see the output in the console, bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511268 is your friend.

This patch alone is good but not good enough, the next one (https://git.eclipse.org/r/89545/) helps too (just invoke the context menu few times on a file in Package Explorer view to see the difference), and the for the last one (https://git.eclipse.org/r/82956) I'm not sure yet.
