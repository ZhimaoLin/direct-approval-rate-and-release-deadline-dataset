Patch Set 3:

saveState is never called in DIEditorPart...

With latest patch I can use IPersistable.saveState() in DIEditorPart.

Seeing the wrapped Part never gets sent the memento to load, I used a dummy XML Memento.  If we are ok with this, I can implement a dummy memento class and avoid the overhead of the XML document.

Patch Set 3:

@Paul, can you please confirm that org.eclipse.ui.IPersistable.saveState() will not be called on the wrapped Part until this patch is merged, and that this is the proper way to invoke that method.

I have a patch that was merged in another project (implemented per your suggestion of using saveState instead of invoking @PersistState); It seems to not get called because of this issue.  It looks like @Persist was implemented but xxx@xxx.xxx in CompatibilityPart.java

I think I might have misunderstood the goal, so I'll dig deeper into this and get back tomorrow.
