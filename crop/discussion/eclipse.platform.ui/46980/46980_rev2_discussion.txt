DESCRIPTION

Bug 461573 - Views not updating properly since 4.4.2

Reverted changes from commit b339bc95e9a0be803042e3491c00564848e7505b
(bug 416650 comment 65), which aimed to impove performance of tab
switching. The reverted commit caused view descriptions of hidden views
disappear after resizing the part stack.

This fix replaces original call to ctiComp.layout(true/*changed*/,
true/*all*/) to ctiComp.layout(false/*changed*/, true/*all*/) to avoid
performance issues described in bug 416650 but still maintaining proper
layout of stack children.
