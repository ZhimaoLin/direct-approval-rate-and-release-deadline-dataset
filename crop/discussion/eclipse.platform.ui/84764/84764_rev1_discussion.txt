alternation)

Adding additional methods to determine if platform is themed or
not. Using this we can have a custom way of deciding to use alternating
progressInfoItems colors.

Line:678, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbench.java -> We should avoid creating new API, if not necessary.

Line:3756, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> I suggest to put this into ProgressInfoItem as private method as long as we see only one caller.

Originally I was going to do this as a private method, but I figured it would be more useful in the workLeon Ochoach as it seems more intuitive to check custom theme flags in a workbench. In addition, I figured it might be useful for other developers to use if it related to your workbench being themed. What do you think?

>  What do you think?

Lets start with a private method. So far the CSS engine is completely internal API and for 4.7 IMHO this should not change. I recently looked the the CSS engine code and was surprised how complex it is. I think we should first rework this code before creating API.
