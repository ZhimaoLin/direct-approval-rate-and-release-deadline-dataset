Line:249, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/list/ComputedList.java -> I moved that code, because that was also done for the ComputedSet by Bug 414297. By looking at the code, the described behavior can also occur for a ComputedList.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

Computing the diffs eagerly means that if a computed list depends on N inputs that all change at once, it will recompute the list N times.

In the very common case where a list of N elements is computed from N input observables, this reduces a typical update time (in the case where all inputs changed) from O(n) to O(n^2).

To handle cross-realm bindings efficiently, the observables in one realm should copy their state asynchronously to an observable in another realm, and the code that accesses each observable should be allowed to assume that the observable is in the same realm as the caller.

This eliminates the need for eager updates or excessive synchronization.

Abandoned

Eager calculation of diffs unwanted (see bug comments).
