I'm sorry, just seen that there are disabled tests for that. 

Please can you activate disabled editor tests in org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest?

Just check callers of showEditor/hideEditor() methods and make sure tests are green again :-)

Paul, do you still remember what the story behind the unimplemented methods were? I'm surprised that we were allowed to leave them out, maybe the team decided not to support them?

See inline comment.  It doesn't implement the API javadoc correctly.

Line:4559, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> If an editor was hidden, it's not longer available from getEditorReferences().  See the javadoc for org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPage.hideEditor(IEditorReference)

Is this for loop really necessary? We could also check: if(ref instanceof EditorReference) and directly execute activate(((EditorReference) ref).getPart(true));
