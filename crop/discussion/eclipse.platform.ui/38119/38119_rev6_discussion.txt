Patch Set 6:

Thanks for the review. My comments/answers are prefixed with "**"

 Done:
* We don't want fancy/new names like "nastor" in the code or UI. It looks like a product or brand name. Please replace it everywhere with e.g. "nesting" or "nested", and move the classes into the 'org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.workLeon Ochoach' package.
* "and others" in the copyright needs a dot
* the content provider should not contain "show" in the name, just "Nested Projects"
* Project Presentation: the label needs mnemonic - suggest to use 'r'
* Project Presetion - the sub-menu labels also need mnemonic ('F' and 'P')
** -> I used 'F' and 'H'

 Still TODOs with questions/comments:

 * Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation  -> The 'label' group is contributed programatically by JDT UI. It's not easy to depend on it. 
* Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.
* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.
I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.
** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection?

 * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.
** -> What do you mean by "filtering directly in the content provider". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example?

 * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.
** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario.

 * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.
** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini.

 Other TODOs:
* The content provider does not have an icon.
