- When you add a new package, you also have to add it to the manifest. I would name the package "nested" not "nesting", since you use the term "nested" at all other places.

- The content provider name should be 'Nested Projects' (uppercase 'p')

- I think you can set the radio state by using HandlerUtil.updateRadioState(event.getCommand(), VALUE); I think there is no API to listen to content provider enablement/disablement in the Customize dialog, but you can update the radio state when the content provider is created, and when it is disposed. Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky. You'd probably have to use code similar to what's in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.CommonFilterSelectionDialog.okPressed().

- I take the filtering change back - let's leave it unconnected. When we disable the Java content, we also keep the Java related filters (not optimal, but that's how it currently is).

- Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation - we can leave this as is since we don't want to introduce a dependency on JDT.

- dialog store vs. preference: if you want to set it via plugin_customization.ini, then I'm OK to use a preference - but not show it in the preferences dialog.
