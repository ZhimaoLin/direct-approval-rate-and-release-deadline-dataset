Patch Set 4: Verified-1 Code-Review-2

I like this new approach of showing nested projects. It already "works", but there are some issues discovered during testing:
- Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.
- The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.
	I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.
- Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.
- The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.
- The content provider does not have an icon.



Here are some initial comments on the code. I did not go into the detail of each method yet:
- We don't want fancy/new names like "nastor" in the code or UI. It looks like a product or brand name. Please replace it everywhere with e.g. "nesting" or "nested", and move the classes into the 'org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.workLeon Ochoach' package.
-The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.
- "and others" in the copyright needs a dot
- the content provider should not contain "show" in the name, just "Nested Projects"
- Project Presentation
	- the label needs mnemonic - suggest to use 'r'
	- it should be in the same group as Package Presentation
	- the sub-menu labels also need mnemonic ('F' and 'P')
