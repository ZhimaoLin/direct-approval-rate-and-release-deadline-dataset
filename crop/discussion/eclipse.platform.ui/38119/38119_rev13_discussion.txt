Patch Set 13:

Comments for patch set 10 are mostly resolved.

The synchronization is done. Cool!

Since the menu action toggles the filters, and we've already synchronized the content provider, we should really just invoke the same code when toggling the content provider. This would fix Case 3 and give a good user experience.

Some other issues I found during testing:

- The selection gets lost when switching Projects Presentation. This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.
- The menu items swap:
	- first time the new menu item is second
	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top
	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible
- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing. Switching back to flat presentation fixes the problem. Looks like an issue with #hasChildren()
