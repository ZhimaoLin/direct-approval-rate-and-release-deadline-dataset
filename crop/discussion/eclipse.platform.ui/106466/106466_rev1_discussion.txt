DESCRIPTION

Bug 525757 - NullPointerException in RetargetAction.partDeactivated

WorkLeon OchoachPage should properly handle cases where resolving the
IWorkLeon OchoachPart from CompatibilityPart.getPart() fails (in case
CompatibilityPart creation was interrupted with some runtime error).

WorkLeon OchoachPage should not propagate "null" events to part listeners and
should report parts which were in inconsistent state so that plugin
developers have a chance to find and fix the broken code.
