DESCRIPTION

Added o.e.u.images.renderer, which provides a maven plugin for rendering
svg files to png in the o.e.u.images bundle build.

The o.e.u.images pom has been modified to execute the renderer's
render-icon goal during the generate-resources phase of the
eclipse-plugin build.

Hi Tony,  I don't think this will work as-is.  But since we check in the PNGs it doesn't have to be part of the building of org.eclipse.ui.images, just available for a developer to use in it.  More comments in the bug.

Totally understandable. I didn't realize the build had an issue because locally I had the maven plugin installed from testing.

I will revise as discussed on the related ticket (#421344).
