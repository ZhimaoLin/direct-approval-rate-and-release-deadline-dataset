Looks, good. I suggest to give the second method a more telling name, e.g. handleContextEvent and to remove the whitespace. Also update the copyright (year, plus Sopot ... Bug XXXXX)

Line:47, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/addons/HandlerProcessingAddon.java -> Whitespace. I suggest to use Eclipse 4.4M5 which solve a bug in JDT which did add this whitespace in Javadoc statements?

From the build error is looks as if EventTopic cannot be accessed. Is this dependency present in MANIFEST.MF?

It is in my eclipse but I forgot to stage the file in the git commit. I'll send over a new patchset.

org.eclipse.e4.core.di.extensions is currently is not part of the dependencies of org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach. 

Maybe you changed that and did not include the MANIFEST.MF into the commit?
