Dani, just in case you did not see my comment to Paul: printItem.setVisible(false); seems not to make a different. I was asking for help what else I should do.

Dani, yes see my comments ;-) The change was suggest by Paul, hence I asked Paul what I did wrong.

> Dani, yes see my comments ;-) 

Well, after your comment on patch set 4 you uploaded a new patch set without any comment that it does not work, so, I spent my time rebasing and verifying it. I then set verified to -1. In contrast to bugzilla, Gerrit did not tell me that a comment had been added in the meantime.

If a discussion continues in another forum, like bugzilla, it would be nice to mention this here.

Agree my communication was not good, sorry for this. 

I'm still looking for advice on this from Paul or someone else.
