DESCRIPTION

Bug 266030: Default working set for project navigator

This introduce in Working Set UI Dialog for Navigator and in
WorkingSetManager a concept of "default working set".
Default Working Set is an existing working set that the user
can decide as the one that will host elements that are not
part of another working set.

A typical configuration is to create a working set "unassigned"
and to use it as the default working set, so it will be a similar
behaviour to what's available in JDT Package Explorer
