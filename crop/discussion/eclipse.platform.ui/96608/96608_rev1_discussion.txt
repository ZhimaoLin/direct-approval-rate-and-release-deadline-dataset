DESCRIPTION

Bug 508819:Define proper API for hover/info color constants(platform.ui)

*As of Patch Set 3, this patch is independent of other patches*

Patch Set 1,2:
- Implementing INFORMATION_ color ID instead of "HOVER_", because
the colors are used in non-hover context.

Patch Set 3:
- Implemented solution with backwards compatibility.
- Introduced INFORMATION_* colors.
- Made old HOVER_* colors not-visible to the user (isEditable=false)

Patch Set 4:
- Moved deprecated note from label into description, and set labels to:
  "Hover * color".
  This way the javadoc colors don't mention deprecation in user
interface, but a developer who looks at the color in the code will
notice the description that links to the proper color. (See attached
screenshot 'javadoc default label').
  AFIK the user now never sees anything 'deprecated' related.

Note:
Once this patch is merged, I will update JDT not to reference HOVER_
anymore.

I can't think of a better solution to deprecating a color and haven't
found other examples to copy from. If someone has alternative
suggestions, please let me know.

Side note, I experimented with 'defaultsTo', but if I use that, then
the deprecated HOVER_color is shown as a child color of INFORMATION_
in user color preference.

I tested that JDT does not break with this change. Javadoc hovers are
present as before.
