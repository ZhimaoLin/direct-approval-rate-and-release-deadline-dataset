Some minor suggestions

Line:300, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet018TableViewerAddRemoveColumnsWithEditing.java -> Also switch to List

Line:40, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet056BooleanCellEditor.java -> Comment potentially incorrect.

Line:42, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet056BooleanCellEditor.java -> Can be removed, Tom is listed about already as author
