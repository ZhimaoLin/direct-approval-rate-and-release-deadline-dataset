Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Patch set restored arrowCursor to protected scope, but keeps accessor methods. It's open to debate if they should be protected or public.

Other platform classes have been kept using accessors instead of member.

Line:448, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressMonitorDialog.java -> Perhaps we can add this in the getter, so getArrowCursor will never return null.

We can look at this at the beginning of Mars.

Line:392, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressMonitorDialog.java -> This should be removed and only leave in setArrowCursor(null) used instead.
