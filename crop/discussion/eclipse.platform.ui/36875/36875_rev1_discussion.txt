Hey, 

5 tests are on error due to l102 in MenuAdditionCacheEntry.java  : 		IWorkLeon Ochoach workbench = application.getContext().get(IWorkbench.class) which returns null 
and 1 is failling testFileToolbarRendered

I'll open a bugzilla for this

But first according to : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433341#c3

maybe they should be integrated in org.eclipse.ui.tests.menus ?

but it seems the org.eclipse.ui.tests are testing the menu in a 3.x context and these one on a 4.x context, and if we do that it should also have been done for the command IMO
