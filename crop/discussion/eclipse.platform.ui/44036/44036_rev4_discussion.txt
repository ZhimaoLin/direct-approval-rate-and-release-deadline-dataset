Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

I was actually trying to avoid the reformatting of all the rest of the code, and realized that (1) the previous comments were lost and should be kept, and (2) the method names could be improved: I prefer method names to indicate the intent rather than their implementation (monitor for changes rather than subscribe for changes).

Thanks for the patch.  I'll rebase and resubmit.
