I think the fix is good, please just swap it for the utility method.

Line:380, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEWorkLeon OchoachWindowAdvisor.java -> This can be replaced with a call to org.eclipse.ui.internal.util.Util.safeString(String).  So Util.safeString(activeEditor.getTitleToolTip())

We tried util method but there was discouraged access warning... Is it OK to ignore?

Yes, it's just because it's internal, but o.e.ui.ide consumes a lot of internals.

I've fixed it at the root.

Peter, thanks for making your first open source contribution. This one turned out to have a more complicated solution but I hope you try again with another fix when you have time!
