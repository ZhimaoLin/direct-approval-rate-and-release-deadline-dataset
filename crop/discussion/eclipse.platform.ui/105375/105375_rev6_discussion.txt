Patch Set 6: Verified-1

- On a clear start
- Close welcome screen
- Make Eclipse not full-screen.
- Open the Ctrl-3

For me the quick access popup extends downwards beyond the height of the window: https://imgur.com/a/EVW0d

Is it supposed to?

@Sopot: same for me here. I'm not sure how important it is though. I'll try to have a look at whether we can easily keep the popup in the root shell.

Patch Set 6:

I've spent more time on the code, and there is so much code that's copy-pasted to "constrain" the size that I don't feel confident in changing one of those methods.
If it's fine with you, I suggest to merge this patch since the behavior you describe isn't a big and probable issue and seems minor compared to the usability issue of a short popup, and we can track the height surplus in a separate issue.
