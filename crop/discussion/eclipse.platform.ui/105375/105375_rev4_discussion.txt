xxx@xxx.xxx does that look fine to you? Should I merge it now?

No. I've just tried this, the popup is still unusable small size.

Currently we have this: 

Math.min(300, (int) (shellBounds.width * 0.6))
int height = dialogHeight == -1 ? Math.min(200, (int) (shellBounds.height * 0.9)) : dialogHeight;

In my case the result is always 300 x 200. I don't see any improvement  with this numbers. I would expect 600 x 400 *at least*, given the fact that the opened window is 1024 x 768.
