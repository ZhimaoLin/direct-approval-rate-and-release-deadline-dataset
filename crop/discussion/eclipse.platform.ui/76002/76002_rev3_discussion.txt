Patch Set 3:

Thanks Patrik. In platform UI we typically do not merge changes of other committers.

So if I give +1 or +2 on a change, I mean "I'm OK with the change to be merged". We typical leave it to the committer to merge, once he thinks the change is ready.

Also reviews for "trivial" changes is usually not necessary.
