DESCRIPTION

Bug 525764 - Inconsistent implementation of
org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.dom.WidgetElement.reset()

If subclasses of WidgetElement override reset() method, they should:
 - first cleanup their own state
 - after that call super.reset()

Thanks Lars for the review, I was going to add few other committers involved in the related code to the review. I'm not yet sure if the change can be merged, I see too many issues while switching themes on Linux and I'm trying to understand if this change making things better or worse.

So please do not merge yet, even if it looks OK.

Informal policy of platform is that we do not merge on behalf other committers.

Patch Set 1:

Some observations: I've tried to enforce "errors" by opening some known to be "problematic" parts for CSS theme changes, and changed the themes back and forth from Light to Dark and Classic.

So far it works without errors in the log (a release ago this was impossible!) and I see that the proposed change fixes "black" tables background in plugin editor "Dependencies", "Extensions" and "Build" tabs.

Without the patch, once switched to the "Dark" mode, the tables were always rendered black, independently how often one switches to the "Light" or "Classic". I've tested on Windows and a bit on Linux, I believe on Linux we have much more artifacts left, but this is if I remember right due known SWT GTK3 issues with Section headers, which aren't rendered properly anyway.

I had opened: plugin manifest editor, plugin schema editor, Git staging view, tabbed properties view, problems view, OSGI console view, and project explorer view. In the opened multipage editors I've clicked through all tabs and in the manifest editor "Dependencies" tab I've expanded/collapsed the two sections on the bottom.  

It would be cool if the reviewers could spent some time reviewing proposed change, because I'm honestly not a CSS expert here and the change could introduce some subtle regressions I can't find with my smoke test above.

The TabbedProperty*-stuff looks fine for me. I cannot comment on the rest.
