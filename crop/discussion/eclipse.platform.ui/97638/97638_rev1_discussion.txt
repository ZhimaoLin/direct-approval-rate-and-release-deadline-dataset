I can still get the outdated menu, e.g. with these steps:
Start new workspace
Close Welcome page
Window > New Window
In the new window: Window > Appearance > Hide Status Bar
In the first window: Window > Appearance > Hide Status Bar
In the first window: Window > Appearance
==> BUG: The menu says "Hide Status Bar"


The initialize code should be in a separate method, i.e.
if (eventHandler == null) {
    initializeEventHandler(window);
}
