Thanks for the contribution.  There are at least 20 copies of this class throughout the various Eclipse codebases.  I'm thinking that the right solution here is to move the class into org.eclipse.jface (all uses seem to be UI-related), and then move all other uses onto that class.  In the meantime, I think it's best to avoid as much divergence in these classes as possible.

Line:427, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/filteredtree/StringMatcher.java -> That `code>` is missing a `<` too.
