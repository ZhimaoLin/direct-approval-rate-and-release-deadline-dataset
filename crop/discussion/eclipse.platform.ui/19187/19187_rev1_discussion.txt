I think the message is good on the constant.  We wouldn't put it on the run/runWithEven methods.

Why not? It was the method I looked at first when being confused (in which cases is run called?). IMO the whole platform could Leon Ochoaefit from a bit more than just the bare minimum of documentation.

I agree with both of you :-). On one hand duplicating the whole text is overkill and painful to maintain. On the other hand, it is unexpected that the action is run for unchecked items and hence I think it's fine to document it in those two methods. I would suggest to add this to the methods:

@see #AS_RADIO_BUTTON How radio buttons are handled

Line:82, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/IAction.java -> This is a bit too wordy for me and does not include runWith.

How about:
<strong>Note:</strong> When a radio button gets selected it will also run the unselected radio button action. Use xxx@xxx.xxx #isChecked} to determine the selection state.

Thanks Dani :). Done. I also added a similar note to AS_CHECK_BOX and rebased.

Line:82, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/IAction.java -> Thanks, done.
