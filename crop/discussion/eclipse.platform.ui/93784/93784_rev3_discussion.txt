@Stefan: with big workspace, is this blocking the UI Thread ?

Patch Set 3:

No, the expensive work is done in a separate Job which applies the precalculated filter after it is finished calculating. It does not block the UI thread. It just takes a while until the actually filtered result is shown. 
I have added a "busy" icon next to the text field which is shown as long as the background job calculates the result.
