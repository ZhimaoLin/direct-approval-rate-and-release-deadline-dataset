Patch Set 5:

Hi, I have modified the code in the following ways for patchset 5:
- added test cases for general case and ProjectExplorer
- made Find toolbar action a CHECK action which is checked if the filter field is active
- reworked filtering: in general, tree is not pruned by class
- tree is pruned for ProjectExplorer to leave out all JDT details, because this would make the filtering INCREDIBLY slow
- ProjectExplorer filter now working no matter if projects or working sets are top level nodes.
