It's correct, but please attach a patch that has only the real changes and not whitespace/formatting changes. That makes reviewing much easier, especially when just before M5 and being very busy.

Patch Set 3:

The reformating is triggered by the save actions on the plug-in which on save Formats the edited lines. If I only edit the line with "png" it pulls the lines to the beginning. Looks like a formatting bug in JDT to me. I turn of format on save and redo the change.
