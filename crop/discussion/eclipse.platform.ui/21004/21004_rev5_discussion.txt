Thanks Lars!

Using Save Actions is fine for committers but when providing a concrete patch it is wrong to use them. The current code base isn't formatted everywhere as specified by the settings, hence you'll always get noise that wastes time of the reviewer.

Hint: Instead of disabling Save Action, you can simply hit Ctrl+Z  (Undo). This will undo the Save Action changes and leave you in the saved state.
