Line:70, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/internal/databinding/swt/DateTimeSelectionProperty.java -> May be would be better log this situation to analyze reports with log in future. I think it help to understand, does it part of code should be remove if we will see this log very often

See reply to comment.

Line:70, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/internal/databinding/swt/DateTimeSelectionProperty.java -> Sorry to say that I do not completely understand your comment. I guess you want to suggest to use a Logger, which logs a warning or debug note, here, right?
I was also wondering whether I should add a Logger by using 			
Policy.getLog().log(new Status(IStatus.INFO, Policy.JFACE_DATABINDING, IStatus.OK,"Cannot set null selection on DateTime", null)); //$NON-NLS-1$

But this would lead to a lot of messages in the log, since I use the pattern with the placeholder described in the bug report very often.

IMHO using this placeholder pattern is a common and useful use case.

Looks good to me, only the test method must be renamed

Line:35, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/internal/databinding/swt/DateTimeSelectionPropertyTest.java -> Please rename the test to the new behavior.
