Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

If I enter Views I see Ant and Bookmarks. If I enter Views: I see no results. I think we should also use the category filter after a ":" has been specified and if a category: is specified show all entries for this category. For example View: should show all results "View:B" only views starting with "B"
