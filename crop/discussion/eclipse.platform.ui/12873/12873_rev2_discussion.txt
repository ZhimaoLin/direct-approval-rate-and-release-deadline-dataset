Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Daniel, my bad but this is really an SWT defect. The old CTabFolder did this automatically if a) there was no explicit ttip defined and the label was trunctated...

I'll move the defect over to the SWT team.

Thanks in any case...

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

As says the previous comment, it is the SWT bug and we are not going to fix it on our site
