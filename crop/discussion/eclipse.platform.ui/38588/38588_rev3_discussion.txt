DESCRIPTION

Bug 455785 - [CommonNavigator] CommonViewerSorter should use sortOnly
sorters when content is provided by different navigator contents

No longer check for trigger points in CommonViewerSorter when content is
provided by different contents so that sortOnly sorters are taken into
account when sorting.
