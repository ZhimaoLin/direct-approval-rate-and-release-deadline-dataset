DESCRIPTION

Bug 466413 - Buttons stop working in Import wizard after an invalid location is specified

Cache the last path checked to avoid (hopefully) unnecessary disk
checks.  Refresh and other triggers still force a check.

Patch looks good. 

Fixes the behavior described in the bug but if there is still focus on one of the text widgets (you don't press enter before clicking anywhere) it always inhibits the first click. This would have to be fixed post 4.5.
