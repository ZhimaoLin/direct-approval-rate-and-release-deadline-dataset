Does this need to be GTK-specific?  Isn't it "Use window system settings"?

This isn't sufficient to override the JFace-level editor and color settings though.  Would it make sense for this theme to override the prefs with the OS-provided colors via SWT.COLOR_*{FORE,BACK}GROUND?

Line:106, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.xml -> Why isn't this 'ws="gtk"'?

Abandoning as approach changed. See subsequent gerrit review in the bug.
