Nice idea. Maybe you should replace the technical names (win32, gtk, macoc) with something more user orientated?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

To keep backward compatibility and existing preferences, I'm not sure we can change the themeId.
What I suggest instead would be that the default theme for the current OS keeps the id and label as it (without os qualifier), and that only other OS variants should be qualified. Or to have a system of alias that would resolve a theme id to the current OS variants if theme has multiple ones.

This is what is done with this patch. Only themes that were previously not available will have their ids appended with it's origin os. This makes it backwards compatible excluding the scenario where a user changes a workspace to a new theme and then downgrades to an older version of Eclipse.

Ok, got it, thanks for clarifying.
I've suggested a few changes about code style. Feel free to pick the ones you like and drop the ones you dislike. Then I'll merge your change.
