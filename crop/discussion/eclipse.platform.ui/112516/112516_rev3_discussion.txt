Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

(1 comment)

Looks good to me, and I'd be ok to merge.
However, I just thought about multiple versions of the same OS (Win XP, Win 7...) or same OS with different WS. This is supported by the theme I believe, should we also try to support it here?
Note that I think this patch can be IMO merged as it, and then we can discuss on the bug how much we want to continue this effort (ie are we all satisfied with the current patch, or do we want to try to support other flavours)
