this all looks quite good (I haven't gone over the optimizations in detail though). My only real concern is that you've moved the code from 'findElementsRecursive' directly into the selector based API.

I'd prefer to leave the base logic as an internal method rather than API in case we need to modify its signature in the future...

Line:140, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelServiceImpl.java -> Why are you removing this method ? We may want to re-use it in other cases...
