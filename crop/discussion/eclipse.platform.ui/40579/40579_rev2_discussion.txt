Mickael, can you review this? Navigator is your area of work.

@Lars: well this change isn't much about Navigator, it's mainly about migrating from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4.

Gerrit build didn't detect any regression.
But it seems like the tests are not run automatically anyway, because skip is the defaul, so the change isn't actually tested, but this is not related to this patch.
So I had to run them manually, comparing output of "mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles -DskipTests=false -Dmaven.test.skip=false" to check whether all tests were still passing. In both cases (current Junit 3 vs proposed JUnit 4), I get the same test results (82/1/2/0). So this change doesn't seem to cause any regression to current status.

The change looks very sane.

However, if you start using JUnit 4 APIs, please make sure that the MANIFEST.MF file defines a minimal version for the dependency to org.junit bundle. First org.junit 4+ version that was introduced in Eclipse ecosystem was 4.8.0 IIRC, so I recommend you set a version range such as "4,8.0".
If you change that, then I would support merging this patch.
