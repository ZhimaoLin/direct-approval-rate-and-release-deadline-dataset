Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I think the newParent argument should be MElementContainer<? super T>

Thanks for the comment Brian.
MElementContainer<? super T> would work as well.
However, in this use case I cannot think of any example, where it actually makes any difference, can you? 
If you prefer I can adapt, but IMHO it makes no difference here.

IMHO, even if the API tools say so, this is not an API breakage. I cannot think of any existing way to call this method, which will be binary incompatible, can you? Maybe I have overlooked something. If you agree, I would suggest to add a commented filter for API Tools.
