Patch Set 4:

> Thanks for the comment Brian. MElementContainer<? super T> would work as well. However, in this use case I cannot think of any example, where it actually makes any difference, can you? If you prefer I can adapt, but IMHO it makes no difference here.

It makes no difference here but it goes against best practice (viz Bloch's Effective Java) and may bite us (or somebody else) later.  Take a look at Collections.fill(List<? super T>,T) and java.util.Collections.addAll(List<? super T>,Tâ€¦).

I expect that we'll want a move(MElementContainer<? super T> container, Collection<? extends T> children) variants at some point too.
