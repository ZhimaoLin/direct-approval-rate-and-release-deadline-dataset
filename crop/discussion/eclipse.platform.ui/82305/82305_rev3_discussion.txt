@ Sergey:
I removed redundant white spaces. A few points to observe:

1) I tried Hashmap, but it didn't work. The IExecutableExtension provides the data in form of HashTable. See org.eclipse.core.runtime.IExecutableExtension, xxx@xxx.xxx .... a Hashtable...". I can't think of a way of using hashtable and making it still work? Thoughts?
I based this factory off of RGBVisibleContrastColorFactory.


2) I may be wrong about the following, but my line of thought is as following:
Although the class RGBPlatformDependentColorFactory is inside an internal package, the IColorFactory that it provides is actually used externally. See patch 2/2. It is used by another plugin (*.jdt.ui), which lives inside another repository. That other plugin will not function properly with the existing 109 version of the .ui plugin, but specifically requires the RGBPlatformDependentColorFactory to function properly, which in turn requires us to increment the major to 110. Thoughts?

Version in pom.xml has to stay in sync with MANIFEST.MF.

Please respond to Lars' comment.

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Wasn't the version already incremented by commit a72dda9b94f07f1c95d7f51f9380a17eec581c88 ?
