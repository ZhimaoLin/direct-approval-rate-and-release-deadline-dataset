will be no NPE.

Hi Patrik.
I already had a similar patch, but had issues with the internet connection. So thanks for providing this.
Please see my inline comment.

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/TrimBarLayout.java -> This looks even nicer:
if (bar instanceof MTrimBar) {
((MTrimBar) bar).getChildren().forEach(this::hideManagedTB);
}

Do you agree?
