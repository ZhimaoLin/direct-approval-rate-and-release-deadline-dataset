Code looks fine to me but I'm wondering why we only allow use of the high contrast theme if the OS is in high-contrast mode...

Line:170, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> This appears to inhibit the user from selecting the high-contrast
theme unless the *display* (i.e. Platform OS) is in that mode.

Why ? will this theme not work unless this is set (BTW Paul tells
me that GTK's display will always return false for this...

It was implemented in this way in order to simplify the implementation. Since the high contrast mode is the special one, I think we can use the special CSS theme for it (based on the 'classic' theme that works fine with the different variations of the high contrast modes)

I've confirmed it won't work at all on Linux.  What about just making it a named theme?

Patch Set 8:

The 'high contrast' CSS theme is a small extension to the 'classic' one. In my opinion we shouldn't mess with it when the OS is not in the high contrast mode

So do you want to include it to the CSS themes combo anyway?

You need to supply a High Contrast theme for GTK.  I'm indifferent to how you do it.

Patch Set 8:

If you want, you can check the platform when considering high-contrast mode.  org.eclipse.jface.util.Util.isGtk()  Then treat it like a regular theme for GTK.
