Initially I was planning to reuse the 'Dark' theme for it, but there are different variations of the high contrast modes (at least on my Windows 7) and the separate style sheet seems to be the best option according to me

thanks,
Daniel

So this says in high contrast mode, we throw away the CSS theme and and only use that small CSS sheet.

How do we convey this information on the Appearance pref page?

Ups, I skipped the preference page. I will disable the CSS combo in such case. I will update the patch in the moment
