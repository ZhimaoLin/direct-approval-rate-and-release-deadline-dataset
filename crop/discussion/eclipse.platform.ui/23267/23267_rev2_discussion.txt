It fixes the bug. The problem I have is
- When in High Contrast theme, one can no longer set the
  tab font and colors (those bugs which got fixed are back).
  It might be useful for the user to be able to change those
  when using High Contrast mode.
- The theme name must be in title style i.e. 'High Contrast'.
- For the user it's hard to understand why he can't switch
  to another theme (I could live with that restriction).
