DESCRIPTION

Bug 430829 - [CSS] CSSEngine styles all pages of a MultiPageEditorPart, slowing down editor switching

Add ability for CSS engines to skip elements based on their visibility.
Visibility is determined by the parent element which can implement a
new interface, ChildVisibilityAwareElement.  We expose the actual
CTabItems, but only the composite of the currently selected item.
