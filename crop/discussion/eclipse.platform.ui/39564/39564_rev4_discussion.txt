Looking at the old/new code there are pros/cons for each approach.

New code:
Pros: 
the code opening the dialog naturally belongs to the action handler and has not really anything in common with  already overcrowded WindowPage code.

Cons:
The code isn't that easy to read as the previous one.

Old code:
Pros:
The code is more readable.
Cons:
There is no reason why the code should be in this particular class and not somewhere else.

See also my comments to the code.

My personal opinion: if the new code with all this strange tricks regarding context use is really OK, I would still prefer it to the old one. Smaller class with a tight coupling to the subject (CPD) is at the end easier to find/understand as the big WindowPage class doing everything.

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/EditActionSetsHandler.java -> is the mWindow.getContext() same context object as the ctx above? If not, the code isn't really better as before, Germans would say "man muss um die Ecke denken" :-).
Window->context->window->context ...
