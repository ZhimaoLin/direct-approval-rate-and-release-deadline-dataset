Patch Set 3:

This changes where bindings are coming from (incredibly high risk change).  What is the difference between those 2 locations?  What causes something to be in one and not the other?  Those questions have to be answered before we can move forward.

Hi Paul, 
Thank you for your comment. I have pushed a change set that modifies BindingModel instead of BindingService. This is partial change, because I think other references to BindingManager should be replaced by EBindingService as well. Do you think it's a good direction?

Patch Set 3:

I think that completely changes a source of bindings, and so I'd like to see a description of what the differences are between the 2 sources (and why some bindings aren't being included in the BindingManager analysis).

Patch Set 3:

EBindingService.getActiveBindings() returns bindigs from binding tables, that are earlier populated with bindings from BindingManager and bindings added directly to model. EBindingService.getActiveBindings() returns current state of the model, and state of BindingManager during application initialization. Bindings added to model are not propagated to BindingManager, this is why some bindings are missing in key preferences. By merging keybindings from current states of BindingManager and model we get complete set of key bindings.
I attach an alternative change (result is the same as previously). Actually, in the new patch, the new BindingManager instance should be fed with all bindings from model (regardless scheme), but EBindingService does not provide such method.
