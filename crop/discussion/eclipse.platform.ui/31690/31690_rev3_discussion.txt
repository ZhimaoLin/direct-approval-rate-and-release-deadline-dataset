Hi Daniel, while I am testing the code, could you take a look at my inline comments? In general I think the bundle versions are not updated correctly.

Line:22, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/pom.xml -> shouldn't it be 0.11.200 ?

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.properties -> unwanted 'tab'

Line:29, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.properties -> Why not "...part color begin"? "start" looks inconsistent with other strings

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Shouldn't it be 1.0.100 ?

Line:4, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> shouldn't it be 0.11.200 ?

Line:22, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/pom.xml -> Shouldn't it be 1.0.100 ?

100, 200, ... we use for master branch. For maintenance ones we use 1, 2, ... At least it is my understanding of the WIKI - https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering

I mistook master with maintenance branches versioning, but then shouldn't 0.11.100 be increased to 0.11.101 ?

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The version for 'org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt' number must be 0.11.101.

The relevant part from the wiki is:

"In general, if that change happens in a service (a.k.a. maintenance) release, then 1 is added."

HINT: Whenever you change a version in a branch and the new version is lower than the previous one, then you are about to make a mistake.

except the version numbering and mentioned minor issues, the patch looks good to me and works fine

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/definition/CSSPropertyThemeElementDefinitionHandler.java -> this can be replaced with "return message"
