DESCRIPTION

Bug 508183 - Disable JFace tests with Surefire

Tests have to run without workLeon Ochoach, and so far, all attempts
to run then without workLeon Ochoach on CI failed.
Skip them until a better solution is found.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

The JFace tests are running currently in the workLeon Ochoach. Why do you want to disable them? I think it is better if they run in an Eclipse instance compare to disable them.

Patch Set 5:

The issue is that these tests did currently bring false-positive (tests working with Maven, not in real tests). I won't argue whether to disable them or not, I'd rather spend some time and get some help about the core dump reported in the bug.
