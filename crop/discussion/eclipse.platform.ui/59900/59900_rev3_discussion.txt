Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

I discussed with Dani and xxx@xxx.xxx that we will try to enable the patch always in the current state to have a good testing period. Therefore I merge it now, if it brings in other issues we need to revert it.

AFAIK Papyrus has enabled the same by default and didn't report issues on that so far.
