I manually merged the contribution to the current Neon codebase. Now the context (application <-> part) should be evaluated and well tested for all platforms.

Line:202, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerShowProcessor.java -> I'm not sure if application is the correct parent. For context menus the parent should be the part.

Patch Set 2:

The application was used as that was what was already being used in the ModelUtils, so we simply used that for consistency. If the part context is the proper one to use then that should work fine as long as something is attached to the menu so it can be found later.

It was also the application for context menus within a part? From my understanding it should be the part. For the main menu it should be of course application.
