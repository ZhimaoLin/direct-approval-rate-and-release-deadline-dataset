One thing I also spotted in addition to the new inline comments is the fact that some for loops and if statements do not have curly brackets.
It is good practise to always use curly brackets even if it is valid to leave them out when only one line follows.

Line:35, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.harness/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/internal/util/AccessibilityTestPass.java -> Here it should also prefered to return List instead of ArrayList, as it is good practise to implement against interfaces instead of concrete implementations. Sorry that I did not spot this earlier.

Line:237, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.harness/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/harness/util/EditorTestHelper.java -> Here I formerly suggested to use IFile instead of IResource as generic type, since an array of IFiles are returned.
