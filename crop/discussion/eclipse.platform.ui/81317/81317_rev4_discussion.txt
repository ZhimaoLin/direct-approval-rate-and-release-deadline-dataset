DESCRIPTION

Bug 501434 - ProgressManager refresh should check for executor shutdown

Shutdown and notifications from jobs can happen concurrently. We should
not thrown a RejectedExecutionException (by using the default
RejectedExecutionHandler). We only log an info status in case we would
need to debug this behavior later on.
