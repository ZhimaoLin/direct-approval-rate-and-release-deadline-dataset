DESCRIPTION

Bug 501434 - ProgressManager refresh should check for executor shutdown

ProgressManager now also logs rejected refresh queries instead of using
the default RejectedExecutionHandler which throws a
RejectedExecutionException.

Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> This will omit the stack trace. Unless you're doing this intentionally, I'd suggest attaching e to the Status object.

Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> I suppose you've assumed that e is an exception. It is not. it's the ThreadPoolExecutor (the lambda is an RejectedExecutionHandler). I've changed the name of the variable to avoid the confusion. 

I'm also now creating an exception to get the stack trace in the log (but I do not throw it). 

Finally, I've also changed the status level to warning or info. The conditions to get tasks rejected can only happen during platform shutdown and it is not really an error: a job has send an event to ProgressManager$JobMonitor concurrently to the platform calling ProgressManager#shutdown(). I don't think we want to pay the cost of synchronization between ProgressManager$JobMonitor and ProgressManager#shutdown() just to handle properly a refresh event that will occur right before the Platform termination.
