Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Adding more and more API to access the selectionGroup / ResourceTreeAndListGroup is not a good path forward, especially, since #createFileSelectionGroup is API and not usable in the current form where the field is "private" and refers to an internal type.

The correct long term fix is fixing bug 147027.

Abandoned

It would make sense to fix the other bug and not add more API, abandoning.
