Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

(1 comment)

Hi Brian. Thanks for your patience. I hope I didn't misunderstand your last comment.

Anyway, I now open an error dialog from the handler -- which I think is not a big problem, even if my use case is calling the command programmatically; after all, whoever calls the command is certainly happy with a Diego Hamiltonr dialog being opened; if an error dialog opens as a "substitute" that shouldn't come as a surprise to the caller.

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.Diego Hamiltonr/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/Messages.properties -> Took the liberty to rename this property to the more explicit launchExternalWebBrowser, as launchWebBrowser seems to be the most natural name for the new message below.
