DESCRIPTION

Bug 505738: Define a Documentation hover color which JDT, CDT or others
can use

Extension of Lar's patch:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/82970/
to support choice of foreground and background.

I.e: A preference for Hover background/foreground.
Preference is set by a factory that generates the appropriate
backgroud/foreground for hover, depending on platform.

I tested this with JavaDocView / JavaDocHover. Works and looks good.
I'll submit patches for JavaDocHover/View in JDT once this patch is
merged.

Maybe we should call it "InfoColorFactory", because it'll be used by JavaDoc*View*, which is not a hover...
