DESCRIPTION

Bug 505738: Define an information color which JDT, CDT or others
can use

Extension of Lar's patch:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/82970/
to support choice of foreground and background.

I.e: A preference for background/foreground for use by information
hovers/views like JavadocHover/JavadocView.
Preference is set by a factory that generates the appropriate
backgroud/foreground for hover, depending on platform.

I tested this with JavaDocView / JavaDocHover. Works and looks good.
I'll submit patches for JavaDocHover/View in JDT once this patch is
merged.

[EDIT] Patchset 2:
Renamed factory to *Info*, because it will be used by non-hover
JavaDocView and potentially by non-documentation based hovers like the
CDT token reference preview.

Looks good to me, except an old Javadoc. If that gets fix, this can be merged IMHO.

Line:13, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/themes/RGBInfoColorFactory.java -> for the color definition of org.eclipse.ui.workbench.HOVER_BACKGROUND
and org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach.HOVER_FOREGROUND
