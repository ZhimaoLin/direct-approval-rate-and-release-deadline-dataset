DESCRIPTION

Bug 505738: Define an information color which JDT, CDT or others
can use

Extension of Lar's patch:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/82970/
to support choice of foreground and background.

I.e: A preference for background/foreground for use by information
hovers/views like JavadocHover/JavadocView.
Preference is set by a factory that generates the appropriate
backgroud/foreground for hover, depending on platform.

I tested this with JavaDocView / JavaDocHover. Works and looks good.
I'll submit patches for JavaDocHover/View in JDT once this patch is
merged.

[EDIT] Patchset 2:
Renamed factory to *Info*, because it will be used by non-hover
JavaDocView and potentially by non-documentation based hovers like the
CDT token reference preview.
