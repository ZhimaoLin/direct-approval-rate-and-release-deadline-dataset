Just some remaining nits to fix...

Line:48, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/commands/MBindingContext.java -> Looks like we missed removing the stale messages here

Line:37, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/fragment/MModelFragment.java -> Where's the new jdoc ?

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/ui/menu/MMenuElement.java -> If this is the 'type' for the container MMenu then it shouldn't have state in it...perhaps move this to MMenuItem ?

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/ui/menu/MMenuElement.java -> It is the extension of MUILabel needed for MMenuElements (contained MUILabel elements).  This should be fine
