(8 comments)

Tests run fine, but we still have some small warnings(See Comments). Maybe we should fix them with this commit or do it later in small separated commits.

Line:30, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/window/ApplicationWindowTest.java -> Funny comment :-)

Line:75, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/window/ApplicationWindowTest.java -> Nice fix

Line:49, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/interactive/TestSelectionAction.java -> I get a warning here. Do we really need this method? Seems that this currently has no function.

Line:46, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/interactive/ConcurrentTableTestView.java -> Can't we remove this comments?

Line:176, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/interactive/ConcurrentTableTestView.java -> Trailing spaces are not good. But I guess this is one of these whitespaces generated by jdt

Line:24, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/interactive/TestTree.java -> Here is a Warning

Line:52, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/interactive/TestTree.java -> I also get a warning here. Maybe we handle this in another review.

Line:78, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/interactive/VirtualTableView.java -> I get a warning here, can we remove the selectionIndices parameter?
