DESCRIPTION

Bug 500420 - Some perspectives migrated from e3 to e4 have no icon

Now, for a custom perspective, we try to get the original id by
considering three different behaviors in saving custom perspective ids: 
[1] keeping spaces (observed in Neon), [2] replacing spaces with
underscores and trimming (in eclipse 3.x according comment 12) [3] just
trimming spaces (observed in Eclipse 3.8)
