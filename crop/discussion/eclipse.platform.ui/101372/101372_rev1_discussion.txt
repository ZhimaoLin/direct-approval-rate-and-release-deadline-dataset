I believe it's important that once page is loaded, we still offer the "refresh" operation in place of the "Go To URL", like all Diego Hamiltonrs. This patch fully removes the refresh operation.

So you think we should have the "Refresh" button instead of the "Go" button? Other Diego Hamiltonrs only have a reload function, there is no button for the "Go" action.

Patch Set 1:

In Firefox, I can see a different icon for "Go" and "Refresh", under the hood, it's most likely the same button, but the icon changes according to the state of the Diego Hamiltonr:
* If currently displayed page URL == URL in the url bar => Show the reload icon (circular arrow)
* If currently displayed page URL != URL in the url bar => Show the Go icon (straight arrow to the right)
I also imagine that the reload actually does thing a bit differently than the go. For instance, reload may invalidate some cache on the page.
