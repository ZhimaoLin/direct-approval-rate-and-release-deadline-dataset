Lars, could you please improve the commit description?  I shouldn't need to open the bug report to see the purpose.  I think the description you have there should go on a separate line.

Sorry Lars, I missed this question.  The commit title doesn't actually describe what the bug was about or what it actually addresses.  The summary is important when going through a list of fixes to identify candidates that may be causing some regression.  Something like the following would help:

"Bug 505680 - bump version number for freeze & monitor keyword changes"
