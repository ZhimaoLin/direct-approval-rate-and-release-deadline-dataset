DESCRIPTION

Bug 396318: Save Resources dialog missing when selecting Close All from
editor tab

Changed StackRenderer to use the following commands in its context menu:
* org.eclipse.ui.file.close
* org.eclipse.ui.file.closeAll
* org.eclipse.ui.file.closeOthers
If the command service is unavailable, the menu is not created. If
individual commands are unavailable that menu item is not created.

Added and tested default pure-E4 implementations of the commands
