Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

I don't like the introduction of PartSizeInfo to contain the application model data which is extracted from container data. This is like an extension of the application model. I suggest to store this data directly as persistent data on the model element. 

This would remove a lot of conversion and storage code and stay in sync with the application model approach to use very simple data storage in the model.

For the approach I think we should introduce constants and store the different values in them.

>>I don't like the introduction of PartSizeInfo to contain the application model data which is extracted from container data. This is like an extension of the application model.

This is related to Bug 401043.  This patch does not address that bug, although I agree the current state is not ideal.

The PartSizeInfo also has methods to handle conversion, validation and constraints.  This code was commented out, and then those comments were removed per request.  

>>I suggest to store this data directly as persistent data on the model element.

This would still store as a string;  it would be better to store an object as transient data, and serialize to persistent data as needed.  That brings up the issue of subscribers though.  I will post on Bug 401043 regarding this.
