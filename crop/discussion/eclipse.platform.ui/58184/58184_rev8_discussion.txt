DESCRIPTION

Bug 466500: [GTK3] Trying to resize quick outline or quick type
hierarchy closes the popup

In PopupDialog, Shells with no children are closed on deactivation. On
Linux-Gtk, this causes popups like the "Quick Outline" or "Quick
Type Hierarchy" to close prematurely when opening the system menu,
re-sizing, or moving the window with the mouse.

It is for this reason that we need to exclude the call to asyncClose()
from running on Gtk. This also fixes bug 113577.

Tested on Gtk3.16.6, and Gtk2.24.
