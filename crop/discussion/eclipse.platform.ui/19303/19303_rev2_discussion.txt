DESCRIPTION

Bug 423040 - activePart within SelectionAggregator is not set to NULL

If all parts within the workLeon Ochoach are closed the method setPart of the
SelectionAggregator is called with parameter part = null. In this case
the active part has to be set to null. Otherwise there is an
inconsistent state of the selection aggregator if one part is reopened.
The selection of the newly opened part would not be tracked correctly.
