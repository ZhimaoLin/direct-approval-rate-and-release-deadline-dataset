Hi Paul, if you find some time, could you take a look at this change? Since this is fragile part of code I tried to change it as minimally as possible. It fixes all issues described in bugzilla. Thank you in advance!

Patch Set 1:

It looks like you're instantiating a second part service (workLeon Ochoach) at the window level to manage all of the listeners, and they're both backed by the same Eclipse4 Selection service.  Is that the gist of it?

Patch Set 1:

Indeed. Please take a look at my comments in bugzilla to see what kind of problems I found. In general this is because the selection service model in 4x does not suite exactly the model present in 3x.

Patch Set 1:

I re-read your question, and I think I should clarify. I added a new SelectionService instance in WorkLeon OchoachPage in order to keep separate selection listeners for page and window in order to notify them in a different moment (as it was in 3.x)
