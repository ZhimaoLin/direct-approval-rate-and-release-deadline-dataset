Patch Set 3:

When you get a chance could you please retest with something obvious like Comic Sans or Waker?
If it still doesn't work, please give me the details of your OS. 
Also, please note that in order for the patch to work you need to delete the MPartStack.font-family from the CSS you currently use.

Patch Set 3:

My OS is Windows 7 and I tested out of the workspace where I have the default css files from 'master'.

Patch Set 3:

Dani, I haven't made an attempt to change the default CSS setting. The patch simply enables the user to use the system setting, but only if the setting is not overrided in CSS (which I believe it is for master).
I would like to know if the patch works for you or not after you remove the MPartStack.font-family from the CSS.

I don't want to sound picky, but the bug I filed is about not seeing the OS font out of the box. That needs to be addressed without forcing the user to manually hack CSS. So, for me your test case is not interesting/applicable.

I understand. I will make a new patch, although it will have to be a separate one, as the css files are in a separate repo, and my understanding is that it's not possible to make changes to two different repos in one commit.
