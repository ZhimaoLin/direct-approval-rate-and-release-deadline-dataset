This doesn't fix the problem. I still get the wrong font. In my case Segoe UI instead of Thaoma. The difference can e.g. be seen when looking at the lowercase 'y'.

Dani, where did you set the font in your OS? The correct font is the one associated with "Message Box", if I recall correctly

Sorry, I can't remember and have no time to test which one it is. What I can say is that I have set the font for all options to Thaoma and that it isn't picked up. Maybe it's the (In)Active  Title Bar font.
