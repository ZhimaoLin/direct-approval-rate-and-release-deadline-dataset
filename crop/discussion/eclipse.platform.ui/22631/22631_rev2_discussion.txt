Patch Set 2: Verified-1

I didn't look at the code but the fix seems incomplete: when I press 'Reset' on the View Management preference page, it is expected that the views show/hide again automatically unless I close/open it manually. This is not the case.

Patch Set 2:

Hi Dani,
If I understand correctly, the scenario is:
1. Run debug
2. Close automatically opened view
3. finish debug
4. run and finish debug -> the view does not show up
5. Reset (in preferences) the list of closed views
6. run debug

Expected behaviour: the view opens again during debugging

I have just checked it and this scenario does work for me...

To be clear I am testing this with CDT.

Patch Set 2:

I didn't bother to install CDT. Simply debugged a simple Java program with a breakpoint. There the manually closed Variables view doesn't come back after 'Reset'.

Patch Set 2:

Really strange... I just tested it with Java and Variables view and it does work in my environment (as described in the scenario in previous comment). I will retry with fresh eclipse instance.

Patch Set 2:

I tested with an existing workspace and also toggled the option back and forth. Maybe that causes it?

Patch Set 2:

Daniel R. just tested it in his environment and it does work for him too.
BTW. Even if it does not work in some cases, I think it is not related to my fix.
It would be good to compare it with 3.8, but I need to know how to reproduce the bug in my environment.
I will experiment.
So far I tested the simplest possible scenario, with pressing "reset" only once, closing (not hiding/minimizing) the view and without restarting eclipse.

Patch Set 2:

The test case is:
- start debug a class that has a breakpoint
- close Variables view
- debug again
  ==> view stays closed (good)
- Reset
- debug again
  ==> bug: view does not automatically appear

Patch Set 2:

:) this is exactly the test case that I and Daniel R. was testing. And in the last step the view does appear (however is not always brought to top)...
I tried various modifications of the scenario and it always work as expected.
I have no idea what is going on...
