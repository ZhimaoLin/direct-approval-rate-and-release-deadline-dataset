Line:18, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.tabbed/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this still needed, now that the activator is gone?

This flag activates the bundle if one of its classes are accessed. It would also allow to provide osgi services, which this plugin does not have. 

Please remove the flag and test if it still works. If it can be removed your CSS patch will not cause test failures in jdt
