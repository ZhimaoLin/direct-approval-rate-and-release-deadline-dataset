DESCRIPTION

Bug 517231: Several HandlerActivationTests fail on Mac

Re-enable test_persistState_371087_1. The RuntimeException handler in
PartRenderingEngine shows error dialog when an exception occurs. in
tests that throw an exception, set a temporary RuntimeException handler
that doesn't show an error dialog.

Patch Set 2:

Can't we add the exception handler in #setUp? That way, this would also work when we add additional tests to the classe.

The patch adds the handler only for tests which are expected to throw an exception, so the exception dialog for these tests are not shown.
Adding the exception handler in setUp() will override the default handler (in PartRenderingEngine) for all the tests even though they are not expected to throw exceptions. And it has to be reset again in the tearDown() for all the tests. I think this will be a overhead for every test and can be avoided.
