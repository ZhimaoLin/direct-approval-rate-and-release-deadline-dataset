DESCRIPTION

Bug 517231: Several HandlerActivationTests fail on Mac

Re-enable test_persistState_371087_1. The RuntimeException handler in
PartRenderingEngine shows error dialog when an exception occurs. in
tests that throw an exception, set a temporary RuntimeException handler
that doesn't show an error dialog.

Line:1668, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/PartRenderingEngineTests.java -> this should go either into the finally block or into the tearDown, same for all cases below.
