DESCRIPTION

Bug 517231: Several HandlerActivationTests fail on Mac

Re-enable test_persistState_371087_1. The RuntimeException handler in
PartRenderingEngine shows error dialog when an exception occurs. in
tests that throw an exception, set a temporary RuntimeException handler
that doesn't show an error dialog.
