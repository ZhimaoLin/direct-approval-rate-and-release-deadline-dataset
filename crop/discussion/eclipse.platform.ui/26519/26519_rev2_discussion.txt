I think we also need to reset the preference value for showing the the heap status. Test case: Hide the HeapStatus and check the preference value afterwards.

Line:593, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/HeapStatus.java -> Don't you have to also reset the preference value for showing the HeapStatus?
