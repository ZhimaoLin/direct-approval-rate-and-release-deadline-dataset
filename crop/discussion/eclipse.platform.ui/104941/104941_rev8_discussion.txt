The tooltip that is meant to show why the button, label and text are disabled does not seem to work for me. Does it work for you?

Nope, it doesn't work for me, although it seems applied on all relevant widgets. I guess it could be a GTK choice (or even an SWT one) to not show popups on disabled controls?

Yes if you omit the disabling the tooltip shows. Adding Alex for an opinion.

Line:289, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/IDEWorkspacePreferencePage.java -> You can use the compositeWsPath variable to set tooltip. As it's not disabled this would work out. You can even have one composite for the button and label ... and set the tooltip on it.

I don't enjoy the tooltip idea. IMHO creating a label for that info would be better. Way more visible even if one doesn't hover over that section.

Patch Set 8:

The issue is that if we want an informative hint, it's going to take a lot of space for an information that isn't very important. Moreover, many other widgets on that page use a tooltip.
Where would you place the label and what would it be?
