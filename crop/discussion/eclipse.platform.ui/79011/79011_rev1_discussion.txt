DESCRIPTION

Bug 498814 - form-based editors unusable because getEditorReferences us

Now, when AbstractFormPart.markDirty is called, it calls
managedForm.dirtyStateChanged() only when the previous state was NOT
dirty. This will improve performances of Form Based editors.

Lars, hope you don't mind taking a look at this (please, only after your return from holidays :)
I wanted also to increase the version to 3.7.100, as described in bug 499164 - but I was not sure, and this another reason why I'm asking a review!

Change looks good to me. Sam, can you verify, if that fixes your issue without your workaround?

Sorry, I don't really have a way of doing that verification. This seems like a sane change though.
