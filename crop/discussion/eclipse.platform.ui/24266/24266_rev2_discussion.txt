The issue with the build seems to be connected to the bundle version update. I will take a look at it, but you can try the patch after fixing it in the local env

Patch Set 2:

The CSS SWT plugin hasn't published any API yet, you just have to mark that new package as internal.

Do we want to limit this functionality to SWT? Maybe we should move it to core so that Tom or other can re-use it for their Eclipse based distribution.

AFAIK we don't need all that workLeon Ochoach stuff.  See how /org.eclipse.e4.core.di.extensions/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/di/internal/extensions/PreferencesObjectSupplier.java deals with preferences, using IEclipsePreferences and org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences.IPreferencesService

This will allow it to work with Eclipse4 applications.

Patch Set 2:

I took a look at the IPreferencesService service and it seems to be mostly designed to read preferences. For storing of the preferences we have the 'importPreferences' method only that is very limited in my opinion. So I'm not sure if it is the valid direction to follow.

The main advantage of the current implementation is that we process the preferences in the similar manner to the preference dialog. So user can easily figure out what preferences they can override with the CSS and what values ones get (they have to check the proper workspace file in order to get such knowledge).

If you agree I would skip the current implementation of the feature. Please let me know what do you think,

Patch Set 2:

Check out org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences.IEclipsePreferences which is a much better fit for writing preferences.  This can be retrieved using org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences.InstanceScope.INSTANCE
