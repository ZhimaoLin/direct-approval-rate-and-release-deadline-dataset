Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/IEclipsePreferencesHelper.java -> I think we should remove the 'I' from all of the classes that aren't interfaces.  So EclipsePreferencesHelper.

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/IEclipsePreferencesHelper.java -> This won't work reliably.  You would need to make sure that every token is SEP + name + SEP so that you can search for SEP+name+SEP to confirm it is there, or setting a large value would match a short value.

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/preference/IEclipsePreferencesElement.java -> Should change name to EclipsePreferencesElement

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/plugin.xml -> This plugin doesn't export all of its packages in the MANIFEST.MF.  The new packages should be marked as internal.

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/preference/IEclipsePreferencesProvider.java -> Change name to EclipsePreferencesProvider

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/preference/IEclipsePreferencesHandler.java -> Should change name to EclipsePreferencesHandler
