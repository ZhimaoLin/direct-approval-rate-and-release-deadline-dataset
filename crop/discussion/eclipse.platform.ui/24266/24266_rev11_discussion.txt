Daniel, could you review this?  It works with the CSS I've attached to the bug.  I'm not sure about the reset semantics, and I've copied your test into the PreferenceNode (I'm not sure about the test either).

Line:1422, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/PartRenderingEngine.java -> We should probably reconcile these 2 events.  Unfortunately, the UIEvents one is API, unless we added it for Luna (then it's API we might be able to change :-)

Line:1470, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/PartRenderingEngine.java -> This was the only way to get all of the bundles.  Turns out childNames() only returns names of nodes that have been changed, so in a new workspace that didn't include the jdt.ui or ui.editors

Line:22, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This should probably be made a friend of the part rendering engine
