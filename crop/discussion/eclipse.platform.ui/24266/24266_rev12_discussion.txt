Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/IEclipsePreferencesHelper.java -> Since we have to store the overridden preference names for cleaning purposes, I think, it will be better to keep the list in the separate preference. I don't expect any phantoms here, but just in case we have ready workaround for it
