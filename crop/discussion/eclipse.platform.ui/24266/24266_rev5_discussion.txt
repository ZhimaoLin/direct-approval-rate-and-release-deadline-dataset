Patch Set 5:

OK, I've updated the patch according to the comments above. Now it looks and works better.

Since we have plenty of more important bugs on our M7 plate, if you agree with the current version of the patch I would like to commit it. We can solve any issues connected to the patch using separate bugs, 

thanks,
Daniel
