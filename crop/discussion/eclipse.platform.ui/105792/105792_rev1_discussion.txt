This import/export options should rather be placed on the dialog (close the to Help button) rather than on the PrefernecePage itself, because the import/export wizards are global and not bound to a specific page. Also, it would be nicer to use icons instead of labels for those buttons (text can be kept as tooltip)

I agree. Are you aware of a way to instantiate a PreferencesImportWizard from within jface as that is where the import/export are created? I don't know how I would refer to it by its ID without causing a circular dependency.

The Preferences command from the IDE usually go through PreferenceUtil.createPreferenceDialogOn(...) methods. This instantiate a FilteredPreferenceDialog . This seems to be the right place where to add a button.
