Line:83, examples/org.eclipse.jface.examples.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/examples/databinding/snippets/SnippetSideEffectRunOnce.java -> In this example, the consumer is idempotent so you would normally have used a normal side-effect, not a runOnce side-effect.

This would be a more useful example if the consumer was not idempotent. I'd suggest moving the call to shell.open inside the consumer since this is the sort of thing you'd only want to happen once.
