Patch Set 1:

There is no information that the patch was created by someone else (see the Bug 340656). Prakash has created and released the path to the head so I consider him as the author

Dani, could you please advice?

thanks,
Daniel

Ah, that makes sense, but in such cases please set the new bug 440199 to be dependent on bug 340656 so that we know that you are reusing an existing fix (it is not clear from bug 440199 and this Gerrit change how it is possible that Prakash was involved in this fix). Thanks!
