DESCRIPTION

Bug 478586 - Migrate toLocale to LocaleChangeServiceImpl

The ResourceBundleHelper.toLocale is only used from within the
LocaleChangeServiceImpl, and the tests can be migrated to the
org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach bundle instead. This permits the removal of
the toLocale method from ResourceBundleHelper.

Wonder if we should bump the versions of this and/or core services as well.

Line:54, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/UIAllTests.java -> Lots of the whitespace changes here are removal of trailing space, which was done automatically in the IDE.

Line:188, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/LocaleChangeServiceImpl.java -> Not sure if this needs to be public any more; it could be private here.
