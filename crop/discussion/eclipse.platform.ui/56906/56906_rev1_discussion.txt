DESCRIPTION

Bug 478586 - Move toLocaleHelper to LocaleChangeServiceImpl

The reference to the toLocaleHelper method is only used in the
LocaleChangeServiceImpl, and the code has been copied and pasted from
elsewhere before. So move this from ResourceBundle so that the friends
relationship canbe removed.
