I modified the Javadoc for the new methods and added xxx@xxx.xxx 3.13 tag to them. But my manifest.mf is still complaining to increase the major version.

Before I can look at the version thing, please fix the the following issues.

Line:120, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> I suggest to remove this convenience method. The target of the bug is to allow users to specify the labels, simplification of the usage should discussed in another bug.

Line:402, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> This seems unrelated to the change, please remove unrelated format changes

Line:555, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> This seems unrelated to the change, please remove unrelated format changes

Line:721, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> Update of Javadoc required due to the new constuctor...
