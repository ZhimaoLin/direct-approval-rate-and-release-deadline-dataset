Please see my inline comments. I'd recommend to create a formatting bug for this class beforehand. Like Lars also did a couple of times, like in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/74179/

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> The indent seems to be wrong here by using tabs.
Since tabs are the right way to go, we should provide a patch for formatting the source code.

Line:155, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> My api base line tooling complains about xxx@xxx.xxx 3.5 and recommends 3.13

Line:483, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> My api base line tooling complains that xxx@xxx.xxx tag/annotation is missing and recommends 3.13

Line:553, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> This also seems to be an unrelated formatting change

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> -1 for formating spaces to tabs, as this would affect the history of the whole file. I'm ok with formatting lines which have unnecessary breaks, if that is necessary.

David, thanks for fixing this bug. I added some comments to address https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511626#c5 and https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511198#c16. Hope this helps.

Line:123, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> Here, integrate the JavaDoc explaining the overload with buttonLabelToIdMap: Map<String,Int>. The client should easily understand the difference between this method and the other one.

Line:155, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> This seems a copy of the JavaDoc for the method with same signature butwithout the buttonLabelToIdMap (overloaded). I xxx@xxx.xxx should report the latest version. 
Perhaps it is a bug in PDE?

Line:448, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> Explain clearly the difference with respect to the other constructor. The client should understand clearly what it the difference in adding the buttonLabelToIdMap parameter.

Line:483, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/MessageDialogWithToggle.java -> Again, this is an overloaded constructor. Probably @since 3.13 should be applied to the other constructor xxx@xxx.xxx <Last Version> should be applied to this JavaDoc 
(Please Nevaeh Wu, correct me if I'm wrong)
