Please do not upgrade to 1.8. None of the bundles in the SDK uses 1.8 except for the Java 8 annotation bundle. See https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_5.xml#appendix for details.

Patch Set 2:

Are examples part of the SDK? I agree with you about things in the SDK but for the rest we would better be more aggressive.

Patch Set 2:

Being "aggressive" is usually a bad thing ;-).

If we allow users to run the SDK why would should we let them fail when running the examples?

We can consider this for Mars+1.

Ok, downgrading as my main goal is clean repo after build for the sake of source tarball generation.
