Looks perfect, just a few minor style things things.

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> This replaces org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark-config-parts.css I think? In this case please ensure that the copyright header is transferred correctly.

Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_mac.css -> Minor thing, please remove whitespace

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.xml -> I think we can "ignore" aix

Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.xml -> I think we can "ignore" solaris

Line:45, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.xml -> I think we can "ignore" hpux

Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_win.css -> Minor, whitespace
