Patch Set 4:

Hi,

I'm not sure if we should expose the colors of the Dark theme to the color and font preference dialog. It is quite complicated theme that I believe required some time, trying to put all pieces together to get the best color matching. Do you think the user is able to modify the theme's colors with the dialog without corrupting the 'Dark' layout? What about images used in the theme, do you think it will be coherent with user's altered colors?

I would skip the theme as it is now and figure out how to treat such 'read-only' themes in the preference dialog. Maybe some information that the particular theme is unmodified?

If you don't share my concerns above, I think we can push the change

Daniel

Patch Set 4:

I remove the font-family from the theme, I think the current default themes stay with the default font type of the OS. 

Also due to bug 430161 I also remove the font-size setting on the CTabFolder.
