You seem to be using Windows Line breaks. Can you change that and resubmit the change? I will also change this directly in the project settings.

Also I think we should move the files, except the main style sheet into a "dark" folder so that the files are somehow grouped.

The "e4-dark.css" which includes the others should stay in the top directory.

Line:18, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.properties -> Question of taste, but I agree "Dark" is more consistent with the other names.

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.xml -> This seems to be an unnecessary change, can your remove that? We dislike in general unnecessary whitespace changes
