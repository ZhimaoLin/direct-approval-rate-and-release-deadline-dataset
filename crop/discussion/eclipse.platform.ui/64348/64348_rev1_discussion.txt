Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)

See comment below.

Line:339, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> According to the Javadoc this should never happen: the page we ask is definitely from our site, so the array must be non null.

This must be a bug in org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkLeon OchoachPage.getViewStack(IViewPart). The expression below returns null in your case:

partService.findPart(part.getSite().getId());

I can only imagine that may be some corner case here (part disposed or not yet properly constructed)? While closing perspective something seem to be broken.

While the patch is OK, I would like to ask you to debug the problem to understand what is going wrong on perspective switch. 

If the code in WorkLeon OchoachPage.getViewStack() is OK, then the javadoc must be updated additionally to this patch, if not, the root cause must be fixed.
