DESCRIPTION

Bug 456729 - Move CustomizePerspectiveDialog and TreeManager to "cpd"
package

CustomizePerspectiveDialog is too huge to be maintainable.
Moved the dialog class (and TreeManager) to the new "cpd" package, moved
all not necessary inner classes out of the dialog class, cleaned up
warnings, code.
