DESCRIPTION

Bug 456729 - Move CustomizePerspectiveDialog and TreeManager to "cpd"
package

CustomizePerspectiveDialog is too huge to be maintainable.
Moved the dialog class (and TreeManager) to the new "cpd" package, moved
all not necessary inner classes out of the dialog class, cleaned up
warnings, code.

A few minor suggestions, please check the detailed comments. This is a relative big change, but AFAICS you did not change any behavior, you only moved classes. Can you confirm that? I'm fine with merging this, if that is the case.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/ActionSetSelectionChangedListener.java -> You could use filterViewer.getStructuredSelection() to save the cast, as you access filterViewer later I see no advantage in using the event.

Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/FilteredModelCheckListener.java -> remove lb

Line:32, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/ActionSetFilter.java -> unnecessary linebreak

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/ActionSetFilter.java -> Maybe combined the two if statements with || ?

Line:34, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/UnavailableContributionItemCheckListener.java -> remove lb

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> We use the Bug reference and optional a description of the change in the copyright header

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/ActionSetSelectionChangedListener.java -> The selection event comes from a *different* source, so this is not possible here.

Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/FilteredModelCheckListener.java -> Done

Line:32, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/ActionSetFilter.java -> Done

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/ActionSetFilter.java -> Done

Line:34, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/UnavailableContributionItemCheckListener.java -> Done

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> Lars, this will be in the next commit and if I now would change the line the I would be forced to manually remerge this scary code again. I hope this is OK to wait for the next review?

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> Not sure what you mean, I will update the copyright header for you, no worries. This potentially will result in a minor merge conflict with the following bug, but I can also solve that for you.

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> Review https://git.eclipse.org/r/38803 will "fix" this comment.

Changing it here and now will cause merge conflict and so rebase has to be manually done, which is quite an effort.
