DESCRIPTION

Bug 501849 - Properties not updated when selection changed in max'd view

Now the Properties view is updated even when the selection is changed in
a maximized view. 
The fix involved a change in PartServiceImple.isVisible(), which now
returns correct results even with fast views.

I think we should fix MinMayAddon, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/83296

Line:512, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> This method should not return true if the element is not minimized, but it does this because the minMaxAddon doesn't remove the MINIMIZED_BY_ZOOM tag from *restored* part stacks if user restores only one stack.

I think it will be better to fix it via https://git.eclipse.org/r/83296

I agree, I prefer your solution as it is clearer
