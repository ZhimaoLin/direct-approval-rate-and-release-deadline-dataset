DESCRIPTION

Bug 355049: "Export" should not dereference linked resources by default

Adds an additional "Resolve and export linked resources" checkbox to the
"File->Export->File System" and "File->Export->Archive File" wizards.
This checkbox is not selected by default, which allows exporting and
importing projects containing linked resources without destroying
project structure.

This change fixes the main issue with the export/import wizards if the
exported source contained linked files or folders - this was one way,
not symmetrical operation. An import from the resulted directory or
archive always broke the links, replacing them with the link target
content. Now import wizard restores the linked state of the affected
resources.

A follow up change may hide/show linked resource entries in the export
wizard resources tree if the "Resolve and export linked resources"
checkbox is toggled.
