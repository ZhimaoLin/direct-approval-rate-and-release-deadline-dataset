DESCRIPTION

Bug 492830 - Resizing Ctrl+3 popup does not give more results

Resizing Quick Access popup gives more results, but not including
low-quality matches.

This change restores the previous behavior, and partially overlaps with
the change to solve bug 492907. 
If 492907 is accepted, this change can be discarded. 
If 492907 is not accepted, this change just restore the previous
behaviour, but the popup will not show the "less relevant" matches on
resizing

If we agree that resizing will change the number of visible results, 
we have this number (of results) is not fixed, but varies per provider
I suggest to restore a message without explicit number of results. 
What do you think?
