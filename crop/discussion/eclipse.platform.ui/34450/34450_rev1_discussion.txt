Hi Daniel, in this patch I've refactored the WorkLeon OchoachPage.saveAll() method  to make it more readable before applying fix for the bug 169947. As this is important part of code, I would appreciate if you could take a quick look at the changes.

Line:3616, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> I think we can remove the 'canceled' flag and refactor the statement below, like:

if (processSaveable2(dirtyParts)) {
   ...
}

The same comment is for another if statement below
