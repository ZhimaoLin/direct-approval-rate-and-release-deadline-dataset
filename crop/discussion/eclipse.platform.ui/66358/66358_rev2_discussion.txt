Patch Set 2:

In Sirius, this change is sufficient as we do not provide roots for our CNF view or for the Project Explorer. 

But I wonder if you might not keep the cache invalidation  in:
 . NavigatorContentService.update (for (de/re/)activation of extensions)
 . NavigatorContentService.updateService() called on input changed because of the (re)computation of the rootContentProviders which might be bound by their viewerContentBinding with isRoot set to true, or by the trigger points expression.

Regards, 

Maxime
