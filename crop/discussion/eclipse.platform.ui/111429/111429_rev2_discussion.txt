Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Thanks Andrey, I can agree now, since I found that I seemed to have a quite old Eclipse target platform set in that workspace. After switching to the newest egit-4.8 target platform of the org.eclipse.egit.target project, I can confirm that the code is now accepted without the Manifest.MF requirement to org.eclipse.core.commands.
