Please undo manifest change.

Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> When I remove that line, I get an error in class AboutDialog, line 401: 

"The method getCommand(String) from the type ICommandService refers to the missing type Command"

Have you tested you change suggestion? That being said; I notice a warning in the Manifest.MF:

"'org.eclipse.core.commands' is missing version constraint information"

How would you feel about a correction that leaves the dependecies, but adds a version constraint?

Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I've loaded your patch into my IDE and removed the line - no errors. Not sure how the setup looks on your side, but the org.eclipse.core.commands.Command is referenced multiple times already in the workbench plugin, so there can't be errors.

Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> OK, I have performed that change, but I'm nervous, why I seeing such an error in my Eclipse 4.7.1a IDE, when I'm doing that. When you speak of a setup here: Are you referring to some concrete software setup that I should install within Eclipse?

Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There is no reason to be nervous.

org.eclipse.core.commands.Command is referenced 150 times in the org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach. If compiler managed to find the type 150 times, it should be able to resolve it once more. In case you really see this error after full build of the workspace, I would file a bug.

I'm using 4.8 nightly build from this friday, and I see no errors.

Please note that org.eclipse.core.commands is required and re-exported by org.eclipse.jface which is required by workLeon Ochoach plugin, so there is no need for an explicit require statement.
