Hi Mickael,
I tested the latest patch. In general it works very well. The only thing that I think could be changed at this moment is described by the following scenario:
Create 3 projects (p1, p2, p3) and 2 working sets (w1 and w2). Then assign p1 and p2 to w1; p2 and p3 to w2.
Next, try to DnD p1 and p2 (together) from w1 to w2. The result is that p1 is moved to w2, but p2 is not removed from w1.
In Package Explorer this operation is not allowed (i.e. moving a group of projects which contain some projects that are already in the target working set).
I think that for now we should keep the same behavior in both explorers.

I also took a quick look at the code. In addition to inline comments:
1. Could you change the commit message to the most prevalent format? I mean:
"
Bug 390348 - [CommonNavigator] Ability to drag projects between Working Sets

Change-Id: Ia8ca4eefc76056c2f349488d98b8faf17db9c13a

"

2. My formatter complains about the code style, including: trailing spaces, too long lines, missing spaces after casting and unwanted space after exclamation mark. I suggest to select all code and let Eclipse format the code according to the project rules.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/ProjectInWorkingSetDropAdapterAssistant.java -> Usually the first line of copyrights ends with "and others."

Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/ProjectInWorkingSetDropAdapterAssistant.java -> As it is now an internal xxx@xxx.xxx is no longer needed

Hi Worjceich,

In the case you mention, I would expect that the p2 project would also disappear from w1. IMO, it's better to implement a better behaviour than mimicking the package explorer which isn't very predictable with the behaviour your describe.

I'll try to submit a patch that also removes p2 from w1, and to apply the styling suggestion you mentioned.

"IMO, it's better to implement a better behaviour..." - OK, agree :)
