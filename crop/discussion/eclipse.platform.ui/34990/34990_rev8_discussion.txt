Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Some small issues to deal with.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/ProjectInWorkingSetDropAdapterAssistant.java -> "and others"

Line:92, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/ProjectInWorkingSetDropAdapterAssistant.java -> This should be ITreeSelection

Line:95, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/ProjectInWorkingSetDropAdapterAssistant.java -> This doesn't seem right: you only tested the first segment in the line above.  In the validateDrop() code you've only checked that one of the selection instances is adaptable (and not that all selection instances are adaptable).

Neat: if I drop a project and a file (e.g., MANIFEST.MF from another project), I get the file under the other working set.

This is definitely some nice functionality.  I'll ensure this gets committed if you can fix up the code.
