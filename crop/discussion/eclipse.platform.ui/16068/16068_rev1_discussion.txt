DESCRIPTION

Bug 415241 - Suppress Symbolic links duplicates on the Tasks View

Added a checkbox "Suppress duplicates due to file system links" on
'Configure Contents' Dialog, that is visible only from TasksView and is
checked by default, and its functionality: The duplicate tasks are
removed, and the old/change tasks are removed from the list when the
project is refreshed and all its references are refreshed.
