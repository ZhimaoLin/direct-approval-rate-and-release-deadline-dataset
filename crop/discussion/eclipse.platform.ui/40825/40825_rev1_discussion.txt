DESCRIPTION

Bug 458728 - [ActivityMgmt] Enabling capability doesn't show toolbar
buttons until restart

Don't change model visibility in the setChildVisible() method - because
this method is not a generic method to set the child visibility at all,
it is only for applying the IContributionManagerOverrides state to model
elements. Changed the misleading method name accordingly to
applyOverridenVisibility() to avoid further confusion.
