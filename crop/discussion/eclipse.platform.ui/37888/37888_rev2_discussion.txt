Line:477, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> This change seems to completely disable error dialog from any job belonging to a job group. There will be no error dialog even when the last job in the job group finishes.

Line:477, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> It is true that this change only filters out error status from jobs belonging to a job group, without ensuring that the job group's status is reported.

Please hold off on a review until I have fixed this.
