I have a vague memory we tried this once before, and for some reason it failed. But, I think best course is to try it again, and if it fails again, perhaps Szymon will have time to investigate why. Then again ... should work just fine?

David, I think you meant bug 402055 and bug 434039 where the exclusion list for SWT was added and removed back and forth. The confusion comes from the fact that SWT should include source bundles for platform specific bundles and not for the main bundle, while launcher should do exactly opposite - include source bundles for the main bundle and exclude for platform specific.

I think it's fine to give it a try, because this will give us the expected exclusion list. And if it fails, we will know there is a deeper problem because expected exclusion list does not give expected results.
