Shouldn't have System.err.println()s â€” and I'm not sure we want to accommodate the case of returning something other than a Menu for now.

There seems to be a logic error unrelated to your change in DCI.

Line:462, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolItemRenderer.java -> Seems like a candidate for an assertion here.

Line:442, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/DirectContributionItem.java -> An aside: should this be setting the OWNING_ME to mmenu (the model element)?

The patch bases on the HandledContributionItem.getMenu method. The method skips setting the OWNING_ME data for some reasons. Do you want to set this data anyway?

I will replace the System.err with the proper logger invocation

thanks,
Daniel
