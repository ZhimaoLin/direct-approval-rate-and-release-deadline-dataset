Re: Brian's review. Thanks for the review.

I have reworked the change set.
Actually, I had erroneously mixed transparency and inheritance.
Setting the background to "null" causes the default background color for some widgets and transparency for others (i.e., Label and Button).

But as you have stated, actually it should inherit the color of the parent control, so this is what I have implemented now.

When this change is through, I'll open another bug and implement background-color: transparent for Button and Label by setting the background to "null". This way inherit and transparent are cleanly separated.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Thought about this for a few days.
Maybe, I should come up with a more generic approach for "inherit" handling. 
Please don't merge this now.
