Finally found some time to improve/reiterate.

For the new patchset I started over from scratch and looked at a central point where I could handle "inherit" values in general. I found such a point in the AbstractCSSEngine. Now, when any value matches "inherit", I read the current value of the respective property of the parent element and set this to the child.

The test cases show that this works both for the general case with custom property handlers and with the SWT engine.

Patch Set 5:

Two problems that I see: (1) not all properties support "inherit", but they will now.  (2) If the parent's value changes, we won't be notified unless the change was applied to all children.  I don't know how important these two issues are.
