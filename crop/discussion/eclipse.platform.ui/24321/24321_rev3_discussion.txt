Although the implementation looks right, the test doesn't look right to me.

Line:41, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/css/swt/InheritTest.java -> Hmm, this doesn't seem right: you're testing the cascading rather than the background here.  "inherit" simply means that the background is taken from the parent element (i.e., the Composite).  This test would make more sense if it used:

   Composite { background-color: red; }
   Label { background-color: inherit; }

The one problem here is that Labels inherit their background colour by default anyways.  So you'd need to first set a colour on the label, apply the CSS, and then verify that the label's background colour is the same as that on the Composite.
