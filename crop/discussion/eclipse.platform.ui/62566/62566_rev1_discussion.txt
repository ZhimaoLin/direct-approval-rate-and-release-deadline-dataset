Thanks Sebastian. I suggest to open a separate bug report for the additional tests of filteredTree.

Other than that the patch looks fine. I would only inline the one statement method.

Line:181, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/filteredtree/FilteredTreeTests.java -> Inline, methods with only one statement do not add a lot of value
