I spent a bit time looking through the patch.  I won't stand in the way of this patch, but I found the original code confusing and these changes don't improve it.  

My confusion stems from that 'Maximizable Children' isn't really documented anywhere.  Nor are the special cases that MinMaxAddon has to handle â€” and how Maximizable Children changes those special cases.  The special case handling code seems to be inserted directly into the code, which makes it hard to reason about.  Especially for whomever comes next to change the behaviour for another piece.

I haven't actually tried running with the changes, but it seems to me that there's a case that's not tested where a stack within the MArea is minimized.  What happens if I switch perspectives?  That minimized stack should be carried across, since the area is shared.

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/minmax/MinMaxAddon.java -> Why is this private to this class?  Shouldn't it be on IPresentationEngine, with javadoc describing the effect?
