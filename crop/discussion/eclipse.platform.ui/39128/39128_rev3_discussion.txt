Sounds like an interesting idea â€” but it really needs some tests, and some stylistic practices need to be backed out (i.e., use of Class#isInstance() and Class#cast() is inconsistent with the rest of the code).

Have you thought about loosening the restriction from MArea to MGenericTile?  It would be nice to have a M1+M2+'M' that would progressively maximize a part within its PSC ancestry; it could be handy for the Debug perspective, for example.

I updated the patchset based on your comments.
I like the idea to create a generic solution. I would suggest to open a new bug for the more generic solution using the MGenericTile as it will require more time to get it right.
