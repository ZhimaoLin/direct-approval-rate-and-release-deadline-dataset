DESCRIPTION

Bug 506562 - Progress view shows too many finished jobs

Listeners to be notified should not be filtered asynchronously. Thus we
must keep the list of them to be notified later in the UI thread.

Also, all jobs notifications now goes through throttler.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

This patch fixes the bug, thanks. I've slightly updated it to make sure listeners are traversed in a predictable order (see http://javaclipse.blogspot.com/2016/03/stable-tests-and-transition-to-java-8.html) and also refactored the code to avoid duplications.

Please check if this is OK for you.
