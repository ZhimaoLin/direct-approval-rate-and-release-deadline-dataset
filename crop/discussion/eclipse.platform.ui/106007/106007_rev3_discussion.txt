DESCRIPTION

Bug 525387 - Cannot hide inactive view with its reference

This is a test case for the bug. The test opens a perspective with two
views, both in the same folder. It then retrieves a reference to the
inactive view, and tries to hide the view using this reference. The test
fails, since it can still retrieve a reference to the view. The view can
still be seen in the perspective.

Added test to InternalTestSuite.

Patch Set 3:

I don't see the test reports in https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/13870/testReport/ report any new test. Is this test supposed to be part of the general test suite? Do you see it running locally when doing `mvn clean verify -Pbild-individual-bundles` ?

The test suite InternalTestSuite is currently deactivated in UiTestSuite. I would like to check why and if we could reactivate it.
