DESCRIPTION

Bug 525387 - Cannot hide inactive view with its reference

WorkLeon OchoachPage#hidePart: Just make it more explicit that if-block is
entered when clientObject is null.

HideViewInNewPerspectiveTest: This is a test case for the bug. The test
opens a perspective with two
views, both in the same folder. It then retrieves a reference to the
inactive view, and tries to hide the view using this reference. The test
fails, since it can still retrieve a reference to the view. The view can
still be seen in the perspective.

InternalTestSuite: Added test HideViewInNewPerspectiveTest to suite

Line:1568, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> This is not needed, please leave the code "as is". null is never instanceof of anything.
