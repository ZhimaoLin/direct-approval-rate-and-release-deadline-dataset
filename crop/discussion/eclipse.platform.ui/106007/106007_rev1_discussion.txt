DESCRIPTION

Bug 525387 - Cannot hide inactive view with its reference

This is a test case for the bug. The test opens a perspective with two
views, both in the same folder. It then retrieves a reference to the
inactive view, and tries to hide the view using this reference. The test
fails, since it can still retrieve a reference to the view. The view can
still be seen in the perspective.
