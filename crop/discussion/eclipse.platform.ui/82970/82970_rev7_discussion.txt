> Leo is this what you need/ want?

For the most part, yes. Except that there should be support for both foreground and background (For example as a paramater to ColorFactory).

May I add the functionality?

Sure. I think you cannot ammend my commit, but please add a commit on top of mine. I could merge both after my vacation of the next week. See you in Ludwigsburg?
