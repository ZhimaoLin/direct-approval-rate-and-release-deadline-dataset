Line:164, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> This doesn't work using cleanUp. They seem not to be doing the exact same thing. Should I mess with it or is the unlink method enough? Since the cleanUp is used in other places it may be risky to interfere with what it does and how it does it.
