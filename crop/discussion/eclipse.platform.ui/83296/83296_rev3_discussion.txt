DESCRIPTION

Bug 501849 - Properties view is not updated when selection is changed in
maximized view

We should not consider MINIMIZED_BY_ZOOM for the minimized state at all,
it is just a flag for MinMaxAddon to remember what it has to *restore*.
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501849#c10.
