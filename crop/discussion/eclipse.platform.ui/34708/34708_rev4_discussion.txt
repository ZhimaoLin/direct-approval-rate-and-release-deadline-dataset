Not instantiating perspective bar extras needs to be taking into account.

Line:3898, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> This will instantiate the factories for all of the elements listed in the PERSPECTIVE_BAR_EXTRAS.  Anything from the PERSPECTIVE_BAR_EXTRAS should have the properties that the button in the perspective bar is there, but nothing is instantiated until the first time the user pushes the button.
