DESCRIPTION

Bug 337588 - [EditorMgmt] Editor should have "Close Tabs To The Right"

Added "Close Tabs To The Left" and "Close Tabs To The Right" menus to
the tab area below "Close Others" and above "Close All".

The menus appear only if there is at least one tab on both sides from
the current tab (to not duplicate functionality of "Close Others" which
will do the same job in opposite cases).

Added extra separator before "Close All" to have visual highliht between
close "some" and close "all" menus.

Cool, stuff, this is really useful. I think our code is almost good, IMHO is handles the "first" and "last" editor incorrectly. Also one style-nit.

Line:1397, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I think this should be if (leftFrom > 0) {

To test, select the first item in the list, I would expect the Close to the right menu entry.

Line:1409, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Same as above should IMHO be

if (rightFrom > 0) {

Line:1503, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Use brackets for single statements (I know we are very inconsitent here but this should be the goal)

Line:1397, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I've tried to explain this in the commit message... The rightFrom!=0 check makes sure that if there are no tabs on the right side, we do not need to have "Close Left" menu because it will do the same as "Close Others".

Same for the next if() comment.

Line:1503, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I've just followed the non existing style guideline - "monkey see monkey do" :-)
I think this was copy/paste from above.

Line:1397, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I think this will be confusing for the user (it was confusing for me). Lets keep it even if it does the same thing.
