DESCRIPTION

Bug 337588 - [EditorMgmt] Editor should have "Close Tabs To The Right"

Added "Close Tabs To The Left" and "Close Tabs To The Right" menus to
the tab area below "Close Others" and above "Close All".

The menus appear only if there is at least one tab on both sides from
the current tab (to not duplicate functionality of "Close Others" which
will do the same job in opposite cases).

Added extra separator before "Close All" to have visual highliht between
close "some" and close "all" menus.
