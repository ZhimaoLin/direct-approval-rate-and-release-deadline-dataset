Patch Set 13:

As a note, I've submitted https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/91792/ as a separate patch as requested.

I'll update this patch and the other in the text editor so that everything is done from the outside afterwards so that the macro is no longer a required dependency and everything is done from the outside to mitigate the concern you had raised about the macro being a required dependency of text editors (but for that, the other request really needs to be merged first).

This should really be done before M6 is done (otherwise the macro won't even be doable from the outside and it'll be too late to integrate it in any way).
