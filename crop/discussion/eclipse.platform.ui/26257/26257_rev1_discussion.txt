Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/css2/CSSPropertyFontSWTHandler.java -> We are not able to remove the Control.setRedraw invocations since without it the patch doesn't work

I'm working on better patch for the issue,
Daniel

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I'm -1 to this change as it will re-open bug 422894 which causes an equally bad effect UI experience on GTK (if not worse).

Could you instead put a platform-specific workaround in the code that sets a background colour to setFont(getFont()) for Win32?  E.g., something like:

   if(widget instanceof Tree && Util.isWin()) {
      // workaround screen cheese issue as per bug 433858
      // trees on Win32 are optimized to only redraw current selection
      widget.setFont(widget.getFont());
   }
