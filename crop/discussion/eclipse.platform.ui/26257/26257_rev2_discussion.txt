This is great Daniel.  Some very minor tweaks.

Line:34, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/engine/AbstractCSSSWTEngineImpl.java -> I'd add a comment here about the redraw listeners being required to workaround bug 433858

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/engine/AbstractCSSSWTEngineImpl.java -> Minor tweak: rename to either NEEDS_REDRAW or NEEDS_TO_BE_REDRAWN (note final N)

Line:195, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/engine/AbstractCSSSWTEngineImpl.java -> This dispose listener isn't necessary since it's removing the listeners from the widget being disposed.
