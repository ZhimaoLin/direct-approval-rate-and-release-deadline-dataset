DESCRIPTION

Bug 391430 - Dynamically creating / deleting menu items in Menu and MPopupMenu doesn't work

Reactivate the fix of Sopot and modify it so it can handle the remove
and add of many elements. Additionally the determination of the insert
index changes so it can handle the differences between MenuManager and
E4 model.
