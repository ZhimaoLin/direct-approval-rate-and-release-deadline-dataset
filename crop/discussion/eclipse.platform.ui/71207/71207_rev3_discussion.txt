DESCRIPTION

Bug 206299 - switching tabs using CTRL+TAB is not possible

All platforms except cocoa and carbon are using M1+TAB and M1+M2+TAB to
switch between visible tabs. Cocoa and carbon are unlinked to M1+TAB and
M1+M2+TAB; but linked to M4+TAB and M4+M2+TAB

Perfect!  Thanks Patrik.  I hadn't realized that the tab actions don't wrap.
