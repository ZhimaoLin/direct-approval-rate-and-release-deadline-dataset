I think this is a good fix but just needs a slight modification of one of the conditions.

Line:514, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> It is possible to run with a workspace (and so need workspace locking) but not bother to persist model state.  I think you just need to modify your condition slightly.
