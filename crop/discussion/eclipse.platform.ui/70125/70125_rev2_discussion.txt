Line:362, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/WBWRenderer.java -> Use wbwShell.getDisplay().  This logic still doesn't seem right as it's ignoring monitor configurations.

Line:362, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/WBWRenderer.java -> Here's a version that takes them into account. I've filed a bug for the code duplication this introduces and will clean it up after our API unfreezes.
