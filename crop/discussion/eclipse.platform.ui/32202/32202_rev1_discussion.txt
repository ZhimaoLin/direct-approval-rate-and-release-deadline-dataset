You're right that the code has a bug, but there's no guarantee that Viewer#getSelection() doesn't return null.  Indeed AbstractViewer#getSelection() returns null.  You need both a not-null and not-empty.

Thank you Brian. So I will also add the null check again. But in my opinion every viewer should follow the Null-Pattern(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern).
I also had this change: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/32074/1 in the back of my mind, where the getStructuredSelection() method is used.
But youÂ´re right because we cannot guarantee that this is always the case, as clients may override the getSelection() or getStructuredSelection() method and return null.
