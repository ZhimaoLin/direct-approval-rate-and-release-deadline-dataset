> there's no guarantee that Viewer#getSelection() doesn't return null.

There is a guarantee. As per Eclipse API rules null is not allowed unless specified in the Javadoc.


> Indeed AbstractViewer#getSelection() returns null.

If an NPE happens, then this is the AbstractViewer's problem.

The change in patch set 1 was correct.
