Did you test it?

Looking at the code, ChooseWorkspaceData(URL) already sets the location.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to test it yet. What is an efficient way to try change on the dialog as PDE Run Config don't show it?
This is the only occurence I found of referencing a "workspace" folder in the repository, so I thought just changing it should be enough.

Just make the 'Location' field empty.
