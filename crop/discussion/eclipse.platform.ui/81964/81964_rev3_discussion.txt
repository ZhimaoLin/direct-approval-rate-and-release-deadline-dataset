Did you test it this time? For me it does not work. 'initialDefault' is already set (!= null) and I already mentioned that ChooseWorkspaceData(URL) sets the location.

Yes, I did test it, and I know it's not enough. The actual fix needs to get in Equinox, however I believe it's worth adopting this here by the way.
