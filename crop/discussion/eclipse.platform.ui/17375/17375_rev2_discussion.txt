The fix is technically correct, but has two trivial issues:
- it uses Tab instead of spaces for indentation
- the new comment:
  // may throw IllegalArgumentException
  is overkill. We also don't list the possible exceptions of 
  #parseInt.

This is not worth for another round-trip, so I'll just fix this after submitting this change.
