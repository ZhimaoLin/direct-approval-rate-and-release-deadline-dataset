Just one question for UIDialogs

Line:160, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/dialogs/UIDialogs.java -> Why is that test not failing?

Line:67, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/commands/Bug74990Test.java -> Didn't know that is is allowed to remove the exception if the subclasses defines it but this compiles well.

Jeanderson, are you still available? If yes, can you locally rebase this change onto master?

Hi Lars, glad to hearing from you.
I'm resolving the conflicts (just realized that this is why I can't use the rebase button) and I will update this very patch as soon as possible.

Line:160, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/dialogs/UIDialogs.java -> Good question Lars. I didn't notice that this test is supposed to fail. Apparently this test is not being executed in the test suite. I will check this.
