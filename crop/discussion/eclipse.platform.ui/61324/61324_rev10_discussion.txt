DESCRIPTION

Bug 476037 Bug 483359 - Sync FontRegistry and preferences

Currently, the fonts are stored in several places:
* JFaceResources.getFontRegistry()
* currentTheme.getFontRegistry(), different from above
* PrefUtil.getInternalStore(), used by preference page.

There are already multiple synchronisation mechanisms in
place, but some seem to be missing. This change:
* adds some synchronization mechanism from currentTheme.
getFontRegistry() to internal preference store
* Makes the preferencePage rely mostly on preferences for
setting fonts, then changes appear to be synchronizaed where
they have to.
