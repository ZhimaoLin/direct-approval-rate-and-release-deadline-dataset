File Comment: tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/preferences/ZoomAndPreferencesFontTestCase.java -> It would be good to have a test case that is independent of Platform Text.

Line:1848, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> What if the theme changes?

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-2 Verified-1

This partially fixes the scenario outlined in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/61324/ but the problem is that after that, the Java editor font is no longer connected to the Text font after 'Reset'.

Patch Set 6:

A similar issue can be reproduced with the plain preference page, highlighting the lack of consistency in the meaning of "default":
0. With a Java editor open, open preference page
1. Edit font for Java editor, set size to let's say 24; Apply; see editor updated
2. Edit font for text editors, set size to 24; Apply. Check Java font in the tree, it says "Set to Default"
3. Reset Text font; Apply; multiple issue
-> The Java font says "set to default" and shows the default value
-> The editor isn't updated and still shows a 24pts font.
4. Reopen preference page
-> This time, the 2 values are "unlinked".

So it seems like the issue is more in the behaviour of "reset" than in the handlers or synchronization mechanism implemented here.
The issue happens specifically when a font and an ancestor are manually set to the same value. The usage of the Theme API for the zoom handlers is comparable to sequential manual changes on all fonts to set in the "family"
