I can reproduce it too. Filed bug 483359 to track that.

As said, the test should not depend on Text (or at least not fail if it is missing).

In my workspace both tests fail with an NPE:
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.eclipse.ui.tests.preferences.ZoomAndPreferencesFontTestCase.restoreDefaultFontAndOpenEditor(ZoomAndPreferencesFontTestCase.java:83)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)

Patch Set 7:

As mentioned by Mickael, the current change does not fix the Reset case.

We need steps (independent of the Zoom feature) that this change actually fixes and that allow us to verify the change.

The proposed change indicates that we have a similar issue with the colors.

This change makes the situation for the preference page worse:

1. new workspace
2. add a Java file and open it in the editor
3. change Text font via pref page; OK ==> Java editor font will change
4. Reset Text font on pref page; OK ==> Java editor font will change

I can easily reproduce this issue. I believe that the issue of the Reset button has to be addressed as part of that change.
