DESCRIPTION

Bug 425525 - [ViewMgmt] Properties View does not populate with workLeon Ochoach
selection when first opened and activated

While properties view is opening, the page active view is the property
view itself, so we can't use it to compute the originating "interesting"
part and populate initial selection.

Fortunately, the current page selection is still provided by the last
active part (view or editor). So we compare the active editor and all
visible views if the selection matches - and the one which has exact the
expected selection is the last active part. If this part is interesting,
it will be used to initially populate the selection.
