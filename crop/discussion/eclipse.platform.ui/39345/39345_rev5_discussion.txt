Thanks Andrey looks good to me. I as a followup we should also remove the unused experimental API from ICoolbarManager2. I created https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=457320 for that.

Line:418, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> I think we should also throw an UnsupportedOperationException here and remove its usage. Opened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=457319
