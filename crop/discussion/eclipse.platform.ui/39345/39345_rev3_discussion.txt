DESCRIPTION

UnsupportedOperationException where appropriate. Removed commented out
debug statements, inconsistent braces style, unnecessary casts and line
breaks.

Thanks Andrey, just the names are not like they are typically.

Line:261, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarManagerRenderer.java -> So far our "naming conversions" is subscribeTopicTopicDescription, e,g., here subscribeTopicDirtyChanged or subscribeTopicDirty would be fitting.

Line:352, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarManagerRenderer.java -> I would prefer to remove this method.

Line:261, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarManagerRenderer.java -> This class had two methods with subscribeTopicTopic and two with more descriptive names, so I've chosen more human readable way. I can change it as you like but I honestly don't see much value in this:

xxx@xxx.xxx

should be written IMHO as

xxx@xxx.xxx

but it's just matter of personal style again.

Please don't get me wrong, but if you want to change the code style in the way you like it - just go ahead and change it, you have commit rights.

I as a contributor see no value and *lot* of overhead for me in making rounds and rounds around code which I didn't even touched only to get some kind of convention in a code which was a mess from any viewpoint from very beginning but at *that* time it was OK to commit any piece of sh, obviously without any review...

This is the best way to keep people away from contributing, because instead of working on real problem we are trying to polish code to some kind ideal state.

What I personally would prefer - keep review on *changed* code and try to cleanup "style" things after the bugs are fixed.

This is a valid point. Thanks for this contribution. I look at it again tomorrow and merge it, if I don't find any issues with it during testing.
