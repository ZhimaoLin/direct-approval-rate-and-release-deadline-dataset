Patch Set 2:

Even as import package, though, that introduces a dependency on the workLeon Ochoach.  There's still a risk, as we were talking about including import package in the topological sort of the ModelAssembler (since we found out they're currently ignored).

I'm just looking at fixing topoSort to handle cycles.

Patch Set 2:

I have a fix for the toposort, but I'll submit it separately, and include test cases too.

Patch Set 2:

Topo sort fixed, but the point about the workLeon Ochoach is still valid.  I'd be happy to move this out into a separate fragment â€” restore org.eclipse.ui.cocoa?

Patch Set 2:

Yeah, I think we'll have to create org.eclipse.ui.cocoa again.
