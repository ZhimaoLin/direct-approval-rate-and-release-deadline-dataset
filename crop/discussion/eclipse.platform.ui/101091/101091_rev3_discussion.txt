Line:1385, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> I probably modified this line and undid the change, so JDT formatter applied. But it's indeed a useless change.

Line:899, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> One issue I have here is that all mnemonics are already used by other buttons on that page.
As a workaround, we could consider more explicit button labels such as "Add editor" and "Remove editor" but that would make very large buttons.
Do you have another suggestion of how to handle that?
