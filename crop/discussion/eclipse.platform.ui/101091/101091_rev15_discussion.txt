DESCRIPTION

Bug 519815 - Associate Editor with ContentType from Preferences

Added new viewer with respective buttons to do the actual associations.
It allows end-users to understand where a file/editor association is 
provided. Currently, only File/editor mapping are shown (and editable) 
as preferences, and user don't get a chance to understand what defines 
other (content-type based) associations.
As user can define content-types, the next natural action they'd like to
do once the content-type is defined is to associate an editor with it. 
At the moment, defining content-type still requires to use a File/Editor
association to associate new types with editors

Line:340, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ContentTypesPreferencePage.java -> The current associated editors are not filtered out from the selection. This causes an issue where you can add the same editor that is already added, enabling the remove button on editors that can not be removed. See FileEditorsPreferencePage.java line 515 for example of filtering.
