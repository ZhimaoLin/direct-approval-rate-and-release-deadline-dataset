Line:899, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> Is there something against changing Edit's mnemonic to 'i' and using the next available letter in the words; 's', 'd', and 'm' respectfully?

Line:899, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> We can do that for Remove and Edit, but for "Add", both 'a' and 'd' are already used as mnemonics.

Line:899, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> That is why I suggested changing 'Edit's mnemonic to 'i' as it is currently using the 'd'
