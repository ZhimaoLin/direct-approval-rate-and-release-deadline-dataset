Patch Set 9:

Have you tried putting the 3 groups below each other? As neither file associations nor editor associations will have more than few entries they don't need that much vertical space. 
This would have the good effect of better aligning widgets too.

Patch Set 9:

I did try it, and by putting those on a single column, it can give the impression of a cascade, ie that that the editor association applies to the File extension/name rather than to the content-type.
By using 2 columns, it made it clearer that the association belongs to the content-type. If it's still not clear enough, we can use some more spacing between groups.
