Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

AbstractListViewer has warnings which are type related

List is a raw type. References to generic type List<E> should be parameterized

StructuredViewer:
Unchecked cast from Object[] to 
 E[]

Maybe xxx@xxx.xxx to the applyFontsAndColors method?

Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractListViewer.java -> Unchecked exception please xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:368, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractListViewer.java -> Why not generified?
