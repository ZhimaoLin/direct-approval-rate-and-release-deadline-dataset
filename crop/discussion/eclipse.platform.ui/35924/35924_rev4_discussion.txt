Line:88, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/filteredtree/FilteredTree.java -> Is this still valid? We always choose the new look.

Line:91, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/filteredtree/FilteredTree.java -> private field, no since required IMHO

Line:300, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/filteredtree/FilteredTree.java -> Why is this not necessary?

Line:300, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/filteredtree/FilteredTree.java -> I removed the whole toolbar, because it never is created. In the old one it has been created here: org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.FilteredTree.createClearTextOld(Composite) , but this method does not exist any more.

Line:774, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/filteredtree/FilteredTree.java -> I cannot see any difference between the pressed image and the inactive image, because the pressed image is a gray version of the activeImage just like the inactiveImage is.
Therefore it isn't worth registering a mousemove listener, which actually does nothing.

Even though I will add it again so that we do not lose any functionality. Maybe on a different OS you see a difference.
