Patch Set 8: Code-Review+1

My only question: in 3.x the list seemed to be kept on a per-perspective basis whereas Tomasz' solution is on a per-window basis.  I don't use Show In so I don't have a feeling as to how important this is.

I don't use perspectives, so for me, it also doesn't matter;-) Since the order has been broken for years now, I don't think many will notice this change at all. And it's also not clear why per-perspective would be better than per-window, per-workLeon Ochoach, or per-view.
