Line:928, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/minmax/TrimStack.java -> Code smell: if the trim stack's parent has any sort of layout, this call to pack() shouldn't be here. At best, it will resize the toolbar twice, causing flicker. At worst, it may be overriding the size specified by the layout and causing it to overlap its neighbors.

The only case where this would be valid is in the unlikely case where the parent has no layout, in which case there's no need to call requestLayout since it would be a no-op.

I suspect the requestLayout call is legit and the pack() call is bogus... but the only way to know for sure is to test it (check in the debugger if trimStackTB.getParent().getLayout() is null or not -- if it's non-null, keep requestLayout and delete pack())

Line:928, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/minmax/TrimStack.java -> Is trimStackTB.getParent().getLayout() really the correct place to check? I think trimStackTB.getLayout() is the relevant one.
 
trimStackTB has no layout so the pack call seems necessary. requestLayout resizes IMHO the parent
