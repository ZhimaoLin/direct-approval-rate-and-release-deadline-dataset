DESCRIPTION

[nobug] .launch file specifies Java 1.5 instead of 1.8

Fairly minor issue, but after seeing a "DNF" one day, I tried to run the
tests locally to see if anything was unusual about them. There was not
but I noticed the "launch" file had "changed". Would be a nice touch to
clean those up so they would be "ready to run".
