DESCRIPTION

Bug 354538 - [regression] Duplicate menu items with
DynamicMenuContributions

To fix bug regression from bug 518036 we should not call
clearModelToContribution() on removeDynamicMenuContributions(): this
will remove also not dynamic children, which results in duplicated
entries next time menu is opened.
