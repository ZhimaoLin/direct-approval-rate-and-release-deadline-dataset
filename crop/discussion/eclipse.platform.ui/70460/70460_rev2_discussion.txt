I think the problem must be fixed at the source, and not at the client side. Whoever sends events about null parts should stop doing this.

Line:184, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/actions/RetargetAction.java -> I think the caller code is the actual place to fix. No listener should receive events about null parts being deactivated.

Line:1058, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/part/PageBookView.java -> I wonder who supplies the null partRef. The caller of this method should be fixed, not the code here.

Line:127, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Testable.java -> Please move this to another commit, it has nothing to do with the original issue (this is test code only). Also why the display should be disposed before we call workbench.close() few lines below?

Line:228, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> How is this possible? Is the part disposed before it is deactivated?
