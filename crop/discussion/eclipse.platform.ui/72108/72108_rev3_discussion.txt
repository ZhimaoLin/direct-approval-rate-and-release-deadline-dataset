DESCRIPTION

Bug 492974 - "Build All" icon placed on top of the existing icon in
toolbar

This change resolves the problem by changing 
ToolBarManager#relayout() to call requestLayout(), instead of
getParent().layout().

In future versions we should also add a new bug to address a re-design
of the CoolBar layout.
