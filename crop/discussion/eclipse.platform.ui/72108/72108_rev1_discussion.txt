DESCRIPTION

Bug 492974 - "Build All" icon placed on top of the existing icon in
toolbar

This change is my proposed solution, that consists in changing 
ToolBarManager#relayout(ToolBar layoutBar, int oldCount, int newCount) 
by adding a final call to Control#requestLayout()

Line:210, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> Suggestion for future work: This should really work if we just deleted the body of this if statement and replaced it with a single call to layoutBar.requestLayout()... but it probably won't actually work because of the way CoolBar relies on an explicit setSize call to determine its CoolItem sizes. If we could fix CoolBar's layout to make it use the computed sizes of its children directly, it would really simplify this code.

Line:220, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> You shouldn't be calling both getParent().layout() and getParent().requestLayout(). Delete this.

Line:231, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> This early return would cause the method to skip the (very important) call to requestLayout.

Line:237, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> layoutBar is the thing that changed, so do layoutBar.requestLayout() -- remove the getParent() call.
