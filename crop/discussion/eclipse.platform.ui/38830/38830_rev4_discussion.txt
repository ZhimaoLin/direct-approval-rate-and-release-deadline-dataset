DESCRIPTION

Bug 305336 - Ability to open a file from command line at a specific line/col

Allow specifying a file with optional line and column.  We accept

  path:line
  path:line:column
  path+line
  path+line:column

We use reflection to avoid having to depend on text-related plugins
Based on initial contribution from Sienna Tate.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

I recant my previous review: let's put this in place and we can adjust the code as necessary. I've reworked this a little bit to support '+' and ':' as the line separator.
