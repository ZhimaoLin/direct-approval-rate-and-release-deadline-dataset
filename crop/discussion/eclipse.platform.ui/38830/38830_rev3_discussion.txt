DESCRIPTION

Bug 305336 - Ability to open a file from command line at a specific line/col

Allow specifying a file with optional line and column.  We accept

  path:line
  path:line:column
  path+line
  path+line:column

We use reflection to avoid having to depend on text-related plugins
Based on initial contribution from Sienna Tate.
