DESCRIPTION

Bug 305336 - Ability to open a file from command line at a specific
line/col

The format accepted is my/file.py+line:col. We do that by manually
parsing the path for this pattern and if we do find it we select/reveal
it later on (using reflection to avoid having to depend on text-related
plugins at this org.eclipse.ui.ide.application).

Thanks for taking a stab at this, Fabio.  But this kind of reflection is a nightmare, and it doesn't work for editor types that use some other internal scheme.  I'll post a bit more on a possible approach to the bug report.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/DelayedEventsProcessor.java -> I think that Copyright year should be updated to 2010-2015
