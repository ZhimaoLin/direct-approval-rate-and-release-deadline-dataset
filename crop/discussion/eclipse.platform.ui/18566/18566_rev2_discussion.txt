Patch Set 2: Verified-1 Code-Review-2

As expressed in the bug 421930 comment 1, I'd prefer to improve the existing import wizard.

Regarding the concrete patch:
- overidding Ctrl+O is a no go and causes warnings
- the code does not compile since 1.5 types are used in a 
  project that uses J2SE-1.4.

Patch Set 2:

Oops, I have several change in this review. I'm going to clean it.
As I also explained on the bug, I don't find very relevant to tweak an existing wizard for that. Do you plan to work on it?
Anyway, such a wizard could be merged for a milestone, and maybe improved or merged back into an existing wizard later if someone is ready to do it.
