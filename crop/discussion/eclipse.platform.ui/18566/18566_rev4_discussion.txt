Patch Set 4: Verified-1

The wizard comes up with errors in the UI (also on the fields) which is a no go (offending for the user). Besides the fact that we don't use error/warning icons on individual fields, they don't seem to update correctly.

The first directory I selected happened to be one which is already an Eclipse project and in that case the wizard refuses to import and directs me to the other wizard. This clearly shows that those two belong together.

The wizard does not allow me to choose the type/natures of the new project. This is bad, since in 99% of the cases a simple project will not be enough and there is no easy way to e.g. convert it to a Java or Plug-in project.

Other things I saw when using it:
- Import strategy can't be chosen (seems always disabled)
- wrong use of sentence vs. title style
- missing mnemonic
- missing colon
- radio options should be in a bordered group without colon
  in the group name

Before you start working on those issues, I suggest you try to add this to the existing wizard or find a committer that will support this direction here.

Thanks for the review

> The wizard comes up with errors in the UI (also on the fields) which is a no go (offending for the user).

Ok, I can disable them when wizard opens.

> Besides the fact that we don't use error/warning icons on individual fields, they don't seem to update correctly.

Is using field decorators a no-go? I like them as I feel they make easier to notice where to fix stuff.
Can you provide a scenario where there is an issue with these decorators?

> The first directory I selected happened to be one which is already an Eclipse project and in that case the wizard refuses to import and directs me to the other wizard. This clearly shows that those two belong together.

The current import existing projects wizard is IMO too complicated for this use-case. What we can do instead is that if a ,project exists, the projectName field get set as it is in the ,project and gets disabled, and clicking finish would have the same behaviour than importing a single project.
WDYT?

Is there an existing wizard page I could re-use or use as example for that?

> Import strategy can't be chosen (seems always disabled)

Yes, the wizard currently only support reference, setting up copy was not top-priority as I was more interested in a usability discussion.

> - wrong use of sentence vs. title style

Do you have guidelines on these topics?

> - missing colon

Definitely fixable ;)

> - radio options should be in a bordered group without colon

Ok, I'll change that

> Before you start working on those issues, I suggest you try to add this to the existing wizard

As I explained there is no existing wizard that would make this scenario easy IMO.

You happen to be this committer ;)

Having errors and warnings on individual fields was considered to be noisy (Christmas tree) and hence not used by us. The only one which is used is the light bulb for hints and only when the field has the focus.


> The current import existing projects wizard is IMO too complicated for this use-case. ... WDYT?

I think it's better to only have one project importer. I doubt it will become that complicated.

See the New Project Wizard. CVS Check Out As... serves as an example.


> Do you have guidelines on these topics?

Not really. The comments I made will also be useful for you when you upgrade the existing wizard ;-).
