Patch Set 5:

Patch Set 5 fixes some minor issues.

I have a question:
* The New Project wizard for a plain "Project" allows me to select referenced project, but I don't see any page allowing to select Natures. Am I missing something?
In general, I don't know how can a user change the Nature of a new or a given projects, except by selecting the specific wizard.

Abandoned

I think this is now done in the e4 incubator. Mickael, please restore if that is not true.
