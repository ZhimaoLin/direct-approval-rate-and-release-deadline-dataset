Line:47, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The import seems to be unused so I've removed it. I have made several tests for the IDE and the RCP 3.x/4.x applications including our Contact demo application and all works fine without it. The unit tests work properly with this change as well
