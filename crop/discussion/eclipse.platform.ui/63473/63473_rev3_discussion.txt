DESCRIPTION

Bug 485021 - Properties view display properties of old selection

Remember if the view was hidden, let the internal selection be updated
if the view is hidden (but do not proceed the actual UI changes to not
reintroduce bug 479855) and let the UI update to the selection in case
the view is activated again.
