Hi, I just added a simple test to validate that the dynamic toolbar contributions are now taking into account. Please let me know if you need something more to accept the contribution. Thank you very much.

Two small changes and then it's good to go from me.

Line:35, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/menus/MenusTestSuite.java -> Could you put a comment here to say that

FIXME: MenusTestSuite was previously disabled in UiTestSuite and these tests are yet to be validated/fixed up

Line:50, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/menus/DynamicToolbarTest.java -> This needs to be a static class as it can't be created via the IExtensionRegistry.  It results in reams of exceptions:

!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.equinox.registry 4 1 2016-04-18 10:17:43.218
!MESSAGE Plug-in "org.eclipse.ui.tests" was unable to instantiate class "org.eclipse.ui.tests.menus.DynamicToolbarTest$MyStatusBar".
