Line:76, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/RenderedElementUtil.java -> We probably need a xxx@xxx.xxx x.y" annotation there, since it's a new API.

At first sight, the code seems to do the job, and doesn't seem to introduce any regression. So it would be acceptable from my POV. However, I cannot tell whether it's the best way of doing things.

I just put -1 because I believe it's missing xxx@xxx.xxx

I'll take a deeper look this afternoon, but I think this needs to enable or create some tests.  I was looking at the corresponding DynamicMenuContributionElement and there are some tests org.eclipse.ui.tests's MenuBaseTests.java. We should have something similar for toolbar contribution tasks.
