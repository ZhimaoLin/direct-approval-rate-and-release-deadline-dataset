Hi Brian,

Ok I will take a look at MenuBaseTests.java and try to do something similar for the dynamic controls in toolbar. 

Thank you.

Patch Set 2:

MenuBaseTests & DynamicMenuTest already tests dynamic contributions but are not enabled. I propose to enable these tests. What do you think about it ?

They should definitely be enabled.  But unless I'm missing something, they test menu contributions, not toolbar contributions.
