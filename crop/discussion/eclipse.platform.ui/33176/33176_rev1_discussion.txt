DESCRIPTION

442570 - Dynamic menu contributions are persisted to
 workLeon Ochoach.xmi
 
 Dynamic menu items are were removed asynchronously in
 MenuManagerShowProcessor with the effect
 that when the workLeon Ochoach exits a copy of any dynamic items was saved to
 workspace.xml and the each time the workLeon Ochoach is started an additional
 duplicate of the dynamic entry was added to the menu.
 
 This has now been moved to MenuManagerHideProcessor, but If there is a
 context menu containing dynamic items and the user opens the menu and
 then right clicks on a different object in the same control to open
 another copy of the same menu, then duplicate entries of the dynamic
 item will appear.
 
 To avoid this we now make a copy of the current dynamic items which is
 then used inside a call to asyncExec to actually delete the old 
 dynamic menu items and hide the old items (.setVisible(false)) to
 prevent them showing in the new menu popup.
