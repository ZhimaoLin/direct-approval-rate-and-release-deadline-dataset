DESCRIPTION

Bug 410426 - VisibleWhen from contribution factories not handled in
toolbars

ToolbarContributionRecord did not handle the factory case in
anyVisibleWhen() and always return false for contributions through
org.eclipse.ui.menus.ExtensionContributionFactory.

This commit also correct a ClassCastException in
ToolBarManagerRenderer.toBeRenderedUpdater EventHandler: the
IContributionItem is not always a ContributionItem, it could be a
MenuManager too. 

Bug410426Test contains two tests which checks the corrected behaviors.
