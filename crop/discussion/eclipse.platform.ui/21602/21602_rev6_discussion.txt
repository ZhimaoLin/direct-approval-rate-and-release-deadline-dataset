DESCRIPTION

Bug 410426 - VisibleWhen from contribution factories not handled in
toolbars

ToolbarContributionRecord did not handle the factory case in
anyVisibleWhen() and always return false for contributions through
org.eclipse.ui.menus.ExtensionContributionFactory.

This commit also correct a ClassCastException in
ToolBarManagerRenderer.toBeRenderedUpdater EventHandler: the
IContributionItem is not always a ContributionItem, it could be a
MenuManager too. 

Bug410426Test contains two tests which checks the corrected behaviors.

Just a minor remark, you have unnecessary whitespace in your commit. Can you use Eclipse4.4M5 or higher and remove them? Before that JDT added them (based on a bug).

Line:61, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/menus/DeclaredProgrammaticFactoryForToolbarVisibilityTest.java -> Style nit, use Eclipse 4.4M5 to prevent JDT to add this whitespace...
