DESCRIPTION

Bug 420479 - [Commands] Add HandlerUtil.getCurrentStructuredSelection

This adds a getCurrentStructuredSelection which returns an empty
collection if nothing is set. This is similar to the implementation of
StructuredViewer but different from getCurrentSelection in HandlerUtil
which returns null. IMHO following teh StructuredViewer pattern makes it
simpler for caller, but if someone disagrees we can change it to return
null.
