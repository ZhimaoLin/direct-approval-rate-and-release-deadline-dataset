DESCRIPTION

Bug 420479 - [Commands] Add HandlerUtil.getCurrentStructuredSelection

The suggested patch adds a getCurrentStructuredSelection method which
returns an empty collection if a structured selection is not available. 

This is similar to the implementation of StructuredViewer but different
from getCurrentSelection in HandlerUtil which returns null. 

IMHO following the StructuredViewer pattern makes it simpler for
caller,e.g,
org.eclipse.ltk.internal.ui.refactoring.actions.DeleteResourcesHandler.
