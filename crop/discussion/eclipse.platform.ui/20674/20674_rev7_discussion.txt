Looks good.  I had 2 flavours of comments:

1) Opaque items it's always an IContributionItem, so the OpaqueElementUtils get and set methods could be better typed.

2) there were 2 or 3 locations where we associated the element with the ICI in the renderer but we don't set the opaque or rendered item.

It's up to you if you want to commit this and then fix those in a follow up or fix them and commit.

Thanks,
Paul

Line:3275, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> This could return an IContributionItem

Line:101, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/OpaqueElementUtil.java -> This should always be an IContributionItem or null.

Line:159, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/OpaqueElementUtil.java -> For Opaque items, this will always be an IContributionItem.

Line:738, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> I know we didn't set it in the past, but is this a good place to set the opaque item as well?

Line:1191, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> I wonder why we don't set the opaque item here (same question w.r.t. the opaque tool item).  It seems most other places set the item.

Line:571, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/PopupMenuExtender.java -> This could be changed to an IContributionItem and checked for null.
