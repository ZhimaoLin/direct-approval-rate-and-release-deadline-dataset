DESCRIPTION

Bug 487570 - Move Navigate -> Maximize and Minimize current View or
Editor to Windows -> Appearance menu

Removed Minimize/Maximize instances of IWorkLeon OchoachAction, added
programmatically in WorkLeon OchoachActionBuilder#addKeyboardShortcuts(.)

Refactored the Appearance menu to have all its items are added
declaratively via xml, including the Minimize/Maximize

NOTE: In ActionFactory, the public static fields MAXIMIZE and MINIMIZE,
are kept to avoid compatibility issues. However, the fields are now
marked as Deprecated, since there should be no caller.
