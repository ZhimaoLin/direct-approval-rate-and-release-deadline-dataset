DESCRIPTION

Bug 487570 - Move Navigate -> Maximize and Minimize current View or
Editor to Windows -> Appearance menu

Removed Minimize/Maximize instances of IWorkLeon OchoachAction, added
programmatically in WorkLeon OchoachActionBuilder#addKeyboardShortcuts(.)

Refactored the Appearance menu to have all its items are added
declaratively via xml, including the Minimize/Maximize

NOTE: In ActionFactory, I left the public static fields MAXIMIZE and
MINIMIZE, to avoid creating compatibility issues. However, I marked them
as Deprecated, since there should be no caller
