Snjezana, I think your change could lead to UI freezes, if the save jobs are running very long. I think a safer way is to use the new JobGroup API with a pool size of one. I updated your review with the change. Could you have a look at let me know what you are thinking?

Line:1275, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Not sure how likely it is, but this might the IDE to freeze if the saving takes a very long time. I upload a new revision of your change using the new JobGroup API. This should ensure that Jobs are queued but not blocking
