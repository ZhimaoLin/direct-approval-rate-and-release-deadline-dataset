Line:1263, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Can this not result in loosing data? If a job is already running, a change happens and the system want to save again, would that lock not loose the new data?

Line:1292, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Should that be equals?

Patch Set 1:

The Jobs API can now schedule jobs based on Job families and define  limit for parallel executing jobs. Maybe this can be used to ensure that only job run at the same time.

Line:1263, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> I have updated the patch so that it waits for a previous job to finish.

Line:1292, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> You are right. I have fixed it.
