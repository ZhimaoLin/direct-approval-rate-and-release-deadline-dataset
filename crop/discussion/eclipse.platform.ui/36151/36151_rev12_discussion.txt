Patch Set 12:

The code is going to work but is creates a bad precedent of improper use of JobGroup functionality. It would be nice to have the fix redone.

I tried to avoid having to do it myself, but I guess it is inevitable. I'll add it to my (pretty long) TODO list.

I think the first version of the patch is the best.

The saveAndCleanJob job is periodically called (every 5 minutes by default) and isn't related to any changes in the system. The issue can happen if a required period is small so that a new job is scheduled before the previous job is completed. 
Using this patch, we increase the period when it is too small.
The new data is saved correctly the next time the job is called.

I have created a new patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/41523
