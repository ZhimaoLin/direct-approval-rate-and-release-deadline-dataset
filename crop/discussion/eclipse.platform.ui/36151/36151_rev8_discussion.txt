Line:1302, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> This is not a proper use of JobGroup. Job groups should not be used to achieve mutual exclusion since this is what scheduling rules are for.

If you are ok with creating multiple save jobs as long as they don't execute concurrently, you can use a scheduling rule. If you want to prevent creation of redundant save jobs, you should implement a specialized synchronization mechanism for this specific use case.

Line:1302, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> The patch has been updated based on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=405542#c5

JobGroup ensures only one job (cleanAndSaveJob) to run at one moment that is in accordance with the Eclipse Job Groups proposal,  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iayTYP2KMz13EeJP9uMpBlL93ZFND5apG-rJG-7kjSU/edit?usp=sharing):

"A JobGroup can be configured with a throttling parameter, that determines the number of jobs from the group that are allowed to run in parallel, or, more accurately, the maximum number of worker threads that may be used to run the jobs belonging to the group."

Line:1302, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> A JobGroup does limit the number of jobs that can run concurrently, but that functionality is intended for throttling, not mutual exclusion. I'm going to update JobGroup JavaDoc to emphasize this fact.
