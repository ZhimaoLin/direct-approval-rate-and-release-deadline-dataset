Louis, is there still something missing? If I use your patch the find method does not find the Addon and the addons are added at every startup.

Patch Set 2:

I commited these changes after working on another uncommited branch on my side...I did not starting working on this bug from the master. 

Since the other commit is not and will not be merged (because of performance concern identify by Eric).

The current findElement method is not looking for Addons, and many other type of elements.

To make this code work, we need to create resolve anothr bug to retreive addons from the findElement method.

Patch Set 2:

To discover addons we must modify the findElementsRecursive to add two simple lines to the method.  Addons are at the application level.

so:
We just need to add => app.getAddons() to the "children" list the same way as BindingsTable...

How do you want to proceed?  Create a patch for this bug or create another bug to find make the search API find Addons?

I think Eric suggest some changes to your patch but I think once you adjust it, he is ok to merge it.
