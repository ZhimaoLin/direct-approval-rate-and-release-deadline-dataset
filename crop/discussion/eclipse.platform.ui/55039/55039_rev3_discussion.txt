Thanks for doing this Nevaeh Wu. There are two other places that need a tweak.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/TrimBarLayout.java -> I think this is typically described as orientation, not alignment.  Should spell out the meaning of true or false; If true, items are placed in a horizontal orientation, otherwise in a vertical orientation.

Line:339, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/TrimBarLayout.java -> What does this point represent?  Pixels from the top left?
