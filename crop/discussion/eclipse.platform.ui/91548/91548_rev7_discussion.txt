OK, I give up with background. This is for later, there is no common color I see in the styles we can use to make everyone happy.

So what about this: we keep the hidden tabs bold as before, but make the current italic? This will make happy everyone used to see old lists, but we have can make some progress with exchanging the CycleEditorHandler and chevron list with the current state.
