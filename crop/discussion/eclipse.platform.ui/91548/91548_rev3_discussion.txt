With this second version, I changed the behavior of the StyledCellLabelProvider, so it can highlight the whole TableViewerRow.

Have you removed my changes intentionally?

Andrey, sorry, you were too fast in reviewing. 
Your changes are ok for me. 
I just wanted to add the change with the hack, so you could examine that. But, when I added the change, I saw you pushed another change there.

Patrik, the change in StyledCellLabelProvider should not be part of this patch for two reasons: it changes the behavior of a very basic JFace class and it should not be mixed with unrelated changes on editors list.

If this is something we need to fix, we should open a bug for it and discuss if this will work for all clients or not.

Can you please restore the second version (with my changes), or should I do this?

I agree, I'll open a new bug for that.

The second version is not working on Windows with default theme. 
I'm investigating this, and pushing it tonight.
