Andrey, hope you don't mind reviewing this change. 

With this change, the selected editor is styled in bold, and the hidden editors have a grey background. However, the gray background does not fill the entire table row, but only the text.

Do you know if there is a known solution?
If not, I could provide a workaround editing  StyledCellLabelProvider#paint(..)
