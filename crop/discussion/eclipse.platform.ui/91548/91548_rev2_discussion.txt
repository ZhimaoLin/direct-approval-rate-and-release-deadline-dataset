Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Patrik, I've slightly fixed the font handling and also changed the way how background color is set, to support "dark theme" &  Co.

Right now the patch sets the background only if the default theme is used. For all other themes the background is not used *yet*, because this can collide with the foreground font color (it is hard to read "white on gray").

@Lars: I have no experience with CSS: how we can make the editor list be supported by CSS of the theme? Ideally we could just use theme color for COLOR_TITLE_INACTIVE_BACKGROUND.

Anyway, this change makes sense and in case we don't get answer soon, I think it is worth to merge because it is a definitive gradual improvement to the previous state.

> Andrey, hope you don't mind reviewing this change.
 
You are welcome.

 > With this change, the selected editor is styled in bold, and the
 > hidden editors have a grey background. However, the gray background

Looks not that bad, I personally don't mind if this would be like this.

 > Do you know if there is a known solution?

No

 > If not, I could provide a workaround editing  StyledCellLabelProvider#paint(..)

If someone else complains, but for now I wouldn't care.

I'm using this change to which I'm adding a minor change, to take into account themeIds incorporating versions.

Line:90, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbookEditorsHandler.java -> In ThemeEngine:148, themeId=id+version, hence we should check if the activeTheme.getId().startsWith(DEFAULT_THEME)
