DESCRIPTION

Bug 471782 - [ViewMgmt] History View always blank

While debugging bug 471782 I've observed that addPart() call in
showPart(String, PartState) is superfluous because it is the fist thing
the next call to showPart(MPart, PartState) does.

We can safely remove it, since it just wastes CPU cycles.
