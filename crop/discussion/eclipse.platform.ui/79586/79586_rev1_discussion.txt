Mario, I guess you forgot to amend? I see now two commits - one removes the constant, another one the use of the constant, but they both should be in one commit.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> What is this? Seem to be left over from some git experiments :-?

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> This was inserted by pressing the 'amend' button. Line 7 and 9 I added by myself.

I suggest to use interactive rebase to squash this into https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79583 and update https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/79583 via amend, push
