Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This fix looks reasonable to me.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I like that the proposed change no longer synchronizes stuff, as proposed in Li Juan's patch. However, this change here, no longer saves the preferences when the user explicitly changes them on the 'Capability ' preference page. This also affects other clients calling IMutableActivityManager.setEnabledActivityIds(Set).

We could call WorkLeon OchoachPlugin.getDefault().savePluginPreferences(); at the end of MutableActivityManager.setEnabledActivityIds(Set).

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Would take a different approach if we want to tackle this.
