Any reason why you did not mark this with a +2 and merge it directly? Just asking if we need some additional review or approval or if I should just merge it right away.

This is "platform style review" ;-) We typical do not merge changes from other committers, unless it is urgent. +1 means the reviewer did have a look and is OK with the changes.

In other words: feel free to merge.
