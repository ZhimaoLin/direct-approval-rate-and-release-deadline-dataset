DESCRIPTION

Bug 19462 - [Wizards] WizardDialog always reserves space for progressbar

By only creating the progress monitor part if the wizard needs one, we
can save some vertical space. Other parts of the code already check
needsProgressMonitor before accessing the progress monitor.

Also, remove unnecessary top and bottom margin around progress monitor
part to save some space even if it is needed.
