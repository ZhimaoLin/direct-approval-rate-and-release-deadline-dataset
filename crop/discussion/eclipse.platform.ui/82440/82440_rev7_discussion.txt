Brian, views now need to opt-in. Please remove your -2. This code still needs testing (definitely on my side but others are more than welcome to give it a try) but your -2 concern should be solved.

I hadn't considered using an attribute â€” great idea!  Could I suggest a shorter name ('inject=true/false'), as 'useDependencyInjection' is quite a mouthful and out-of-keeping with other attribute names used throughout the platform.

We definitely need some tests for this too.

Line:189, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> This needs more details:
  - the object is not created by the injector: `@PostConstruct` is not respected.  xxx@xxx.xxx work? Does it happen before or after `dispose()`?)
  - injection happens after object creation and `setInitializeData()`, but prior to `init()`
