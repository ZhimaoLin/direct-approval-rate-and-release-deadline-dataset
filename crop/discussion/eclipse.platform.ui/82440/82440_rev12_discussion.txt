Looking good!  A few comments and one question.

Line:190, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> A few things:

  - e4 is the incubator; E4?  But maybe that ship has long sailed…

  - I'd express this slightly differently: the view doesn't use DI.  Rather the flag controls whether the view is injected using the DI framework.

Line:201, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> Star or otherwise indicate which steps are in addition

Line:205, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> *On* disposal of the …

Line:210, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> I think the lists need to be <ol>…</ol>'d too

Line:84, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributedPartRenderer.java -> I don't understand this situation?  Should we be using  getLocal()?

And do we need to reparent an existing partComposite on parentWidget?

Most of the feedback done, I think. 

I still need to check, if we need to re-parent the Composite. This is still open on my side.

Line:190, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> I rephase.

Line:201, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> I add a sentence

Line:205, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> Done

Line:210, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/views.exsd -> Done

Line:84, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributedPartRenderer.java -> The compatibility layer fills already the context with a Composite, if the renderer does not check for an existing Composite. But getLocal sounds better to avoid finding a Composite in parent. I adjust the code.
