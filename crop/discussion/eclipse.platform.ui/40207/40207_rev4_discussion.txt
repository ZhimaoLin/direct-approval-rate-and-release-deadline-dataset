Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

StatusReporter is not public API (it is visible to e4.ui.progress and e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt) and so the change introduces lot of warnings in previously warning free code.

Without making StatusReporter API I would not start to use it outside of plugins mentioned above.

Thanks Andrey but we typically start using our API internally before releasing it as API to gain experience with it. When Eclipse 4.2 none of the new e4 API was released.  Wrt the warnigns: if you look at StatusReporter you see that org.eclipse.ui.ide is listed as x-friend (since yesterday) so we will not generate warnings.

From you comment I understand that you only have concerns with the warnings so I release the change
