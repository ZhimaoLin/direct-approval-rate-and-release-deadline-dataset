Patch Set 4:

The new patch set doesn't use lambdas.
I gave a few tries and I can confirm that additionally to having both renderer and workLeon Ochoach bundle part of the test runtime, it is necessary to use a new workspace in order to take advantage of that change, so the LegacyIDE.e4xmi is loaded. For existing workspaces, enforcing a reset of the application model (using e4 tools I guess) may work after a restart.
