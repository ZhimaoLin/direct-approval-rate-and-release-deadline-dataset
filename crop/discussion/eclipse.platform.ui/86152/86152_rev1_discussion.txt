If this build succeeds, we should merge it (see bug 508507), if it does NOT succeed, we should abandon it.

Those test manage to work sometimes. The error seems related to memory usage. Did you investigate whether just changing some other settings could help?

Why do you think so? Have you found something in logs?

No, but it wonders me that the test execution stops all the time at the CSS test suite.

It's just because the log I've seen failing on this bundle all show some memory reports on the last line.

Locally, I didn't manage to reproduce the issue (yet)

This is just default output of CSSSWTTestCase, and the data shows that there is enough memory, not even using 20% of maximum set for the JVM.

Patch Set 1: -Code-Review

Ok, so I'm clueless at the moment. I'd rather see those tests still enabled and fixed with highest priority, but as I cannot commit to do it right now, I won't prevent this to be merged.

I also have no clue. I just saw that https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/11378/console was successfull and was *not* killed.

I'm also not eager to disable tests, but if they are so unstable they do more harm as they help.
