DESCRIPTION

Bug 497332 - [GTK3] Platform.UI UiTestSuite, Some tests fail on Gtk3,
(some on Gtk2)

Fixed 3/3 tests that was causing a failure in both GTK2 and 3. 

testFindHistoryViewReferenceAfterShowViewCommand: GTK3 runs
minimize/maximize windows slower than GTK2, created a minimal wait time
before acquiring the active window in order to get the correct window.

testResetThemeRegistries: I have no found any reason why fontDefinition2
would run put(fontDefinition2.getId(), fontData) twice when comparing to
both fontDefinition1/2's instantiations. Setting to verify it gets
called once.
