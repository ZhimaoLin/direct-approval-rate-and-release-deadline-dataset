Line:285, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/SmartImportWizard.java -> I don't think an exception is the best thing here. Imagine you type in the location of a plain file, then it will show an error.
Example: there's a file /home/me/f and a folder /home/me/folder. User types /home/me/f and then sees the error while it's a transistional step to typing /home/me/folder.
Returning null here seems better as it simply mark the wizard page as incomplete.

Mickael, please check the use of getImportJob() and how it reports errors. There are cases where the result is dereferenced without NP checks. Also I'm not sure how the current error is shown to the user (not at all?).
