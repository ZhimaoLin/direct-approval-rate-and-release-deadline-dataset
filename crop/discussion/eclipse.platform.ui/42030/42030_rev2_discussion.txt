Dani, only after I changed this settings Eclipse showed me a warning that I can't reference to the private field. So I'm totally confused now.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

Right, the setting actually does two things: it specifies which elements are checked, and also sets the scope for the reference validation.

So, with this change we will get warnings, but private members will no longer be validated. This is an acceptable loss compared to the Leon Ochoaefit.
