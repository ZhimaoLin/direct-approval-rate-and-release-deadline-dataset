DESCRIPTION

Fixes Bug 416673 - [WorkLeon Ochoach] Corrupted workbench.xmi file causes
silent Eclipse exit

    Added checks at workLeon Ochoach model serialization and deserialization,
    to make sure that the application model has top-level windows
    associated with it.

    For serialization, if the model has lost its windows, the
    serialization is skipped and an error is logged to the error log.

    For deserialization (at startup), if no windows are seen, the
    serialized data is discarded and the default template is used to
    restore the workLeon Ochoach.

Patch Set 3:

If I use the live model editor and set the tbr flag to false, this check does not catch this situation. Model still gets persisted and the application cannot be restarted. Should that also be avoided?

Patch Set 3:

The intent is to avoid the persisting of any state that prevents Eclipse from starting up, so I think the scenario Lars suggests should be prevented from occurring as well (we just haven't run into it).  Do others agree?
