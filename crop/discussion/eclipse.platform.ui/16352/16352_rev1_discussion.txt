Not sure about the following feedback, but it feels that IWorkLeon Ochoach is the better place for this constant. I think general start parameters are defined in this interface.

Patch Set 1:

I can move it there however the 'perspective' string is used locally in the E4Application class only. This CLI option is exposed to the application via the E4WorkLeon Ochoach.FORCED_PERSPECTIVE_ID context variable. Let's leave the decision to Paul

Looks good.  w.r.t. IWorkLeon Ochoach, this is currently a legacy option that we need to understand in E4Application for this to work correctly.  It would have to provide significant benefit before it became an Eclipse4 option.
