Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

This change looks good. master branch is currently frozen and we're going to decide tomorrow on how to proceed for the next two weeks before Kepler ships. Leaving this in gerrit for today but remind me if it's not merged in the next two days.
