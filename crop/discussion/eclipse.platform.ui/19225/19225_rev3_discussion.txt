Patch Set 3:

@Lars

I chose the word Location as this is already used e.g., in the Properties Dialog at the Resource page. But of course it could be named differently.

@Dani

I understand your point and I even thought about this one before I've submitted the patch. I came to the conclusion that it would be nice to have to have all these kind of features. I find this "Open Resource" dialog the most usable thing to navigate though multiple large projects by only using the keyboard (the Copy Location function comes in handy when also switching between Shell and Eclipse). 

Granted, if more features would be added then the name of the dialog would be probably misleasing as the purpose of the dialog would no longer restricted to open resources only. Any suggestions are appreciated.
