I like the idea, small suggestions in the review. I'm not sure if "Copy location" is a good naming. Maybe "Copy file path" would be a better fit?

I prefer to keep the 'Open Resource' dialog simple and targeted to opening/navigating files. Otherwise we also get requests to add 'Delete', 'Copy', 'Run As', etc..
