DESCRIPTION

Bug 510826 getSectionGradientImage in FormImages always returns a new
image although it already has one in the cache

Corrects the problem in the equals method of the nested private class
SimpleSectionImageDescriptor which is the root cause for the cache
misses. Adds a JUnit test for this problem.
