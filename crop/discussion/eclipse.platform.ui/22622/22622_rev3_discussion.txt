Line:600, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/themes/ThemeAPITest.java -> What are we saying here?  What has changed to generate all of the extra events?

Line:600, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/themes/ThemeAPITest.java -> It is done by the CSS changes (altering/adding the ColorDefinitions) that modify the theme registries and extra events are propagated. I put the general assertion in the test to avoid updating it every time when we change sth in the CSS (add, remove or modify some definition). Basically it affects the test since the test WorkLeon Ochoach uses CSS styling. I can try to mock it in the scope of the separate bug, if you want

As long as we understand why (so know this test is sensitive to any change in the platform CSS) then it's probably OK.

Line:600, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/themes/ThemeAPITest.java -> Second test was failing due to the same reason, so I've mocked the CSS engine for the 3.x theme tests and ones are green now
