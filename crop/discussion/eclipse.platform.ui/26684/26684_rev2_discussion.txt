It has worked during my local tests without the cheese. Probably we have added some additional change that produces the cheese again. I will investigate it

See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433858#c38 which you probably didn't have in your workspace.

I have all patches in place and I'm still not able to reproduce the cheese issue in the Navigator. I'm using the RC1 build and all works as desired.

Are you updated to at least M7 version of the Eclipse? Without it the cheese issue is always present (don't ask me why)?

Ah, I know why you don't see the cheese: in order to better see the flickering and cheese I always set
'Active part background end' to green. As soon as I do that, the cheese is there with RC1 + this Gerrit change.

OK, I have it now. So it works fine with white background

I will take a look at it

The invocation of the Composite.redraw() in the current patch creates the cheese. I will work on the workaround for it.

Line:185, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> This line produces the cheese (the Composite.redraw() call forces redrawing of the Tree). It is workaround for the Bug 433276

Line:190, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> Another line that produces the cheese
