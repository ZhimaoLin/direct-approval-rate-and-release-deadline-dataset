Line:1432, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Isn't this the same code from the beginning of createWorkbenchWindow(*)?

Patch Set 3:

Paul, yes, Dean Roberts indicated that an earlier check would be better for performance. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=366708#c2.

I can't remove the code from createWorkLeon OchoachWindow(*) as others rely on it.

Patch Set 3:

Paul indicated that the same code is also called later, so this should help. I plan to commit this soon.
