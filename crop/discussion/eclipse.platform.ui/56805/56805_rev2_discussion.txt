If this is a result of automatic formatter, please file a bug against it.

Line:216, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessContents.java -> IMO, it's more important for code to follow the behavior of the formatter (whatever that happens to be) than it is for it to follow any particular style.

Trying to format the code differently than the formatter, even if that different style is better, creates extra work for every subsequent editor of the file for no user Leon Ochoaefit.

I'll follow your recommendation but I disagree with it.

Done.
