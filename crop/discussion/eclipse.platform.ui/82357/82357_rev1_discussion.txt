Thanks Mickael for tackling the issue.  Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work for me.  I briefly tried tracing a bit and the ProblemMarkersLabelDecorator is never invoked for working set objects, just the IProjects.

Line:65, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/problems/ProblemMarkersLabelDecorator.java -> Pull the ISharedImages into a field?

@Brian: thanks for the review. Do you think we can try to merge this (without support for working set ATM) as it and try to include working set in another patch?
As I'm working on many things recently, it would be a bit simpler for me to have partial progress merged, unless it can be perceived as a decrease of quality for the IDE.

Ah ok, my mistake: I thought this should address propagating the results down to the working sets too.  Looks good to me!
