DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors


Currently, processors and fragments are processed before the workLeon Ochoach
model is created.

This patch adds an attribute to the org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model
extension points that enables users to run a processor or merge a
fragment after the workLeon Ochoach has completely created the model and just
before early startup plugins are loaded. 


## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "postmodelcreation" flag to the  processor and
fragment extension point. The flag is optional. The value "false" will
be assumed when not specified which mimics the current defaults. See the
extension point documentation for more information.

## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of processors and fragments that need the workLeon Ochoach
model just before earlyStartup plugins processing.

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase before the workLeon Ochoach model
is created (or when run in pure e4 mode) and one
additional phase when the workLeon Ochoach is finished with the model.

## ResourceHandler
Changed because of a method signature change in ModelAssembler. No
functional changes here.

It turns out that this approach is flawed. We need to rethink our strategy.

What issue did you find Wim?

Patch Set 12:

The model is not completely build at boot time. For example, perspectives that are not yet activated become part of the model only if the user activates them. 

Example: Suppose I want to add stuff to a part stack with id "left" which is in the Java perspective. This part stack will only be placed in the model upon first activation of the Java perspective.

This is too late for the fragment processing step.

Instead, all available fragments that could not be loaded at boot time should be tracked and revisited on every major change to the model.

I'm still pondering a solution. I think I will register an event listener to catch the described corner case like you suggested.

AFAIK Wim is not working on this anymore. Wim, please restore if that is incorrect.
