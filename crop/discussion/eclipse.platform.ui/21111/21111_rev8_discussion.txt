DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

Currently, processors and fragments are processed before the workLeon Ochoach
model is created.

This patch adds an attribute to the org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model
extension points that enables users to run a processor or merge a
fragment after the workLeon Ochoach model is created. 


## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "compatibity" flag to the  processor and
fragment extension point. The flag is optional. The value "false" will
be assumed when not specified which mimics the current defaults. See the
extension point documentation for more information.

## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of processors and fragments that need the workLeon Ochoach
model just before earlyStartup plugins processing.

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase before the workLeon Ochoach model
is created (or when run in pure e4 mode) and one
additional phase when the legacy workLeon Ochoach is modeled.

## ResourceHandler
Changed because of a method signature change in ModelAssembler. No
functional changes here.

Patch Set 8:

We're considering going ahead with this but there shouldn't be a compat flag in it.  We're thinking of allowing you to flag contributions to preRender ... i.e. right before the renderer createGui(*) is called (which should be after the workLeon Ochoach creates the 3.x part of the model).  But I need time to review it, I haven't got there yet.

Wim, as of Pauls comments, can you remove the compatibility flag?

Patch Set 8:

@Paul: You mean rename the flag "compatibility" to "preRender"? The patch currently _is_ prerender. Both phases xxx@xxx.xxx I cannot remove it without breaking the patch.

Patch Set 8:

I mean that the flag shouldn't be called compatibility.  immediatelyPreRender seems to wordy.  phase2 seems a little odd.  But that there's a second phase of processing done isn't really related to the compatibility layer since it's all done in Eclipse4 code.
