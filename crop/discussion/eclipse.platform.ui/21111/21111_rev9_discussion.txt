DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

Currently, processors and fragments are processed before the workLeon Ochoach
model is created.

This patch adds an attribute to the org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model
extension points that enables users to run a processor or merge a
fragment after the workLeon Ochoach model is created. 


## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "compatibity" flag to the  processor and
fragment extension point. The flag is optional. The value "false" will
be assumed when not specified which mimics the current defaults. See the
extension point documentation for more information.

## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of processors and fragments that need the workLeon Ochoach
model just before earlyStartup plugins processing.

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase before the workLeon Ochoach model
is created (or when run in pure e4 mode) and one
additional phase when the legacy workLeon Ochoach is modeled.

## ResourceHandler
Changed because of a method signature change in ModelAssembler. No
functional changes here.
