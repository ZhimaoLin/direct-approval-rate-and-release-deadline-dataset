DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

Currently, processors and fragments are processed before the workLeon Ochoach
model is created.

This patch adds an attribute to the org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model
extension points that enables users to run a processor or merge a
fragment after the workLeon Ochoach has completely created the model and just
before early startup plugins are loaded. 


## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "postmodelcreation" flag to the  processor and
fragment extension point. The flag is optional. The value "false" will
be assumed when not specified which mimics the current defaults. See the
extension point documentation for more information.

## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of processors and fragments that need the workLeon Ochoach
model just before earlyStartup plugins processing.

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase before the workLeon Ochoach model
is created (or when run in pure e4 mode) and one
additional phase when the workLeon Ochoach is finished with the model.

## ResourceHandler
Changed because of a method signature change in ModelAssembler. No
functional changes here.

Just some minor suggestions, I continue to investigate your code changes (this time complete). Maybe you want to look during this time at the minor things?

Line:76, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/schema/org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model.exsd -> I'm not sure if that make it clear what will happen. Maybe rewrite it:

until fragments not flagged with this tag and information based on the plugin.xml file have been processed and just before the rendering phase starts.

Line:122, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/schema/org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model.exsd -> Similar as above. I'm not sure if that make it clear what will happen. Maybe rewrite it:

until fragments not flagged with this tag and information based on the plugin.xml file have been processed and just before the rendering phase starts.

Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Can we rename this method to something more descriptive, e.g. 

isCorrectPhase()

I think we should also combine the checks you are doing, e.g. for the fragment 

if (!"fragment".equals(ce.getName())) { //$NON-NLS-1$ && !isCorrectPhase(){
					continue;
}

Line:126, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Combine check?

Line:230, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Combine check?
