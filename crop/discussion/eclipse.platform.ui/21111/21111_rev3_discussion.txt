DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

I found the last problem. It will only process fragments and processors
if there is no saved model.


## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of fragments before earlyStartup plugins.

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase in normal E4 mode and one
additional phase when there is a compat layer. This extra phase is
called to process processers and fragments AFTER the workLeon Ochoach is
created.

## ResourceHandler
This one calls the model assembler. It checks if the application runs in
"legacy/compatibility/mixed" mode (whatever you want to call it). With
this information, it will call the ModelAssembler in the correct way.

## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "compatibity" flag to the  processor and
fragment extension point. Default value is "e4step". See the extension
point documentation for more information.
