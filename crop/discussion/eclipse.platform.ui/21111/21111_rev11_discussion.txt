DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

Currently, processors and fragments are processed before the workLeon Ochoach
model is created.

This patch adds an attribute to the org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model
extension points that enables users to run a processor or merge a
fragment after the workLeon Ochoach has completely created the model and just
before early startup plugins are loaded. 


## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "postmodelcreation" flag to the  processor and
fragment extension point. The flag is optional. The value "false" will
be assumed when not specified which mimics the current defaults. See the
extension point documentation for more information.

## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of processors and fragments that need the workLeon Ochoach
model just before earlyStartup plugins processing.

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase before the workLeon Ochoach model
is created (or when run in pure e4 mode) and one
additional phase when the workLeon Ochoach is finished with the model.

## ResourceHandler
Changed because of a method signature change in ModelAssembler. No
functional changes here.

Line:126, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Like that, what about combining the check with the other check in the above if statement?

I think the functionality to delay a fragment after the processing of the plugin.xml is a desired feature in general. I think we should consider this patch for Luna, this will not only help with contributing to the IDE but also to have a better integration of fragments and plugin based extensions.

Wim, I just released http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/commit/?id=479402a0130ec2a9d820e9fe8f488a8a636d3315. Can you update your review? I believe your patch will be easier to read afterwards.
