DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

The ModelAssembler is used to import fragments and run processors in
order to augment the model. In applications that run the legacy 
workLeon Ochoach the processing of some fragments and processors can now be 
done at a later stage, after the legacy workLeon Ochoach is modeled. The 
moment when a fragment or processor needs to be called is controlled by
changes in the e4.workLeon Ochoach.model extension point. 

## ModelAssembler
Is now able to run in two phases. One phase in normal E4 mode and one
additional phase when there is a compat layer. This extra phase is
called to process processors and fragments AFTER the workLeon Ochoach is
created.

## PartRenderingEngine 
I added the call to the second pass in here. Just BEFORE the call to 
run the earlyStartup plugins. It checks if the application runs in
"legacy/compatibility/mixed" mode (whatever you want to call it). With 
this information, it will call the ModelAssembler in the correct way.

## ResourceHandler
This one calls the model assembler. It checks if the application runs in
"legacy/compatibility/mixed" mode (whatever you want to call it). With
this information, it will call the ModelAssembler in the correct way.

## org.eclipse.e4.workLeon Ochoach.model.exsd
Added an extra attribute "compatibity" field to the  processor and
fragment extension point. Default value, also when not specified, is "e4step". See the extension point documentation for more information.
