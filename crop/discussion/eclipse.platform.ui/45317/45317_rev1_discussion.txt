Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Brian, Tom, Lars, since you were involved in https://git.eclipse.org/r/41337/ fix, can you please review this change?

I can confirm that introduced regression (Bug 463962) seems to be fixed by this patch, but honestly speaking, I have no idea about getCurSharedRef() API/behavior and can't say whether the proposed change make sense in general or not.

Thanks,
Andrey

The first build seem to be successful but hudson "verified" checkmark was not set in the gerrit. I don't know what happened there, so I've re-triggered the build (paranoia).
