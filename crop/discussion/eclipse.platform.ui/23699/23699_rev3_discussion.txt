DESCRIPTION

Bug 430662 - Editor area splits when dragging an editor without Ctrl key
pressed

Don't split the editor area when dragging within the editor area and the
Ctrl key is not pressed. Don't split the editor area when dragging into
the editor area from outside and the Ctrl key is pressed. Show outer
rectangle as an indication that the part will be inserted into an
existing editor area stack.
