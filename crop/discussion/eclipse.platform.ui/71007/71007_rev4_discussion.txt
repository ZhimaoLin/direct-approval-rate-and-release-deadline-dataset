Line:590, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEWorkLeon OchoachAdvisor.java -> Oomph workspaces almost always have the last segment of "ws" and have a descriptive second-last segment. Consider using a more nuanced heuristic that handles this case, too.

One option: use the second-last segment if the workspace name is the string literal "ws".

Another option: use the last two segments in all circumstances.

Another option: use the last two segments if the last segment is three characters or less.

Another option: look for a folder structure that resembles an oomph installation and use the second-last segment if so.

IMO, a check for the string literal "ws" would probably be sufficient since that would be a pretty strong indicator that the workspace is part of an oomph installation.

I think we should not have any specific assumption for the Oomph setup in our code.

+1. Plus, in general it should not be required to add such a lot of code to set the default.

I'm not sure I understand what the "+1" above meant. If it meant that you agreed that we should not have any specific assumption for the Oomph setup in our code, then I also agree. Please notice that the patch does not and did not make any Oomph-related assumptions.

Regarding "such a lot of code to set the default", please keep in mind that the preference initializer cannot be used because it is called before the workspace selection dialog is shown. This brings up a question that I borrowed from film Amadeus by Milos Forman:
 
"Emperor Joseph II: My dear young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Just cut a few and it will be perfect.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?"
