Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/EclipseProjectConfigurator.java -> This goes into the child directory without checking if the child was visited already.

On Linux we might have recursive links (back to any parent directory) etc, which will cause stack overflow here.

To avoid this, traverse algorithm should maintain set of visited directories, *resolved* via File.getCanonicalPath(), or we should use Files.walkFileTree(...) API (haven't tried this with recursive links and cannot guarantee that it will not fail with StackOverflow).

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/EclipseProjectConfigurator.java -> We could simply call the WizardProjectsImportPage#collectProjectFilesFromDirectory method (or extract content in some utility method shared by both consumers). I'll investigate in that direction.
