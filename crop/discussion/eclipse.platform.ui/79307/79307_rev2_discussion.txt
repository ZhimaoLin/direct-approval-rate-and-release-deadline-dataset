DESCRIPTION

Bug 476045 - Commands visible in Quick Access don't show commandImage

Quick access commands now show commandImage. The code uses
PlatformUI.getWorkLeon Ochoach() only when needed, consistently w.r.t. getters
for other services provided by CommandProvider.

@Lars: By the way, isn't there a way to avoid this duplication and consider that a +1 on Gerrit is enough? For code-review, it's definitely better to use Gerrit than Bugzilla. Is this something you already discussed with the PMC?

Not that I'm aware of. Please send your proposal to the PMC mailing list.
