DESCRIPTION

Bug 476400 - Remove JFace Activator

The JFace Activator didn't add any value that couldn't be provided by
the FrameworkUtil class, and caused an additional class to be loaded
on the critical path at start-up of an Eclipse instance.

Remove this class, and replace calls to getBundle() and getBundleContext()
with appropriate getBundle() calls.
