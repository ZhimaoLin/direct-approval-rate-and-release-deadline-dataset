DESCRIPTION

Bug 476364 - Refactor EventObjectSupplier to use DS

The EventObjectSupplier can avoid using a service tracker and be
passed an EventAdmin instance instead. This needs to be applied to
the UIEventObjectSupplier as well, since this is a subclass and
instantiated separately from the EventObjectSupplier.

As long as nobody tries to call this set method we should be fine.

Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> That is wrong, should be 0.13.0.

Alex, I adjusted the dependency version of the MANIFEST.MF. Can you check and see if that change makes sense for you? Other than that, I think the changes look good. Tests running successful locally.

Strange, the last time I looked the version in di.extension of 0.13.0. Looking at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/56039/2 I agree that it is safer to bump is up to 0.13.200 for example. If you can update the review, I merge them.
