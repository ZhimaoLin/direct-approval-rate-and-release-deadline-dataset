DESCRIPTION

Bug 476364 - Refactor EventObjectSupplier to use DS

The EventObjectSupplier can avoid using a service tracker and be
passed an EventAdmin instance instead. This needs to be applied to
the UIEventObjectSupplier as well, since this is a subclass and
instantiated separately from the EventObjectSupplier.
