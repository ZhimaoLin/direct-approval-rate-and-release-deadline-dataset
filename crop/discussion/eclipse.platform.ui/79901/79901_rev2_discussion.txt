osgi.service org.osgi.service.event.EventAdmin to o.e.e4.ui.services and

Thanks for tackling this Dirk.

The commit message is missing the bug title.

Should we change the reference to org.eclipse.equinox.event in org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt.test too?

Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability on osgi.extender?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think you missed some text here

Sorry, I totally missed your response somehow.

 > The commit message is missing the bug title.

Well the rest of the ticket description is far too long to match the rules, that is why I didn't add it. I can add it but then the warning will arise that the first line of the commit message is too long. :)

 > Should we change the reference to org.eclipse.equinox.event in
 > org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt.test too?

IMHO yes, and everywhere it was added just to satisfy the test-runtime. In the ticket Markus also says that there are similar issues in JDT builds. But we can add it to this commit for the platform. But it looks like in the platform this is the last remaining direct Require-Bundle entry.

 > Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability
 > on osgi.extender?

Yes I think so. There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities. But we could add Require-Capability and the p2.inf files to all bundles that make use of DS.

I will update the contribution on this later and see if the build and the feedback is fine then.
