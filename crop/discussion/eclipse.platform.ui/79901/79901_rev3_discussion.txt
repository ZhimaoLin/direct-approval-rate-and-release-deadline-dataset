DESCRIPTION

Bug 462862 - [Metadata] Missing explicit dependency on
org.eclipse.equinox.event kills tycho-surefire-plugin tests

Added OSGi Require-Capability header to osgi.extender=osgi.component to
all bundles that use DS. Also added the Require-Capability osgi.service
org.osgi.service.event.EventAdmin to o.e.e4.ui.services and
o.e.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.
Also added the necessary p2.inf file to define the same capability
requirements via p2 meta data.
