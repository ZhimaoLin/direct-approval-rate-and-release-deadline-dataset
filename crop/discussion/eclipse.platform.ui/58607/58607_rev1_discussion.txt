Line:413, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> I think I would move this code to the Workbench Page. Adding the default perspectives is not directly related to the perspective switcher and it woudl avoid the "ugly" access including the cast...

Line:416, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> Why is this first split with " " necessary?

Line:421, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> why do you trim the id s?

Line:413, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> I copied the ugly access from PerspectiveSwitcher.closePerspective, so moving my code would not eradicate this style in here.
If I move this code to WorkLeon OchoachPage, where should I call it?

Line:416, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> e3 allows both spaces and commas as perspective-id delimiters.

Line:421, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> That's a habit of mine, to be less picky about user-inputs, but since e3 does not do it, e.g. a tab is read as part of the id and makes it not-found in e3, I could be just as 'mean', if that is preferred.

Line:413, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> I would move it right after the creation of the default perspective (line 4036)

Line:416, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> Done

Line:421, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> Done

Line:413, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> After communicating with Jonas by email, he said to put the call in the area of lines 2695-2717, which I did.
