Lars,
I'm not experienced in this particular area, I have to debug it. 
My very first impression:
 
1) this looks like a change on a very basic API behavior. I think this deserves a test case (or two).
2) Haven't seen this in IDE yet, but update which sometimes *adds* element and sometimes updates sounds very surprising.
3) Not sure but if public API class overrides a superclass method - is the API changed? If yes, I miss "since" javadoc.
