I believe adding a note there would be pretty helpful.
Also, we need to check with PMC whether a public method going for synchronous to asynchronous is perceived as an API change with specific policy.

Line:340, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/ProgressMonitorPart.java -> You should annotate that "since 3.x, this method updates asynchronously"
