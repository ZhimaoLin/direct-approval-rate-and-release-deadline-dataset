This does not work. #updateLabel is part of the API contract and overridden by subclasses. If you no longer call that method those are broken.

Please remove any non-related whitespace changes.

@Dani: I don't get your comment. The updateLabel method is still invoked, not directly by the method but as part of the Throttler "ticks". So I don't think the contract is broken there.

You're right. I looked at it again, and it looks OK.

Line:343, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/ProgressMonitorPart.java -> Add a newline before xxx@xxx.xxx
