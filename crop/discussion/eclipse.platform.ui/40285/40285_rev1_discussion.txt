Thanks Philip, good stuff here but for several fields I suggest to stay with package protected for now. Please adjust the Gerrit review.

Line:411, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> I prefer to direct access here, please remove this from the Gerrit review.

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributionRecord.java -> I suggest to leave this package protected

Line:368, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributionRecord.java -> I suggest to stay with package protected here.

Personally, I try to avoid using package protected members due to having less control over the members state. But I'm fine if package protected members are used in this case.
