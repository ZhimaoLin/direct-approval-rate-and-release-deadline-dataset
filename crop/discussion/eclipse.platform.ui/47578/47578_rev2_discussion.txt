DESCRIPTION

Bug 466927 - Problems view content not updated after changing markers
without changing selection while view is hidden

Improved the fix made for bug 446864. After revealing hidden problems
view we should not check selection changes, but marker changes (in case
selection is not changed we still can have markers change). Also only
trigger UI updates (and do not rebuild the markers info), since this was
also already done while Problems view was hidden.
