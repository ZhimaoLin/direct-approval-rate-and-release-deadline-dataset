Line:222, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java xxx@xxx.xxx Were you able to figure out *why* this consistently works for some views and not for others? I found this the most puzzling about this bug.

Line:222, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> The cause of this bug was that "quickAccessContents.doClose();" was called only on focusLost, when the QuickAccess shell is losing the focus, and not after the user selects a command from the quick access list.
