Patch Set 1:

Hello Lars,

At least in my Eclipse, it complains about unused variable in AbstractFieldAssistWindow#createExtraControls(Composite parent).

The issue is that we have a super class with an empty method. This method is required only for an Anonymous child-class in ControlDecorationTests.

In my opinion, createExtraControls fits much better as an abstract method since it works just like a hook for a single child class.

I guess your confusion is the fact that ComboFieldAssistWindow and TextFieldAssistWindow are forced to Override createExtraControls with an empty method. However, in the later case we don't have a warning, since it's okay to choose not implement a certain method from an interface (in this case, we usually use throw new UnsupportedOperationException() but I just added a comment).

By the way, at least for me, this inheritance relation seems a little odd.
