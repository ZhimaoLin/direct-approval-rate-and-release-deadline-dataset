DESCRIPTION

Bug 500332 - Dispatch progress manager notifications in the UI thread

There is no more need for synchronization in listeners as they are all
executed in the same thread (aka thread safety via thread confinement). 

Listeners have been changed accordingly by: 
- removing thread safe data structures
- removing unnecessary synchronized blocks 
- removing WorkLeon OchoachJobs to run task in the UI thread. The concept of
infrastructure job disappears at the same time.
