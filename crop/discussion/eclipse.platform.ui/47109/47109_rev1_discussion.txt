Looks good, except the commit message reference seems incorrect.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We use the following format for commit messages.

Bug XXXXX - Description of the Bug

as you can copy from the bugzilla interface. In this case the commit message should be:

Bug 465657 - PNG icon for error_co_buildpath needs improvement

Can you update the commit? I could do this on my side, but I think it is important for you to learn our correct commit format.
