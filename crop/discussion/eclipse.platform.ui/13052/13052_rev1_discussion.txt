Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Daniel, this patch has the very undesirable side-effect of ending up with *both* the IDE's default perspective open as well as the one defined in the command line.

Perhaps you can add code similar to what 'forcePerspective' does to get the perspective descriptor somewhere in the WorkLeon OchoachWindow's 'setup' method (just before it calls the page's 'setPerspective' ??
