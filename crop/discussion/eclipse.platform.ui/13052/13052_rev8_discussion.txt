Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Looks good, I have 2 minor issues to be addressed.

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ResourceHandler.java -> Why is the forcedPerspectiveId only applied if we don't -clearPersistedState?  Doesn't that mean that you can't use "-perspective id" with an Eclipse4 application that clears it's persisted state?

Line:242, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> "perspective" should be turned into a constant on E4Application

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ResourceHandler.java -> This part of processing modifies the selected perspective in the model. When the '-clearPersistedState' option is used the model is not loaded from the workspace, so we don't need to process this part of the fix.

OK, you just need to address the constant in E4Application
