Patch Set 7:

(1 comment)

The issue with the 'resource' perspective was introduced after refactoring the patch regarding the new window logic processing and I've not noticed it during my local tests. The latest version of the patch uploaded on Friday solves it as well

thanks in advance for review,
Daniel

Line:120, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/PerspectiveStackRenderer.java -> This change fixes the issue mentioned in my 2nd comment to the patch set 5. However if you find it risky I think we can revert it and consider the rest of the patch only. The issue described in the comment is not so painful for user and happens only when they open perspective via '-perspective' parameter first time. After restarting the Eclipse it works as desired. So, I think we can open separate bug for this particular case with lower priority and process the rest of the patch - in my opinion it is better to have the bug 377981 "almost" fixed, than not have it at all
