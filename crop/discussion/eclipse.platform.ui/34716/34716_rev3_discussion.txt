Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/ListSelectionDialog.java -> You have not answered my question why you have this static methods.

Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/dialogs/ListSelectionDialog.java -> A usual constructor does not support type inference in Java 1.6 as those static methods do.

I dislike writing 
new ListSelectionDialog<MyType>(Shell parentShell, Object input,Class<MyType> elementType, IStructuredContentProvider contentProvider,ILabelProvider labelProvider, String title, String message) where <MyType> would have to be stated two times.
With those static factories I only have one <MyType>.

Another advantage is that I could also return a different subclass of the SelectionDialog in the Future, so that clients may directly Leon Ochoaefit from new implementations without changing their code.

I think defining twice the same information is anyway not a good practise, we need to review this Class<MyType> elementType parameter.
