The existing support for filterActions mustn't be removed. (see comments inline)

Line:86, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/FilterActionGroup.java -> The existing gilterShortcutAction still need to be added to the group. Your change seems to ignore them, so it's not backward-compatible.

Patch Set 6:

The filterShortcutActions list is always empty, so I saw no point in adding it to the menu and therefore replaced it with the lruFilterDescriptorStack deque.

Patch Set 6:

@Jan: you're right. The list is never populated, and my research for subtypes for FiltersActionGroup on the web showed that no code seems to extend it and customize this list (which is good as the method is internal). The reference I found to the FiltersActionGroup in FindBugs plugin only require the start/end markers as it's used to resolve menu position.
