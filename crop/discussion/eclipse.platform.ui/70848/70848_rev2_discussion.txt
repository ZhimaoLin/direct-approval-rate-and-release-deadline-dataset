Patch Set 2:

@Jan: this patch looks good, however it seems to me that it does much more than simply adding the MRU filters. I believe it also include many things improving IMemento support and fixes a few bugs. Do you think you could split this patch into several independent finer-grain ones (if possible linking to related bugzilla entries)? That would make it easier to review them.

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/NavigatorFilterService.java -> Isn't this a bug fix, independent of MRU? If so, could you report it in a dedicated bug and Gerrit?

Patch Set 2:

NavigatorFilterService: Yes, I already did. It is bug 502038.

SelectFiltersAction: Hm, not easy to decide, because to me this does not really seem to be a bug. Currently the filterGroup.updateFilterShortcuts() method call does nothing, so it is irrelevant if the dialog was cancelled or not. With the MRU filter list to update it suddenly becomes relevant. So I would rather not like to move this change to another bug.

Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/FilterActionGroup.java -> Do you think there would be an opportunity here to avoid the removeAll and to create only menus for new entries/remove too old entries?
Maybe instead of a queue of ICommonFilterDescriptor, you could directory store and manipulate a queue of related ToggleFilterAction ?

Line:170, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/FilterActionGroup.java -> As, for what I understand, LRU are really managed according to history; which is the more natural order for users to interact with them:
* Chronological order (so user can see a bit of a "breadcrumb" thanks to LRU)
* Alphabetical order
?

As I'm not myself a user of MRU, I have no opinion, but I'd just like to make sure both were considered and that your proposal regarding the order of menus is what you think is best for users.

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/ToggleFilterAction.java -> Should it be part of a patch for bug 502038 ?

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/SelectFiltersAction.java -> Fine, let's keep it the current commit then.

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/NavigatorFilterService.java -> Ok, so can you please make a different patch for this, mentioning "Bug 502038" in the commit message?

Patch Set 2:

When I submit a new patch set should this depend on change 81751 (bug 502037) or should I wait until that change has been reviewed and probably merged?
