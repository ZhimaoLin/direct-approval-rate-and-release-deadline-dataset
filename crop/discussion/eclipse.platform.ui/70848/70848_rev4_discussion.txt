Patch Set 4:

I looked at the sorting of the menu and it is done in the same way as in the implementation used in the JDT PackageExplorer.

So I suppose I did not give this much thought and just reused the existing logic.

I have a patch ready, but cannot push it due to network problems. Hopefully it will work again next week.
