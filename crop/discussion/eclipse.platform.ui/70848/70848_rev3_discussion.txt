Only a couple of small changes are required in order to merge that.
I also have a couple of questions, that are not blocker.

Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/FilterActionGroup.java -> This "Recent Filters" menu must be below the "Filters and Customization..." one.

Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/FilterActionGroup.java -> Do you think there would be an opportunity here to avoid the removeAll and to create only menus for new entries/remove too old entries? Maybe instead of a queue of ICommonFilterDescriptor, you could directory store and manipulate a queue of related ToggleFilterAction ?

Line:170, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/FilterActionGroup.java -> As, for what I understand, LRU are really managed according to history; which is the more natural order for users to interact with them:

    Chronological order (so user can see a bit of a "breadcrumb" thanks to LRU)
    Alphabetical order
    ?

As I'm not myself a user of MRU, I have no opinion, but I'd just like to make sure both were considered and that your proposal regarding the order of menus is what you think is best for users.

Line:48, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/messages.properties -> This has to be
  RecentFiltersActionGroup_Filters=Recent Filters

since just using Filters here gives the impression to user that those could be the only ones available.
