Thanks for the additional feedback. The border is readded and the default is set to clean all projects. But I still have the problem that the project names are a little bit more indented because of the collapse-sign (which is hidden). Please check the new screenshot. Any idea how to remove the indent?

In master the problem/indent is not there, so, look there.

Anyway, you should extend the FilteredItemsSelectionDialog rather than abusing the FilteredTree.
