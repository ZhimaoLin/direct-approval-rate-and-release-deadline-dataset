I modified the code so that I can get Linux to behave like Windows and I think the border of the box is not correct. To compare open FilteredTree and change useNativeSearchField to return true,

Line:258, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/CleanDialog.java -> I think you should use a SWT.BORDER border here.

Line:266, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/CleanDialog.java -> FilteredDialog uses a different case here:

	protected Text doCreateFilterText(Composite parent) {
		if (!useNewLook || useNativeSearchField(parent)) {
			return new Text(parent, SWT.SINGLE | SWT.BORDER | SWT.SEARCH
					| SWT.ICON_CANCEL);
		}
		return new Text(parent, SWT.SINGLE);
	}

Take a look at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=268232

As you can see, on Windows 7 the 'Clear' button is inside the search field.

Please stop trying to provide a fix for Windows if you don't have access to a Windows machine or another contributor that has one and can provide the fix.

Maybe revert to 4.6 (except button rename) and take the time to provide a complete fix that has been tested on all platforms early 4.8. We can then still consider to put it into 4.7.1.
