Thanks for the feedback! It is fixed now. I also removed the not needed column in the gridlayout which causes a little more margin on the right side than on the left.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-2 Verified-1

The list is now missing the border and the default has been changed to not cleaning all projects. That's a no go.

Please take a look at the dialog in 4.6 M6. It should look the same except that
- radio buttons are replaced by 1 checkbox
- a filter field is added
- description is updated (already in master)
- OK is renamed to Clean (already in master)
