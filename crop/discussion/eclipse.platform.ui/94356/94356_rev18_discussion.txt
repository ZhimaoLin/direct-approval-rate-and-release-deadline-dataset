Please check the new patch. I hope the filter text now behaves like you are expecting?! Please leave a message if not. The icon hack from filteredtree is currently not in.

Well, it's not a hack but I agree not ideal (see bug 293230). However, ALL filtered UIs in Eclipse have that button and it's not that much code. Please add it.
