> the default has been changed to not cleaning all projects. That's a no go.

Sorry to be a bit rude, but ignoring review comments in a subsequent change is really wasting my time.


Another review comment you ignored from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500598#c16 :

The filter field needs the "type filter text" affordance as everywhere else.

Time is running out. On Monday I will revert to 4.6 if I don't have a complete fix.
