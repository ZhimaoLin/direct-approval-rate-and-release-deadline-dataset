In the current master I implemented the filter functionality on my own and used the "old" CheckboxTableViewer, thats why there is no indent. Now I am using a FilteredTree with a CheckboxTreeViewer. The indent comes from the CheckboxTreeViewer (it is the expand-sign which is not visible because children won't show up). If I am right, using a FilteredItemsSelectionDialog won't work because of the additional UI elements it provides and because we need checkboxes in the filtered table.

So, use what's in master and fix this bug. Using a *tree* is complete violation.

We need a solution soon otherwise I will revert to the whole thing to 4.6. We have this week left.

David and I'm looking at this now. Using FilteredItemsSelectionDialog is possible, but we need to override the createDialogArea, as we want a CheckBoxTableViewer and no view menu.

I provide a Gerrit review soon.

Patch Set 9:

Puh, re-using FilteredItemsSelectionDialog turns out to be very ugly, as we have to override many methods to remove the view menu, help context, etc. I think that is not a good solution, we try another approach.
