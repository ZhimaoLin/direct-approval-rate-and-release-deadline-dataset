DESCRIPTION

Bug 460383 - Move platform ui plugins to Java 1.7 BREE -
org.eclipse.core.commands

Added "Override" annotations, added generics where possible (no API
change), fixed warnings related to generics, added suppress warnings for
the remaining places where API shouldn't be touched, cleaned up code.

Fixed Util.safeCopy(*) methods as they always returned same collection instead
of the copy.
