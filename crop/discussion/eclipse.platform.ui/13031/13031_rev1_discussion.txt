Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'd prefer a different solution that didn't use a map.  For example, make org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt.StackRenderer.findItemForPart(MPart) public and pass in the StackRenderer to BasicPartList.  Then during getFont(Object) you can do render.findItemFormPart(MPart).isShowing() (with appropriate null checks)
