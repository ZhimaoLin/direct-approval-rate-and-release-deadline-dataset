Patch Set 5:

I've fixed a few things:
* API annotations were added
* Clean unused stuff
* Added mnemonics:

Regarding remaining issues:
* Options should use sentence-style: I don't understand what you mean concretely, which option are you talking about
* NPE when opening an archive: will be fixed
* "From directory" doesn't store previous values: I could not reproduce it, I tried the wizard, and the value I gave was remembered for next imports (which BTW does not seem to be an interesting features as people generally import only once). Can you elaborate on how you could get this issue?
* Import as new project using reference vs copy: I think for this one we might need another wizard page to choose whether to reference or copy. It would also allow to select working sets.
WDYT?
