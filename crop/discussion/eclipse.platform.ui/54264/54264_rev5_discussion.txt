DESCRIPTION

Bug 455281 - [Model] ModelServiceImpl.findElements(*) does not filter parts from outside perspective

When processing the children of an MWindow containing a primary
MPerspectiveStack, and not instructed to consider elements outside
of the perspectives, then restrict the search to within that primary
perspective stack.

Update UIAllTests and StartupTestSuite to JUnit 4 and cause UIAllTests
launch to require Java8 and JUnit4.
