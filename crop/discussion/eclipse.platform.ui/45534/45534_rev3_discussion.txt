Patch Set 3:

Added a fix for StyledTexts too (PyDev has one inside a view which should be themed). Note that adding it this way doesn't seem to be a problem as matching it in the 'match all' rule...

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> WS should be avoided

Line:97, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> I guess this comment should be in line 110, please remove the reference to PyUnit

Line:101, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> I would just leave that out

Patch Set 3:

Added a new one to fix only a pattern for the StyledText inside a SashForm... (I was wrong, the PyDev editor worked, but the regular Text editor didn't work anymore, so, just fixing the particular issue I had).
