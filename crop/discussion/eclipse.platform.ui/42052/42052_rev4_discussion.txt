Line:300, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> Why >= 0, not > 0?
Actually I think this should be if(!clean.isEmpty() && !toRemove.isEmpty()) but I have to check in the debugger.

Line:300, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> I think we cannot wrap the whole statement in an if block as this block contains the setDirty(false) statement. Maybe we can use this bug to ensure that the update avoids always updates and evaluate in a new bug the option to wrap the whole block and move the setDirty out of it?

I would like to avoid changing two things at the same time.
