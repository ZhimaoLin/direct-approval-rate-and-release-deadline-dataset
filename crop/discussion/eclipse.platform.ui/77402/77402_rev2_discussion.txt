DESCRIPTION

Bug 497984 - Stop using COLOR_INFO constants in PopupDialog

COLOR_INFO constants are used for tooltips drawing (as stated in the
javadoc even). As dialogs are supposed to be user interacting it is best
to switch to COLOR_LIST_[BACKGROUND|FOREGROUND] as selection colors
(selection background and text) are also based on the same widget thus
inconsistency like white on white, blue on blue by default or when
selected will be prevented.
Further more this would give a bit more predictable dialog colors in
eclipse as some system themes use funky yellow, blue, black tooltip
colors (aka COLOR_INFO_*) making these dialogs not integrate well with
the workLeon Ochoach.

Patch Set 2:

This is a welcome change on Linux GTK where many default themes use tooltips with a black background (eg. Adwaita on Fedora). As an example, the listing of inherited members is unreadable in the quick outline view because they seem to show up as blue text on top of the black background.

I've pushed the same change into the Eclipse Neon maintained on Fedora 24 since various users have brought this issue up.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Looks way better for Quick Outline. Javadoc hover is not affected, I guess that use their own color constant.
