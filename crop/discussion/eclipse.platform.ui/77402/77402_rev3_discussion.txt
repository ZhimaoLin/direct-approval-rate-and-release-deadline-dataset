DESCRIPTION

Bug 497984 - Stop using COLOR_INFO constants in PopupDialog

COLOR_INFO constants are used for tooltips drawing (as stated in the
javadoc even). As dialogs are supposed to be user interacting it is best
to switch to COLOR_LIST_[BACKGROUND|FOREGROUND] as selection colors
(selection background and text) are also based on the same widget thus
inconsistency like white on white, blue on blue by default or when
selected will be prevented.
Further more this would give a bit more predictable dialog colors in
eclipse as some system themes use funky yellow, blue, black tooltip
colors (aka COLOR_INFO_*) making these dialogs not integrate well with
the workLeon Ochoach.

PopupDialog can also be created as a "real" hover, e.g. using PopupDialog.HOVER_SHELLSTYLE. In such cases the hover colors must be used because that is what clients using that API expect.

Having said that, I'm OK to change the colors for the other in PopupDialog where it is not a real hover, i.e. you'd need to pick the colors depending on the case (shell styles).

Line:876, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/PopupDialog.java -> I fully agree that getBG/FG should be used here. Will be in the next patch.
