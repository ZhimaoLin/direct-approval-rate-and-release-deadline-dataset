DESCRIPTION

Bug 497984 - Stop using COLOR_INFO constants in PopupDialog

COLOR_INFO constants are used for tooltips drawing (as stated in the
javadoc even). As dialogs are supposed to be user interacting it is best
to switch to COLOR_LIST_[BACKGROUND|FOREGROUND] as selection colors
(selection background and text) are also based on the same widget thus
inconsistency like white on white, blue on blue by default or when
selected will be prevented.
Further more this would give a bit more predictable dialog colors in
eclipse as some system themes use funky yellow, blue, black tooltip
colors (aka COLOR_INFO_*) making these dialogs not integrate well with
the workLeon Ochoach.
Dialogs with NO_FOCUS style bit set (PopupDialog.HOVER_SHELLSTYLE) will
still use COLOR_INFO_[BACKGROUND|FOREGROUND] as they are supposed to act
like hover/tooltips.

Dani, please notice that -2 was used inappropriately in this review. It contradicts the consensus agreement we reached some time ago.
