DESCRIPTION

Bug 486474 - Menu are not correctly filled calling menu service

When removeAllWhenShown is set to true, upon showing the menu, the menu
items are removed from the MenuManager, but not from MMenu. This is
causing this problem as well as memory leak as some menu items get added
multiple times to MMenu. This patch fixes this issue
