That code was added for bug 327690 so I'm not sure we should remove it.

Line:345, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/WizardHandler.java -> This code is deliberately updating the UIElement (that's any menu contribution that is referencing this command).  It's been that way since before 3.7.  I don't think removing this code is the way.
