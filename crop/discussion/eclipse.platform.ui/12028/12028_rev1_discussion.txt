DESCRIPTION

Bug 366528 - [Compatibility] Implement IMenuService#populateContributionManager

Alternate implementation.  The model elements for populated toolbars and
menus are treated as transient data.  Must provide a "bridge" context
for the renderers to find and must hook up the UIEventPublisher as
they're not in the hierarchy.
