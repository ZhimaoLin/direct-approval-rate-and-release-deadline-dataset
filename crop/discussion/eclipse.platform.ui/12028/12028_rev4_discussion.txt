DESCRIPTION

Bug 366528 - [Compatibility] Implement
IMenuService#populateContributionManager

ContributionManagers can be populated whether or not they are already
tied to a model.  For managers that don't exist in the regular model,
the transient data is used to link to a parent for context lookups.
The UIEventPublisher is hooked in on populate and removed on
releaseContributions(*).
