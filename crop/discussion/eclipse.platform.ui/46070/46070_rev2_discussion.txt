I'm in favour of this change.  It's applicable outside of nested project too, such as when importing Maven projects without m2e.

Two tweaks.  I particularly find the menu option hard to grasp as it's describing the implementation and not the intention. "Filter duplicate resources" seems better to me.

Line:1084, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java -> Throwing an exception here seems dangerous: err on the side of caution and return true.

Line:780, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/messages.properties -> I find this description a bit hard to understand.  "Filter duplicate resources"?
