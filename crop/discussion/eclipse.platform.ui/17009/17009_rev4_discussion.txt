DESCRIPTION

Bug 398684 - [WorkLeon Ochoach] Initial size from IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer is
not used to create the workLeon Ochoach window

Set the size after preWindowOpen() is called.  Have the default model
loaded for small RCP apps start with a really small size to avoid large
grey rectangles.
