Can you adjust one of the implementations in eclipse.platform.ui of the existing dialog to see this new dialog in action?

Sorry, after reviewing a few more dialogs, I think we need to stay with setResult(), it is widely used.

Line:118, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Array is wrong, returned is a collection.

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Sorry, after reviewing a few more dialogs I think we should stay with getResult(), I see it commonly used.

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Is Array the correct term here? Not sure if Varargs have its own name

Line:165, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Rename to setResult, sorry.

Line:183, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Rename to setResult, sorry. Lucky you did not adjust yet the Javadoc.

As a note, if our set methods would return "this" instead of void we could create a fluent API, e.g. instead of 

dlg.setTitle(title);
dlg.setMessage(message);

we could write
dlg.setTitle(title).setMessage(message);

Not sure if that is desired or not.
