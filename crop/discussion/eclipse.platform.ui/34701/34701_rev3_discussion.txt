A few minor code suggestion and I think we should name the methods better. This is a trade-off as this makes it harder to migrate existing code but I think the initial naming was not very well done. 

In general I like this change but I would like to see this applied a few times in eclipse.platform.ui before merging it. Please replace a few times the usage of the old dialog with this one.

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Should this be called "initialSelection"? initialSelections sounds weird.

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Put in one line, our new line length is 120

Line:60, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> This is just a copy from the super impl. Can be shorted to "Creates a dialog instance".

Line:79, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Can be removed, that is the same as in the super implementation.

Line:111, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Maybe a better name would be: getInitialSelection()

Line:133, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Maybe a better name would be: getUserSelection

Line:144, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Maybe a better name would be: setInitialSelection

Line:155, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Maybe a better name would be: setInitialSelection

Line:195, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Maybe a better name would be: setUserSelection

Line:237, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Remove, this is documented in the super implementation.

Line:259, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> Remove, this is documented in the super implementation.

Line:266, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> This is a new dialog (even if it is a copy of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs, AFAIK the since tag is only used for new methods)

Line:278, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/SelectionDialog.java -> This is a new dialog (even if it is a copy of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs, AFAIK the since tag is only used for new methods)
