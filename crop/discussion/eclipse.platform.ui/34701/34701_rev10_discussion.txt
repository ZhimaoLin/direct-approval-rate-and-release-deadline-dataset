Do you also have an example for an input which is not a list? I feel like the Collection abstraction makes the client code complex. Is their an example where we also Leon Ochoaefit from it?

Line:197, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/FeatureSelectionDialog.java -> I feel like my last feedback got ignored

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/TipsAndTricksAction.java -> Why was  d.getOkButton().setEnabled(false); deleted?

Line:197, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/FeatureSelectionDialog.java -> Done

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/TipsAndTricksAction.java -> I removed the getOkButton method from the SelectionDialog as subclasses can also access the ok button like that: getButton(IDialogConstants.OK_ID)

Now the button is disabled inside the FeatureSelectionDialog class, so that it must not be modified from outside.

I think it is not a good practise to externalize certain buttons in a abstract Dialog like the SelectionDialog.
