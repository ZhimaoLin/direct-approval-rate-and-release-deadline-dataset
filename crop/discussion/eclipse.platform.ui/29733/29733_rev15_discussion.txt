This patch works partially but I noticed the following issue:
- fast views are fully shown instead of being minimized
- the sequence of the windows is not kept: in 3.x I had
  Java|Team|Debug. In 4.x I got Debug|Java|Team

That's a general issue in 4.x, see bug 472633.

The same problem when importing 3.x perspectives, see bug comment 73.

The fast view issue is addressed in another patch. When testing migration, I encountered an NPE when rendering one of custom perspectives. Investigating...
