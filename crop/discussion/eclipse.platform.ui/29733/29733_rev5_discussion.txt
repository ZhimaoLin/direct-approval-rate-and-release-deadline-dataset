This is Excellent !! The only reason for my -1 is that the new classes all seem to have xxx@xxx.xxx 3.5' (which I don't believe...;-).

I'll add more comments on the bug about the remaining work.

Line:37, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/migration/PerspectiveBuilder.java -> Has this really been around since 3.5 ?

Line:181, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/migration/WindowBuilder.java -> Shouldn't this check to see if we have one already ?
