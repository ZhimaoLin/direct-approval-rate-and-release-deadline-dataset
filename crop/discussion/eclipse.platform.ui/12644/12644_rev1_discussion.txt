We need to put back xxx@xxx.xxx 1.0 in the model M* interfaces.  Also, it seems to have added * imports without removing the matching imports (that's less important though).

Line:13, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/commands/impl/CommandsFactoryImpl.java -> It added commands.* without removing the specific command imports.

Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/MAddon.java -> We need xxx@xxx.xxx 1.0 tags in the model interfaces.

Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)

Both issues, I believe, arise from hand editing of the generated code - something that we should strongly discourage. The @since tags should be inserted into the model. Eric is currently updating Javadoc this way; to minimize merge risk, I'd prefer he add xxx@xxx.xxx tags, too. I will attempt to clean-up the imports.

Line:13, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/commands/impl/CommandsFactoryImpl.java -> In general, we should avoid doing any hand modifications to the generated code. I suspect the individual commands.* imports were the result of someone doing Organize Imports. I try removing them, and see what happens when I regenerate. If they show up again, I'll file a bug against EMF, and keep things as is.

Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/MAddon.java -> This, however, needs to be done in the model, not directly in the code, where it will be removed (again) whenever the code generator is re-run. Eric is currently editing the model to improve the Javadoc. I would prefer not to do this myself, and then attempt to merge in Eric's changes - merging the .ecore changes is likely to be highly error prone.
