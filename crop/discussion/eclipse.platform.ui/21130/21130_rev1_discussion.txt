Learned something new, Gerrit "revert" only creates a new Gerrit review. 

Daniel, as I accidently applied your change, I planned to revert it. But from your comment in Bug 426572 I understand that you are fine with the Gerrit review applied? 

In this case I would abondan this revert.

Yes, it works fine for me. I have made several tests with different attribute combinations (both set, both unset, only one set) and I haven't noticed any issue with this change.
