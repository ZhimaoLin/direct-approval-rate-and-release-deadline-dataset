DESCRIPTION

Bug 510752 failure on org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms.util.FormColorsTests

Changes the testStandalone test so that it do not longer tests all
colors whether they are disposed after fColors.dispose(), because it is
the correct behaviour that colors should not be disposed when they are
still in use.
