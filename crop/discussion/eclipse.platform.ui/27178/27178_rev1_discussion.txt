Hi Daniel, I added some changes into Gerrit comments to reduce the side-issues.

Line:167, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> I would change lines 168-173 to:

   .MPart Composite > StyledText {	
      background-color: #3f4447;	
      color: #BBBBBB;	
  }

Line:188, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> I would change lines 189-194 to:

  .MPartStack.active .MPart Composite > StyledText {	
      background-color: #313538;	
      color: #AAAAAA;	
  }

Line:194, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> By the way, using .MPartStack#left, .MPartStack#bottom etc. selectors is too much arbitrary, I would deprecate it (if eg. the user shifts the views or opens eg. the Debug perspective, see the 'Java > Declaration' or 'Debug > Variables/Breakpoint' views for example, those rules aren't triggered and the styles become inconsistent)

Line:279, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> I would add:

  #org-eclipse-e4-ui-compatibility-editor Canvas {
	background-color: #262626;
	color: CCC;
  }
  .MPartStack.active #org-eclipse-e4-ui-compatibility-editor Canvas {
	background-color: #202020;
	color: CCC;
  }


(Need to check CDT editor, if its issue with the bright AnnotationRulerColumn widget to fold/unfold code come out again, we need to restore the workaround)

Line:143, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> Better to completely remove lines 144-149 (using the #id Selector changes the overall priority of the others 'StyledText' rules)

Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> Forgot ';' 
(all the following CSS rules aren't loaded)

Line:194, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_partstyle.css -> Yes, I agree it is not perfect, but it solves the issue that we have with the overriding of the 'AbstractTextEditor.Color.Background' preference value

I will try to prepare better patch

Yes, please go ahead. I think it is the best option since you are the most familiar with the Dark theme and all styling issues involved with,
