Just a request for a name for hasVisibleWhen() that isn't as tied to the implementation details

Line:193, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarContributionRecord.java -> I wonder how this plays out with multiple separators with same id but different visibleWhen clauses.  Hopefully that doesn't happen (and it beyond the scope of your patch).

Line:166, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarContributionRecord.java -> Can we come up with a better name?  VISIBILITY_IDENTIFIER isn't a visibleWhen, per-se.  requiresVisibilityCheck()?

Line:193, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarContributionRecord.java -> A separator can't have a visibleWhen expression. It is either visible => then it is a org.eclipse.jface.action.Separator or it is invisible then it is a org.eclipse.jface.action.GroupMarker.
