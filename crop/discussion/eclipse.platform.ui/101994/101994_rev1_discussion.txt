This fixes the first part of the Bug. But for the second part 

Even after I delete the newly added content type, The association with the External Editor still exists. This association needs to be deleted once the content type is deleted

Thanks for the review Kalyan. As per bug comment, I think it's easier and more efficient to split the 2 issues in 2 different patches/bugs. So if you think this already fixes the 1st issue (external editor association) properly, please consider updating your vote.
