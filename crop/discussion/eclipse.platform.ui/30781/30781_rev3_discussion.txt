Patch Set 3:

Some of the strings are keys that should be turned into constants to avoid coding due to typos.

Patch Set 3:

We can convert them into constant, but I will not will something as these tags are used on the application model and model tags can not point to Java constants.

Let me know if I still should convert them.

Patch Set 3:

Sorry, I have a hard time to parse your last comment.

For example "limbo" is used at several places in the code across bundle boundaries. The lowest bundle who knows that key should introduce a constant as API and that constant should be used everywhere in the Java code.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

Although it probably makes sense to turn those strings into constants, I believe this change is already an improvement and could be accepted as it.

I disagree. At the moment I see a warning and know that I have to do something. After the change that warning will be gone and no one will ever look at those strings again.
