Hi Lars,

I think this is not solvable, so, I don't think it's worth reporting it (mainly -- at least on windows -- when the text changes, a side-effect is that the scroll size will change, but as there wasn't any real set of the scroll bar max size, it'll be *silently* updated and we won't have a notification).

So, this pull request makes a fix to handle that situation (and I also ended up fixing an issue where there was a conflict with the option to just show the scrollbars if needed on the StyledText which made the git staging view unusable).
