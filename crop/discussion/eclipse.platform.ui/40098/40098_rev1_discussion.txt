Paul should review this, but IMHO if we want to expose the IContextProvider interface that needs to go to a more central place.

Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/commands/internal/IContextProvider.java -> Feels wrong to have such an important interface in the org.eclipse.e4.core.commands plug-in. Should that interface not defined in the context plug-in?

Line:1519, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPlugin.java -> You returning the application context hence I would not call this getWorkbenchContext

Line:56, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/commands/internal/HandlerServiceImpl.java -> I think we should not leave commented code in master

Line:86, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/commands/internal/HandlerServiceImpl.java -> Underscore is an uncommon way define a key.

Why should this interface go anywhere beside staying internal - it sole job is to provide the compat layer a chance to create its handlers before the workLeon Ochoach is booted - all the compat code steps into internals so why should we expose this thing?

Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/commands/internal/IContextProvider.java -> This is all internal stuff and should not be exposed anywhere - it is only there to help the compat layer to do its job

Line:1519, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPlugin.java -> WorkbenchContext == ApplicationContext but I have no strong feeling to be the service use IWorkbench was the reason to name it like this

Line:56, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/commands/internal/HandlerServiceImpl.java -> right a left over

Line:86, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/e4/core/commands/internal/HandlerServiceImpl.java -> the reason to use _ is exactly that it is uncommon so noone else is overwriting it

IMHO if we want to give static access to the application context we should push it to a general bundle. There are several places where this can be useful, e.g., access to the translation service via a dialog. But lets see what Paul thinks.

FYI - You can run the tests via mvn with the following command if you are in the test directory for the commands: 

mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles

I ran them from the launch config inside my IDE - if mvn shields other results something is wrong not?

It's impossible to run those tests on OS-X using maven - no idea what's wrong so i filed https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458116
