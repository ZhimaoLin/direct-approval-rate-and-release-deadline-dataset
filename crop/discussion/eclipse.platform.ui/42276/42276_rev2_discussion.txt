Line:61, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/SelectionAdapterFactory.java -> I think this was incorrect and still is incorrect. IIterable is not an instance of ISelection.

Line:61, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/SelectionAdapterFactory.java -> ISelection is not an IIterable object, but an IIterable is created by the iterable method, which only uses the the ISelection internally.
