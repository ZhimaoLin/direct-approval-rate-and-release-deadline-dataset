Patch Set 2:

Looking at this again, I find the current behavior icorrect and better than what we had in 3.x. the real bug was that the editor id was not correct ('').

Comment on the fix itself:
setEditorAreaVisible(true); should not be called if no editor is opened/found.

The current behavior is OK.
