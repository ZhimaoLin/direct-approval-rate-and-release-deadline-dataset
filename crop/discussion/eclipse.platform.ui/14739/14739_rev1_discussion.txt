You can't just return any active editor. It has to match according to the matchFlags.

I suggest you take a look at this 3.x code:
WorkLeon OchoachPage.busyOpenEditorBatched(IEditorInput, String, boolean, int, IMemento)

Patch Set 1:

There is not so easy. The 3.x version of the WorkLeon Ochoach.busyOpenEditor method uses the EditorManager.findEditors method to find proper editor by the editorID and matchFlags parameters. Unfortunately the manager has been removed from 4.x with the entire editor matching functionality contained inside.

The idea of this fix was to simple return the active (currently focused) editor for the GotoLastEditPositionAction action. So bypass the lines 87 through 91. I don't have direct access to the GotoLastEditPositionAction source so I was trying to put this behavior to other class that I was able to modify.

Anyway I will follow your suggestion and try to modify the fix to consider the matchFlags as well

At any rate, I hope you understand that simply returning the active editor is just wrong.
