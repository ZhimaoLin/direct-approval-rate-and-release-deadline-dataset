DESCRIPTION

Bug 508498: Add "information" color api 

Introducing a color to be used by widgets that display text.
This is to be used by various Black/White color related bugs in JFace on
Gtk.
This gives us the flexibility to easily change the underlying system
color later when/if COLOR_TEXT_* is implemented. (See comment).

Patch set 6 notes:
Note: This is compatible with theaming. On Gtk dark theme it is dark, on
bright theme it is bright. In fact HOVER_ uses the same mechanism.
Further, this color is not in conflict with higher level theming, 
higher level themes should override system defaults with their own
colors if need be. The goal of this color is to be a suitable substitue
'default' color to be used instead of COLOR_INFO_*

Patch Set 8: Code-Review+1

@ Sergey, Thank you for spotting these bits.

Note updated commit message.
The api is not in conflict with higher level HOVER_ colors, but more like to set a suitable default to replace INFO_. HOVER_/JavaDoc etc colors can still override coloring where required. An example of this is:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508776#c11

I did some other minor tweaks. Please compare Patch set 8 to patch set 5.

I don't know why Hudson builds are not stable. I don't think it's related to this change?

I think the test failures are unrelated. 

Do you have already a Gerrit in which you are using this new API? Change looks good to me, but it would be nice to see how it is used.

Thank you for asking. Yes. 

This is to be used in jFace components as a suitable "default".
ex: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86768/2/org.eclipse.jface.text/src/org/eclipse/jface/text/AbstractInformationControl.java
This is not to replace 'INFO' Color. User-defined colors like INFO can override the defaults for styling. See #11: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508776#c11

This is more for things that don't require user customization.

Also I haven't written the patch, but it will be used in the following instead of the if condition:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/86098/3/org.eclipse.jface.text/src/org/eclipse/jface/internal/text/html/HTMLPrinter.java 

And there may be some other places which I will bump into later on.

Thoughts/Concerns?

Thank you.
