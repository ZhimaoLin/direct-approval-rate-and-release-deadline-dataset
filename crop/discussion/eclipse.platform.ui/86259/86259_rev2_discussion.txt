DESCRIPTION

Bug 508498: Add "information" color api 

Introducing a color to be used by widgets that display text.
This is to be used by various Black/White color related bugs in JFace on
Gtk.
This gives us the flexibility to easily change the underlying system
color later when/if COLOR_TEXT_* is implemented. (See comment).
