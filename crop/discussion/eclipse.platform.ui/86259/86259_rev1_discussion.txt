DESCRIPTION

Bug 508498: Add "information" color api 

Introducing a color to be used by widgets that display text.
This is to be used by various Black/White color related bugs in JFace on
Gtk.
This gives us the flexibility to easily change the underlying system
color later when/if COLOR_TEXT_* is implemented. (See comment).

Patch Set 1:

This introduces API.
From what I gather, the plugin version was bumped from 3.12 to 3.13 in commit: 65398a6aca2b20c7485756cc9522adc0a6c52779 (17/09/16)

Should I increment the version number further or do we go with only one version increment per release?
If we don't increment the version and use this somewhere, then this could cause some intermediate breakage for some developers.

Please advise.
