DESCRIPTION

Bug 160802: [Markers] Problems View, Errors: must copy whole line

- patch adds Copy Details submenu with additional commands (inspired by
similar use case in Mylyn, consistent naming)
- submenu contains "Description" and "Qualified Name" (inspired by JDT)
items for copying these information into clipboard
- patch intentionally do not put menu item for each possible attribute
as it would be too much and not usefull (just most usefull ones)
- main "copy" item remain unchanged - for generating tab-separated
report of all visible information as until now
- patch works for different kinds of markers (errors, warnings in
"Problems View" or tasks in "Task View")
- fixes also similar bug 244965
