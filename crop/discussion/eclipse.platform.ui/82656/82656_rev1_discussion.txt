DESCRIPTION

Bug 160802: [Markers] Problems View, Errors: must copy whole line

- patch adds Copy Details submenu with additional commands (inspired by
similar use case in Mylyn, consistent naming)
- submenu contains "Description" and "Qualified Name" (inspired by JDT)
items for copying these information into clipboard
- patch intentionally do not put menu item for each possible attribute
as it would be too much and not usefull (just most usefull ones)
- main "copy" item remain unchanged - for generating tab-separated
report of all visible information as until now
- patch works for different kinds of markers (errors, warnings in
"Problems View" or tasks in "Task View")
- fixes also similar bug 244965

Patch Set 1:

Cooool. Thanks for this contribution.

A few suggestions:

The column is called "Resource". I suggest to name the copy action also "Resource" instead of "Qualified Name".
Please remove the whitespace in the Javadoc.

Other than that, I think this is good to go.

Patch Set 1:

Regarding Qualified -> Resource - the menu item action is actually copying into clipboard full path of resource of the marker -> so i propose alternative - to name menu item "Copy Details > Resource Qualified Name" (still keeping "qualified name" term which is commonly used from JDT, but indicate it is from Resource column)
(follows adapted patch in this way, ...but if this variation would not be suitable i can in the end put just "Resource" label)
in patch is removed whitespce from javadoc of handlers(In reply to comment #2)
