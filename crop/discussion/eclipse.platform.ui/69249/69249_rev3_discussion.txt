Thanks a lot Markus. I answered as comments. If one of your //TODO is not commented, it means that I take it into account and will fix it as suggested in next patch set, without need for additional explanation or discussion.

Line:68, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> Ok.
What about
@return the children location (at any depth) that this configurator suggests to import as project
?

Line:81, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> What about
@param proposals The current set for files that will be proposed as import for users.

Line:86, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> The order in which the projectConfigurators add proposals is not specified and cannot be guessed reliably. Some typical use case include:
- Maven pom.xml in JDT "bin/" folder -> in such case, we want to ignore that location
- Eclipse's .project in Maven "target/" folder -> we also want to exclude it.

The solution I wrote consists in making 2 passes: 1 doing simple discovery and the other doing filtering so adopter of this interface don't have to guess or care about the order.

Line:88, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> In the example above, it can be interesting to know that a given project how a given project is going to be configured. However, that's something discussable, and at the moment, I managed to write the m2e configurator without using the ProjectConfigurator part of that method.
So if you think it's better, it seems fine to remove it and have proposals being only a Set<File>

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> The use case for importing a project again is: let's imagine a plain project, then user figures out there is some configuration that they missed. Using IContainer, they can call this method and get proposals about how their project should be configured (proposing to add/remove natures). There's a "Discover and Configure project" pop-up menu action I wrote that uses this, it's not part of Platform UI yet, but it relies on this method.

Line:168, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> Ok for ignoredPaths.
