Patch Set 4:

@Markus: Patch Set #4 should add changes for all your suggestions. I removed the TODO for those that are done. The only one remaining is about the removeDirtyDirectory method parameters. I'm not sure what's better between keeping a potentially useful parameter, and removing it.
Your advice is welcome.

As I'm writing,
I have the impression that since current implementation of ProjectConfigurator are internal, and since we don't have a "stateful" lifecycle for those, it seems actually misleading to present these to API adopters.
I'd be in favour of removing it then. WDYT?

(1 comment)

Line:91, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/ProjectConfigurator.java -> I tried to use a simple Set<File> instead of the Map. I find it happens to make the code more complex, and I have the impression that since this Map is actually what appears to user, it's easier for adopter to understand what is the object they're manipulating in this method.
So I would be in favor of keeping this method as it.

Is it OK for you? Can I remove this comment and fix the commit title to make "mergeable" ?
