DESCRIPTION

Bug 239636 - [Wizards] [Import/Export] Import projects as closed by
default

Add an Import option to import projects initially closed to avoid
unwanted build activities in large projects. Added option for the 'old'
WizardProjectsImportPage and the 'new' SmartImportWizard.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

The overall change looks good. However, I'm curious of the ability of the wizard to detect additional natures and nested projects in the case  of closed projects (as the Import Strategies allow to poll project content to find additional metadata).
This typically happen in the case of some imports like Java EE projects without a .project, when the import detects afterwards that it's a Java EE project, against the project content in the Eclipse workspace. Polling content requires workspace to be open.
So there should be a link between the various checkboxes, ie importing as open should probably disable and deselect the 2 other checkboxes (and vice-versa).
Also, I would avoid sentence that negate an action: an "Import projects closed" label is more confusing that an "Open projects" one (being ticked by default).

Line:110, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> Confusing sentence in the wizard. Prefer the "positive" wording such as "Open projects".

Line:74, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/SmartImportJob.java -> It would probably be simpler to call it "openProjects".
