DESCRIPTION

Bug 239636 - [Wizards] [Import/Export] Import projects as closed by
default

Add an Import option to avoid that imported projects are also opened to
avoid unwanted build activities in large projects. Added option for the
'old' WizardProjectsImportPage and the 'new' SmartImportWizard.

Patch Set 9:

To allow ProjectConfigurators to do their job during import I temporarily open the imported projects to close them at the end of the import again right before the auto-build option is re-enabled. With this solution the projects are already configured correctly if the user opens them after he imported them without opening them directly. Also we are avoiding to disable some combinations of import options. I personally don't like software that disables some options after I enabled another option without an obvious reason.

Patch Set 9:

I'm sorry but your explanation made me change my mind ;)) As the setting controls an action and not a state, using "close" in labels and variables seems more explicit and leaves less room for misconceptions. What about "close newly imported projects upon completion" ?
