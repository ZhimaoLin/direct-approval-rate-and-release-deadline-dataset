DESCRIPTION

Bug 239636 - [Wizards] [Import/Export] Import projects as closed by
default

Add an Import option to close imported projects after import to avoid
unwanted build activities in large projects. Imported projects are open
during the import due to copying of resources or project configurators.
Added option for the 'old' WizardProjectsImportPage and the 'new'
SmartImportWizard.
