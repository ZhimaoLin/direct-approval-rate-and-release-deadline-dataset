Line:198, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardResourceImportPage.java -> I've found usage of the BidiUtils.BTD_DEFAULT constant in the WizardNewProjectCreationPage.createProjectNameGroup method (line 226). So I've prepared the similar fix. Should it be also replaced with the StructuredTextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE one? For me usage of the StructuredTextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE is not clear. I would expose the StructuredTextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE constant via one of the BiDiUtils constants (or create the new one) to make it more obvious. Please let me know what do you think.

Thanks in advance for help with it,
Daniel

Line:198, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardResourceImportPage.java -> The "Project name" field contains a project name, and not a file path. It doesn't need a FILE handling type, since it doesn't contain file path delimiters.

> expose the StructuredTextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE in BiDiUtils
No, we don't want to duplicate some of the STTHF constants in BidiUtils. The Javadoc of applyBidiProcessing already defines clearly what is supported there. APIs should follow the DRY principle.

Line:198, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardResourceImportPage.java -> OK, now I understand the difference. Thanks for explanation, I've missed the Bidi api documentation
