DESCRIPTION

Bug 471782 - [ViewMgmt] History View always blank

Fixed various view management regressions regressions caused by changes
in bug 430988. Added tests for the expected behavior.

To open legacy views, use IWorkLeon OchoachPage.showView(viewId); to open e4
views init the shared placeholder first (basically same as the Ctrl+3
does, see org.eclipse.ui.internal.quickaccess.ViewElement).

> Sure, but this will not go in the maintenance branch?

I don't see any problem putting in the maintenance branch too — people will see this code if they look at the source.
