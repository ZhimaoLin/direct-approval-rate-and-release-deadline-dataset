Patch Set 2:

I prefer the code from Patch #1 as each call to EPartService#isPartOrPlaceholderInPerspective() performs two traversals from the perspective; you're calling this method for each part feature in the stack in question.  At the very least we could short-circuit to just find the first matching part.

In the IDE case, I'm almost puzzled that why we don't remove the part from the area.
