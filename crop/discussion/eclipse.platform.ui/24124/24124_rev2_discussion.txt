Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/EditActionProvider.java -> Shouldn't this have been removed if adding overrides?  There was a couple of other locations as well.

We have lots of places in platform.ui with (Non-Java) and @Override, so my current approach is to separate the adding of @Override from the removal of the Non-Javadoc thing. xxx@xxx.xxx is a real problem IMHO and the unnecessary Javadoc is only annoying.
