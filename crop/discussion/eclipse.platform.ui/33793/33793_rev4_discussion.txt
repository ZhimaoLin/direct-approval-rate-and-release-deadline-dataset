Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I don't see the advantage of creating a new class just to deprecate it. I suggest to leave it as inner class.

Patch Set 4:

I wanted to extract deprecated code from the ColumnViewer class by making a new class, so that the ColumnViewer does not contain that much code, which only exists for backward compability.
It's to purge the ColumnViewer Class.
Is it not worth doing this?

Patch Set 4:

I would prefer that we leave the inner class for now.
