Thanks for your submission, Manual.  A few little tweaks, and could you please flatten your commit and use the guidelines for commit messages?

Line:4070, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> Although it may seem that PerspectiveSwitcher was the only user of this method, it may be used elsewhere.  We try not to reduce the visibility of methods unless the method is broken.

Line:5501, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> I know this was in the existing code, but String.split() actually takes a regex, so we can simplify this code and just use

   persps.split("[, ]");

Line:5527, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> getWorkbenchWindow().getWorkbench() â€” please avoid using PlatformUI.getWorkbench()

I created this gerrit change unintentionally, so I redid the changes here plus 2 of brians tweaks in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/58607

Line:4070, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> I introduced this method (by refactoring) in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/58607 i.e. it is totally new, no one else could possibly use it, since that review has not been submitted yet.

Line:5501, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> ok

Line:5527, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> ok
