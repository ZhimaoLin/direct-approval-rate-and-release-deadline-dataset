DESCRIPTION

Bug 183675 [Forms] ExpandableComposite does not resize upon collapse

Pulled up the reflow method from Section to his parent
ExpandableComposite and changed the internalSetExpanded method to call
reflow() instead of layout() to reflow the composite and all the parents
up the hierarchy until a SharedScrolledComposite is reached.
