DESCRIPTION

Bug 493138 - CPD: items on 'Available action sets' column must not be
rendered in disabled color

This change only affects the left column ('Available action sets') on
the 'Action Set Availability' tab in the "Customize Perspective" Dialog
- all elements are shown now in same standard color, independently from
their availability.
