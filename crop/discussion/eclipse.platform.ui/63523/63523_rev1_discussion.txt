DESCRIPTION

Bug 417258 - trying to make IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest stable

Two IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest tests seem to be dependent on the test
environment (I have no idea why, except the timing or execution order is
different), they do not fail if running locally:
org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.testFindViewReferenceAfterShowViewCommand
org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.testFindHistoryViewReferenceAfterShowViewCommand

The patch makes the test order predictable and tries to tweak a little
bit the timing after showViewViaCommand() is executed.
