DESCRIPTION

Bug 417258 - trying to make IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest stable

Two IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest tests seem to be dependent on the test
environment, they do not fail if running locally:
org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.testFindViewReferenceAfterShowViewCommand
org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.testFindHistoryViewReferenceAfterShowViewCommand

Both tests are implicitly using ShowViewHandler, which uses active
window - if for whatever reason (slow GTK implementation) the wrong
"active" window is used, the opened view doesn't appear in the right
context.

The patch makes the test order predictable, tries to enforce the current
window to be active and tries to tweak a little bit the timing after
showViewViaCommand() is executed.
