+1 for the patch.
I only have one minor comment left.
Sorry for the confusion concerning the formatting, but whitespace should be removed and only the formatting of the real code should stay the same.

Line:69, tests/org.eclipse.e4.emf.xpath.test/src/org/eclipse/e4/emf/xpath/test/ExampleQueriesTestCase.java -> On the one hand I said the formatting should not be changed, but those whitespaces, shown by the red boxes, actually should be removed. It this a minor issue and I give you a +1 even though.

Thibault can you rebase that locally? I removed the whitespaces in master but now I get a rebase conflict.
