DESCRIPTION

Bug 322002 - [Commands] Undo/redo buttons for toolbar

New "Edit" toolbar is added in the WorkLeon OchoachActionBuilder with the Undo
and Redo actions. The Undo and Redo buttons are not visible in the main
toolbar by default in a similar way like the Print button. The user can
add them using the Customize Perspective wizard.
