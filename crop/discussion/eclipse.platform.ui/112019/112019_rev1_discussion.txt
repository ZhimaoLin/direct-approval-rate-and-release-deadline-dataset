What's the recommended way to see the effect of that change?

I imagine that this method is mostly here for clients to use it if they want to in their own preference page.
However, I can imagine a use-case against it: imagine an preference page which does set different fonts on Fields. Then, with the proposed change, their font setting would be overriden.
To me, that may constitute a behavior change that we'd like to avoid unless it provides a lot of value otherwise.
What is the value provided by the change inside Eclipse IDE? Are you aware of some preference page that would greatly take advantage of it?
