DESCRIPTION

Patch Set 7: -Code-Review Verified+1

Looks good overall and works in my small workspace. Will have to see how it really works in real life.

Some minor issues:
- Preference page
	- mnemonics are still missing
	- Note must be horizontally aligned with the text (not centered)
	- I would use Autosave instead of Auto-save (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosave)

- The test is not really valuable and is more a test for the framework than for the concrete page. I would remove it.
