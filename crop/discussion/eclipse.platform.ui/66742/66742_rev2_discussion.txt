DESCRIPTION

Bug 486644 - Automatic save of dirty editors

-Creates model fragment to save dirty editors
-Registers to the Event system for the dirty event and in case an editor
is dirty it saves every 60 s (the value is modifiable in preferences).
-Add a new Auto-save preference page (under Editors) that allows to
enable/disable the auto-save and change the interval of auto-save.
-Add PreferencePage tests
-Add new ISaveablePart3 interface that allows to be part of
the auto-save mechanism (or not)
-Add new e4 UIEvent : LAST_MODIFIED on Dirtyable

> I don't understand what you mean by mnemonics on a preference page. I thought mnemonics were for menus entries.

Any widget can specify a mnemonic and that's what we do in all our UIs. Just open one of the preference pages and press 'Alt' key.


>> The lowest allowed value should probably be higher than 1.
> Ok which value do you prefer ?

I would play around with several different open editors and find a value where auto-save is still usable.
