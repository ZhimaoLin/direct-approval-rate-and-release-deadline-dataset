DESCRIPTION

-Creates model fragment to save dirty editors
-Registers to the Event system for the dirty event and in case an editor

enable/disable the auto-save and change the interval of auto-save.
-Add new status bar item to quickly enable/disable auto-save.
-Add PreferencePage tests
-Add new IAutoSaveableEditorPart interface that allows to not be part of
the auto-save mechanism

One big show stopper is that the auto-save operation terminates many existing actions (closes their shell), e.g. content assist, hover, Quick Fix/Assist, linked mode etc. This will not be accepted by the users.

As mentioned before, using this together with Auto Save is almost impossible due to the unexpected caret movement.

Line:60, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> I would use "Auto Save" or "Auto-Save"

Line:1, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/AutoSavePreferencePage.java -> General comments on that page:
- An option must have a text followed by the field. We do not put the field in-between text.
- "Note:" needs to be bold (see 'General' preference page).
- The note does not wrap when resizing.
- It says that the page is reset when "the activity" restarts, but the user does not know which activity, e.g. mouse move, typing, executing an command, etc.
- Mnemonics are missing.
- The lowest allowed value should probably be higher than 1.

Line:1, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/build.properties -> Why did you remove the copyright notice? Please add it back.

Line:67, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The bundle version range must be specified.

Line:71, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please leave this at the original location.
