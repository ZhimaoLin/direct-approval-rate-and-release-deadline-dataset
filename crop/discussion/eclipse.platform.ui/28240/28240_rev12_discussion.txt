Patch set 12 is just to ping Gerrit to try building again; the error looked like it may have been a temporary thing. If it isn't, I will try to find out what is wrong with the code.

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/extensions/NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.java -> If we are willing to give up on soft reference lifetimes for keys and instead get weak lifetimes, we can strip half of this convolution for WeakHashMap, which will take care of the key reference side of things.

Patch Set 12:

Looks like the build error is not your fault. One of the repos the build is pointing to no longer exists (RC3). I guess we should bump this to the next on RC4 which is still there. Or better probably point to the released version of Luna until a 4.5 milestone is created.

I see more recent builds passing so this error might have already been fixed. I'll kick off another build.

Can anyone take a look at this CL?

I've been using it in my local Eclipse build and it seems to work fine.
