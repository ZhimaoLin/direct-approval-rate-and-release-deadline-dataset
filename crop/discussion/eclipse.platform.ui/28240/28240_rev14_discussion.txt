In one of your previous comments you mentioned that you observed missing updates in the Navigator view when the cache was re-enabled. Have these problems been addressed? If so, what evidence do you have that there are no remaining view staleness issues?

I'm pretty sure it's not an issue now, due to two things.
1. I was able to reproduce even when this change was not applied.
2. I was only able to reproduce in 4.3. Seems to be fixed in 4.4

Patch Set 14:

If we are willing to give up on soft reference lifetimes for keys and instead get weak lifetimes, we can strip half of this convolution for WeakHashMap, which will take care of the key reference side of things.

Line:109, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/extensions/NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.java -> Should be an else if; these two types are mutually exclusive.

Line:328, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/extensions/NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.java -> Ack, merge removed the debugging log message that went here; need to add it back in.

Line:35, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/extensions/EvaluationValueReference.java -> Should be final.

Line:86, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/NavigatorContentDescriptorManagerEvaluationCacheTest.java -> Should test different List type as well, just to make sure that "sibling" types that can still be equal are still matched.
