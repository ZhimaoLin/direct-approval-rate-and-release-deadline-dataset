Ok, that should be the rebase. As a lot of this code was removed in 4.4, this makes the change look "bigger" than it really is. To get a better idea of what has "actually" changed, compare the latest patch set against an earlier patch set.

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/extensions/NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.java -> If we are willing to give up on soft reference lifetimes for keys and instead get weak lifetimes, we can strip half of this convolution for WeakHashMap, which will take care of the key reference side of things.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ugh, so much bad grammar. Will fix in next patch set.
