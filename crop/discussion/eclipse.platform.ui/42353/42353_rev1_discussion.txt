DESCRIPTION

Bug 460503 - [Perspectives] Sometimes a button ("Save") is not hideable
from the toolbar

Fixed search for already hidden elements: it must use id separator (see
WorkLeon OchoachPage.addHiddenItems()) to avoid name clashes on contributions
starting with the same string, like "save" and "saveAll".
