I think activating the save actions applied to any changed lines is good.  But this looks like a bunch of changes that aren't necessary.

I had errors in my workspace due to the unnecessary casts and used the opportunity to clean-up a bit more. If you want I can only push the stuff which gives me compile errors due to my JDT settings.
