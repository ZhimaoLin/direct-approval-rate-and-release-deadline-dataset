Hi Mike, thank you for participating at the Eclipse hackathon Hamburg. Could you please resolve the whitespace issues in the StackRenderer? It is not that easy to review your bug fix, as there are so many changes, where only whitespace is changed.

Line:481, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Please undo those whitespace changes, which have nothing to do with the Bugfix
