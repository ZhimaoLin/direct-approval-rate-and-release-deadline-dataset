DESCRIPTION

Bug 498356 - [problems view] Add buttons to Problem View, to narrow
scope

Problems view will include the filter dialog on the toolbar. Clicking
the button will pop the filter dialog for users to choose how they would
filter the problems view. Changed openFiltersDialog() to protected so
problemsView can call the method.

Hey Alex, a big issue of problems view was fixed here : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500617 which aids with one of the bigger uses cases described in the comments. The overal issue of narrowing the scope of Problems view is yet to be finished.
