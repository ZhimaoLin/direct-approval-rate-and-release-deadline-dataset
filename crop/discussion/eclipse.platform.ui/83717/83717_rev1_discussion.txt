DESCRIPTION

Bug 506169 - UISynchronizer.syncExec leaks the interrupted state

Interrupting the main thread can cause things to break, so don't
interrupt it until waiting at least 1s - just in case it isn't
deadlocked.

I wonder if we can reuse Deadlock etc infrastructure to *simulate* the deadlock which could happen if we would not interrupt? This would avoid interruption in most cases.

> I wonder if we can reuse Deadlock etc infrastructure

I don't think that would work here. The Deadlock class can only detect deadlocks caused by scheduling rules. The deadlocks here would always involve a syncExec (which isn't modelled in the Jobs framework) and would often involve some sort of other non-scheduling-rule lock.
