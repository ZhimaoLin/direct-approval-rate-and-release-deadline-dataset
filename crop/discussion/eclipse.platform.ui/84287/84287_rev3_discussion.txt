Patch Set 3:

(4 comments)

We still need a bug report and the current commit header pointing to this bug report.

Line:5, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We increment by 100, e.g., 3.3.300

Line:91, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/wizard/Snippet072WizardWithProgressSubtasksAndCancel.java -> use split here instead of newChild.

Line:96, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/wizard/Snippet072WizardWithProgressSubtasksAndCancel.java -> Can be removed if you use split

Line:97, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/wizard/Snippet072WizardWithProgressSubtasksAndCancel.java -> use split with flag to show the text.

Line:91, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/wizard/Snippet072WizardWithProgressSubtasksAndCancel.java -> I don't want to use split here to illustrate that I want to finish a subtask and not be forced out by the exception.

I use split on line 80
