Perfect fix! However, I would put this into the same bundle that contributes the action (org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach).

In addition, a comment that explains where the "print" ID comes from, would be helpful.

Dani,
org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/WorkLeon OchoachActionBuilder.java *contributes* the action to the UI which is only *defined* by org.eclipse.ui.workbench, therefore I've also "uncontributed" it in org.eclipse.ui.ide.

So should I let the patch "as is" or do you still want to move the plugin change to org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach?

You're right, IDE puts it into the toolbar. So, the plug-in is fine. But I'd still like to see a comment regarding the "print" ID.
