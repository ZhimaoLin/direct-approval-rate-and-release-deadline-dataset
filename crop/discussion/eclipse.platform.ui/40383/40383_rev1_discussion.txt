Because "Unable to execute early startup code for an extension" is too generic, I would prefer to point out *what* is actually wrong (we know it, plugin authors don't, because it was OK before).

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/EarlyStartupRunnable.java -> I would prefer to use dedicated message "The startup extension does not provide a valid '" + IWorkbenchConstants.TAG_STARTUP + "' element."

Thanks Andrey, please check again.

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/EarlyStartupRunnable.java -> In this case we should also add the plug-in name.
