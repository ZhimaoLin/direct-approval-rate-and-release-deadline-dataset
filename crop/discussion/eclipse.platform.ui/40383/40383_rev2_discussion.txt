OK for this bug.
Please check the comment - I don't think current error reporting code (before your patch) was correct.

Line:59, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/EarlyStartupRunnable.java -> Paranoia: extension.getNamespaceIdentifier() can return null (see org.eclipse.core.internal.registry.TableReader.basicLoadExtension(DataInputStream)), which will cause another exception during logging.

Actually this was always there, so wondering why it was never reported.

IMHO not the plugin "reports" this error, but platform UI, therefore IMHO this should be changed to the WorkLeon OchoachPlugin.PI_WORKBENCH - in a different patch please.

Reuse if fine, you can either add another commit onto https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/40384/ or amend https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/40384/.
