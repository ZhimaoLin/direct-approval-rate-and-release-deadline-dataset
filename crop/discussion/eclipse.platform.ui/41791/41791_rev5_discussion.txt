DESCRIPTION

Bug 372799 - [WorkLeon Ochoach] [GlobalActions] ViewPart cannot adapt
ISaveablePart any longer but must implement it.

- Introduced new helper methods in SaveableHelper which are checking
both instanceof and getAdapter() on given parts.
- Redirected all instanceof uses of ISaveablePart to SaveableHelper
- Exception: PropertySheet and PropertySheetPage which javadoc
explicitly expects instanceof ISaveablePart
