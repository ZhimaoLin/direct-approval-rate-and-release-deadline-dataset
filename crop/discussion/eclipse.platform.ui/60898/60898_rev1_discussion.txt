Hi Ed, thanks. The change contains unrelated formating changed. Where are these coming from? If they coming from a rgeneration of the model, can you provide a separate Gerrit for the format changes?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

As this code caches the commands, a new test should be included into this change, that ensures that getCommands() returns the correct commands.. The new test should test removal of a command and the addition of a command at runtime and validate that the getCommand return the correct number of commands.

Note that this project has project-specific save actions and those kick in and do the formatting.  For a contributor it's almost impossible to edit these files without a whack of formatting changes.  I thought I'd backed out all the formatting changes before committing, but one wrong save and all is formatted again.

If you want contributions to the project, and you're going to ask the contributor to carefully avoid that saves to do reformatting, when the project specifies this is supposed to happen, you likely won't get much contribution.

True, but IIRC this is the first contributions in EMF generated Code hence we never had this problem. The save action are there to help people to avoid creating whitespace errors.

If I regenerate the EMF model does the generator undo the ws changes?

Yes, it does, but there's a trick we use with Oomph's models.  In the GenModel's Templates & Merge section we set Cleanup to true and we have project-specific cleanup actions that format, organize imports, and other such things so the generator produces results that allow us to edit the files and not have the save actions introduce further changes.
