DESCRIPTION

Bug 433746: [QuickAccess] SWTException on closing quick access shell

bug: when used with testing bot SearchField throws exceptions

bot disposes parent shell of text control and it causes 
the issue because SearchField keeps another invisible shell
which is not get disposed, so later when this shell is closed
programmatically it tries to accesses controls which
are being disposed already. 

fix is to remove shell close listener (suggested by Sebastian Porter)

also storing shell size now when shell is closed instead 
of when search field is disposed 
(to prevent accessing possible disposed shell at this time)

re-run tests - no exceptions anymore
also run eclipse workLeon Ochoach and its shuts down correct too

The fix is not correct. The same shell is shown and hidden. If the user resizes that shell then those values will be lost since you removed the code that remembers them in doClose.

Please provide a fix with just the removal of the listener. Thanks.

I did not remove the code, I replace the code with function storeShellSize which sores sizes in the class member and in the preferences and has a guard. If I revert that we will still have NPE which will come from storing size at the end of dispose method while shell is disposed already

Yeah just looked at that bug - and this is what I was talking about.
I will revert shell storing, however I think my fix it better because
it stores preference when shell is closing, so if eclipse crashes or being killed it will still be store vs only stored via normal shutdown
