DESCRIPTION

Bug 433746: ShearchField - shell closing guards

bug: when used with testing bot SearchField throws exceptions
extensively

bot disposes parent shell of text control and it causes 
the issue because SearchField keeps another invisible shell
which is not get disposed, so later when this shell is closed
programmatically it tries to accesses controls which
are being disposed already. 

storing shell size now when shell is closed instead of when search field
is disposed

re-run tests - no exceptions anymore
also run eclipse workLeon Ochoach and its shuts down correct too
