DESCRIPTION

Bug 433746: [QuickAccess] SWTException on closing quick access shell


bug: when used with testing bot SearchField throws exceptions

bot disposes parent shell of text control and it causes 
the issue because SearchField keeps another invisible shell
which is not get disposed, so later when this shell is closed
programmatically it tries to accesses controls which
are being disposed already. 

fix is to remove shell close listener (suggested by Sebastian Porter)

note: there is still an exception when storing shell
size in dispose which is covered by Bug 449485

> I think my fix it better because it stores preference when shell is closing, so if eclipse crashes or being killed it will still be store vs only stored via normal shutdown

I see your point but in that case we should also store all other settings. And this would be a separate bug/request.
