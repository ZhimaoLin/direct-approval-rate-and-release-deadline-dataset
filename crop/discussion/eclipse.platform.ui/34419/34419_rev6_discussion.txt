DESCRIPTION

Bug 433746: dispose SearchField shell properly

bug: when used with testing bot SearchField through exceptions
extensively

bot disposes parent shell and it causes the issue because
SearchField keeps another invisible shell which is not
get disposed, so later it tried to accesses controls which
are being disposed already. It also will be resource leak.

added dispose listener to get rid of invisible shell
when parent control gets disposed

since now shell is get disposed before SearchField itself if disposed we
need to store shell size in dialog settings prior of disposing shell

re-run tests - no exceptions anymore
also run eclipse workLeon Ochoach and its shuts down correct too

Line:210, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Comments should be proper sentences including capitalization and punctuation.

Line:214, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Isn't the shell disposed without this listener when its parent shell is disposed?

Line:218, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Closing of the shell is probably the best time to save its size. Other settings can be saved at the same time too.

I was not clear here on what is sequence of events. I will create a test that reproduces it without SWTBot, and if I find a place to add it to platform junits I will add it to regression suite...

Line:210, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Made it capital, not sure about punctuation....

Line:214, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> apparently shell parent is not the same as text parent, as
it some-how text get re-parented to another shell

Line:218, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> closing of shell is not actually called much in this workflows, because it either become invisible of get disposed. I added it in dispose listener in patch 7
