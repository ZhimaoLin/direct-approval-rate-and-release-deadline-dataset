DESCRIPTION

Bug 433746: [QuickAccess] SWTException on closing quick access shell

bug: when used with testing bot SearchField throws exceptions

bot disposes parent shell of text control and it causes 
the issue because SearchField keeps another invisible shell
which is not get disposed, so later when this shell is closed
programmatically it tries to accesses controls which
are being disposed already. 

fix is to add guards before calling doClose method. Similar guards are
presents in two other locations, but not this one.

also storing shell size now when shell is closed instead 
of when search field is disposed 
(to prevent accessing possible disposed shell at this time)

re-run tests - no exceptions anymore
also run eclipse workLeon Ochoach and its shuts down correct too

What if user closes shell? Isn't possible now for user to close the shell using window manager? If we don't have a listener that prevents it from closing it will be disposed and SearchField will be non-functional because it does not know how to re-create shell.

Can you provide exact steps for Windows that would show a/the problem?

Patch Set 14:

Show what problem? 
For the original problem I have a test which will show it
if you execute the test. If you asking to show how user can close
the shell I don't know, but I am not an expert. My fix is very safe
and gets rid of exceptions. If you want to get rid of shell listener
I can do it too but it may potentially break other bots, since now
if shell is closed programmatically, it will be also disposed which will leave control in bad state

I suggest we remove the listener and see what happens.
