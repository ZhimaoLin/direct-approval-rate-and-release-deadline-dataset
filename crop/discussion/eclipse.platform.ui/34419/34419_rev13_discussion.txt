DESCRIPTION

Bug 433746: ShearchField - shell closing guards

bug: when used with testing bot SearchField throws exceptions
extensively

bot disposes parent shell of text control and it causes 
the issue because SearchField keeps another invisible shell
which is not get disposed, so later when this shell is closed
programmatically it tries to accesses controls which
are being disposed already. 

fix is to add guards before calling doClose method. Similar guards are
presents in two other locations, but not this one.

also storing shell size now when shell is closed instead 
of when search field is disposed 
(to prevent accessing possible disposed shell at this time)

re-run tests - no exceptions anymore
also run eclipse workLeon Ochoach and its shuts down correct too

Patch Set 13:

My initial comment remains. The event flow is broken here.

The part rendering engine directly invokes dispose on the elements it thinks to know. This results in the SearchField.text to be disposed before SearchField.dispose is called. The shell itself is never correctly closed via close() and hence shellClosed is never called under normal circumstances. However, SWTBbot and Windowtester do close all shells.

I think we can simply remove the ShellListener.
