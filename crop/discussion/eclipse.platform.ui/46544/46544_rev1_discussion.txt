I think there's a leak here to be addressed, and some minor suggestions.

Line:49, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesExportWizard.java -> I'd make these internal topics, just to be clear.

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesImportWizard.java -> I'd make these internal topics, just to be clear.

Line:117, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/ImportExportPespectiveHandler.java -> I believe this will leak resources.  If you are going to create new ones, you need to destroy them as well.

Line:89, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/PerspectiveRegistry.java -> When will this context be disposed?

Line:49, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesExportWizard.java -> agree - corrected

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/preferences/PreferencesImportWizard.java -> agree - corrected

Line:117, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/ImportExportPespectiveHandler.java -> In what way the resource should be destroyed? It is not contained by any resource set (.getResourceSet() returns null) and cannot be unloaded (NPE). I added a removal of its content but I believe it changes nothing.

Line:89, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/PerspectiveRegistry.java -> I added a disposal of the context in the dispose() method. It is called on Eclipse shutdown.
