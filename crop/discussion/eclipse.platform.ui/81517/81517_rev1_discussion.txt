DESCRIPTION

Bug 501681 - Deadlock in WorkLeon OchoachErrorHandler.handle

If a job code wants to handle a status in a "blocking" way, check first
if UI thread can dispatch tasks. If yes, handle the status as before in
a synchronous way, otherwise submit an async task for UI thread to avoid
deadlock.

No, update of copyright is optional these days in the Eclipse top level project. Cool, hey?

We typically do not merge Gerrits from other committers, no need to use -2 to prevent us from doing that. I glad Dani reduced his usage of -2, we should not start that now again.
