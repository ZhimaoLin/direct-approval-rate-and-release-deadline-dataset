I still believe this is a good change. I'll merge it once the test have passed.
However, I have a copyright question: code was initially submitted in 2015, and is going to be merged in 2016. Is it fine to keep copyright dates to 2015 then?

I believe that what matters with copyright is the date when code was authored, so let's merge it as it.

The need to update the copyright header has been removed recently, so you can leave it 2015 (or update to 2016 if you prefer).
