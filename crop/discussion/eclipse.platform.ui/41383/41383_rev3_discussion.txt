DESCRIPTION

Bug 404009 - Customizing toolbars in a Custom Perspective and save the
prospective. Switching perspectives does not update the toolbar.

The problem was the not updated "old" descriptor of the original
perspective object still mapped to the "new" perspective in the
WorkLeon OchoachPage.

This does not fix bug 404009 for me using those exact steps:
1. fetch this Gerrit change into the dev workspace
2. start new target workspace
3. close Welcome
4. Window > Perspective > Save Perspective As... - use 'foo'
5. Window > Perspective > Customize Perspective...
6. uncheck Toolbar visibility for File > Save
7. click 'OK
   ==> 'Save' icon disappears
8. Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other - Java
   ==> 'Save' icon still not shown

Line:3845, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> Please remove those unnecessary braces.

Right. Interestingly problem isn't shown after rebasing - most likely fix https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/41378/ for bug 395601 fixes the bug 404009 as well.

Strange thing the fix here worked without another fix before... I'm still trying to understand what the problem is.
