> By the way, please don't use -2, this blocks the change.
I know.

> -1 is good enough to tell me that you have concerns.
Yes, but maybe not someone else who then submits.

> If I want to do evil things, I could push directly to master
Yes please (without the evil of course). For changes that you don't need/expect a review it's simpler and doesn't cause Gerrit e-mails to be sent to all who listen to that channel.

Same applies for work in progress. See bug 429647 for someone else who complains about the noise.

Thanks Dani, I prefer the workflow to always go via Gerrit. I want to ensure for example that I don't commit unnecessary whitespace and I find it much more effective to see this in Gerrit. I update the copyright. 

I also see the  "abanded / restored" noise in Gerrit, thanks for asking the person to stop doing that.

Line:184, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/Wizard.java -> I would change the message string to start with "getControl() ... " -> note the brackets after the function name. The same style with brackets is used for "setControl()" text in the message, so please make it consistent.
