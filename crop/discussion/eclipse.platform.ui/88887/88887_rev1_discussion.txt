Just a question for better understanding. Is Equinox DS still needed together with Felix SCR? Or do we have two SCR implementations in that case?

In order to avoid a lot of configuration errors while migrating to felix SCR I have decided to keep equinox.ds but only as a simple way to ensure felix SCR is activated at the right start-level.  There are lots of current configurations that will activate equinox.ds.  Each and every one of these would need to change if we removed equinox.ds altogether.  So no we just have equinox.ds being used to make sure felix.scr is activated.

Also note that I have not yet gutted equinox.ds implementation yet.  I wanted to make sure the features that include equinox.ds are updated first to includes felix.scr.  Just including felix.scr should not start it as of yet because nobody will be activating felix.scr.

Just to ensure I'm on the right track and someone else checking this patch. We will have two SCR implementations in E4 applications that are feature based and use org.eclipse.e4.rcp. But as nobody directly references a SCR implementation, none of the two bundles will be activated unless a product configuration specifies the auto-start. And most of the RCP applications out there have a autostart configured for Equinox DS.

Correct?

Felix SCR and Equinox DS bundles do not use the lazy activation policy.  If p2 is used then no bundles without the lazy activation policy will be marked for start unless they have a p2 configuration unit (CU) specified to eagerly activate them and set their start-level.  The problem is that there are many existing configurations out there that have a CU already present to eagerly activate equinox DS, but there is nothing similar for felix SCR.

What I am trying to do here is not invalidate all these installations or require them to be updated with a new CU to activate the DS implementation correctly.  Instead I am just leaving equinox.ds here but its internal DS implementation will be removed and it will only have code to find the felix SCR implementation in order to make sure it is activated just like the equinox DS bundle should be.  Now the felix SCR bundle should be pulled in because the equinox DS bundle will be updated (with a follow-on commit) to remove all of its internal implementation of DS and instead just have code to start felix SCR.

This commit here is just to make sure felix SCR is present before I do that removal of the equinox DS implementation code.
