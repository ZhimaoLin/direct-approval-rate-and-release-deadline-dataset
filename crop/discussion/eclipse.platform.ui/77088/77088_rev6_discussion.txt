Alexander, IMHO the minor, not micro segment must be incremented

Quote from https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_minor_segment:
"The minor segment number must be incremented when a plug-in changes in an "externally visible" way. Examples of externally visible changes include binary compatible API changes, an updated BREE (Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment), significant performance changes, major code rework, etc. Another way to know when this version number should be changed is by exclusion: it should indicate changes that are neither bug fixes (indicated by the service segment) nor breaking API changes (indicated by the major segment)."

Quote from https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_interfaces_-_API_methods

"Add type parameter -> If method has no type parameters -> Binary compatible (2) "

getAdapter has been considered as not-API change in previous cases:
