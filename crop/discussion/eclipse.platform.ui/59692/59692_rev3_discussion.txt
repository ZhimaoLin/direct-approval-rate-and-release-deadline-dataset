Thanks Jens, but this change fails the build. Please have a look at the build log, e.g., https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/7285/console and adjust the patch.

Jens, can you rebase that change onto the latest master?

Just for clarification, using Require-Capability you want to remove the direct dependency to equinox. But you don't remove the Require-Bundle. So I don't understand why the change should solve the described requirement.

Dirk, I do not see a direct dependency to "equinox.ds" in the MANIFEST.MF file. Can you clarify what you mean?

Sorry, my fault. I completely misunderstood the ticket and the contribution.

For anybody who comes across this, here is my understanding of this now. Equinox DS provides the osgi.extender capability since Neon M4. Now the e4 bundles can specify Require-Capability to that osgi.extender. If the capabilities are configured correctly, the former implicit dependency to DS becomes an explicit dependency and the auto start configuration for the ds bundle shouldn't be necessary anymore.

Does that makes sense?

Patch Set 3:

To get this patch in some modifications need to be done:

1. It needs to be rebased manually because of conflicting changes
2. p2.inf files need to be added to the META-INF folder in order to support capabilities at build time using p2.

Regarding the p2.inf, have a look at Bug 481449. I recently contributed the necessary p2 capability info to org.eclipse.equinox.ds. Adding the p2.inf to the consumers will make it possible to resolve capabilities via p2. The reason for this is that p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities yet.

I added p2.inf files with the following content in local tests to prove that it is working now:

requires.0.namespace = osgi.extender
requires.0.name = osgi.component
requires.0.version = 1.2.0

This way the build failures should be solved.

Patch Set 3:

Not sure what we should do with this patch. It does not work because of the missing p2.inf files. For one project this was fixed with another patch. Is the intention to update the remaining projects aswell?

Abandoned

There is no response on any question here and I added most of the require capability headers together with the needed p2.inf files already. Therefore this patch can be abandoned.
