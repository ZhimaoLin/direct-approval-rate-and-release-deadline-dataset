DESCRIPTION

Bug 411821 - [QuickAccess] Contribute SearchField through a fragment or other means

Provide the "QuickAccess" via a e4 application model fragment inside
of the "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". This removes the "QuickAccess"
search field from every none "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". If another
application wants to have the search field too, it simply has to provide
an e4 application model fragment which defines the required ToolControl.
(take a look at org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/LegacyIDE_fragment.e4xmi
to see an example)
