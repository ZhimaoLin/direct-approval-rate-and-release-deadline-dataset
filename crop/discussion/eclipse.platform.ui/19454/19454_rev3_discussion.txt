DESCRIPTION

Bug 411821 - [QuickAccess] Contribute SearchField through a fragment or other means

Provide the "QuickAccess" via a e4 application model fragment inside
of the "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". This removes the "QuickAccess"
search field from every none "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". If another
application wants to have the search field too, it simple has to provide
an e4 application model fragment similiar which defines the required
ToolControl. (take a look at org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/LegacyIDE_fragment.e4xmi
to see an example)

Line:226, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/internal/ModelUtils.java -> If these classes are needed, they would be separate classes.

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> This breaks a fix.

If added a question to your Comment in the CoolBarToTrimManager.java, please have a look.

Line:226, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/internal/ModelUtils.java -> That's not a problem, I will do this in the next Gerrit-Commit.

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> Can you tell me which fix it breaks, so I can test it. Because "modelService.find(id, searchRoot)" does the same as
"modelService.find(searchRoot, id, MToolBar.class, null)" and checking the resulting array if it contains an element.

The only difference is that modelService.find() has a short-cut if the id is null or empty.

Another difference would be that modelService.find() calls
   modelService.find(searchRoot, id, MUIElement.class, null)
instead of
   modelService.find(searchRoot, id, MToolBar.class, null)
and this would probably find more elements if the ID matches but this would lead to a ClassCastException on line 169: MToolBar toolBar = (MToolBar) modelService.find(item.getId(), window);

This ClassCastException is the reason why I changed the line, because there are multiple marker/placeholder objects with the same ID but different element types.

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> There can be multiple MToolBars with the same ID that show up from time to time, of which we work on the first one.  There used to be multiple MUIElements with the same ID from time to time as well, but the findElements(*) with MToolBar.class was probably sufficient for filtering those out).

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> Sorry Paul now I see the problem: I had a merge conflict because I changed the line to exactly the same code as somebody else does. I erroneously resolved the merge conflict by using the wrong/old version. As you can see in my previous comment I also always overlooked the fact that the right part is the stuff I changed and not the left one ;-(

Sorry for that I will fix this tonight.
