DESCRIPTION

Bug 411821 - [QuickAccess] Contribute SearchField through a fragment or other means

Provide the "QuickAccess" via a e4 application model fragment inside
of the "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". This removes the "QuickAccess"
search field from every none "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". If another
application wants to have the search field too, it simply has to provide
an e4 application model fragment which defines the required ToolControl.
(take a look at org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/LegacyIDE_fragment.e4xmi
to see an example)

Patch Set 6:

Hi Paul,

I've found the problem with the double QuickAccess whenever a legacy workLeon Ochoach is opened. The reason for this error are the old QuickAccess entries in the workbench.xmi which I clean now on startup.

Additionally I fixed the comments you suggested except one in the PositionInfo. Because removing the Exceptions from the getPositionReferenceAsInteger() would change the previous behavior of the ModelUtils.merge() method.
