DESCRIPTION

Bug 411821 - [QuickAccess] Contribute SearchField through a fragment or other means

Provide the "QuickAccess" via a e4 application model fragment inside
of the "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". This removes the "QuickAccess"
search field from every none "org.eclipse.ui.ide.application". If another
application wants to have the search field too, it simple has to provide
an e4 application model fragment similiar which defines the required
ToolControl. (take a look at org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/LegacyIDE_fragment.e4xmi
to see an example)

I've fixed my merge error in the CoolBarToTrimManager and moved the positioning inner classes to separates files as you suggested.

Again, sorry for the inconvenience.
