> Why not always adding the Search in Help?

I think we could try, and see what the users think about it.
I suppose we should put "search in help" as first element. Correct ?

Patch Set 1:

Thanks, now I see: so doing it does not interfere with the normal activity of the user. But the user has always that help search as last option. This is doable, and it is a very good Idea.
