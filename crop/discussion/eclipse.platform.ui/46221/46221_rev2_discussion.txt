DESCRIPTION

Bug 461311 - Workaround for crashes when the user attempts to open
the window menu on Ubuntu.

Remove the radio buttons in the Window manager in the case where displaying
them may cause Eclipse to crash. This crash occurs in Unity for users who
are not using the UBUNTU_MENUPROXY environment variable.

This is a temporary workaround that should be reverted once bug 461311
is fixed.
