In the bug report you mentioned that you'll provide detailed information later. Would be fine to get them. So you actual intent with this fix etc.

Also see inline comments.

Thanks

Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/ValueBinding.java -> Can you explain why you made this class public, besides instanciating it in a testcase?
I am not sure why you do not use dbc.bindValue in order to create the ValueBinding.

In case making it public is really necessary you'll have to adjust xxx@xxx.xxx tag. Setting up the correct api base line would help here. See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlatformDevelopment/article.html#platform_repo_errorfixing_apibaseline

Line:344, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/ValueBindingTest.java -> This test also does not fail when using the ValueBinding, which is currently in master. I'd expected this test would fail without your patch, right?

Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/ValueBinding.java -> I made it public, to be consistent with SetBinding and ListBinding. I will revert that.

Line:344, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/ValueBindingTest.java -> I will replace this with another test, that shows a possible inconsistency. Demonstrating multithreading issues in unit tests is always tricky, the test code isn't really simple and sometimes you have to instrument the productive code as well. So you should believe me, that there is a multi threading issue in the code.
