Patch looks good to me. Stefan, do you still have concerns after Conrads answer? If I do not hear back from you I merge this early next week

@Lars: My comments from Sep 2 resulted in patch set 8. There I updated the test and reverted my visibility change on the ValueBinding.

Patch Set 8:

I don't think this code is harmful but I also don't think it fully fixes the bug it is intended to fix. There's still race conditions in this code and anyone hoping to use it in the multithreaded scenarios it is intended for will still see data getting out of sync.

Personally, I'd go for the alternative algorithm I described in the bug - that should fix all the race conditions, not just make them less common like this patch will.

However, if you think that making the races less frequent offers some utility until we have time to do a proper fix, I won't object if you want to push this.
