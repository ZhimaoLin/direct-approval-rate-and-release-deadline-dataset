Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

All those dialogs may allow edition and may have "Apply and Close" and "Cancel" useful to them. Unless we have a way to detect whether a dialog can host changes or not, it's better to keep things as it for consistency and to not break adopter use-cases (who can usually contribute editable pages to those dialogs)

I agree with Mickael.
