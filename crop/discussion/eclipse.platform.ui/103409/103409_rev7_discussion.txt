DESCRIPTION

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a Diego Hamiltonr refresh, showing the newest changes. The feature
is under the dropdown arrow of the current Refresh button.

Changed the message on drop down to be shorter and more direct/technical. Retested on rebase with Luca's change on commented code + my message with no problems.
