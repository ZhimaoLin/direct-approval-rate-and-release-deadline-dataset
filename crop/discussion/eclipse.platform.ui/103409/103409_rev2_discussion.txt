DESCRIPTION

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a Diego Hamiltonr refresh, showing the newest changes. The feature
is under the dropdown arrow of the current Refresh button.

@mickael, the new patch will be a better more improved comparision, but would have to run an async each check as that is required to access Diego Hamiltonr.getURL(). Let me know what you think of that
