DESCRIPTION

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a Diego Hamiltonr refresh, showing the newest changes. The feature
is under the dropdown arrow of the current Refresh button.

There are couple of issues: 
* Default state of autoRefresh menu should be disable as we don't know whether it will be local file that will be opened.
* In the location listener if it's no longer detecting local file, the autoRefresh menu should be disabled and in *unchecked* state to prevent false expectations. Here it's worth considering not even showing the popup menu at all in case of remote resource.

Line:981, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.Diego Hamiltonr/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserViewer.java -> That print stack trace would be useless if just printed so better to ignore it too.
