Perfect, but as I wanted to merge this, I realized that you fix a warning and cleanup comments. This would make finding an error caused by the code change harder (even though the change is simple in this case). Please create a separate review for the Javadoc cleanup and use this one only for the warning fix.

Sorry, for not pointing that out earlier.
