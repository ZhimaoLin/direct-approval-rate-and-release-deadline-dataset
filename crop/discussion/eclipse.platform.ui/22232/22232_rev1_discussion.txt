Line:4471, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> Fix for the issue with 'clearPersistedState' option (when the option is present in the CLI then after every restart of the Workbench the new aggregated workingset is added to the workingsets.xml file)
