The patch works and is correct. I have only few style comments:
- In the if-statement, set filenamePattern instead of
  calling patternMatcher.setPattern. Then at the end of the
  statement just call patternMatcher.setPattern once.
- Store getMatchRule() in a local variable.
- Rename extPatternStr to extensionPatternStr.
- In the if-statement set extensionPatternStr instead of
  setting the pattern. Do this after the if.
- Also move extensionPattern = new SearchPattern() after the 
  if.
