Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Looks to me that this changes the current display of the user interface, the plug-in editor uses now a solid color without any change on the user side. I don't think we can do this. Why not adding chanding the line in 	Image image = FormImages.getInstance().getGradient(getBackground(), bg, realtheight, theight, marginHeight, getDisplay()) in Section.java. 

We would use getTitleBarGradientBackground() similiar to your suggested change.  If set and if we do not want a gradient we simply set this to the same value as the starting color. 

I think a gradient from red to red is actually a solid color
