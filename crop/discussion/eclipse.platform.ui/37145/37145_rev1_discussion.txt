I think the suggestion solution is not the right once, without looking into the details. AFAICS the starting color of the gradient is currently hard-coded to white. If that is correct, we should introduce a new setter which allows setting the end color of the gradient.

Line:458, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/forms/widgets/Section.java -> I did not dig into the details but if the problem not that getBackground() can be set from the outside but the "bg" parameter not? I would expect a new setter (new API) for the hardcoded color.

The proposed solution now only draws a gradient in case a gradient backgroundcolor is set, and otherwise it just draws the backgroundcolor, which has been set.
