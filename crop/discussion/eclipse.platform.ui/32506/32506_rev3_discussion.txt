Great stuff Steven. My remarks are:

* You put javadoc on an overriden method? Should this not go into the API.
* Reduce the complexity of the method by splitting the if/then/else into separate methods

With https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/43679/ is remove all unnecessary whitespace, so if you rebase this should also be gone.

@wim I put the documentation there because I did not know if ALL model fragments would implement this?  Are there other implementations out there that do not / will not support this?

We should put some documentation on a wiki page too;  How best to proceed with that?

I will implement test cases, but need some guidance on that.
