Looks good, but I think we should have a separate test for the functionality.

Line:44, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/xmi/modelprocessor/ModelFragments.e4xmi -> I think we should put this is a separate file.

Line:2, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/ResourceHandlerTest.java -> 2010, 2015

Line:163, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/ResourceHandlerTest.java -> I would prefer a separate test method for the new xpath functionality.

Line:188, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/ResourceHandlerTest.java -> Can we use modelService for the finding?

Line:44, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/xmi/modelprocessor/ModelFragments.e4xmi -> Agreed.

Line:163, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/ResourceHandlerTest.java -> OK.

Line:188, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/ResourceHandlerTest.java -> Yes, assuming the modelService works :)  This private method does not rely on other services.  Also, model service may have issues with elements that have the same ID.  In theory I could put the same element with the same id multiple times in a menu.  I don't know if modelService would be able to resolve that.  At least here we can count and validate if need be.

I will make the other changes and await response on this.
