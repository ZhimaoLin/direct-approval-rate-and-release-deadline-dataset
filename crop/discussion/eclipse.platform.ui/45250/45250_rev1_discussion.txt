This is the build error:

[ERROR] Cannot resolve project dependencies:
[ERROR]   Software being installed: org.eclipse.e4.rcp.feature.group 1.4.0.qualifier
[ERROR]   Missing requirement: org.eclipse.e4.rcp.feature.group 1.4.0.qualifier requires 'org.eclipse.e4.core.di.annotations 0.0.0' but it could not be found

I don't understand how the above feature project is involved by the .psf change

Looks like Gerrit is configured to allow only a merge if the verified flag is not -1

If the build is now ok, I can amend and push a commit with the same code and different comment.

Yes Patrik, please try this (I think you need to change at least the commit message)
