Patch Set 2:

The scrollbar is now responding as expected.
The only issue is when you shrink the size vertically, hiding the last element, then you increase the vertical size again, the items in the table are not updated on the fly.

IMO, this is not a big issue, but it is worth to spend some time to see if it is possible to fix this
