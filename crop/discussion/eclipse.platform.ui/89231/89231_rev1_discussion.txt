Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Looks to easy to be accepted :-)

Can you please add tests for this API too?
We have enough code which seem to work but fails on every possible occasion :-)

Patch Set 1:

The automated tests, that failed don't seem to be connected with this patch. I checked the results for other patches, there these tests also failed. Is it possible that there are broken tests in master?

I don't exactly know how to write automated tests for eclipse. I'm not really into this topic.
