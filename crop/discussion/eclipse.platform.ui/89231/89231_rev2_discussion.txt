Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

I'm still not convinced. Whatever the new code does (especially in such prominent place) should be tested, otherwise we will provide implementation of something we don't even know *if* it works, *how* it works and if it will fail after some innocent change.

Please check the disabled (XXX) tests in org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest. They probably only need to be enabled :-)

Patch Set 2:

After so many years, we seem fine without these methods. I suggest to close the bug as wontfix.

I have no insights into how this was done in e4 and why those methods throw today exceptions, but the API is NOT deprecated. Either we should fix this (like this gerrit proposes) or we should deprecate the API.

Me neither. This was before my active time.

+2 for deprecation and marking them for deletion

After my Eclipse 4 Migration talk at Javaland I was contacted by someone that told me they can't migrate because all their applications rely on hiding/showing the editor area on perspective switch. I have just looked at the ticket and found this patch. To be honest not yet sure what it does.

But why should we deprecate methods that are used in E3 based applications? Without a solution on this people are blocked with the first step in migration, only updating the target platform.
