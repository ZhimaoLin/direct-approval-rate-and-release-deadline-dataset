Line:824, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> I think my patch and this one have something in common: they both are wrong if the active part was an editor. For editors it is irrelevant in which perspective they are.

Here we should first check if the active part is an editor or not. If this is an editor, we should return the active part as is.

How can one check in e4 if a part is an editor or not?

This patch will add performance regression because of overhead to the evaluations etc during part switching, focusing etc.

Line:821, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> this adds quite an overhead while switching parts, selection something etc, because all the menu/toolbar etc contributions, listeners etc all usually want to know the active part. In this sense my patch was definitely better, because it added only a single table lookup.
