I think this is a correct step but not sufficient to solve the Bug Bug 431032, see comment in the bug. Still I think this change is correct and should be applied, can you update the copyright header?

The comment in ModelPageLayout actually says that the MPart in the shared elements array should be set to TBR true (which implies code depends on that).  Why do you think that you should change that?

Thanks PAul for the comment.  I realized that I forgot to change something else....

The comment you are refering and TBR = true have been introduce in:
Bug 327583 - [Compatibility] ModeledPageLayout arbitrarily sets a part's TBR flag to 'false' even if it is rendered in other perspectives.

I think the resolution was not 100% perfectly right. The problem was coming from the LazyStackRendered in the showElementRecursive method.  When trying to get the Control of a Part that is not rendered...you will get a null.  I will re-submit a gerrit for review.
