Line:1265, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Eric says visible is not to be used with parts.

Line:402, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ModeledPageLayout.java -> You can't set the part TBR to false, it might be in other perspectives

Line:403, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ModeledPageLayout.java -> Eric says we don't use visible with parts.

Line:403, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ModeledPageLayout.java -> The model data should be correct. For example I want to switch the Show View functionality to work on the model, hence I need correct model data.

Line:403, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ModeledPageLayout.java -> The model data should reflect what it was designed to do, and visible was designed to move the entire composite to the  invisible shell.

Line:403, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ModeledPageLayout.java -> Not sure if we are discussing the same thing. Take Bookmark for example. Its visible property is initially set to "true" after start of the IDE, even though it not visible. Open it and close it and afterwards the visible attribute is false.

For *shared* elements the MPlaceholder rendering 'owns' the MPart's flags and nobody else should be messing with them. The the MPL the 'visible' parameter actually refers to the *placeholder*, not the MPart (I really wish the model didn't have 'visible' as the name for this field, it's very confusing).

Line:1265, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Basically 'visible' is a very low level state and should not
be managed in standard control logic. More relevant to this
code is that the ElementReferenceRenderer calls 'setParent'
on the MPart's control making the state of the visible flag 
irrelevant for shared parts. I'll explain on the defect...

Line:224, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/LazyStackRenderer.java -> This code is incorrect in any case...if the Placeholder's TBR is false then the referenced part's 'curSharedRef' *must* not point to it...

Line:226, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/LazyStackRenderer.java -> IIRC we should be able to replace all of this code by simply calling 'createGui' on the placeholder, the ElementReferenceRenderer should take care of the rest of the logic...
