replaces Buffer with Builder only where 'append' method is used.

Creating StringBuilder and converting it to StringBuffer makes no sense as it is slower than using any of them. Better to create similar methods backed by StringBuilder for others to use. and deprecate the StringBuffer ones so people see they are up for conversion.
