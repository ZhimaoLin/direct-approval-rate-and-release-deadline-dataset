Looks good to me. I'm a little bit unsure if we must provide a way for the user to undo his selection.

Brian, what is your option. Must we provide a way via the preference to undo the user selection?

Sorry, but I'm not clear what you're referring to.

If you mean a preference to disengage from full screen, given what you described for GTK (that the menu cannot be accessed in full-screen mode), then something would seem necessary for those users who do not have a keybinding.  An alternative would be to refuse to engage full-screen mode without a keybinding â€” perhaps just on those platforms without proper menu support when in full-screen?

If you mean the preference to never show the prompt?  I'd say yes, if we have a prompt that is blocking on the user input, as seems is currently the case.  Full-screen mode has been available in OS X for a while and from what I've read, users who use full-screen mode frequently switch in and out of full-screen mode.  It seems likely usage on other platforms will be similar.  For these users, the prompt will become a friction point.  The prompt is only needed for two reasons: (1) to educate new adopters as to how it works, and (2) to rescue users who inadvertently invoked it.  Once you're used to it, you'll never want to see a prompt again.

Now if the prompt was time-based instead, showing a message for a fixed time before self-destructing (300ms?), then perhaps a preference might not matter so much.  On OS X, these are called 'HUD' panels: translucent centred panels that disappear automatically.  Here's an example: http://www.raywenderlich.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ProgressHUD.jpg  Such a HUD would reduce the friction, since the user wouldn't have to do an action, and they're already having to pause for the resize/relayout to occur.

Thanks Brian. With this change we have a check box "Never show this again". From your explanation I understand that it is OK to have this option without the need to allow to reverse that decision via the preference dialog.
