Line:1705, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/fieldassist/ContentProposalAdapter.java -> Should it also check for popup.getShell() == null || popup.getShell().isDisposed() || popup.getShell().isVisible() ?

If I understood correctly, the additional checks are not necessary. Lines 1888-1890 ensures that popup is only not null if the popup has a not disposed shell and the visibility of the shell is not changed anywhere in the context of ContentProposalAdapter.

Ok, thanks, this looks good to me, but another pair of eyeballs on this one would be welcome ;)
