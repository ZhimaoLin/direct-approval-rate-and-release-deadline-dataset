DESCRIPTION

Bug 427774: Open project from navigator

Added context menu entries and actions to easily open or select a
project from a folder in navigator.
This makes navigation easier in case of multi-module projects (Maven for
example).

Cool.  I had 3 comments inline plus a comment about the location.  Open Projects/Close Projects are usually just after the F5-Refresh command,  Can you place this action there as well?

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Probably use org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.plugin.WorkLeon OchoachNavigatorPlugin.log(String, IStatus) to log

Line:39, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/FoldersAsProjectsActionProvider.java -> You would probably adapt to IFolder, using something like org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.AdaptabilityUtility.getAdapter(Object, Class)

Line:43, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/plugin/messages.properties -> Perhaps this should be Open As Project
