DESCRIPTION

Bug 427774: Open project from navigator

Added context menu entries and actions to easily open or select a
project from a folder in navigator.
This makes navigation easier in case of multi-module projects (Maven for
example).

Abandoned

For change in another bug.  If this is not the case, it can be re-opened

Patch Set 4:

IMO, this should be reopened. Although bug 427774 and 427768 provide some similar entries, they can be considered/reviewed/fixed separately. Only if accepting both change, it would make a bit of sense to review UI to avoid similar context menu entries.
It looks like I can't reopen the review, can you please do it?
