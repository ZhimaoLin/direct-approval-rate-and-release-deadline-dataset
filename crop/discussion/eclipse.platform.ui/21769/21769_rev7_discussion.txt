DESCRIPTION

Bug 427774: Open project from navigator

Added context menu entries and actions to easily open or select a
project from a folder in navigator.
This makes navigation easier in case of multi-module projects (Maven for
example).

I've made the update you suggested.
I moved the folder to the "BUILD" group, and it shows about "Refresh". Although it makes some sense in the UI, I believe these groups are misleading.
