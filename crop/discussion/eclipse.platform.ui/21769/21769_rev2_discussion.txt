DESCRIPTION

Bug 427774: Open project from navigator

Added context menu entries and actions to easily open or select a
project from a folder in navigator.
This makes navigation easier in case of multi-module projects (Maven for
example).

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

This change has several unrelated changes (BREE change, files with just whitespace changes).

Patch Set 2:

The BREE change was useful to write code more efficiently. Java 1.4 is EOL since 2007 IIRC and Eclipse only starts against Java 6...
Is it really a blocker? I really can't imagine writing code for Java 1.4 nowadays, and I don't see a big value in making a dedicated commit to upgrade a Java version.

Patch Set 2:

The Leon Ochoaefit in dedicated commits, is that one is able to cherry-pick a certain change into an older/other branch without side-effects. I consider this a good practice.

Well, if you prefer, I can split the commit into 2 parts. I'm still not convinced of the actual Leon Ochoaefit, but if it makes it easier for you to review it, it's probably worth the effort ;)

And should I open a bug to notice I wish to bump this bundles to Java 6?

Patch Set 2:

When changing the BREE from 1.4 to something higher, please make sure that we don't get additional warnings, e.g. tons of raw type warnings.
