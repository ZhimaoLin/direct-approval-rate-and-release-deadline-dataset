with this patch the user is no more able to change the background-color of the code editor with Eclipse GUI, is it the desired behavior?

It is controlled by the 'AbstractTextEditor.Color.Background' and 'AbstractTextEditor.Color.Background.SystemDefault' preferences

With this patch the background color of the editor will be 'hard-coded' in CSS to #202020 for the Active state and #262626 for the Inactive when Dark theme is selected.

Need to bind 'AbstractTextEditor.Color.Background' key in the stylesheet in order to work correctly but as far as I know this is not possible with the current API.

Feel free to update the patch or create a better version. I will be out soon, so I cannot work on another version of the patch.

Patch Set 1:

Using current API (the IEclipsePreferences CSS element) we can override the background, but we are not able to associate it with the state of the MPart. So I would define some common background color for both states and mark the state itself by the proper .MPart attributes (CTabItem background/border)
