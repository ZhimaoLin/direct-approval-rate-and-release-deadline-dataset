Why is this Bug related to Bug 450212 concerning the e4.emf.xpath.tests?

I really like your changes. Tests are running well and the reordering of the methods in the test classes I do also like.
I just added Lars in order to ask if it is ok to change the order of methods?
IMHO the new order from Thibault makes more sense and since this are only TestCases we should change this. What do you think Lars?

Hey,

This bug is not related to bug 450212 but first when i push review for bug 450212 i was on top of this review, maybe that's where i introduce the confusion but i repush a review for bug 450212 on top of head, 

also i add some laucnh configuration which could be useful for futur users to be sure to launch their test in a proper way. What happend to me with the failing rcp test when i wasn't sure about launching them in a proper way because they were failling :)
