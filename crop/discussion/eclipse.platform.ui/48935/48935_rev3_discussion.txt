We are discussing this on the ticket already. It seems a simple rebase is not possible.

Hence my request if you (or Dirk) can rebase it manually ;-)

Patch Set 3:

I tend to abandon this patch in favor of Change 52199.

The reason is that I tried to apply another patch for this one trying to merge the changes I did xxx@xxx.xxx But it created a new patch set, which seems to be related to inconsistent Change-Id's in this patch.

Nevertheless, the changes I took the changes made by Jonas and extended them so they match this patch.

@Jonas
Could you please verify the new change set, so we are sure to be on the same track?

Just to be sure, you want me to review change 52199 and it already includes your additional fix? It is currently not merging....

Yes, and I just rebased the change to fix the merge conflict.

It is still not merging. Could you kindly ping me, when it is merging, I will review it then...

It's not "it is still not merging" ... it is more "it is again not merging" because someone pushed another change. :-)

I rebased again, so you should now be able to review.
