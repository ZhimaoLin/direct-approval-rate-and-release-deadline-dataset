Line:468, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/internal/theme/ThemeEngine.java -> Since the new theme can have some style definitions missing we have to also remove obsolete SWT resources from cache. Unfortunately the resources are still in use by GUI Widgets so we can not release them directly (I'm going to discuss it using separate bug since it is broader topic ). However the user has to restart the Eclipse to get full effect of switching the CSS theme so we won't suffer from memory leaks
