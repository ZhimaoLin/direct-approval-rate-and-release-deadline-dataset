DESCRIPTION

Bug 364735 - [Viewers] ViewerComparator violates its general contract

Don't use DecoratingLabelProvider for sorting. The results from this
label provider are unstable by design and may change during the sort
operation. Instead, use the original label provider enclosed by the
DecoratingLabelProvider.
