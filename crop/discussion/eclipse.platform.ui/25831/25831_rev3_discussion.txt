Otherwise it would be different from Locale.getDefault(), no?  But now I'm concerned that if we never bothered to verify and then change the locale in the standard workbench processing, what's the ripple effect from changing the locale because we don't like it?

Line:545, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> I also thought of overriding the default Locale if we find out that the current default Locale is invalid. I don't think it is that "we don't like it", it is that the Locale is invalid! That's what the whole ticket is about. A user is doing something wrong (set a wrong Locale) and we do "repair" stuff in the back. The original ticket is about bad behaviour in case of wrong user settings, so I thought that was your intention to do repair stuff in the back. But I would be glad if others would step up into the discussion.

Line:545, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> Maybe we're OK with leaving the bad default locale and doing our repair on our model support.
