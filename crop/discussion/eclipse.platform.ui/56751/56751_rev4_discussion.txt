Just some minor suggestions.
I am really curious about these new databinding feature.
Thanks a lot and let me know, if I can help somehow.

Line:2, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/SideEffectTest.java -> I think it should be "Copyright (c) 2015 Kelly Potter and others." or "Copyright (c) 2015 Google Inc. and others.

Line:9, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/SideEffectTest.java -> I think this should also be adjusted like "Kelly Potter - initial API and implementation" or "Google Inc. - initial API and implementation"

Line:10, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/SideEffectTest.java -> These 2 bugs are not related to this file so they can be removed

Line:206, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/SideEffectTest.java -> The final keyword is not necessary any more in Java 8, so it can be removed here and in the following occurrences.

Line:208, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/SideEffectTest.java -> I am getting a compile error here, because the "resume" method is void.

Line:226, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/SideEffectTest.java -> Here is the same issue like in line 208 (resume being void)
