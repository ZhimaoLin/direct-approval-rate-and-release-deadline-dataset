Sorry for the long delay, but I think this is ready for another look. I believe I've responded to everyone's requests, including Sergey's request for better javadoc and examples.

Line:307, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> No, it can't already be disposed. This method is asynchronous.

Actually, if you see my comments in the bug, I was concerned that it may be confusing that runOnce is asynchronous while create is synchronous. Perhaps I should rename this to runOnceAsync?

Line:307, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Not a fan of that one. I actually find that less descriptive than runOnce and it does nothing to convey the asynchronous nature.

Line:307, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Please consider createAsyncTrigger and asyncRunOnce. If not, runOnceAsync is fine too.

Some suggestions from my side.

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Pauses "an" ISideEffect

Line:280, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> I know it is pseudo code since there is no actual implementation in this method, but I suggest to directly use IObservableValue<String> as correct return type

Line:288, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> This line should be
IObservableValue<String> fileContents = loadFileAsString(filename);

Line:289, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Here it should be fileContents::getValue, without the () behind the method reference

Line:325, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> What do you think about adding a createResumed method as well to avoid these two steps here:

result[0] = ISideEffect.createPaused(theRunnable);
result[0].resume();

Done.

Line:280, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Thank you. That was sloppy of me.

Line:307, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> I like using a suffix better, since it's consistent with the other methods in this class (such as createPaused). We may also want to add a createAsync method for consistency.

Line:308, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> No, that won't work since result isn't final or effectively final.

Line:325, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> The create() method also creates a resumed observable, but it performs the first run synchronously.

I'll add a createAsync method that does the thing you suggest asynchronously.

Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/SideEffect.java -> Done

Line:16, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/SideEffect.java -> Actually, it shouldn't have been here at all since it moved to ISideEffect.

Done.

Line:18, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/SideEffect.java -> Done

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/SideEffect.java -> I actually remember deleting that blank line because I thought you'd dislike it.

Done. ;-)

Line:219, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/SideEffect.java -> Done
