Since the cssEngine is null I had to use the JFace facilities to manage the icon's lifecycle. First tries to get it from CSS - if not available then get the default one (which I packaged in the o.e.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt bundle).

Tried with both GTK2/GTK3, looks good. Code is OK for me too.

Just to explain my $ws$ remark, I think it's far more likely that an RCP app developer will want to create custom drag-handle images on a per-platform basis than per-language basis.

I'm unsure how a french drag-handle might differ from an english drag handle :-)

It would be a romantic hand√©l? :)

Thanks for spotting. I'll change it to ws. Copy paste miss.
