The files also need their copyright updated.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could be a bit more specific than "some" ;-)

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/ResourceMgmtActionProvider.java -> should be: Iterator<Object>

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/ResourceMgmtActionProvider.java -> Why is Iterator<Object> better than Iterator<?> ?

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/ResourceMgmtActionProvider.java -> Because in this case we don't need to use a wildcard / unknown type.

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/ResourceMgmtActionProvider.java -> I'll immediatly fix that in a new patch set basically to make you happier ;)
But I still don't see the difference between "?" and Object. To me, both mean unknown actual type, so I don't think one is better than the other from a readability POV. I even believe "?" is somehow more explicit because it looks so mysterious that you know you have to take care of the type more obviously than when writing "Object".
Does it have an effect on the bytecode ?
