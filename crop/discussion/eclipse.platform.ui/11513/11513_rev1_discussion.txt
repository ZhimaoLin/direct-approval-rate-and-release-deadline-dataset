Generally looks good, though I think the implementation can be simplified.

A lot of the CSS changes can be backed out.  The CSS class for a modelled object is generated from its tags (see SWTPartRenderer#setCSSInfo()), and the CSS class is regenerated whenever the tags change, overwriting any additions that may have been made.

I think the BUSY flag should be moved to UILifeCycle rather than be on UILabel.  The element-fields correspond to changes to the corresponding model element's fields and are auto-generated through EMF magic.  Plus we could support other objects to indicate that they have a busy state

Line:540, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> This can be simplified: just add/remove CSS_BUSY_CLASS to/from this element's tags and then call setCSSInfo().  The CSS class list is regenerated whenever a part is activated.

(The other changes can then be removed.)

Line:954, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/UIEvents.java -> I think this might better belong in UILifeCycle?

Line:204, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/part/ViewPart.java -> You can simplify this by using UIEvents.publishEvent()

Line:46, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/StackRendererTest.java -> Just curious, but was there an issue in MBasicFactory.INSTANCE.createPart() and set the factory?
