Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

If you're setting a tag on the model element, you can listen for that and update your styling on change.  Your event handler should be able to get an oldValue and newValue out of the event.

I don't think busy is a lifecycle event, it's state that's associated with the MPart model.

Line:533, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> This should be removed and the change should now be managed such that adding or removing the busy tag should re-style the folder tab.

Line:262, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/UIEvents.java -> Should be removed

Line:970, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/UIEvents.java -> These topics are auto-generated from attributes in the MUILabel model.  We don't have a separate topic for different kinds of tags, just for tags.

Line:465, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/WorkbenchSiteProgressService.java -> Should be removed

Line:24, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/StackRendererTest.java -> This should be added to org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.UIAllTests.UIAllTests()

Line:32, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/SWTPartRendererTest.java -> This should be added to org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.UIAllTests.UIAllTests()
