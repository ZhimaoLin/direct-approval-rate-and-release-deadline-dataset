Line:544, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/part/WorkbenchPart.java -> You can't add protected methods to ViewPart or WorkbenchPart, They would be API.  In this case, something that needs the model can get the site from the part and do the test+cast itself.

Line:534, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> When using a model tag, you can initialize your EventHandler in the org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.StackRenderer.init() method.

Line:198, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/part/ViewPart.java -> You can't add public methods to ViewPart or WorkbenchPart, they would be API. This showBusy(*) method is for contributed parts to react to going busy, not us.  The model busy tag should be set/removed in org.eclipse.ui.internal.progress.WorkbenchSiteProgressService.SiteUpdateJob.runInUIThread(IProgressMonitor)

Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/CSSConstants.java -> Do we already have CSS constants somewhere in the bundles for existing swt CSS constants?  Bogdan, is this something that's done in org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.properties.custom ?

Line:551, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Calling setCSSInfo will eventually class setClassnameAndId on the styling engine which calls an applyStyles on the widget. Calling reapplyStyles will just do the same work twice (actually more work as all of the widgets will get restyled).

Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/CSSConstants.java -> We actually don't have a place to stick WorkLeon Ochoach related CSS Constants. We should grow one and also stick in the "active" constant that gets used for active part tracking (see WBWRenderer). Not sure if this is the package to put it in though - maybe it should be in the same place as CSSRenderingUtils (o.e.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt)

Line:90, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/SWTPartRenderer.java -> Don't think you need this.

Line:534, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I decided to use the existing itemUpdater since according to me it is the proper place for the "busy" support

Line:551, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> There is the refreshing issue when the method reapplyStyles is skipped.
