DESCRIPTION

Bug 459833 - ConcurrentModificationException in ServiceLocator.dispose

To avoid complicated locking inside
activate/deactivate/dispose/disposeServices and register methods, change
the type of servicesToDispose from HashMap to ConcurrentHashMap. This
will avoid still possible ConcurrentModificationException in
activate/deactivate/disposeServices methods.

Additionally changed "disposed" field to volatile to avoid wrong value
being used in different threads.
