DESCRIPTION

Bug 459833 - ConcurrentModificationException in ServiceLocator.dispose

To avoid complicated locking inside
activate/deactivate/dispose/disposeServices and register methods, change
the type of servicesToDispose from HashMap to ConcurrentHashMap. This
will avoid still possible ConcurrentModificationException in
activate/deactivate/disposeServices methods.

Changed "disposed" and "e4Context" fields to volatile to
avoid wrong values being used in different threads.

Changed registerService() to log an IllegalStateException with
additional information about service/implementor types if the locator
instance was already disposed.

Changed activate/deactivate/disposeServices to use SafeRunner.
