This seems pretty good to me. I just have a few comments and suggestions.

Line:179, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceEncodingFieldEditor.java -> we can also get rid of the parenthesis by the way.

Line:59, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeViewerFocusCellManager.java -> Maybe it'd be better to remove the null check above?

Line:72, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeViewerFocusCellManager.java -> Maybe it'd be better to remove the null check above?

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ActionBars.java -> !(parent instanceof MGenericStack) || parent.getSelectedElement() == part

Line:197, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTFontHelper.java -> Isn't it actually highlighting a bug in the condition above?

Line:292, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ViewerCell.java -> I find it better to:
* keep check in the while condition
* Remove if above
* remove the null check on line 300 (which is already covered by the condition in the while, and conditions are better than break.

Line:59, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeViewerFocusCellManager.java -> Right, makes sense

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/e4/compatibility/ActionBars.java -> +1

Line:197, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTFontHelper.java -> I'm not sure about this. If so, it should be handled in a separate ticket.
