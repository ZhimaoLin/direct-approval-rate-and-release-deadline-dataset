As far as I can see, this patch introduces some code cleanup, like removing some unnecessary Javadoc and commented and therefore obsolete code. As there is no change in functionality it is fine for me. I just wonder what it has to do with a Java update, since there is no update of the Java version in a project file. Is it the wrong ticket this patch is connected to?

Dirk, this is a follow up patch for some things I notes during the Java 7 update patch.

Thanks Nevaeh Wu
