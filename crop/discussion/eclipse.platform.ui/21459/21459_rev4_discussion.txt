The patch looks huge, but most of the changes are just whitespace noise. Please avoid this in future patches, to make reviews easier. Thanks.

Patch Set 4:

We should run source code clean up on org.eclipse.ui and activate the save actions to remove trailing whitespace to get rid of this issue.

No that would be horrible. Those massive changes would make it much harder to see diffs using the Team > Annotations  feature.

The Save Actions preferences should be fixed to only touch edited lines and avoid unrelated changes.

Patch Set 4:

Dani, these are not meaningless whitespace changes. Almost the whole body of the method was wrapped in try-finally so the body had to be indented with +1. Without doing this for this change, any indentation rules would be useless. But in general I fully agree with your point.

Ah, yes, see it now. Sorry for the noise!

But it would make providing patches easier IMHO, which I think is at least of equal importance.

The Save Actions must be set, so that no noise is created. Reformatting every file is a no go.

Patch Set 4:

I think the save actions are already correct "Format edited lines".

Right, in this concrete change there was no "noise". It was false alarm on my side.
