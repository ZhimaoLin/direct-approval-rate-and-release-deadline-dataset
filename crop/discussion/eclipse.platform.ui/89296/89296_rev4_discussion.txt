DESCRIPTION

Bug 510228 [RFC] Ensure that Sections reacts to changes in the
background color during theme switch

Updates the BackgroundImage when new titlecolors have been set. Do not
finish the BackgroundImage when the BackgroundImage has not changed.
Copied the JUnit tests from ExpandableComponentTest to SectionTest and
add tests to check for the correct behaviour.
