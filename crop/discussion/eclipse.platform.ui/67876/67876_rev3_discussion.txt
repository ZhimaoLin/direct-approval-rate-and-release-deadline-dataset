Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/messages.properties -> It would be nice to shorten it a bit.  Could I suggest
"Quick access to application commands"
"Quickly execute application commands"

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/messages.properties -> Question: is the quick access searching only application commands ?

Patch Set 3:

I think we can drop "application" and the repetition of "Quick". As we can also open files which are in the editor area, I suggest:

"Access to commands and other components"
