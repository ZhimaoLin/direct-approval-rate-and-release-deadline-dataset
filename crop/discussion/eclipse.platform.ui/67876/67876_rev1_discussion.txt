Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/messages.properties -> This text isn't quite right. The Quick Access will appear in all sorts of RCP apps, most of which are not IDEs.  And the contents aren't based on application content but on the UI framework.

OS X's Help > Search, which serves a very similar purpose, simply says "Search"

"Quickly access elements in the user interface"?
"Quickly access elements in the application"?
"Access user interface elements in the application"?

"Execute commands in your application"

Brian, I like your "Search" proposal. What do you think, should rename "Quick Access" to "Search"? I think that would make much more sense to our users.

"Search anything and execute commands in the application."

I would drop the "anything", for example we only "search" the open editors. The following would be good IMHO:

"Search and execute commands in the application."
