No problem. I *think* you put the change number from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/46455/ with a little typo into the commit message as bug number. However, that number should be the number of a bugzilla bug report where the problem is described that you want to fix with this change.

When uploading a revised version of a change, make sure you use the same change ID (and not 0000...).
