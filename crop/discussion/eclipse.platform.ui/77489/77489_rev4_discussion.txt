> Should be fixed now.

Nope. To test, simply check "clear the workspace" in the debug config. The default checked item in the view menu is still "Show All", even if in the "Configuration" dialog "Errors/Warnings on Project" is used.

Also please notice the Markers and Tasks views: they should follow the Problems view, otherwise it will be really inconsistent.
