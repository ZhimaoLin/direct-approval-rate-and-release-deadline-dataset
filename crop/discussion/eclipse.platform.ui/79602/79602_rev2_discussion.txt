Line:676, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> Do not use a lambda here, too many useless calls LambdaForm$MH.linkToTargetMethod lead to a lot of wasted runtime

Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/JobInfo.java -> ConcurrentLinkedQueue.size() is not O(1)

Line:619, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressManager.java -> Not thread-safe from the beginning. Now that we have a ConcurrentMap, we should probably replace the body of this method by 

return jobs.computeIfAbsent(job, JobInfo::new);

but it degrades performance for about ~12%). As I don't know if the lack of thread-safety causes issues, I kept the method as is.
