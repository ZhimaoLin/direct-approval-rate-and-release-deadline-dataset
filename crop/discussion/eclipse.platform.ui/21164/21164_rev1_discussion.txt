DESCRIPTION

Bug 376486 - IDE not extendable via fragments or processors

This patch works when the e3 app is started for the first time but it
fails to work correctly whena restart is done without cleaning the
workspace. I don't see anything obviously wrong with the saved
workLeon Ochoach.xmi after the first run. 

Please take a look if you want to see if you can spot the problem. It
could also be my M4 setup.  


## PartRenderingEngine 
Moved the processing of fragments before earlyStartup plugins

## model.exsd
Changed the extension point. Updated documentation

## ModelAssembler
Updated the logic to work with extension point

## ResourceHandler
Renamed some fields

Yes, you usually make updates and then amend the previous commit (and make sure it has the Change-Id in it).  When you push the amended commit for review, it'll show up as a second patch set
