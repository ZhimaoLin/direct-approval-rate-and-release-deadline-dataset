DESCRIPTION

Bug 502841 - TreeViewer::expandAll() causes cursor to flicker

createChildren(), changes the cursor from arrow to hour-glass and back
while TreeItems are created. In some cases, like e.g. expandAll(), this
method is call frequently (here for all tree items) and causes unwanted
flicker.

Remove BusyIndicator.showWhile() that surrounds the item-creation code.
This leaves the application code to decide whether some busy indicator
is shown or not.
