DESCRIPTION

Bug 502841 - TreeViewer::expandAll() causes cursor to flicker

createChildren(), changes the cursor from arrow to hour-glass and back
while TreeItems are created. In some cases, like e.g. expandAll(), this
method is call frequently (here for all tree items) and causes unwanted
flicker.

Remove BusyIndicator.showWhile() that surrounds the item-creation code.
This leaves the application code to decide whether some busy indicator
is shown or not.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Digging in the history of platform UI, the BusyIndicator.showWhile was added via Bug 154571. But as BusyIndicator.showWhile does not do any additional protection, e.g., like using a SafeRunnable, I think it is save to remove it.

I plan to merge this, but as Andrey also added himself to the review I wait a few more days to hear if Andrey see problems with the change.

Thanks RÃ¼diger.
