Answered there: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514068#c26 (i.e.: it's possible to use it in other platforms, but by default it's only enabled on Windows in the dark theme -- for other platforms the user has to opt-in, so, I think it's very rare for users in other platforms to actually hit this code, but not really impossible, so, the check is really needed, but the bugfix is Windows only as on Linux/Mac the issue is non-existent because after a redraw, which is called after changing the scroll selection, it doesn't take as long for the system to actually do the operation, whereas on windows that update can be delayed by quite a lot).
