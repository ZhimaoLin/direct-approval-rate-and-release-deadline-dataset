I checked the patch and it fixes the issue, but I think it should be put in the WBWRenderer class. The MinMaxAddon is not good place for it in my opinion. Additionally during switching the perspectives the wrong layout is displayed for a moment. I think we should try to hide this side effect for users.
Maybe we can figure out the shells that need to be updated (maybe with Shell.getModified) and layout only changed shells. It is important from the performance point of view.

thanks a lot for your help,
Daniel
