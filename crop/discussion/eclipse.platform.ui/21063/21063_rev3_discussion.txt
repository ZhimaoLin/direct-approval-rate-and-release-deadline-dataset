Works quite well but I'm with Robin the 'Close' should be 'Hide'. Also there should be the equivalent of the 'Restore Hidden Toolbars' available on the context menu.

Worse is that this isn't persisted across restarts which will be *very* annoying.

I'll comment further on the defect...

Eric, I think it is persisted based on the runtime application model. Did you see that it is not persisted? In this case I think this would be a bug in the persistence of the runtime model.

In conjunction with the https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/21662/2 commit, this makes totally sense.
