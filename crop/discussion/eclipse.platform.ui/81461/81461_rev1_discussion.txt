change seems correct. However I believe it's better to stick with existing indentation to maintain some readability.

Line:251, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TextCellEditor.java -> same thing about keeping indentation

Line:255, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DialogCellEditor.java -> Maybe better to keep same indentation as previous line here (spaces)
