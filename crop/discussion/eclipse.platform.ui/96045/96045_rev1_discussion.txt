DESCRIPTION

Bug 515965: org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk java Access restriction compile
error due to OS.setDarkThemePreferred()

Adding single override (manually added this line, because if I set
"enable project-specific settings, a lot of stuff is added), to set
"Forbidden reference (acess rules):" from default "Error" to "warning"
to allow compilation on Linux.
