I think we should add a couple xxx@xxx.xxx to the interfaces listed.

Line:28, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/IWorkbench.java -> We should add xxx@xxx.xxx

Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/UIEvents.java -> We should add xxx@xxx.xxx here.

Line:16, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> This should probably xxx@xxx.xxx
