I think this looks good, except for the one if statement mentioned inline.

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/dom/DocumentCSSImpl.java -> Isn't this transitively the same thing?

Cf answer inline.

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/dom/DocumentCSSImpl.java -> Ideally, I'd like to have written
selector.getSelectorType() == selectorType == Selectrp.SAC_CONDITIONAL
But this is not possible with Java. I don't know a better way to write condition for equality of 3 items.

Do you have a suggestion?

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/dom/DocumentCSSImpl.java -> If we only do this if selectorType == Selector.SAC_CONDITIONAL
_SELECTOR shouldn't that condition be checked at the beginning of the method?  Since there's nothing else that can happen if that's not true.
