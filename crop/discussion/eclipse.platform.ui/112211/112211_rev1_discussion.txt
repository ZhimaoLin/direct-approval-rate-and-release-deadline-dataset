Do we really need this? I would expect that a client interacting with FormText already knows that text.

I regularly stumble across the lack of that getter when trying to use databinding with FormText.

That was not my concern. I think that those who deal with FormText instance also know the text. Do you have a counter example?

Yes, sure: Albeit the FormText itself is readonly, the dynamic program code may still change it's content during runtime. It is the very same use case that makes it relevant that the Label widget has a text getter. This is not a contrived example, I'm speaking of a problem that occurs in our real-world programs.
