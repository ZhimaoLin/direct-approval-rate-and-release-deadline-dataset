Hey Brian,

I changed the code a little bit.
But the API Base Line Tooling still complains that the manifest version should be increased to 2.0.0 in the org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach bundle. In a former comment you said that this should not be required.
Any update on this?

I can't see why it wants the version bump: you've just only added a class and added API.

FWIW, I don't see any API tools errors.

My baseline currently point to an Neon SR 2 installation. Maybe I mis-configured something else.
Anyways I'd love to merge the patches related to this bug before M6.
Do you see any other issues with the current coding?

Patch Set 6:

I also see an API baseline error in:
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
The method org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.application.ui.MUiFactory.createImperativeExpression() in an interface that is intended to be implemented has been added	MUiFactory.java	/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/model/application/ui	line 48	Compatibility Problem

AFAIKS the major version needs to be increased.
