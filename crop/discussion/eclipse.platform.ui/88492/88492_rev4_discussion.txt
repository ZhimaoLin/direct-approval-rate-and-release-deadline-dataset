I guess these track changes until the workLeon Ochoach context is disposed of?

Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ContributionsAnalyzer.java -> These formatting changes are somewhat odd: some previously-long lines are being split over multiple lines (like this one)…

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ContributionsAnalyzer.java -> … but other equally-long lines are being un-spilt
