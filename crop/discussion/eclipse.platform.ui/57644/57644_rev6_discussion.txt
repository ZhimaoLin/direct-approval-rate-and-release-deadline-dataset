Please see inline comments

Line:35, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/HideTrimBarsHandler.java -> Typo in the initialTrimVisibilityValue. An "i" is missing

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/HideTrimBarsHandler.java -> I suggest to use the isEmpty() method here:

if (initialTrimVisibility != null && !initialTrimVisibility.isEmpty())
