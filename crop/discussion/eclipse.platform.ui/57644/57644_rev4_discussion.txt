See my inline comments and you might also want to have a look at this existing class: org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.ToggleCoolbarHandler

Maybe the org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.ToggleCoolbarHandler replaced by your new implementation.

Apart from that the feature is pretty cool.

Line:65, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/HideTrimBarsHandler.java -> Please rename the "string" to "initalTrimVisibilityValue" or something similar

Line:67, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/HideTrimBarsHandler.java -> 1) Reuse the "initalTrimVisibilityValue" instead of doing another get operation here

2) Use Boolean.parseBoolean rather than Boolean.valueOf to avoid autoboxing/unboxing
