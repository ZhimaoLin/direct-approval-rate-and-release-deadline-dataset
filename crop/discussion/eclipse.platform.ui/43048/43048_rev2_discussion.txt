Patch Set 2:

This caused warnings in the official build:
xxx@xxx.xxx

I've reverted it with http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/commit/?id=ce77aa3fd02cfb220c7af9e536f64368dad35dd0

You have several options here:
- disable the unused object allocation warning on the project
- enable the warning in the official build for the project and xxx@xxx.xxx again
- disable the xxx@xxx.xxx in the official build for the project

Patch Set 2:

Since object allocations are rarely a mistake, seems to me that we should disable the warning on the project instead.

> disable the warning on the project instead.

Makes sense to me, created a review for that here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/43271

Sorry for the trouble Dani.
