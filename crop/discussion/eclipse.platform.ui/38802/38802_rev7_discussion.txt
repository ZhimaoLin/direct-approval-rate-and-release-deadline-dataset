Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit message does not fit to the bug report. If this commit solved both problems, maybe you should merge both bug reports?

Line:233, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> Why is this comment out? It should be removed if not used anymore.

Line:2231, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> I like the change in this class but is this really related to this functional change? If not maybe create a separate Gerrit review for it? Note that you do not necessary need a separate bug report for it, just mention in the commit message body that it is a cleanup.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> There are many similar bugs which descrive some oddities of the CPD. I have picked two of them with the symptoms I think most closely related to the fix. BTW I have no rights to merge bugs.

Line:233, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> I wanted to let here a notice why the symmetry on add/remove is not kept. Usually if I have such code I would always search for similarities (like the setup/teardown order etc), and if I can't find them, I have a question why. The comment should help reader to understand why there is no symmetry in those two method implementations.

Line:2231, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/cpd/CustomizePerspectiveDialog.java -> It is directly driven by the change on line 2291 below, otherwise I would have to start with some Copy/Paste, which is not what I personally like.

Line:233, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> I think a comment is fine but not to leave dead code in. Maybe change the comment to:
// not necessary to remove the ModeledPageLayout.ACTION_SET_TAG + id tag as the entry is only disabled.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would pick in this case one of the bugs (with the correct description) for the copyright header. We can mark the other bugs as duplicates later or simply add a comment to the corresponding bug.
