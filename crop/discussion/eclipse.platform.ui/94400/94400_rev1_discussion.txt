Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

The About dialog has to remain simple IMO, and the typical user of this dialog isn't very likely to take advantage of the import/export here, and I think the people who want to export their configuration would expect it there neither.
I would rather see this in the `Installed Software` tab of the `Installation Details`, closer from the `Uninstall` button.
