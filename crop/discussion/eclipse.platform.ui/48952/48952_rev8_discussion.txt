DESCRIPTION

Bug 468796 - ClassCastException in Theme$1.propertyChange (127)

Theme Property Change Listener is made to process values either of type FontData[] or String for fonts and
either of type RGB or String for colours. So it could process the typed values as well as their String representations.
