DESCRIPTION

Bug 468796 - ClassCastException in Theme$1.propertyChange (127)

Theme Property Change Listener is made to process values either of type FontData[] or String for fonts and
either of type RGB or String for colours. So it could process the typed values as well as their String representations.

@Victor: I'm not sure about the platform-UI rules, but maybe you could add yourself to the list of contributors in the header with a reference to the bug number?

As we can see all the history in git, I never liked those constantly growing header comments. But if Platfom UI rules require to do so - I'll do it. However I never saw such a requirement ;)
