Thank you for your patch Isiah Lucas. There is one minor suggestion. See inline comments.

Line:1115, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/ImportExistingProjectsWizardTest.java -> As this is only a formatting change, which has nothing to do with the actual bug, this class should be removed from the patch.

You can easily archive that doing a mixed reset in the History View and leave out this class for your commit.
