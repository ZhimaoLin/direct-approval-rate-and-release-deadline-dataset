Hi Isiah Lucas!
The patch works very well. I have only a few minor comments:
1. As Nevaeh Wu already mention, please avoid refactoring and formatting changes that are not directly related to the fix. This includes the the extractions of local variables. Without this it is easier to notice what really changed in the fix and it makes the patch easier to backport to older versions. Refactoring can be done in a separate commit.
2. Please update the copyright date in all files you have changed.
3. I think the messages should be:
a) "Some projects cannot be imported because *their* project description file is corrupted"
b) "Some projects cannot be imported because they already exist in the workspace or *their* project description file is corrupted"
4. Please take a look at my inline comments

Line:22, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Please remove this trailing space

Line:950, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> The two lines above seem to have wrong indentation.
