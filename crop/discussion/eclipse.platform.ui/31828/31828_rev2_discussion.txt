Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I think we should refactor this patch to increase readability of it and commit it at the beginning of M3 in order to have more time for catching any regressions that it can introduce. 

It is quite huge change and committing it now for M2 is quite risky according to me

Patch Set 2:

In that case I can:
First, provide a patch with refactoring (without the fix)
Second, provide a second patch with the fix, based on the refactored code.
To avoid wasting of time, during the refactoring it is important to be aware of the fact that some of the code will be removed in the next patch (with the fix).

I verified that it fixes the reported issue but didn't have time to do a code review.
