Line:673, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I'm not sure if we should fix it in this way. Removing the CTabFolder.layout invocation is a part of the optimization process that is needed to fix the issue exposed by the "JRockit Mission Control " application. It blocks the similar applications to be migrated to the E4 (poor GUI rendering performance)

This cannot go in, Daniel is correct in that this was the most serious of the layout performance issues (it causes a layout of *every* instantiated view / editor).

I'll comment further on the defect
