Are any features used from EMF >2.11?
But if the build is using 2.14 explicit, then the modular target should do this also.

No idea :).

But we build against 2.14 explicitly as emf core bundles are distributed with platform and we want to ensure latest emf core is delivered to clients. Please change it to 2.14.

Karste, this is last development week for M4 so please either fix this one and push it or retarget the bug so we can have clear status of M4.

Patch Set 4:

I will retarget it, since I found more issues when testing the platformUi setup. I can't make it this week.
