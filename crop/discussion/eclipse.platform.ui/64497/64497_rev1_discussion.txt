Line:409, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/AbstractWorkingSetManager.java -> (unrelated to the bug) Should we better use workbench.getDisplay()?

Line:303, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/IAggregateWorkingSetTest.java -> Why sys.out? One can save the exception to AtomicReference and check it later,  instead of asking to look at system output.
