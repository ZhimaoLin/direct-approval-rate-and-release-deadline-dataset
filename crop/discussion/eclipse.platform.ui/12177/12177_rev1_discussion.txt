Paul,

Although this change solves the issue in my local environment where I was able to reproduce the issue I would follow the different solution if possible. So if there is other option to fix it please let me know and I will apply it.
The current solution relies on filtering the already existing actions during processing the toolbar contributions and I'm afraid that it can ommit some cases.

thanks,
Daniel

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think you're correct.  While we state tool and menu IDs must be unique it was never enforced and so in Products in the wild collisions happen all the time.  This might wipe out some of those.
