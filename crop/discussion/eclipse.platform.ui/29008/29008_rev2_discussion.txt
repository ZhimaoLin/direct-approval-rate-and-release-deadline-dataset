@Sean, I'm not sure what the "DO NOT MERGE" thing is. It seems you are deleting this file. SHould I just approve this?

Yea, basically, since this is a followup to a change that should not be merged into master, this should not be merged into master either. Well, cherry-picked is a more accurate term for what I don't want to happen, but DO NOT MERGE seems to be more conventional.

So yea, if you are fine with the commit this is a follow-up too, then this should be more or less considered as part of the same "change".

BTW, do you want to be added to the reviewers list for the "real" fix?

@Sean, yes, please add me to that. I might even work on the CNF again at one point.
