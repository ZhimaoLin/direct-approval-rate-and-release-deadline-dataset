DESCRIPTION

Bug 427997 - Delete and rename shortcut enabled on empty workspace

Return false if the selection contains the workspace root in
DeleteResourceAction#canDelete(List). This will disable the Delete
action on empty workspaces. Note that this addresses the delete-case
only, but not the rename-case that is mentioned in bug 427997.
