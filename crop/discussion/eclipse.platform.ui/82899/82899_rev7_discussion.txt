DESCRIPTION

Bug 264404 - Problem decorators on Resources Project Explorer

This adds the problem marker decoration to resources, via the Resource
CNF extension. Some performance should have been improved by avoiding
multiple refresh operations on same "branch" in the tree (only
refreshing the highest one).
