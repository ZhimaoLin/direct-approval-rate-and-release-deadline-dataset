DESCRIPTION

Bug 264404 - Problem decorators on Resources Project Explorer

This adds the problem marker decoration to resources, via the Resource
CNF extension.
Some performance should have been improved by avoiding multiple refresh
operations on same "branch" in the tree (only refreshing the highest
one).
The patch also include the possibility for JFace's DecorationOverlayIcon
to take an ImageDescriptor as input.
