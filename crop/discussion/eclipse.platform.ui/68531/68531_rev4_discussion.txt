> Can you add a preference to disable this styling? This way we can
 > activate it in our dark theme with the option for users to disable
 > it. This preference does not need a UI, it is sufficient if the
 > user can set it for his installation.

Ok, changed it to follow a preference.

A .epf file such as:

/instance/org.eclipse.ui.themes/SCROLLBAR-THEMED=true
file_export_version=3.0

Can be used to override the setting and turn it on in any OS (and by default it's true for the dark theme on windows).

Patch Set 4:

Sorry, I know I said "preference" but wanted to say "option for the user to specific on this command line or in his eclipse.ini". Similar to the -Dswt.enable.autoScale=false parameter https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.6/M6/

Can you get this done today? I should be able to review and test the code tomorrow.

Ok, will take a look at that. Mostly, I will keep the preference there as I think it's a nice approach and would make it easy to add a ui setting later on if needed and will make the -Dswt.enable.themedScrollbar=true set the preference value if passed.

Not sure if I'll be able to do it today though (but if not today, definitely tomorrow).

Ok, just enabled adding -Dswt.enable.themedScrollBar=true/false to override any value from the theme.
