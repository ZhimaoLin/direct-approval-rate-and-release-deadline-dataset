First feedback, the default should be false, hence such a setting should not be necessary

Line:344, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_mac.css -> This should not be necessary, default should be false.

I need to add that because when switching themes it will keep the last value when it's not set (instead of reverting to the default).

CSS handler should reset to the default during a theme switch, see existing handler implementations
