Line:466, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/HandledContributionItem.java -> Why not model.getLocalizedTooltip()?

Patch Set 1:

getToolTipText does already refer to model.getLocalizedTooltip() and it does additional work to ensure that possible key bindings are also presented. This approach is completely symmetric to the corresponding effects done in updateToolItem() on ToolItem instead of MenuItem.

So why are you using final String tooltip = model.getLocalizedTooltip(); in DirectContributionItem?

Patch Set 1:

Again for symmetry reasons with updateToolItem(), which does the same thing for ToolItem. I do believe that keeping the behaviour here analogous is consistent. If the behaviour of ToolItem is incorrect here, I suggest to open another issue for this.

Patch does not work for me on Linux. I'm not sure if Tooltips on menus are supported under Linux, need to test this.

Dirk, does the patch work for you on Windows? See Bug for a small example app, including translations.

You might be a victim of bug 452009. I will extend the example code to provide menu tool-tips that are not addressing the main menu.

We recently updated the XxxContributionItem classes so they have a common abstract base class. So this contribution needs to be manually merged. Although I think it is easier to apply the changes manually again to the new codebase, and I think the modifications can be done once in the abstract base class now.

Daniel, can you please manually rebase onto master? Dirk has a Window system available to test your change.

I will try that this weekend, but in the recent past I had very bad experience with any attempts of this kind of master synchronisation using egit. If all fails I need to withdraw the code review and need to provide a new one.

Daniel, as long as you use the same Change-Id you can update this review, even if you completely reimplement it.
