DESCRIPTION

Bug 485154 - Properties view reacts on changing to views in the same
stack

Properties view should never show content of hidden parts, and parts in
the same stack are "hidden" for the Properties view by definition.

Fix: if the Properties view is hidden, it should not react on activation
of parts in the same stack, because this will invalidate the current
selection (and shown content) anyway.
