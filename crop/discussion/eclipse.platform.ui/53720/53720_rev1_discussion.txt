Thanks Louis, change looks fine to me. Could you also upload an example plug-in with an activity based filter, which we can use to validate your patch?

Maybe I made a mistake but using the test plug-in attached to the bug this does not seem to work. Lars, can you double check?

Two additional questions:
1. Did this work in 4.4 and if so, what change broke it?
2. The code only filters in 'Show View' dialog. What about the menu itslef?
