IMHO, the patch would filter out all views, which are not registered using an extension point. Although this is not officially supported, someone could add a view to the application model only and AFAIK, there would be not entry in the view registry. Wouldnt it be better to directly call the WorkLeon OchoachActivityHelper here?

Line:185, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewContentProvider.java -> Cant we just call viewRegistry.find insetad of this loop?
