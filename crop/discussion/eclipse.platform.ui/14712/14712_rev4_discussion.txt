Thanks for the smaller patch which immediately shows what changed.

The stream should by closed in a finally block. With the proposed fix it can still result in an unclosed stream.

Line:215, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/engine/AbstractCSSEngine.java -> I think it should look similar to the following:

finally {
    if (stream != null) {
      try {
        stream.close();
      } catch (IOException e) {
        // Ignore issues during closing 
      }
    }

Any time I make a change on a file, I get some whitespaces removed, independently of what I set for "Remove trailing whitespaces" preference.
I'm sorry but I can't spend time removing those 50 whitespaces manually everytime I have a change, that's a pure waste of my time.
If you can guide me on how to keep those whitespace, I'll be able to propose another version for this patch.

Mickael, you are basically ranting about your own workspace settings. It looks like you enabled Save Actions and there you chose to modify the whole file.

You have two choices:
1) Disable them while working on patches.
2) After you save the file invoke Undo. This will only Undo
   the additional changes made by the Save Actions.

Thanks Mickael for this clean-up work. The existing whitespace can be annoying, especially as the platform discourage the usage of trailing whitespace. http://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform_UI/How_to_Contribute

I open https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=418910  to run the clean-up action on org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core to get ride of them.
