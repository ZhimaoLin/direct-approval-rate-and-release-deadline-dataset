Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Ok, let's take the code as it then. At least, the workaround is well documented so someone seeing an issue and reaching this piece of code while debugging knows there's something to dig here.

@Lars @Brian: I'll merge it soon. However, if you have the opportunity to have a look at the workaround and give a hint about it in the meantime, that would be nice ;)

Thank you for tackling this bug.  I'm not familiar with this code, but it seems that Andrey's comments on https://git.eclipse.org/r/44542 still stand: the XXXtestOpenAndHideEditor*() tests in org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest should be enabled, and pass.

Patch Set 2:

I have tried to enable those tests, but they failed. I don't have enough insight to tell if there is a problem with the implementation or the tests have to be adapted.
