You can't remove menu items in an SWT.Hide or SWT.Selection event.  That's why it's in an asyncExec(*)

Hmm, wierd the example works fine for me (see the video in the bug). The elements are only removed from the application model, and it seems that the Renderer already takes care of the possible clash here. 

Whether I can or can't .. it seems to work that way :)
