Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)

This is a generally good change -- just need some minor changes. 

Marking as -1 so that it will pop up back in my review queue once the changes are made.

Line:39, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/operation/AccumulatingProgressMonitor.java -> Leave this with package visibility. We don't want to expose the whole implementation - just the new static helper method. Move the new static helper utility to a new utility class.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/operation/AccumulatingProgressMonitor.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx 4.8

...and update the minor plugin number to 4.8.0 in the MANIFEST.MF and pom.xml files.

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/operation/AccumulatingProgressMonitor.java -> Change return value to IProgressMonitorWithBlocking.

Also, move this static method to a new utility class rather than making this whole implementation class API. Suggest moving it to a new class in the same package called "ProgressMonitorUtil" (feel free to pick another name if you can think of a better one). That will reduce the API footprint of this change.

Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/operation/AccumulatingProgressMonitor.java -> Please add a unit test for the new method.

Line:243, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressMonitorFocusJobDialog.java -> Change to:

Display d = Display.getCurrent();

It's guaranteed to work because this method is guaranteed to be called in the UI thread.

Line:244, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/ProgressMonitorFocusJobDialog.java -> Change variable type to IProgressMonitorWithBlocking.

Patch Set 4:

(2 comments)

Line:42, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/operation/AccumulatingProgressMonitor.java -> xxx@xxx.xxx when referencing external classes.

Suggested rewording:

Wraps an {@link IProgressMonitor} associated with the UI thread, producing a new xxx@xxx.xxx IProgressMonitorWithBlocking} which can be used from any one thread. The resulting progress monitor will send changes to the wrapped monitor asynchronously.
<p>
May be called from any thread. The thread that uses the resulting progress monitor need not be the same as the thread that constructs it.

Line:49, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/operation/AccumulatingProgressMonitor.java -> Change to: "Display associated with the progress monitor's UI thread"
