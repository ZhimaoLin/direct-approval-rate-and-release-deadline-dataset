Patch Set 4:

If you can fix another group of warnings, I'm fine with this going in.  Maybe another 5-8?

Patch Set 4:

Most remaining warnings are because of API. Not sure we do want to change API method signatures as part of this change.
Why not merging it but keeping bug 427923 open for remaining warnings?
