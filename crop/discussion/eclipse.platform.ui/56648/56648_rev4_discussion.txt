Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> No, it is a "weird" case. If I remove it, I get a compile error. Not sure if that actually a bug, but I did not want to change behavior in this patch.

Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> My bad. I missed that the adapter type differed from the cast type. This cast is necessary, you're right.
