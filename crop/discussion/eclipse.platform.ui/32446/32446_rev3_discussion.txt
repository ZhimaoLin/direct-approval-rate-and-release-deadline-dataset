Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/32446/3/examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse+JFace+Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet62TextAndDialogCellEditor.java,cm still completely reformatted.

To fix this, right-click the file, Replace -> Previous revision. This should reset the file to the state before the changes. Afterwards redo the changes.

Thank you for the hint Lars, but actually I tried exactly this several times yesterday, but unfortunately with the same result.

I guess it has something to do with the "carriage return", which is used in the original.

My "Text file encoding" is set to UTF-8 and my "New text file line delimiter" is set to Unix, which should be ok, isnÂ´t it?
