Patch Set 1:

Great work Steven. I suggest we move this data to the persistent state of the model. Having structured data in one field is usually error-prone. We were anyway planning to replace container data with persisted state. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=401043

Can you solve both bugs with this change?

I will wait for feedback on that bug.  In the meantime I will check in the next revision with min/max support.

It turns out that having multiple relative parts is not so trivial when the user starts to drag sashes.

This ended up getting pushed as a new change-id, so this one will be abandoned.  Other version was just rebased.
