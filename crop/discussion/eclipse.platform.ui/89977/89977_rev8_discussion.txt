DESCRIPTION

This reverts the revert commit 01c431b4466b0ac32c6c8bdf70aed078d8ec12b4.

Busy cursor is shown while expansion of the tree.

Introduced new expand methods that allow disabling redraw while
expanding the tree. The busy indicator will be shown until the tree has
been redrawn.

Doesn't it remove all feedback (spinning cursor) when an expandAll takes too much time?

No, why it should? This is actually my use case, an expand that takes too long. Perform a file search which retrieves a lot of values and then execute expand all on the toolbar.
The busy cursor is shown while expandToLevel is performed. Even better when using the new API to disable redraw, then the cursor is shown until the tree has been redrawn. However, this needs that the new API is called by the ExpandAllAction. The default behavior is to not disable redrawing, which just takes longer. But the busy cursor should be shown without flickering.
You should fetch the change from Gerrit and try it yourself with the Search Results view.
