DESCRIPTION

Bug 502841 - TreeViewer::expandAll() causes cursor to flicker

This reverts the revert commit 01c431b4466b0ac32c6c8bdf70aed078d8ec12b4.

Busy cursor is shown while expansion of the tree.

Introduced new expand methods that allow disabling redraw while
expanding the tree. The busy indicator will be shown until the tree has
been redrawn.
