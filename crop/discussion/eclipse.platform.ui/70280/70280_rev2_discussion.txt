Patch Set 2:

Brian, do you think this entry is valuable for users, expecially new users? I don't think so. I have neither seen a newcomer or another one seen using it and I train a lot of experienced and new Eclipse IDE users.

Patch Set 2:

Similar arguments could be made for half of the menu items.  We have no data on the larger scale of who uses these actions.  I think this kind of approach ("nobody I know uses it") is dangerous.  For uses who *do* use it, it has now been removed.  And Show View > Help > Help *isn't* equivalent: it still needs clicking on 'Search'.

IMHO Before we start removing items, we should have real data on usage.  What could be useful is to add some instrumentation to Eclipse to log usage of menu and toolbar items.  I know some vendor plugins log actions to Google Analytics.
