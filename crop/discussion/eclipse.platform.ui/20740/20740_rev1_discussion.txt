DESCRIPTION

Revert "Bug 421291 - Integrate org.eclipse.ui.images into platform aggregator build"

This reverts commit 227cf14966f95889bc55f7d4ad2fbff5d6ad352c.

Dani Meggert suggested that we should not include this bundle into the build, as it is only used as temporary source of images. The images will be copied into their consuming plug-ins
