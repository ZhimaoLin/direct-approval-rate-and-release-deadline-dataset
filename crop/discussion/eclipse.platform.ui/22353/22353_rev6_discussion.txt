After removing the 'images' directory from the 'org.eclipse.platform' bundle the CSS stylesheets don't see the new images. I've noticed at least one issue with the 'applicationCSSResources' property in the platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.platform/plugin.xml file that seems to be affecting it

Line:216, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/internal/theme/ThemeEngine.java -> I would add the default constructor for the OSGiResourceLocator class and initialize the 'startLocation' field with the empty string there

Ah, that is how it is found. Thanks. I adjust that. I also place the default directory again in, Dani has concerns about backward compatibility
