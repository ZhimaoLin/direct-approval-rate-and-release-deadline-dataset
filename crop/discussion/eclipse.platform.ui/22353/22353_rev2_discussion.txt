Patch Set 2:

I've noticed that the 'org.eclipse.platform' bundle still contains the images used by CSS files. Maybe we can include the migration of images to the 'org.eclipse.ui.themes' bundle using this bug. If you prefer we can open the separate one for the migration of images and push the current change as it is

Daniel, the CSS themes do not include "images" in their path. In their a magic logic which looks for the image folder if no folder is specified?
