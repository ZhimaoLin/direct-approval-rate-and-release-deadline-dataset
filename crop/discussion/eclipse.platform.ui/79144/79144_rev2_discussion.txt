DESCRIPTION

Bug 476045 - Commands visible in Quick Access don't show commandImage 

Improvement to previous fix, in order to use PlatformUI.getWorkLeon Ochoach()

org.eclipse.ui.internal.quickaccess.CommandProvider is now responsible
to get an instance of ICommandImageService. 

I changed CommandProvider public constructor, but is not a problem as
not API

That's definitely an improvement, Patrik.  An even better improvement would be to use our DI to create those providers.

What if I create a separate bug: "Use DI to create Quick Access Providers"? - (This will affect also Bug 495065)

Sounds good to me â€” looks like the whole set of QA *Element classes could be greatly simplified by DI.
