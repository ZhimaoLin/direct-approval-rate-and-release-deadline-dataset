Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/SelectionServiceImpl.java -> This code seems weird â€” it's possible that I add a selection listener to the app's ESelectionService (so I should be notified of selection changes on all windows) but my listener *could* be just added to the selected window.

Seems like an attempt to avoid having to perform null handling like you've added above.  Were you able to reproduce the situations getting NPEs?
