Line:1, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/views/OpenViewTest.java -> It seems like similar tests belong to org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.workLeon Ochoachpart. If you think it makes sense too, please move this to the existing package.

Line:2, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/views/OpenViewTest.java -> Missing copyright header

Line:19, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/views/OpenViewTest.java -> Make sure this is added to a TestSuite ( UITestSuite or ApiTestSuite) dependending on the best package.
