I don't believe BindingManager is in the correct state, as it's a global that we use to manage sets of bindings by scheme and platform.

Line:273, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/keys/BindingService.java -> The problem is that the BindingManager is a global entity and is not necessarily up to date with the BindingServiceImpl contextSet (BindingServiceImpl is not global, but a service created in each IEclipseContext (so different MParts can see different activeContext sets).  BindingServiceImpl delegates to BindingTableManager which is different.
