This change ties us to Equinox's EventAdmin, contrary to the intention of bug 412121.

Patch Set 1:

We must be able to create and launch the RCP Mail app.  Whoever suggested removing the equinox.event bundle needs to come up with another solution then.

Patch Set 1:

The current patch is just to fix the regression that blocks M2 (it is major issue). I've reopened the bug 412121 to fix it after M2. We have to modify the way we get the EventAdmin service. 

I can work on the bug 412121 to solve it as desired

Ok as a temporary fix.  Maybe note that in the commit that it reverts the change from 412121?
