Patch Set 4:

Andrey, you add me to the reviewers, however I never use linked resources, so I don't feel like I'm able to review the functionality properly.
I had a look at the code, but my lack of knowledge on this topic makes that I "seemed good", without more guarantee from my side.
Is there anything specific you'd like me to look at in those changes?

It's OK, thank for your time.

Looking on the screenshots - is the wording of the new option understandable? Does it make sense for you, especially from a "general" user perspective?

Yes, I find the wording pretty clear and precise here.
