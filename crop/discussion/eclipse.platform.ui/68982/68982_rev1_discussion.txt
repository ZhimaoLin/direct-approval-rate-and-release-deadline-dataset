Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Looks good to me. Require-Bundle to org.eclipse.equinox.ds definitely looks wrong. And with the added p2.inf file the build succeeds.

I think we now need two committers to approve.

P.S. Could you abandon your other patches in Gerrit to clean up a bit. Typically you add a new patch set on previous commits to have a better traceability.
