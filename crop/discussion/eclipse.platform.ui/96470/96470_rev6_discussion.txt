Patch Set 6:

- I added my testclasses to CssSwtTestSuite. As I did not see an execution of them in patch set 5.
- Is the location of my testclasses correct?
- Do I have to add JavaDoc?
- Are my changes to the existing classes (adding new public methods / making existing methods public) ok?

Patch Set 6:

I can do the detailed code review after the PMC approval before the merge, in general the code looks OK but I'm very busy and without PMC approval I will not do the detailed code review now.
