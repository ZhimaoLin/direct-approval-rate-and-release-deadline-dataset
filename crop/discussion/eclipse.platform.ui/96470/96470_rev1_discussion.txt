DESCRIPTION

Bug 516114: Add support for styling of TabbedProperties View

!!!This is work in progress!!!

First step for adding CSS styling support for the tabbed properties
in the properties view. Up to now only the TabbedPropertyTitle is 
considered. Styling of TabbedPropertyList is not yet implemented.

Open questions:
- Should we make it possible to style the different colors 
  IFormColors.H_GRADIENT_START, IFormColors.H_GRADIENT_END and
  IFormColors.H_BOTTOM_KEYLINE1, IFormColors.H_BOTTOM_KEYLINE2
  independently?
- Why does the setting of the foreground of the label show no effect
  (label stays white instead of the light blue as in form headings)?
