DESCRIPTION

Bug 516114: Delay creation of css property handlers

Lazily create the instances of the property handlers. If the properties
handler instances are already created during evaluation of the
extensions this activates all bundles that contribute property handlers.

Creation of the property handler instances is delayed to the point in 
time when it is needed.

To late for 4.7.0. Lets do it right in 4.7.1 with the deletion of the activator. This should remove the need for eager activation.

Yes I know that it is too late. I just wanted to show my proposal and get feedback if I am going into the correct direction. We can just keep this gerrit change unmerged until 4.7.1 opens up.
