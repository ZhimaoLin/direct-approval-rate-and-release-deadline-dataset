DESCRIPTION

Bug 516114: Delay creation of css property handlers

Lazily create the instances of the property handlers. If the properties
handler instances are already created during evaluation of the
extensions this activates all bundles that contribute property handlers.

Creation of the property handler instances is delayed to the point in 
time when it is needed.
