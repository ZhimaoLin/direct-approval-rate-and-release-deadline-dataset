Patch Set 3:

This patch will introduce some additional issues that cannot be addressed in CSS with the current API (I report them here so they can be tracked):

- when the user changes the color of AbstractTextEditor.Color.Background, the AnnotationRulerColumn widget (fold/unfold column) will not change its color until reboot, in CDT editor it will need at least a CSS workaround (can be placed into its bundle);

- the Canvas that contains the StyledText + LineNumberRulerColumn widgets won't follow the value of AbstractTextEditor.Color.Background;

- we will lose the Inactive color behavior for the editor (minor issue);

I believe we will be able to revert this behavior when the Bug 435655 gets fixed

It looks good for me. However we can consider removing the separate background colors for the Active and Inactive MPartStacks outside of the MArea and use only one color in order to be coherent with the current change. We can modify it using the new bug scheduled for 4.5
