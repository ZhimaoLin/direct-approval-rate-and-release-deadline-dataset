DESCRIPTION

Bug 514892 - Re-work labels in Problem configuration dialog

Creates a new "Description" field only for configuration dialog so that
properties can have its own label
Removes the ":" which were used inconsistently (in 4.6)
Removes also the ":" from group box, as columns in groups is not common
(see workspace launcher) and IMHO looks bad.
