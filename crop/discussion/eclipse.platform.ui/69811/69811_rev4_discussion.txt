DESCRIPTION

Bug 460698 - [Navigator][Project Explorer] Undo [ctrl z] deletes
resources without warning in Project Explorer and Navigator

This bug fix does not add the CopyProject and CopyFilesAndFolders
operations to the undo stack, thus fixing this issue. This behavior is
similar to creation of new file which is also not added to the undo
stack.
