Any particular reason why you placed it on the maintenance branch? I think the platform team only ports back criticial bugs and AFAIK translations do not qualify. Can you update the change for the current master branch?

Also see comment for the commit message.

Does not qualify for the maintenance branch. This change is now pushed to the master brunch.
