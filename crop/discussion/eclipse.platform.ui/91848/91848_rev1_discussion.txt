Line:254, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> private methods are always final. Please remove this modifier.

Line:261, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> Probably we want to use SafeRunner here, instead of catching Exception?

Line:264, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> I don't see why this should happen here and why do we need the extra catch block for that.
