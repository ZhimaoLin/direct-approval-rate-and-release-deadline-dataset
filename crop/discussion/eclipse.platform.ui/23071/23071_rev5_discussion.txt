Look great, I suggest to also check the command text, see inline comment.

Line:481, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/HandledContributionItem.java -> Also call it "UnLabeled" if command text is null or text size == 0

Also commented inline, please check.

Line:481, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/HandledContributionItem.java -> I've tried it out - it's not possible to have a command which name is null or empty - a run-time exception is raised in this case (about that command, not about this code).

So I think it's safe to keep the current code this way.
What do you think?

Thanks for the clarification, if command text cannot be null than the change is ready IMHO. Thanks for this contribution.
