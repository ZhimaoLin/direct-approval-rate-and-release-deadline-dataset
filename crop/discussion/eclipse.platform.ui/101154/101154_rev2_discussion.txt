Hi Andrey,

Thanks for your change, it looks ok, and for sure no exception will be thrown.

But still the job will be executed and rescheduled every 6 seconds, and in headless mode it will be done "for ever" because workLeon Ochoach will never be created, may be the number of times the job is rescheduled should be limited. What do you think?

Ideally we should not schedule in the headless mode at all. How do you specify that mode? Is this something "official", or do you just start your own application and don't start workLeon Ochoach there?

If you have no good proposal, I may imagine we can simply give up after 10 attempts or so, or increase the wait time every next call. Please provide a patch for that.
