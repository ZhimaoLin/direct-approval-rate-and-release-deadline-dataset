Two minor formatting issues, other this is good to go.

Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/databinding/viewers/ObservableMapLabelProvider.java -> Looks like JFace was not changed to use 120 chars per line. I changed that now, please combine the two lines

Line:28, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DecoratingLabelProvider.java -> Line break look strange.
