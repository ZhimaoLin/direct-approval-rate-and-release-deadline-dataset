"Import Projects from Filesystem..." is accurate enough IMO.
However, you patch doesn't place it above the "Import..." menu. Is it intentional? I actually like it better if that menu remains close to "Open File..." like it is currently, so I'm not trying to influence you to move it close to "Import...", just making sure it's not an issue.
