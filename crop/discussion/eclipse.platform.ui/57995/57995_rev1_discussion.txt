DESCRIPTION

Bug 479403 - [WorkLeon OchoachLauncher] Creates a workspace folder when
pressing Cancel

Removed (unneeded) call to appContext.applicationRunning() in case we've
got an exit code and terminate startup. This avoids unwanted side
effects with implementors of StartupMonitor interface: they assume we
have started up but exact the opposite is the case.

AFAIK applicationRunning closes the static splash. Are we closing it somewhere else?
