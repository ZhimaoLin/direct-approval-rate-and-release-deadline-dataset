DESCRIPTION

Bug 514662 - Rename "Windows" and "Mac" theme to "Light" (already done
for Linux)

The default theme for windows and Mac should have a descriptive name.
Using "Light", in comparison to the "Dark" theme should give the user
better information about the purpose of this theme.

Do the "Light" themes on all those platforms look exactly the same? If not, its not a good idea to use the same name.

The themes are OS specific similar to the Dark theme. We filter them based on the OS, a windows users will never see the "Light" theme from Linux or Mac. So if you are concerned that they will have similar "Light" entries, this will not happen.

For me "Light" neither tells me more or less than "Windows", but I also don't have a better name at the moment.

I read this, as "this change it OK for me". So I plan to merge it tomorrow unless I hear back from you.
