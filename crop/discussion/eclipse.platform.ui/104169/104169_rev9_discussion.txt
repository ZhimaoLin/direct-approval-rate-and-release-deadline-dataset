Test fail on CI. Does `mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles` work for you locally? I suspect when running with Tycho, the state is a bit different and the shell hierarchy is too, causing the error reported by tests.

Line:35, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/dialogs/ResourceItemLabelTest.java -> Should be 3.14 (same as version in MANIFEST.MF)

Line:21, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialogTestSuite.java -> Should be 3.14 (same as version in MANIFEST.MF)

Line:2, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/UiTestSuite.java -> Just remove the 2016 in such case. you can write 2000-2017 so it more immediately reads like a range.
