DESCRIPTION

Revert "Bug 515965: org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk java Access restriction
compile error due to OS.setDarkThemePreferred()"

This reverts commit 9a6348cce9b4a013e158e27e388e07bd05203805.

After further investigation, I found that the root cause was an issue in
my target platform.

I had "org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64" turned off, so that I wouldn't
see duplicate calls in call-hierarchy,
but this had an impact on org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk. Re-enabling it
enabled theming engine to work again.

As such, reverting the customization in options.

No need to revert. It's fine to have these settings.
