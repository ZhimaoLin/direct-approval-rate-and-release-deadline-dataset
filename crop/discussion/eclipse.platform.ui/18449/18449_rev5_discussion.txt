OK, we can probably push this once the comments are answered and then continue working on it in other patches.

Line:20, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/themes/ThemeElementDefinition.java -> Is this a display element or some kind of overridable element?  It's not clear why there's label information in here.

Line:24, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/css/swt/CSSSWTTestCase.java -> Why is this in the patch?  Too much white space change.

Line:20, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/themes/ThemeElementDefinition.java -> It is the base class for Font and ColorDefinitions and contains the common support for overridable. The overriddenLabel is the text that is added to the description to inform the user that the particular definition has been overridden

Line:24, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/css/swt/CSSSWTTestCase.java -> OK, I've pushed it by accident. Let me revert it in the new patch set
