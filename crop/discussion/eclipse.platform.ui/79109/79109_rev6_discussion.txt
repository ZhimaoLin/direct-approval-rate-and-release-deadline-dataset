DESCRIPTION

Bug 496747 - [Project Explorer] Fix path comparison

The comparison was erroneous and led to unexpected ordering. This fixes
the path comparison by using a segment-to-segment comparison rather than
a plain toString one (which fails at properly understanding the meaning
of a slash in path)
