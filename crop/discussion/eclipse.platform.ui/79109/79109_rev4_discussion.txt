DESCRIPTION

Bug 496747 - [Project Explorer] Fix path comparison

The comparison was erroneous and led to unexpected ordering. This fixes
the path comparison by using a segment-to-segment comparison rather than
a plain toString one (which fails at properly understanding the meaning
of a slash in path)

Patch Set 4:

Note that there was already PMC approval for this patch, and version of patch set #1 is already in master. Do we need to re-ask for PMC approval to merge that?
If not, then just having a +1 from another committer (Andrey?) is enough to merge.

I'm OK but please check if the plugin manifest/pom versions need to be incremented.
