Patch Set 3:

My initial approach was wrong. While trying to find better fix, in patch set #3 I experiment with adding the "additions" marker (fixes problem with the "after=additions" contributions) and "afterAdditions" marker which helps to show the "after=additions" contributions in the correct order.
