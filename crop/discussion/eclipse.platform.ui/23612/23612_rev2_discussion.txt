Line:400, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ContributionsAnalyzer.java -> We'd have to work on this some more, I don't think we can just embed a constant in here ("additions" was different).

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> We need to be clear what we're saying here.
