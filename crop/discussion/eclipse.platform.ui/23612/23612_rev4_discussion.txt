The latest patch set is refined version of the previous patch sets. It is still based on adding new trim items before perspective spacer.

The code in the WorkLeon OchoachPage looks fine but I'm less sure about the CBTT code...

Line:184, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> Wojciech, I'm a bit confused as to what this code change adds.
It looks like the work done in WorkLeon OchoachPage should fix the
issue; what does this code fix that the WBPage code doesn't ?

The change in WorkLeon OchoachWindow fixes only "static" contributions. It does not fix "Dynamic" contributions (EditorActionBarContributions). I agree that this fix in CBTTM is not elegant and it does not 'scale', so ideas how to do this better are welcome.
