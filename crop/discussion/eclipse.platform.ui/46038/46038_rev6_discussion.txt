Tony, you have more taste than I have ;-). Can you review this one?

Patch Set 6:

Thanks for taking a stab at this, Patrik.  It's definitely an improvement if a bit unsexy. The only stumbling block here is that the images need to be freed: DnDManager#clearOverlay() doesn't free the images. But this looks like a failing of DnDManager and should be a separate but dependent bug.

Would it at least make sense to pre-compute the images?

Patch Set 6:

I was thinking at a DnD failure since changeset #1 to #3. There I added an image with transparent bg and a single polygon, but I found the DnD displays only a dark green square containing the image bounds. (My impression is you can use a single color for the overlay)
After this observation I realized that I can not add an image, so I re-created the triangle-down by putting rectangles one on top of the other

Patch Set 6:

(corrected): I was thinking at DnD failure since Patch Set 1, where I draw an Image with a polygon representing the arrow. 
I realized the dndManager.addImage(img) it is not really working, as after you add an image, you can see only a rectangle filled by one color, corresponding to the image bounds. My impression was you can use only single color rectangles to draw on the overlay.
After I realized that I can not add an image, I re-created the "triangle-down" by putting rectangles one on top of the other.

Patch Set 6:

The current design does seem pretty limiting :-/  It would be nice to support something like a Safari-style tab animation, where the tabs are moved to show where the new tab would appear.

Anyways, we could at least pre-allocate the 6 images.  Especially since there's a single DnDManager created per window, so these images just accumulate over the lifetime of the window.  I've reworked your patch slightly and based it on a patch for 477398.
