Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please restore the title how it was in snapshot #2.

Line:39, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.job/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/jobs/actions/DebugJobManagerAction.java -> Remove the accidentally added blank line.

Line:48, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.job/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/jobs/TestJobRule.java -> Having xxx@xxx.xxx tag without an explanation what the method returns makes no sense.

Line:52, examples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.job/src/org/eclipse/ui/examples/jobs/views/JobsView.java -> Revert changes unrelated to the bug this patch is addressing. There are many throughout this file.
