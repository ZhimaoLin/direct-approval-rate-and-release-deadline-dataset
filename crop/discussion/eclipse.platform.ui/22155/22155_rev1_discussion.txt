The change from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/22157 should be included with this patch now.

I'll include my other observations on the bug.

Line:175, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> Shouldn't this have already been set based on either being set when changing the combo or when the user deliberately switched the combo?  Or is this set the true change to the system, and getSelectedColorsAndFontsTheme() reflects the combo?

Line:325, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> These should be turned into constants, either in an internal interface (possibly org.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.IWorkbenchRegistryConstants) or in this class itself.  They also need to be updated to camel case.

Line:167, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme/schema/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme.exsd -> I think this should be themeAssociation.  We use camel case in our other extension points.

Line:169, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme/schema/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme.exsd -> This should be themeId.  It should also have a "link" to the extension point/element/attribute that can provide this ID.

Line:176, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme/schema/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme.exsd -> This should references that it's an ID.  Maybe colorAndFontId.  And it should also have the "link"

Line:230, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme/schema/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme.exsd -> These would then be updated to be camel case.

Line:175, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> Yes, this call is redundant since the theme is already set. I will modify it
