Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> Does this make sure that if we've applied a CSS background rule we don't need to make that the renderer set the background?  How important is it to mark children since they won't have their background explicitly set?

Line:101, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/css2/CSSPropertyBackgroundSWTHandler.java -> Does the overriden background not apply here because it's a side-effect of not being selected?

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertySelectedTabsSWTHandler.java -> Should this not reset a set background tag property?

Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_basestyle.css -> What defines which 3.x theme the definitions are added to?

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CTabFolderElement.java -> When the background is defined by CSS rule then it is handled by the background handler. The 'hasBackgroundOverriddenByCSS' check is to avoid the regression in behavior (the Dark theme explicitly defines the background color and possibly some RCP applications in the field). Actually it is the workaround for the transparent background color (I haven't found better way to support it)

Line:101, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/css2/CSSPropertyBackgroundSWTHandler.java -> I'm not sure whether I get the question, but the idea of it is to mark that the background for the Composite (not CTabFolder, I'm interested into Composites that are children of CTabFolder) was define by the CSS rule

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertySelectedTabsSWTHandler.java -> I've noticed some issue during switching the 3.x themes and modifying the values using Color/Font preference page and it was solved by this fix

Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_basestyle.css -> It is applied to the current one. After switching the 3.x theme it is reapplied to the new one and so on. The extending of the theme is done in the runtime only. So user after switching to the new 3.x theme will get the definitions used by CSS inside
