Line:12, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_basestyle.css -> I've decided to add/override the ColorDefinitions within the CSS files. It gives us quite good flexibility since definitions defined/updated in this way are applied to the current 3.x theme (after switching the 3.x theme the new one is updated with it ). Using the 'plugin.xml' file for that we have to define the new e4-related 3.x themes based on some parent ones (i.e. the classic one - I'm not sure if we can define multiple parents for the new 3.x theme) so it is not so flexible as the current approach.

Unfortunately such added/updated definitions are read-only at this moment, but I will enable the edition using separate bug, when we agree with the current design

thanks for review,
Daniel
