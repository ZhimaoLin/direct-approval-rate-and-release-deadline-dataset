Thanks for the patch Bruno.

But this approach doesn't seem right.  Although it looks like you followed the approach of ResourceNavigatorMoveAction to use MoveProjectAction as a delegate, it's not quite a analogous situation.  First, ResourceNavigatorMoveAction extends MoveResourceAction and so now we would have two instances of MoveProjectAction as a delegate.  Second, it also means the other *ResourceAction implementations in org.eclipse.ui.actions are a bit different as only MoveResourceAction handles projects transparently.  Third, it would also be a change of API since MoveResourceAction previously didn't handle IProjects, and there may be code relying on that (similar to how ResourceNavigatorMoveAction cascaded through MoveProjectAction to its super implementation).

I think the cleaner approach would be to modify org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.actions.RefactorActionGroup.  It will be similar to what you've done here.
