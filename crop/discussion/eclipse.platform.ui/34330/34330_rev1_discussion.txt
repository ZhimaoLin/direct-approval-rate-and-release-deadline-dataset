Some Javadoc comments are still required, see my comments.

Thanks for the review Emma Oneill.
See inline comments here.
I think it is obvious that a private constructor is used to block instantiation.

Line:581, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/JFaceResources.java -> I think this is obvious here and therefore an unnecessary comment.

Line:94, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/PreferenceConverter.java -> I think this is obvious here and therefore an unnecessary comment.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/StringConverter.java -> I think this is obvious here and therefore an unnecessary comment.

Line:142, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/SubMenuManager.java -> Done

Line:175, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/SubMenuManager.java -> Done

Line:1443, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTreeViewer.java -> Done
