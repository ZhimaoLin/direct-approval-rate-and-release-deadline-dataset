Thanks for the patch Bartosz.  It's M7, beyond the API freeze, and so we'd need a compelling reason to ask for an exception for xxx@xxx.xxx IWorkLeon Ochoach's workbench listeners, and IModelResourceHandler.  Since this is part of the E3.x Choose-Workspace-Dialog, is there a reason we can't instead implement this using the o.e.ui.workbench.IWorkbench post-shutdown listeners?

I'd really prefer a minimal change here and to avoid refactorings even where they may be warranted.

Line:281, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ResourceHandler.java -> We're generally not including these non-javadoc comments

Line:247, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/ChooseWorkspaceWithSettingsDialog.java -> These changes seem unnecessary.  Correct?

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> Should be invoked in a SafeRunner

Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchMessages.java -> Stray conflict needs to be resolved

Line:101, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/E4Workbench.java -> ArrayList isn't thread-safe; use ListenerList

Line:58, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/IModelResourceHandler.java -> Typically of the form

@return <code>true</code> if saving the model is allowed

Unfortunately, I think it can't be done easily using post-shutdown listener, because it's invoked much earlier than saving workLeon Ochoach model (E4Applicaion.saveModel()).
I removed IWorkLeon Ochoach and IModelResourceHandler API changes and left the PostSave annotation only. IMO adding PostSave annotation is an elegant solution. Changing post-shutdown listeners logic to being invoked after saving workbench model would be unnecessary mixing e3 and e4 logic. I also added PreSave annotation support, because it has not been used so far (unless I am mistaken).

Line:281, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ResourceHandler.java -> Done

Line:247, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/ChooseWorkspaceWithSettingsDialog.java -> I've made some more refactoring in next patch set.

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/E4Application.java -> Done

Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchMessages.java -> Done

Line:101, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/E4Workbench.java -> Done

Line:58, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/IModelResourceHandler.java -> I removed this method from API.
