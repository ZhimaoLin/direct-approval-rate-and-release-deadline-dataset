Patch Set 4: Verified+1

I tweaked a few details:
  * changed the name to swt-tree-arrow-color to better match CSS standards (color/background)
  * log warning messages when unsupported
  * centralized windows-only message to the implementation so that we can support other platforms in the future without having to touch other files

Look good to you, Fabio?
