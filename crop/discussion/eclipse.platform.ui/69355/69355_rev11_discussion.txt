Just one minor comment for the form of the tests. Please also note that due to Bug 510830, form tests are not executed automatically during the build.

Line:34, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/SizeCacheTest.java -> This should also be migrated to JUnit4.

Line:25, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/HintAdjustmentTest.java -> The forms tests have been migrated to JUni4 a while ago, I suggest to use JUni4 here also. Remove extends TestCase if you agree.
