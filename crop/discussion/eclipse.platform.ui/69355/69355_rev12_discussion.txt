Line:119, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/layout/TestColumnWrapLayout.java -> Should there be an assert in this method?

Line:65, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/HintAdjustmentTest.java -> I think this should just be testValue and also not final.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/forms/widgets/ColumnLayout.java -> delete.

Line:131, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/SizeCacheTest.java -> I noticed that this was wHint in other parts of the code. Up to you whether it's worth messing up the blame layer to be consistent.

Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/forms/widgets/ControlSegment.java -> I would capitalize the h or spell out Width.

Line:10, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/layout/ControlFactory.java -> make final and add a JavaDoc.

Line:119, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/layout/TestColumnWrapLayout.java -> Done

Line:65, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/HintAdjustmentTest.java -> Acknowledged. However, this is a constant and as such the all-caps is appropriate.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/forms/widgets/ColumnLayout.java -> Done

Line:131, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/SizeCacheTest.java -> Done
