Calling showBusy(false) during dispose makes sense, but why did you also change the implementation for showBusy(boolean)?

During testing the fix for the considered issue I've noticed some additional refreshing problem of the tab after closing/opening its part. It fixes the change you were asking me. Generally the part of checking that I've removed was not necessary since the tags are kept in the unique list and there is no way to generate duplicates.
