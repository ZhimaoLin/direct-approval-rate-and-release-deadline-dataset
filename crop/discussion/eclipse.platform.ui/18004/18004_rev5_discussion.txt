DESCRIPTION

Bug 236006 - [Viewers] Add tooltip support for DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider

Delegate to the styled label provider in case it implements the new
interface IToolTipProvider (which was extracted from CellLabelProvider).
If it does not implement IToolTipProvider, the super implementation is
used as before.
