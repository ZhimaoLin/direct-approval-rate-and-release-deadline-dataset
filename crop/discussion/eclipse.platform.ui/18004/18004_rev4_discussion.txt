DESCRIPTION

Bug 236006 - [Viewers] Add tooltip support for DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider

Delegate to the styled label provider in case it implements the new
interface IToolTipProvider (which was extracted from CellLabelProvider).
If it does not implement IToolTipProvider, the super implementation is
used as before.

Patch Set 4:

> Looking at the existing clients, most of them only want to implement getToolTipText() and not such a big interface. Do you really need all those methods, or could we go ahead with a smaller interface?

Yes, done in next patch set. Also addressed inline comments.
