Did you enable it by setting the system property to true?

Ok sorry, I added the property : -Declipse.workaround.bug467000=true
and ..  it works.. 

But not very nice because this problem will be for all projects and not only for papyrus. When you have a menuContribution with : popup:org.eclipse.ui.popup.any we will have to set this property... ? What about the IDE ? it contains many contributions like this ??
