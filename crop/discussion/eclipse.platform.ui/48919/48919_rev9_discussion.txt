Patch Set 9: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

Papyrus would like to set the property in their activator (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=467000#c26), hence reverted back to patch set 5.

> verified but not very nice ....

I agree Olivier, but the proposed fix is just not in a state that it can be put in by default. We will have to find a better fix for 4.5.1.

This one works for Papyrus. We can enable the property in Activator#start, thus we don't need all our users to manually activate the workaround
