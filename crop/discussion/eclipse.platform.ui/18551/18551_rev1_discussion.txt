I have no issue if this is an optional bundle that people can consume if they want, but polluting the RCP feature with lots of new images which are even from other components like Team, JDT and PDE is definitely a no go. Also note that this would increase the RCP Runtime dpackage size by 19 MB (35 %)!

Which feature is the right one so that the Eclipse SDK can consume these images?
