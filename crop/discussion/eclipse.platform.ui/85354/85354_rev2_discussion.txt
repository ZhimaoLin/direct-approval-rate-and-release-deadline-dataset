Andrey and Lars, hope you don't mind taking a look at the proposed change, to see if it matches the expected behavior.

Patch Set 2:

Great! The way it works is *exactly* what I've expected. There are few smaller things to polish, mostly related to the wording and positioning of options.

1) This is an "either or" setting, so this should be two radio boxes, not two checkboxes.
2) The old SHOW_LOCATION setting should still be used for full path,  the new SHOW_NAME option is for short path / name.
3) Create a "Window title" group for three options below.
4) Rename old option "Show workspace path in window title" to "Show full workspace path"
5) The new option "Show workspace name"
6) The old "Workspace name" text box should go below the new option, and aligned a bit right so that it is clear that it is used for window name choice. Also it should be disabled if "show full path" option is enabled.
7) Same way the "Workspace path: <path>" should go below the first option, and a bit right off it, so it is clear that this is what will be shown.

Keep going, this is really good change! I will review the code as soon as you will made the pref page changes above.

I prototyped the UI with Windowbuilder. 
Please, look at the image here: http://imgur.com/paneslB.png

Is the UI in line with your requirements?
