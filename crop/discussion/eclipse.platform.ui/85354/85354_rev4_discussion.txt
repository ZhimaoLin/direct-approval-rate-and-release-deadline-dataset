Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

Excellent. The functionality & code are almost there, see comments below for missing pieces.

Line:388, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEWorkLeon OchoachWindowAdvisor.java -> Please remove obsoleted constant from the class and from the message bundle

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/IDEWorkspacePreferencePage.java -> Please undo all formatting changes on *unrelated* code. Please try not to mix unrelated changes with the actual patch, because it is really hard to see what is changed and needed for the patch and what is just some cosmetic cleanup.

Additionally, by clicking on "Restore defaults", NONE of the new radio buttons are selected (but the "show name" wins). This should be fixed.
