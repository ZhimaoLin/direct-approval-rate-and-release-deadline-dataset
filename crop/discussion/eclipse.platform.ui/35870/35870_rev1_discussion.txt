Looks good, two suggestions.

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> For now, please use x-internal for both packages

Line:437, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/CheckboxTreeViewer.java -> I suggest to handle this change via a separate bug report, the JFace Viewer are heavily used. Please explain in your bug report why this is required.
