Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

It probably intentionally covers the way extension point is read from the registry. I believe it's better to keep it, but to add a comment about the possible value of this extension.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

This is not a bug. This empty contribution in tests validates that the startup extension reader can read empty blocks without failing. It has some value.
