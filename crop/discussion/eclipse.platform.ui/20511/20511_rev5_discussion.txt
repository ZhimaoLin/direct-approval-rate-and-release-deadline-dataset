DESCRIPTION

Bug 404231 - resetPerspectiveModel() does not reset the perspective

Make a copy of every perspective after the first start of a
new e4 application and save it in the application model. This
copy is used in the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() to
restore the origin perspective state.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

I think the idea is sound but the approach is overly complex (i.e. we can use EModelService#cloneElement to copy the existing perspectives as we do in WorkLeon OchoachPage#savePerspectiveAs).

I'll update the defect with comments....
