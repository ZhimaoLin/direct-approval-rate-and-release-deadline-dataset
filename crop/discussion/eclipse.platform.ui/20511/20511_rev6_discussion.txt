DESCRIPTION

Bug 404231 - resetPerspectiveModel() does not reset the perspective

Make a copy of every perspective after the first start of a
new e4 application and save it in the application model. This
copy is used in the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() to
restore the origin perspective state.

Patch Set 6:

Eric has here the final say, but I would prefer if the logic is the same in the IDE and in a RCP application. This would allow to simplify the IDE resetPerspective call.

Patch Set 6:

I would prefer this too, but the fact that the IDE uses the legacy way to contribute perspectives (via ExtensionPoint and the PerspectiveDescriptor) and also calls the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel in the middle of it's reset, make it hard to have one common reset implementation.

Patch Set 6:

Rene, maybe you can move the call the model resetPerspective and clean the IDE one a bit up with your changes?
