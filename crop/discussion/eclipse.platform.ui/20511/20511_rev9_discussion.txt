DESCRIPTION

Bug 404231 - resetPerspectiveModel() does not reset the perspective

Make a copy of every perspective after the first start of a
new e4 application and save it in the application model. This
copy is used in the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() to
restore the origin perspective state.

Rene, I'll comment on the defect...this patch still goes deeper that I'd like into the application basics (i.e. changing 'createDefaultContext'...).
