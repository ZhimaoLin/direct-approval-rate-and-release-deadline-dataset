DESCRIPTION

Bug 404231 - resetPerspectiveModel() does not reset the perspective

Make a copy of every perspective after the first start of a
new e4 application and save it in the application model. This
copy is used in the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() to
restore the origin perspective state.

Rene, much better except that Addons and the 'core' are independent entities; by importing your service within ModelServiceImpl you're *requiring* that the addon (or at least its bundles) be present in order to even compile.

Rene, can you make your addon an independent entry? This would allow users to use it for where Eclipse 4 application? Maybe we should move that to the e4 tools project?
