DESCRIPTION

Bug 404231 - resetPerspectiveModel() does not reset the perspective

Make a copy of every perspective after the first start of a
new e4 application and save it in the application model. This
copy is used in the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() to
restore the origin perspective state.

Patch Set 10:

PerspectiveReset service feels a bit narrow. Why not create a full perspective service and move the perspective switch functionality from the part service to it?

Patch Set 10:

During the writing of this interface I thought about this too. But the following things come into my mind and so I decided not to do it (for the moment :-))

*) The need of the service is just to restore a persisted/dehydrated MPerspective state and not to do all the magic the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() does.
*) It should also act as a kind of abstraction layer for the persistence logic (e.g.: another add-on could for example use a DB to store and restore a MPerspecitve, or an add-on which uses a file per perspective state to store)
*) (and last but not least) I just want to try if this ideas finds some followers.

If others want to enrich the methods of this interface too, I'm happy to add your suggestions.
