DESCRIPTION

Bug 404231 - resetPerspectiveModel() does not reset the perspective

Make a copy of every perspective after the first start of a
new e4 application and save it in the application model. This
copy is used in the EModelService#resetPerspectiveModel() to
restore the origin perspective state.

Much better but still not there IMO, I've commented on the defect already.
