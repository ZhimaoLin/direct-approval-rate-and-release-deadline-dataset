Can the snippet provide an initial selection, as in the inline comment?

Line:90, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet063ComboViewer.java -> he snippet should show us providing a useful selection if it can. Something like:

MyModel[] model = createModel(); v.setInput(model); v.setSelection(new StructuredSelection(model[0]));
