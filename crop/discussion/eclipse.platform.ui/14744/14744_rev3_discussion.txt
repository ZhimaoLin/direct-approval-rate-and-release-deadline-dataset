In addition, could you modify the copyright header to look more like Snippet061FakedNativeCellEditor

Line:86, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet063ComboViewer.java -> The snippet should show us providing a useful selection if it can.  Something like:

MyModel[] model = createModel();
v.setInput(model);
v.setSelection(new StructuredSelection(model[0]));
