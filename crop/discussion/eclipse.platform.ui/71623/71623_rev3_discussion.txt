This change depends on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/71594/ which introduces new internal API JobCancelabilityMonitor.Options. It won't compile here before change 71594 is merged.

I suggest to group both monitoring pages under one category "Monitoring" with two subcategories: "Job Cancelability" and "UI Responsiveness".

Maybe also add the keywords "background" "cancelation" to the preference page.

Can you check if Marcel Bruch if he has special requirements for his AERI? I think it should be included in the freeze report.
