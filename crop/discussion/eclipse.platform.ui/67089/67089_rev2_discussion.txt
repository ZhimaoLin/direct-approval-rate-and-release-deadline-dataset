Patch Set 2: Verified-1

Unfortunately it does not work: instead of being slow, it's now unusable: While it fixes/stops the update while hidden, one can no longer use the view when shown out of the minimized stack, since it never updates anymore. One has to restore the complete stack, which defeats the purpose of "fast" views.

==> on showing, it needs to update the input


> I hate to say it, but I think we need some unit tests to verify these conditions.
