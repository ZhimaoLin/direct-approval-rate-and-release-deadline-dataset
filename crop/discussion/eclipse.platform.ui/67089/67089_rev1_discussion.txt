Note that the code is not compact by purpose: to allow easy debigging so that one can place a breakpoint to each interesting branch.

I hate to say it, but I think we need some unit tests to verify these conditions.

Line:488, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> LazyStackRenderer#isMinimizedStack() checks that it's not ACTIVE too

Line:496, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Is it sufficient to check just the parent?  Imagine an MArea split into two zones (so containing 2 MPartStacks) that is minimized.  Seems to imply that minimizedPartHandler, which fires part-hidden and part-visible notifications, needs to handle MElementContainers and cascade part messages too.

Thanks Brian! 

Anyone on CC can answer to Brians questions? I have almost none workLeon Ochoach modelling experience, the patch is based solely on my quick workbench debugging (and I've seen only this one single flag being used by MinMaxAddon).

Line:488, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> This is the only place which does this - all others only check MINIMIZED flags. This !ACTIVE check was added in the commit 482a6957632e2e18f1b8c1e9d5f611db70ec8ea7 and I think this belongs just to the outer postProcess() function guard condition.

Line:496, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> I will try to debug it a bit more.
 
Regarding minimizedPartHandler: can you elaborate a bit how this is related to the current issue? Or is this just a general remark that the code should be improved there?

Line:488, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> I haven't tried to dig into this.  It seemed that this might be applicable for when the user actually clicks on the fast view â€” it's stack is still minimized, but the part is now the active part and so is visible.

Line:496, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> minimizedPartHandler is an event listener defined within this class that listens for MINIMIZED being added or removed from a PartStack and fires part-hidden or part-visible messages for the stack's selected part.

Line:496, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> OK, but I still cannot get your comment before regarding that handler :-)

Line:496, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Ah, sorry: I was pretty dense.  Although not directly related to this bug, I suspect the code in minimizePartHandler has a similar problem in that it doesn't do the right thing for firing the part-hidden and part-visible messages with MAreas
