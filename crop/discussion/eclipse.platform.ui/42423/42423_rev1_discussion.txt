Line:215, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> The name of the constant is rather strange. Why not PERSISTED_STATE_RESTORED?

Fix the constant name and I think this can go in as well.

Line:767, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> I guess we're willing to take one more missing firing on existing windows to fix the problem?
