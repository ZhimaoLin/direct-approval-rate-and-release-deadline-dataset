DESCRIPTION

Bug 515965 - org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk java Access restriction compile
error due to OS.setDarkThemePreferred()

Setting Forbidden Reference to "Error" again while preserving custom
settings.
After investigation, with a complete Target platform, there are no
compile errors and darktheme works. Having consitent settings across all
users ensure we have the same dev environment.

Tested, child eclipse switches to darktheme without issues.
