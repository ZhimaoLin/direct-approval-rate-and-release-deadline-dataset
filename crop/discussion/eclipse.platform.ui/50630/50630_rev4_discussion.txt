Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

Thanks for the patch, Tobias.  We need to check that the region wasn't disposed as updateOverlay() is called multiple times during a drag, and disposes the previously allocated region.  It's just the region allocated on the last call to updateOverlap() that needs to be disposed.
