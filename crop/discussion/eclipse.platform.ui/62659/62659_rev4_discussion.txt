Bug 90292: Extension to select how to handle unknown file types

I'm experimenting around an extension point to plug strategies on how to
handle unassociated file types. The default one would remain the current
"System editor then Text", and I'll try 2 alternative extensions for
"Let user select editor" and "Poll a remote suggestion/discovery
service".
The choice between the strategy would be managed as a preference, that
RCP providers could set via plugin_customization.ini and/or API; and
that user could set via preference page.
