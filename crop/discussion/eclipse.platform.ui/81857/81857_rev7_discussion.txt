Patch Set 7:

I added all classes to the suite again explicitly, but I really don't understand, why Gerrit uses maven and surefire to execute the tests, while the daily build uses Ant to execute the test.xml. This duplication looks for me very error-prone.

Sorry Conrad, lost track of this. This needs manual rebase. Can you update it, I would have time to review it this week.
