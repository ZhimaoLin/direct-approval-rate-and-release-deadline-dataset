The class BindingTestSuite only contains that 1827 test cases, that need the JUnit3 runner. All other tests are not mentioned in any suite, because JUnit 4 uses the declarative style, i.e. all methods annotated xxx@xxx.xxx are treated as tests. In total there are 5702 tests (with 6 skipped) in the module o.e.jface.tests.databinding

Conrad, not sure I understand your comment. If I run BindingTestSuite without your changes, it executes 4100. This is also what is execute via our daily test run, see test.xml in the plug-in. The test suite must continue to include all tests.
