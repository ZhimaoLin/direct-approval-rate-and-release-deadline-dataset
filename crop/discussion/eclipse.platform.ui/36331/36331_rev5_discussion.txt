Patch Set 5:

> here's also the string "active" used here: org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.dom.ShellElement.isPseudoInstanceOf(String)

I wouldn't use the same constant for it although it probably means the same, but from the CSS point of view IPresentationEngine.ACTIVE is a regular CSS class whereas 'active' in ShellElement is pseudo class that can get changed dynamically and can mean sth slightly different. We can always update it in the feature, but for now I would go without this piece.
