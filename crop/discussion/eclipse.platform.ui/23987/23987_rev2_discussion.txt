We're trying to avoid 'magic' strings...

Line:3956, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> Lars, hate to be picky but could you change the string
constant into an IWorkLeon OchoachConstant value ?

Lars, if the fragment processor needs the ID shouldn't a Model Processor also be able to 'find' it ? Unless we use a constant this becomes error-prone...note that we should make this API post Luna so others can find it as well.

Thanks Eric, I opened Bug 431376 for it. Having an ID is important both for fragment and processors. No ID is not a good thing.
