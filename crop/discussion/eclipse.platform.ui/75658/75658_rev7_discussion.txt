DESCRIPTION

Bug 496319 - Add Ctrl+C to About box to copy the build ID

CopyBuildIdToClipboardHandler now reports the main build information,
the same you can read in the first three lines in about dialog.

The Ctrl+C is redefined in About Dialog, where it executes the 
org.eclipse.ui.ide.copyBuildIdCommand. 

The aboutDialog context is active only when the dialog is active
