DESCRIPTION

Bug 496319 - Add Ctrl+C to About box to copy the build ID

CopyBuildIdToClipboardHandler now reports the main build information,
the same you can read in the first three lines in about dialog.

The Ctrl+C is redefined in About Dialog, where it executes the 
org.eclipse.ui.ide.copyBuildIdCommand

Patch Set 1:

There is a minor improvement to do: make the child context active only when the AboutDialog is in foreground, and disable it when other dialogs are active
