Line:175, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/ProjectReferencePage.java -> IS this check useful? project.getProject() == project, so only the 2nd part would be enough IMO.
(I don't think it's a blocker)

Line:175, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/ProjectReferencePage.java -> This essentially the same code path as the previous code.  Consider it future proofing should we ever support truly-nested projects :-)

Though I suppose in such a case we should add a new IProject#getParent() as I'm sure there is other code that assumes IProject#getProject() == returns the same project.
