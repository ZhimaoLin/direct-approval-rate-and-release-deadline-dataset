> I've got a (non-blocking) question

I think we really want to keep property pages as specific as possible to the selected item: the set of pages on an IResource  is already very large once you bring in WTP.  Unfortunately many objects already adapt to IProject in the way that you show â€” I personally don't think it really makes sense for a Deployment Descriptor item to show inter-project references.
