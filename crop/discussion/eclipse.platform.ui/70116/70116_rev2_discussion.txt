Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

This is a problem between SWT and GTK, see bug 445900. Please don't release unnecessary workarounds in a wrong layer.

Patch Set 2:

Markus, there's no need to make users suffer while we figure out what to do about the SWT bug. This workaround is clearly marked as a workaround and is easy to remove once the fix at the SWT layer goes in.
