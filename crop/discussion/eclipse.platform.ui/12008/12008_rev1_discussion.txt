Patch Set 1: Do not submit

This fix is a layer breaker: ui.workLeon Ochoach must know nothing about resources (project, folder, file). You should have noticed yourself when not being able to use IFileEditorInput.

Also note that isInstanceOfInterface(...) is not correct, as it would not cover cases like B extends A, A implements IFileEditorInput.
