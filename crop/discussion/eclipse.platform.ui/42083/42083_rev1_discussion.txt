Additional comments:
- The commit message should start with
  Bug 444840 - [IDE] IDE.getEditorId(IFileStore) is private
  so that Gerrit can produce a link

- If it's the first time in a release cycle where a new API
  is added, one must increase the bundle's minor version.
  You should have seen this (compile error) if you had the 
  API baseline installed.
