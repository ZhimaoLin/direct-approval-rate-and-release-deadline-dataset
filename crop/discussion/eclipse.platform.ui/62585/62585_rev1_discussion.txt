Line:168, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ToolBarManagerRenderer.java -> All these calls to pack (every one in this file) are probably inefficient no-ops.

Assuming the toolbar's parent has a non-null layout, the call to requestLayout should be sufficient and is much faster.

It's possible that the calls to pack(...) are some kind of workaround for a layout bug, so this should be re-tested without them to determine if anything is broken.

(There's no good reason to ever call pack except on Shells or other free-floating controls without layouts that are allowed to overlap their neighbors.)
