Mario, thanks for the patch. Please see comments below.

Line:92, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> The problem now is that the array can contain markers of different types (TODO, tasks etc). "Appropriate" view is not defined then => probably the code and javadoc should be changed to reflect this.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> Since 3.13, and the pom.xml / MANIFEST.MF version should be updated too.

Line:111, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> This is problematic, as explained above...

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerViewUtil.java -> Similar to above. Additionally, looking at the code, this part can be removed entirely (bug 205497 was fixed for 3.4 and we can expect that there will be no use cases today for people migrating from Eclipse 3.3 or older to 4.7). But please don't do it in the same commit, do the cleanup first.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> API is always for programmatic access :-) Human brains don't have yet an interface to the code.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Added new method to MarkerViewUtil: boolean showMarkers(IWorkLeon OchoachPage, IMarker[], boolean).

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/markers/MarkerSupportInternalUtilities.java -> Please don't mix functional changes with re-formatting. If the code is automatically formatted, you can either use Ctrl+Z after save to undo the formatter or cleanup the code in a commit before or after your actual fix.
