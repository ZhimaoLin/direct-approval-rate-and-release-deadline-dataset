I think you should add yourself to every snippet to honor your work. Also I think running the clean-up actions for the next patch set would not hurt. ;-)

I'm 50 % done (wanted to give you fast feedback) but I don't see so far the ArrayContentProvider used. If that holds true for the rest I suggest o add a snippet to demonstrated the usage of the ArrayContentProvider has this has also changed.

In general I think I would prefer the usage of ArrayContentProvider for the simple exmaples, not sure why the platform team decided to use IStructuredContentProvider all the time with the same implementation.

Line:63, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet005TreeCustomMenu.java -> Annoying whitespace issue in JDT. I suggest to delete the offending empty Javadoc lines https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=251824

Line:116, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet005TreeCustomMenu.java -> whitespace

Line:70, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet008RevealElement.java -> whitespace..

Line:50, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet004HideSelection.java -> Minor thing, whitespace

I also wonder how useful these generated Javadoc Snippets are? Maybe delete them in all Snippets. Maybe John can comment on that?

Amzazing Sisyphus work, Hendrik. Thanks for that. I have mainly whitespace comments and I think I found one unnecessary cast. Also it might be possible to change Snippet050DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider.java to use File as E.

The remaining changes look great, thanks again.

Line:55, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet031TableViewerCustomTooltipsMultiSelection.java -> Strange check

Line:57, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet031TableViewerCustomTooltipsMultiSelection.java -> Is this case necessary?

Line:87, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet050DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider.java -> I suggest to change that to File, File[], this only requires that the input is set the following way: viewer.setInput(File.listRoots());

See http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipseJFaceTree/article.html

Line:177, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet024TableViewerExploreNewAPI.java -> Boris left IBM, maybe remove the email and add yourself? (please feel free to ignore this nonsense comment)

Line:46, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet62TextAndDialogCellEditor.java -> Weird line breaks. Maybe clean them up?

Line:234, examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet057TableViewerSkipHiddenCells.java -> Replace Boris?
