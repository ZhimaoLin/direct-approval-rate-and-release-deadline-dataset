Patch Set 1:

Is that the service that funnels events to the window and page service?  So we'd just be hooking up the per-part version?  Or is that the service the takes the window/page service and funnels it into Eclipse4?

Patch Set 1:

"Is that the service that funnels events to the window and page service? So we'd just be hooking up the per-part version?" - Indeed. The ESelectionService notifies this compatiblity SelectionService which in turns notifies legacy listeners. In this compatibility SelectionService there is already a code for handling per-part selection, but it is not called for inactive parts because it is not per-part 'registered' in the ESelectionService.
