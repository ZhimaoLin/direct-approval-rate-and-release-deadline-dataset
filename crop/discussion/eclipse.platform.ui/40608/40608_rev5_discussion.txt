Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

testWorkingSetSaveRestoreAggregates fails for me but this is independent of this change. Interesting is, if I run this on a virtual display the test runs fine. 

Code change looks good to me and it solves Bug 383569 comment 30 - issue 1 and 2 for me

Thanks Andrey and Noopur
