Patch Set 1:

Looks good.

Last time I've checked the test failure described in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=420956#c20 it was caused I think by the duplication of the data after reset perspective, but I didn't investigated it further because I could simply remove the code causing the failure: oldPersp.updateActionBars(), it was not needed at *that* time for that specific fix I worked on.

Can it be that the IAggregateWorkingSetTest.testWorkingSetSaveRestoreAggregates itself isn't OK and has wrong assumptions on existing preconditions. Invoking the test as a standalone test (not inside the testsuite) works fine.
It was failing ONLY because *before* the test another test (IPageServiceTest) called  WorkLeon OchoachPage.resetPerspective().

Just wondering if the IAggregateWorkingSetTest itself can't be fixed, we should just move it before IPageServiceTest?

Patch Set 1:

Looks like IAggregateWorkingSetTest.testWorkingSetSaveRestoreAggregates itself has some problem. Running it as a standalone test is fine. However, debugging it slowly as a standalone test causes it to fail with the same error condition as with the attached resetPerspective fix.

On debugging found that in IAggregateWorkingSetTest.saveRestoreWorkingSetManager(), saveWorkingSetState call works fine. The difference can be seen after invoking restoreWorkingSetState. But could not find the root cause.

As suggested, moving it before IPageServiceTest and running the suite does not cause any failure.
