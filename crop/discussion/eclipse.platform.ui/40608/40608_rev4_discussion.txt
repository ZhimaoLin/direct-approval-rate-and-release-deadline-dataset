Patch Set 4:

Change in TreeManager:
Noticed that at many places, the check-state of items is also updated programatically (not by user - example: CustomizePerspectiveDialog.createToolBarVisibilityPage(...).new CheckListener() {...}.checkChanged(TreeItem changedItem)). This may change the parent's check-state also. But the changedByUser-state of parent should be updated only when the child's state was changed by user. Hence, added the if-condition.

This change adds to the change in bug 264312 comment #6:
> Only items whose state has been explicitly set by the 
> user (or implicitly through (un)checking a parent 
> element) are used to update the menu/tb 'hidden' lists.
with: or implicitly through (un)checking a child element.
