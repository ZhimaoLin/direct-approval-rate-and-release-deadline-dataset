Thanks Fabio, this is a great start.

I think that it would be a bit more general if the property took a colour as an argument (see CSSPropertyShadowColorHandler for an example).

The arrow size needs work; we can't just hard code some pixel numbers.

Line:49, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyTreeArrowsSWTHandler.java -> It would probably be better if the property specified the arrow colour

Line:58, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyTreeArrowsSWTHandler.java -> Do these hard-coded values work for different font sizes?

Line:481, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/plugin.xml -> Should define a TreeElement, just like CompositeElement.

Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_win.css -> I think it'd be better to support a colour hereâ€¦

Line:49, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyTreeArrowsSWTHandler.java -> The only issue is that I'd have to create a new PaintListener for each tree -- or add the color to the tree data (setData/getData).

If that's the case, I'm more inclined to create a constant at CSSPropertyTreeArrowsSWTHandler regarding the color ("org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.tree_item_foreground_color") and then do a getData() at the painter as that'd be more memory efficient than creating a new painter for each tree with the color.

Line:58, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyTreeArrowsSWTHandler.java -> They should (the arrow size is not dependent on the size of the font as far as I know).

Also, these values are being used in LiClipse: http://www.liclipse.com/ for quite a while already and no one complained so far :)

Line:481, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/plugin.xml -> Ok, will do.

Abandoned

Ended up rebasing outside and ended with a new review (which should address the current issues) https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45175/
