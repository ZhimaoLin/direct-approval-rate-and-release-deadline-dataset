Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

The correct fix is to create a local copy of the perspective description in case it is gone. This local copy can then also be used to store the changes.

In 3.x a warning was logged:
!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 2 2 2015-02-19 14:50:07.082
!MESSAGE Perspective Debug has been made into a local copy

After that it will e.g. be "<Debug>".


Test Case:
1. start workspace
2. switch to Debug perspective
3. exit
4. in org.eclipse.debug.ui/plugin.xml remove the perspective contribution
5. start workspace 
(another bug: exceptions in the .log)
6. open CPD

You could compare Perspective.java with the version tagged 'R3_8'.
