DESCRIPTION

[WIP] Bug 431862 - Group perspectives entries under one sub-menu

Adding the perspectives entries to a new menu
Note that the command names do not have "..." in their name, not sure if
I should change the command names or add new entries for the menu

Also the "old" action contributions still need to get removed. I think
once we switch to the new menu we should deprecate the old actions.
