DESCRIPTION

Workaround bug 436645: [CommonNavigator] NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.EvaluationCache#getDescriptors does not work

Disable NavigatorContentDescriptorManager.EvaluationCache as it does not
work and will only waste memory.

Proper fix for cache usage will be in 4.4.

DO NOT MERGE
Will be superseded by the proper fix in "newer" branches.

Sorry if I was out of turn adding you as a reviewer, Paul, or if you were not the right person to add.

Patch Set 6:

I guess this would be targetted for Luna SR1 (4.4.1, R4_4_maintenance) when the branch is open at the end of June.

Patch Set 6:

You mean cherry pick this workaround into 4.4, and the "real fix" up in master at the moment will be put into 4.5?

Abandoned

I'm abandoning this change as we won't put this into 4.3.x at this point.

Patch Set 6:

Sounds reasonable. I will cherry pick into the appropriate R4_4 branch once that becomes open.

Patch Set 6:

Or should I cherry pick into master, and rebase the "real fix" on top of that?
