DESCRIPTION

Bug 515405 - MenuManagerRenderer maps overflow, 100% CPU usage during
debugging

If menu id is not configured in plugin.xml, don't rely on
object.toString() to generate id's - if the method is overridden, we can
have issues with menu managers etc because the id will be not unique
anymore.
