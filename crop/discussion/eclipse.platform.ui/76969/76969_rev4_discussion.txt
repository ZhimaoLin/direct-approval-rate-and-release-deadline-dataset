DESCRIPTION

Bug 497585 - Remove underline in main toolbar for Linux

SWT increased via Bug 484463 for Neon the toolbar size to display the
underline in the main toolbar correct.  This results in lost space. 

I suggest to remove the underline, as this makes the UI look better and
allow SWT to reduce the size again.
