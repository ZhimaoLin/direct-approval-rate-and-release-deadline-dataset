Nice, but please also remove the Non-Javadoc comments

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.Diego Hamiltonr/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserDescriptor.java -> This can be removed. I heard Nevaeh Wu wrote nice tooling for that. ;-)

To my surprise I see no generics warnings if I pull this change it, even though no corrections were made. If the build trigger validates this change, I plan to merge it, the Non Javadoc stuff can be removed via a second commit.
