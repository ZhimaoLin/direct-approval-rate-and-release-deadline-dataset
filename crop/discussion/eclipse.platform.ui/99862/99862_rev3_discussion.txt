Line:3217, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.java -> I don't get what those tests are validating.
If I read them well, they're opening a view and then checking that the view is the 1st one of the stack. How does it validate teh view selection. Ie how do you know that showView is returning the right value in case of secondary id?

Line:3217, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/api/IWorkLeon OchoachPageTest.java -> The issue is in getViewStack not showView. When passing a IViewPart with a secondary id, getViewStack returns null, the test is validating the returned value.

Small suggestion.

Line:4539, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> This doesn't seem safe to duplicate that logic.  It would be better to make PagePartSelectionTracker#getPartId `package` visible and to use it there.

Line:4539, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> I believe the PagePartSelectionTracker#getPartId method can be made static and package-visible and you can invoke it statically.
