DESCRIPTION

Bug 411724 - Hidden toolbar doesn't stay hidden

CleanupAddon contained code to automatically make a UI element
visible when one of its children became visible. This is
appropriate for part stacks and sash containers but not for
toolbars, so we use instanceof checks to ensure we're using
it when appropriate.

Brian:

I've added checks for IPresentationEngine.HIDDEN_EXPLICITLY, but unfortunately I can no longer reproduce this. The sort of random focus changes I was using before are no longer creating or destrying toolbar entries so I can't determine if the new checks are an acceptable replacement for the instanceof checks.

Until such time as someone is able to reproduce this again, I'm inclined to leave the instanceof checks in, since I know they fixed the issue the last time I was able to reproduce it.

Line:149, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/cleanupaddon/CleanupAddon.java -> Should this check include MCompositePart?  That's an MPart container.  I'm not sure, however, that the MCompositePart children's visibility is treated independently.

I kinda thought the HIDDEN_EXPLICITLY would make sense to be checked inside shouldReactToChildVisibilityChanges()?

Patch Set 7:

I added the check for MCompositePart and moved the HIDDEN_EXPLICITLY check to the helper method as requested.

I was also able to reproduce the bug again and was able to confirm that this latest version of the patch still fixes it. If anyone else is trying to reproduce this, use the Resource perspective -- it seems to occur there more frequently.

Please take another look.
