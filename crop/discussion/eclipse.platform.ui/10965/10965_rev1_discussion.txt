Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I think with 2 minor edits this is good to go.  Rebase the change a push another patch set when you're ready.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> You don't have to include the URL for the bug in the commit message.  Your first line is good, then you can leave a blank  line and add any other comments about the commit you want (or nothing if the commit is self explanatory).

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/keys/BindingService.java -> I think if we instantiate it here we should remove the extra code from readRegistryAndPreferences(*)
