Can you also post the Gerrit reviews into the Bug reports? This way people only watching the bug will also have to change to review. I do this now for this review. Thanks for the fix!

Hi Lars,
This is actually not ready to be commented in bugzilla. This is why I added the "DRAFT" title. I just want to discuss the changes with Eric, apply potential changes and then continue in bugzilla. I used gerrit because it is the most convenient way to share code that is under discussion. Unfortunately I don't know any way to push "private" commits (not visible for everyone, without notifications etc.)

Ah sorry for that misunderstanding. I think if you push to refs/draft/master it is private. 

But I personally would prefer to have open reviews, if possible, other people might also help to improve the suggested change. Also we avoid double work, for example in Bug 383403 it looks like Rene is also looking at the change.

I did not know the refs/draft/master . This seems to be exactly what I need!
And I agree with your other comments.
Thank you Lars!
