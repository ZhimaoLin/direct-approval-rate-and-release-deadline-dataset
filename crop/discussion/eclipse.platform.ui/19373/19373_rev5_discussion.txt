This is *really* close, I've put a comment into the draft...

BTW, IMO this is really fine work...very simple and straightforward (especially the way it ends up with a simple parameter addition in the renderer..;-).

Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> Rather than changing the local 'style' we should be changing the 'itemStyle'...otherwise we can end up with a vertical TB but a horizontal 'itemStyle'...

You can't change the semantics of createControl(*) to do a dispose().  I also wouldn't add a new createControl(*) method.  It's better to add a setStyle(*) with a note that says it will only effect newly created controls, and make sure that if the toolbar *is* disposed that createControl(*) will use the new style to create a new one (it seems to do this by default).
