Patch Set 3:

Also following Paul suggestion if not feasible, as this would introduce a dependency of the forms plug-in (which can also be used standalone together with SWT) to our e4.css engine.

I think the correct solution is to leave it as separate plug-in.

> I think the correct solution is to leave it as separate plug-in.

What about merging it with the 'org.eclipse.ui.forms' using the CSS related package names?
