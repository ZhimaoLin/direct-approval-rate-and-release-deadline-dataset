Daniel, would be great if you could review this and also suggest fixes, e.g. better property names, classes, e.g. I will a bit insecure with this change, as this is first time I try to implement support for CSS elements.

I would merge the change with the 'org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt' bundle, using proper package names

Generally the change looks good to me

Daniel

Line:10, org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.forms/plugin.xml -> I would call it the 'form-title-background''

It can't go with the e4 bundles, since it depends on the workLeon Ochoach.  I'd suggest putting it in org.eclipse.ui.forms itself, since that's the dependency to make it work.

Daniel, org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt cannot be used, as this would introduce a hard dependency to forms which we would like to avoid. I place the change in forms as suggested by Paul
