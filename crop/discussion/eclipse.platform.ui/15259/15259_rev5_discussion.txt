Patch Set 5:

Yes this is a per Workspace Setting. 
It's the org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unavoidableGenericTypeProblems Setting in the org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs file

Patch Set 5:

Independent of the setting you should explicitly suppress the unavoidable casts IMHO in the source code so that the code is clean, no matter of this setting.

No, this is wrong. Either you suppress them or you set the project preference to ignore unavoidable generic type problems.

My vote is on the correction in the code. The preference setting is JDT specific and we should avoid errors in a non JDT enviroment, e.g. a Tycho build.

Patch Set 5:

xxx@xxx.xxx is fine for me, but then make sure that ignoring unavoidable generic type problems is unchecked for that project i.e. stored in the project settings.

Note that the Tyhco build (main parent pom) also has its own compiler settings, so, if you choose wrong (incompatible) compiler settings in your project, then you will get warnings in the build (e.g. xxx@xxx.xxx that you might not see in the IDE.
