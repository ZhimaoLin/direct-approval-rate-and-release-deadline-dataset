I have a few comments inline

Line:235, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/CellLabelProvider.java -> Why isn't ViewerColumn in these 2 methods parameterized?

Line:215, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TableViewerRow.java -> I get a warning for this cast from Object

Line:195, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ColumnViewer.java -> I get a warning here about the cast from Object.

Line:756, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ColumnViewer.java -> I get a warning about the cast from Object

Line:409, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ViewerCell.java -> I get a warning for this cast from Object

Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ViewerRow.java -> I get a warning at this cast from Object

Line:385, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTableViewer.java -> Doesn't this now need xxx@xxx.xxx ?

Line:403, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTableViewer.java -> Doesn't this now need xxx@xxx.xxx ?

Line:509, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTableViewer.java -> Doesn't this now need xxx@xxx.xxx ?  I think there are a couple of other places just like this.

Currently the setting "Ignore unavoidable generic type problems" is set. With this enabled lines like "E element = (E) doGetItem(selectionIndex).getData();" will not show any warnings. 

Should we disable this setting?

But you are right.I haven't seen this.

I think you should disable the JDT setting and add xxx@xxx.xxx for the specific case.

Is that setting a per-workspace setting?  Is that why I saw those warnings in my workspace?
