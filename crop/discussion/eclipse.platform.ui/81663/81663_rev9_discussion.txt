Patch Set 9: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Suggest further JavaDoc changes and cleaning up the semaphore use in the test case, but I'm also fine with the patch in its current form if you disagree. I'll give this a +2 and will let you submit. Take or leave my suggestions as you see fit.

Line:1071, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/statushandlers/StatusDialogManagerTest.java -> Nit: Save 1 line of code by deleting the call to semaphore.acquire() and change the constructor to read new Semaphore(0).

Thanks, I've let the javadoc as is but improved the test code.

Line:1071, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/statushandlers/StatusDialogManagerTest.java -> Done
