Bug 501681 - Deadlock in WorkLeon OchoachErrorHandler.handle

Fix a deadlock situation introduced via bug 241244 commit
1904f477320dac4a9f4d45f7be478efba4a0b735.

If a job code wants to handle a status in a "blocking" way, submit an
async task for UI thread to avoid deadlocks.

The new test hangs on hudson, but does NOT hang on Windows 10 nor RHEL7.

The output is:

Blocking job: before handle()
Blocking job: after handle()
testDeadlockFromBug501681: after locking
testDeadlockFromBug501681: after joining
