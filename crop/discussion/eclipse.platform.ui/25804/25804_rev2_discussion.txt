This is not a problem with the CBI handler ... it's a problem with quick access.

It should have snap-shotted a useful IEvaluationContext before it fired up the dialog, IIRC.

Not sure what that mean. Do you have an example somewhere else for that?

Patch Set 2:

Have a look in the CommandProvider in 4.4 and 3.8.  I used to take a snapshot on creation in 3.8.  Now, it receives a snapshot from somewhere else ... but if I had to guess, I'd guess the dialog doesn't do it.
