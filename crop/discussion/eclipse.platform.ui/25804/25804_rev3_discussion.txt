OK shoot into the blue. Does the attached patch look right to you? Fixes the issue AFAIK but the concept of the snapshot is new to me, so I'm not really sure what I'm doing here. Feel free to update the patch.

Line:206, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessDialog.java -> The snapshot has to be taken before the dialog is opened.  What about moving the code up to where you create the command provider?

If I move the code where I create the command provider, I still get the exception.

Patch Set 3:

If I move the code where I create the command provider, I still get the exception. I have to move it out of the BusyIndicator block to make it work again.
