DESCRIPTION

Bug 486531 Resource (GDI-Handles) leak in ImageHyperlink

Fixes a resource leak (GDI Handles) in createDisabledImage() in
org.eclipse.ui.forms.widgets.ImageHyperlink. Replaced redundant code in
setEnabled method. Removed useless if(image==null) and added a missing
redraw() in setImage() so that setImage() works similar to
setText().Added a JUnit Test for the leak.
