Line:264, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.forms/src/org/eclipse/ui/forms/widgets/ImageHyperlink.java -> This doesn't seem right: we're building `disabledImage` from `image`, so we need to check that `image` has not been disabled.  I think something like the following?

   if (this.image != null && !this.image.isDisposed()) {
      if (this.disabledImage != null && !this.disabledImage.isDisposed()) {
         this.disabledImage.dispose();
      }
      disabledImage = new Image(this.image.getDevice(), this.image, SWT.IMAGE_DISABLE);
   }
