DESCRIPTION

Bug 430873 - Cleanup JFace code in preparation for GSoc

Removed unnecessay comments from viewers (Non-javadoc).
Keeping javadoc from overriden methods if additional/relevant
information provided. Otherwise, (copy from super javadoc or meaningless
comment e.g. "string representation" on toString()), the javadoc was
removed.

Removed some blank spaces.
