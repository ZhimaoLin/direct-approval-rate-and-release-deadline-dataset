DESCRIPTION

Bug 259846 - Text is trimed even when setWhitespaceNormalized is set to
false for FormText

Changes the algorithm in FormTextModel so that the normalization of
whitespace works as described in the javadoc of method
setWhitespaceNormalized() in FormText. Added unit tests to prove that
the new algorithm works as designed.
