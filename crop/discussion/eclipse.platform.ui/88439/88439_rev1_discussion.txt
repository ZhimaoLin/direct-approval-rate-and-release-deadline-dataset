DESCRIPTION

Bug 259846 - Text is trimed even when setWhitespaceNormalized is set to
false for FormText

Changes the algorithm in FormTextModel so that the normalization of
whitespace works as described in the javadoc of method
setWhitespaceNormalized() in FormText. Added unit tests to prove that
the new algorithm works as designed.

Line:18, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.forms/forms/org/eclipse/ui/tests/forms/widgets/FormTextModelTest.java -> Forms test are still JUnit3 based? Ugly. Please open a new bug to convert them to JUnit4

Strange the tests are working on my local machine, but not on the build system. Is this blocking others work? Do i need to repair this fast, or do i have time to find out what the problem is? Regarding the Junit 3 -> to Junit 4 i will file a new bug.
