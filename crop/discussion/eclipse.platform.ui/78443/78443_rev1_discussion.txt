DESCRIPTION

Bug 495567 - Increment org.eclipse.ui.views version to 3.9.100

See bug 495567 comments 44 and 46: PropertySheet.isDirtyStateSupported()
is new API, so the minor segment was incremented to 3.9.0 in 4.6.1
service release.

To avoid the state where the service release version of the plugin is
higher as the next major release, we must increment org.eclipse.ui.views
version to 3.9.100.

Additionally removed unused .api_filters file left over after gerrit
review changes.
