DESCRIPTION

Bug 495567 - properly handle dirty state changes in properties view

This is the first part of the fix, corresponding to the solution #1
described in bug 495567 comment 6): a part exposing
ISaveablePart either via implementing it or via providing adapter to it,
must properly handle and propagate dirty state changes to the UI.

Properties view will properly track now dirty state of the contributing
ISaveablePart part, also if multiple instances of Properties view are
opened for same contributing part. As a result, UI representation of a
Properties view tracking a ISaveablePart will change: it will show
leading asterisk '*' in all cases the contributing part also shows it,
and hide it otherwise.

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> I don't know the saveables API in detail, but looking at the sources this is not null safe. So I would add a null check before the for-each iteration.

Line:223, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> Are you sure about that cast operation? You are asking for a service interface and cast it to a concrete implementation without instanceof check. You perform that check in the tracker that is only added to a SaveablesList.

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> Done

Line:223, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheet.java -> This code exists in this form in many places across Platform UI, for example in WorkLeon Ochoach, WorkbenchPartReference, WorkbenchWindow, SaveAllHandler etc.

Anyway, I've changed *this* instance now.
