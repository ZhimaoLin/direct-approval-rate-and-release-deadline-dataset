Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

The hashCode function that's generated by Eclipse Source looks like this:  Could we make it similar?

final int prime = 31;
int result = 1;
result = prime * result + major;
result = prime * result + micro;
result = prime * result + minor;
result = prime * result
		+ ((qualifier == null) ? 0 : qualifier.hashCode());
return result;

Patch Set 2:

Yes, that would work as well.
I'm not a big expert of the best way to implement a hashCode() so I trust you if you tell me implementing it as you suggest is better.

Would you like me to rework this patch, or is it part of what you changed in Patch Set 2?

Patch Set 2:

Suggested implementations for hashCode() match implementation of equals to ensure that 2 equals object have same hashCode.
For which specific class would you like to see an alternative implementation of hashCode ?

Patch Set 2:

These 3 classes seem to have equality defined by multiple fields: AbstractCombinatorCondition AbstractElementSelector CSSConditionalSelectorImpl
