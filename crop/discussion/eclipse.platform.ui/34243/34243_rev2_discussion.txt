Wojciech, let me know if you see any issues with this change. I think for now the service should still be internal.

Hi Lars, the change looks good to me, however I would like to wait for Paul's general opinion about E4 Help Service API before pushing any changes.

In general this rename should be save to do, as it does not change any API. But lets wait and hope that Paul has his platform.ui day soon. :-)

Patch Set 2:

Paul commented on the bug and it was more a general question about the API design. This does not create any API just makes the naming of the service more consistent, which was suggested by Wojciech. I assume it is save to merge.
