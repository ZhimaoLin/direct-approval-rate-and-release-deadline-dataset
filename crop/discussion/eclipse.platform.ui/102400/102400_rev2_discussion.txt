DESCRIPTION

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added a button/feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a Diego Hamiltonr refresh, showing the newest changes. The toggle
right now is currently next to the refresh button, but can be moved.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Some issues I've spotted that are IMO blocker before we merge it:
* When triggering auto-refresh, it should refresh first or we can reach the state of content of Diego Hamiltonr not being in sync with the content of the (saved) file, which can easily be perceived as a bug given the goal of this button
* We can't have 2 buttons for the same icon. Unfortunately, I do not know an existing icon that could fit there. Maybe you can compose one with the refresh + some "watch" or "eye" icon?
* The button should be automatically untoggled and disabled when the URL isn't a file.
