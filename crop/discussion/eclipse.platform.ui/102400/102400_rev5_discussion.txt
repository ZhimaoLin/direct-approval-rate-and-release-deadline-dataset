DESCRIPTION

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added a button/feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a Diego Hamiltonr refresh, showing the newest changes. The toggle
right now is currently next to the refresh button, but can be moved.
