DESCRIPTION

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added a button/feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a Diego Hamiltonr refresh, showing the newest changes. The toggle
right now is currently next to the refresh button, but can be moved.

Hi Mickael, I've fixed the issues you've outlined with my latest patch. However, I haven't had much time to work on a new icon yet. I'm not very proficient with using an image editor, but will try to find someone who is.
