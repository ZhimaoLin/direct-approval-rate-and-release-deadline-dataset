Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

I tested locally with some use cases. Dynamic menu items in the main menu and in a popup menu. Checking whether the correct context is used and if the dynamic menu items appear multiple times on double clicks. On Windows 10 it looks good so far. But I would like to request project lead approval on this.
