Just a few niggles I spotted doing a quick eye-ball.

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> UIEvents.isADD handles both an ADD and ADD_MANY.  But the {NEW,OLD}_VALUE for ADD is a single item, whereas ADD_MANY it's a collection.  So your equals() tests don't work for the {ADD,REMOVE}_MANY situation.  Use the UIEvents.contains() instead.

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Is there a possibility the placeholder could return null?

Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> I wonder if these shouldn't be done xxx@xxx.xxx

I didn't make a full code review but verified that it fixes the problem.

One minor issue: I would rename 'minimalizedPartHandler' to 'minimizedPartHandler'.

Basically it is the initial version of the patch that was created to discuss the design approach with Eric

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> For this particular case I would like to test for the ADD event only. I've reused the UIEvents.isADD method for it that handles both cases

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> It is a good question. I haven't encountered the NULL value during my local tests of the patch. On the another hand the similar code is executed in the StackRenderer (without checking against null) and it works fine.

Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> I've followed the selectedHandler that subscribes and unsubscribes for the event explicitly. However I can refactor  the code in this way if you want
