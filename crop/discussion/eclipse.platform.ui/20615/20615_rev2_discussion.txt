Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Daniel, as well as changing the 'minimalized' to 'minimized' I think that you're also firing too many events. The current code loops through the parts in the stack firing the events but it should only act against the stack's 'selectedElement'.

I think that the current code will, for example, fire 'partVisible' events against views that are *not* visible when restoring (unminimizing) the stack...
