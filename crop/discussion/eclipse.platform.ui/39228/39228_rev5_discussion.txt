Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> , 2015 needs to be added

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Use:
PlatformUI.getWorkLeon Ochoach().getWorkingSetManager()

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> This variable is not needed

Line:72, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Move this into the first if-statement and then break out of the loop

Thanks for the review.
I just have a question, appended to one of your comment.

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Ok. I'll do it in next patch set

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Isn't it a better practive to avoid using singleton objects and to use the current context to get the services we need?

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Ok. I'll do it in next patch set

Line:72, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Ok. I'll do it in next patch set

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> Not in this case. There is only one workLeon Ochoach and that's the code pattern used in the whole SDK.

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/OpenFolderAsProjectAction.java -> I'm not sure I agree with the reasons here (there is only one workLeon Ochoach because there are singletons, so code somehow locks to a single workbench, and the fact that it's used everywhere doesn't make it better/worse).
Anyway, since it appears more important to you than it is to me, I'll change it in an upcoming patch set, within a few minutes.
