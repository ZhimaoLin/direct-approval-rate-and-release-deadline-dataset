We just need one more minor fix.

Line:246, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ContributionsAnalyzer.java -> This array isn't needed anymore, it can just be turned into a boolean.  I think this method gets called frequently, so it's worth not allocating an array.
