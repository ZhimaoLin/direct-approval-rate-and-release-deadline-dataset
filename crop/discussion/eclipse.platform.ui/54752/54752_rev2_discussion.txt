Patch Set 2:

I was rather hoping to deprecate the Observable type attribute and offer parameterless versions of observe() rather than making the parameterized versions easier to use...

But if we really need to make the parameterized versions easier to use for class types, this is a reasonable approach. More comments in the bug.
