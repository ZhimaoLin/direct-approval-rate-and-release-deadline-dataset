DESCRIPTION

Bug 508934 - When using -showlocation, the corresponding preference on

..the Workspace preference page is not checked.

With the proposed solution, when -showLocation LOCATION is set, the
Button "show full workspace path" is checked (and disabled), and the
Text "Workspace path" holds the LOCATION value.

Abandoned

Let's abandon this one as per Dani's comments. https://git.eclipse.org/r/104941 should be a better substitute.
