DESCRIPTION

Bug 508934 - When using -showlocation, the corresponding preference on 

..the Workspace preference page is not checked.

With the proposed solution, when -forcelocation LOCATION is set, the
Button "show full workspace path" is checked (and disabled), and the
Text "Workspace path" holds the LOCATION value.
