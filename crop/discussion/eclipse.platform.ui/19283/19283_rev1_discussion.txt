DESCRIPTION

Bug 22905 - [EditorMgmt] associations: Allow pattern matching

Allow association keys with multi-part extension. Editor lookup first
checks for association that is a a perfect full-filename match, then
proceeds to multi-part extension, progressively relaxing by one part at
a time until a the first match is found.
