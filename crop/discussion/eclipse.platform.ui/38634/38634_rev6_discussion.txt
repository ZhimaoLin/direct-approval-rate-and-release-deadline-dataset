DESCRIPTION

Code cleanup: make Perspective code warnings free

Introduced generics where possible, removed unused code, removed wrong
javadocs, converted ArrayList->List in signatures, made fields final
private.

Removed few never written fields and appropriate methods.

Converted spaces to tabs all over the code (was a funny mix of both).

Please update the commit message, the rest of the comments is material for discussion, I think we should use the opportunity to simplify the Perspective code.

Line:97, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> Why do we not remove this method? I do not see the value it adds. As Perspective is internal we should be fine and I do not see the value it adds over calling the page directly.

Most of the methods you've asked to remove were still used in CPD, except one. I've removed that one and added bug info.
