DESCRIPTION

Code cleanup: make Perspective code warnings free

Introduced generics where possible, removed unused code, converted
ArrayList->List in signatures, made collection fields final.

Removed getShowInTime() and appropriate field as this one was never used
/ written.

Converted spaces to tabs all over the code (was a funny mix of both).
