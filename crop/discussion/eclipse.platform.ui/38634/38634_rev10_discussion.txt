DESCRIPTION

Bug 456726 - Add toString() to various platform UI elements for
debugging)

Introduced generics where possible, removed unused code, removed wrong
javadocs, converted ArrayList->List in signatures, made fields final
private.

Removed few never written fields and appropriate methods.

Converted spaces to tabs all over the code (was a funny mix of both).
