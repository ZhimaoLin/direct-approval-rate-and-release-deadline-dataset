DESCRIPTION

Bug 456727 - Code cleanup: make Perspective code warnings free

Introduced generics where possible, removed unused code, removed wrong
javadocs, converted ArrayList->List in signatures, made fields final
private, converted for to foreach loops where possible.

Removed few never written fields and appropriate methods.

Converted spaces to tabs all over the code (was a funny mix of both).
