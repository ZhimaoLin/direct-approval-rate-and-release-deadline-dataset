DESCRIPTION

Code cleanup: make Perspective code warnings free

Introduced generics where possible, removed unused code, removed wrong
javadocs, converted ArrayList->List in signatures, made fields final
private.

Removed few never written fields and appropriate methods.

Converted spaces to tabs all over the code (was a funny mix of both).
