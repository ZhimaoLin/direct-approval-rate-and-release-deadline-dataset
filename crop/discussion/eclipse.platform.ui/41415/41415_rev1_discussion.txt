Patch Set 1:

Hi Philip, Could you rebase the patch (gerrit shows some conflicts and I cannot rebase it directly) and update copyright date to to 2015?

Patch Set 1:

Hmm... It conflicts with another patch in gerrit - https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/40309/4 and I cannot merge any of them (at least I don't see any way). Moreover there are some problems with Hudson. I will take a look at this.

Patch Set 1:

The failing Hudson build is because of a bug in SWT which should be fixed torrow, afterwards the build trigger should work fine again.
