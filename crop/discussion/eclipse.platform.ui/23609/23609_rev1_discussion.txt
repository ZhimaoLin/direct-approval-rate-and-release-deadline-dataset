Patch Set 1:

Adding the DND support for the HeapStatus trim solves the issue. I've checked the Eclipse 3.x and it also has got the draggable trim

thanks in advance for review,
Daniel

Line:186, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/IPresentationEngine.java -> I'm not sure if we can do such change in API now. If not, I will modify the patch appropriately

This is just introducing a constant which was used before as String, so I think it is save to do.
