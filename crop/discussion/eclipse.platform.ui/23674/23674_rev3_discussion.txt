Patch Set 3:

I wouldn't update the public method, instead suppress that warning.

I think that updating the API is binary compatible but not source compatible, although considering this is a set of deprecated classes (org.eclipse.ui.commands was deprecated in favour of org.eclipse.core.commands years ago) maybe it doesn't matter so much.

Abandoned

This is handled with your depreated change.
