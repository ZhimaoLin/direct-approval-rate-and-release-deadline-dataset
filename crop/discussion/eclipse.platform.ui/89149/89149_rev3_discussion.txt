Line:161, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/WorkingSetsContentProvider.java -> Is this a workaround? Why it is needed now? If we can't avoid it (which would be my favourite), we should at least document it.

Line:256, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/workingsets/WorkingSetsContentProvider.java -> res is null here. Do we really expect that unassignedProjects contains null?
