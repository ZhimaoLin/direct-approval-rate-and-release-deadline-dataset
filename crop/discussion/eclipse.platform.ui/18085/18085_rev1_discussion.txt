Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

The general direction is good, it doesn't make sense to have two dispose listeners on the same widget. What I don't like is that we now first deactivate and then hide. This could lead to potential problems with subclasses.

A simpler fix only does this:
- remove the listener as you've already done
- add the following code to #toolTipHide:
		if (event != null && event.type == SWT.Dispose) {
			deactivate();
			data= null;
		}
