DESCRIPTION

Bug 511702 - [regression] editors list shown with "hidden tabs list"
closes wrong editors

Use actual element on which the "close" menu was triggered instead of
the selection computed from the table. Latter one can change on mouse
move by AbstractTableInformationControl before the actual close handler
is executed.
