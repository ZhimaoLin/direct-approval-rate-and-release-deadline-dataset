We have tests for CSS in org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.css.core and org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.css.swt.  Could you please add tests to these plugins to specify the creation and use of these new definitions, and capture the interaction between CSS and pre-provided font definitions.

Line:168, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTFontHelper.java -> isEmpty() is not valid in J2SE-1.5.  Please set up your JREs, at least 1.5-1.7 (and a 1.4 you might have to request specially)

Line:1521, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPlugin.java -> It seems to me it's invalid to put these in the context, as they'll be wrong as soon as the theme changes.

Line:24, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/themes/FontDefinition.java -> This class should be resubmitted without all of the formatting changes.

Line:185, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/themes/WorkbenchThemeManager.java -> We currently have some problems if an early startup of this class is triggered.  Will the IEventBroker sometimes by null?

Line:1521, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPlugin.java -> It should be fine since I put into the context the context function that retrieves the latest *Registry from the current theme

Line:1521, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPlugin.java -> That value is computed once and cached in the EclipseContext until it is invalidated (at some point in the future).  But since the invalidation is not tied to the Theme change, the value returned could be wrong.
