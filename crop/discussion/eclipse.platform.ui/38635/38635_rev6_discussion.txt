for-each loop conversion is fine but you have also other changes here. See detailed comment

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> I would here also follow our pattern to check if present and only to remove if present.

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> Lars, the check does not make sense and I honestly never saw any patterns in UI code here :-). Do you really want it?

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> If you look at our model code and our tag handling you find it frequently. I suggest to write it similar to the following:

if (alwaysOnActionSets.contains(descriptor) {
    alwaysOnActionSets.remove....
    page.perspectveAction....
}

Makes the code better readable IMHO.

Abandoned

Merged current changes into https://git.eclipse.org/r/38634 as the later one became too much changes anyway.
