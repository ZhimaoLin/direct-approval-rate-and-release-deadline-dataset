Looks good, except commit message and I think we should leave the check for the tag before removing it.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please use platform format for commit message

Line:254, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Perspective.java -> We typically use the pattern to check for a tag before removing it. Please add the check again, I think we should stay consistent here and I also think it increases readability.
