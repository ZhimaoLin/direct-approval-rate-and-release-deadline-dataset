Thanks Daniel, thanks for the change. Great to see you getting active after our RCP training in Hamburg.

I'm currently cleaning up unused renderer classes. I hope to get this done today or tomorrow. Once this is done, some of these changes can be removed.

This is OK, if your change is based on an older commit than the current master pointer, you get this "Cannot merge" information.

Hi Daniel. DirectMenuItemRenderer has been deleted, as it was not used by our renderer factory. MenuItemRenderer and childs will be deleted soon, see Bug 473874. Can you please update your review to include only the relevant classes for this change?

When you refer to "MenuItemRenderer and childs", do you mean the derived classes from MenuItemRenderer (such as HandledMenuItemRenderer)?
