Patch Set 2:

Actually, threre's three topics solving different parts of two problems:

Problem 1) Addressing splash screen widgets
Problem 2) Unsetting/leaving alone the background of the splash screen widgets, so they keep their default look before the theme is applied.

Problem 1 is addressed by this changeset and alternatively by not having IDs and implementing change set  https://git.eclipse.org/r/24281 (Support for inner-class selectors)

Problem 2 is addressed by https://git.eclipse.org/r/24321 (Support for 'inherit' value for 'background-color' property)

Almost good, see inline comments

Line:423, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> Can you remove that line until the inherit bug is fixed?

Line:428, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> Can you remove that one until the inherit bug is fixed?

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> Add yourself to the class

Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> I would use the constant directly.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> CSSSWTConstants.CSS_ID_KEY

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> CSSSWTConstants.CSS_ID_KEY

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> CSSSWTConstants.CSS_ID_KEY

Line:56, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> Maybe wrap this call in a private method setCSSData();?

updated patchset is coming in a sec ...

Line:423, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> I have temporarily added a suitable color. Not as good as transparent but less extreme.

Line:428, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_globalstyle.css -> I have temporarily added a suitable color. Not as good as the default but less extreme than the dark theme.

Line:10, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> Done

Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> The constant generates a Discouraged access warning. 
Should I also add xxx@xxx.xxx annotation to the class?

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/splash/BasicSplashHandler.java -> Done
