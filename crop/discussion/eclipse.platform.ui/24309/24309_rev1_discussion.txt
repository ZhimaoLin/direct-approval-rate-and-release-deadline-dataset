Great, thanks a bunch. We typically don't want different changes in one Gerrit review. Can you "just" add the CSS constants with this review and create a new Bug report and Review for the support of the inherient property?

Aren't they both part of solving "the splash screen" problem?  You can target the new attribute without IDs or a class of some kind.
