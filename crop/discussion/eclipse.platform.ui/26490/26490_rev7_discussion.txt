I made my quick access field disappear and then I wasn't able to bring it back, because the existing perspective switcher didn't have the new tags.  More comments in the bug.

Line:846, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> This doesn't work for an existing set of workbench windows.
