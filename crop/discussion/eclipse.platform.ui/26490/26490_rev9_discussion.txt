Looks good to me, I also tested the change and everything works fine for me. I merge this change, Paul gave his positive review in the Bug already.

Line:1875, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> I don't see this change related to the bug report, but I also don't think it harms.

Line:1875, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> It's in a different fix, and doesn't show up as a change if you look at a diff between base and 9
