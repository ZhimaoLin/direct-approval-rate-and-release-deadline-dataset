DESCRIPTION

Bug 482024 - ExpandableComposite layout issues

Bug 368861 - ExpandableComposite failed to compute right wrapped client
size

- removed all special cases in regards to guessing about wrapping on
client controls and let control calculate its own size based on hints
- refactored code that same calculations are used when calculating size
and doing layout, otherwise its duplicated in two spots leading to some
nasty issues
- better heuristics when calculating proportions of text client and text
label controls
- fixed bug in SizeCache where it won't let control calculate size with
given hint because it calculates wrong minimumWidth. Removed lots of
special cases in SizeCache leaving so it actually cache the size rather
then guess it. Added lots of tests for it

testing done:
- run existing junits and wrote bunch more,
- current code coverage for ExpandableComposite is 72%
- manual tested bunch of flag combinations
- test running eclipse sdk and using PDE editors that use forms heavily
(plugin manifest and target definition editor) seems to be ok
(linux ubuntu and windows 8)
