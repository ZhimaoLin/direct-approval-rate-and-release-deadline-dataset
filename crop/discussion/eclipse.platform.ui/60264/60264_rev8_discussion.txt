DESCRIPTION

Bug 482024 - ExpandableComposite layout issues DO NOT SUBMIT

Bug 368861 - ExpandableComposite failed to compute right wrapped client
size 

- removed all special cases in regards to guessing about wrapping on
client controls and let control calculate its own size based on hints
- fixed bug in SizeCache where it won't let control calculate size with
given hint because it calculates wrong minimumWidth
- refactored code that same calculations are used when calculating size
and doing layout, otherwise its duplicated in two spots leading to some
nasty issues
- better heuristics when calculating proportions of text client and text
label controls

do not submit need more testing and test cases
