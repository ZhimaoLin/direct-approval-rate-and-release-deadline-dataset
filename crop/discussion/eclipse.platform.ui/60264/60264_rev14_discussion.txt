DESCRIPTION

Bug 482024 - ExpandableComposite layout issues

Bug 368861 - ExpandableComposite failed to compute right wrapped client
size 

- removed all special cases in regards to guessing about wrapping on
client controls and let control calculate its own size based on hints
- fixed bug in SizeCache where it won't let control calculate size with
given hint because it calculates wrong minimumWidth
- refactored code that same calculations are used when calculating size
and doing layout, otherwise its duplicated in two spots leading to some
nasty issues
- better heuristics when calculating proportions of text client and text
label controls

testing done:
- run existing junits and wrote bunch more, 
- current code coverage for ExpandableComposite is 72%
- manual tested bunch of flag combinations
- test running eclipse sdk and using PDE editors that use forms heavily 
(plugin manifest and target definition editor) seems to be ok 
(linux ubuntu and windows 8)
