Patch looks good in principle. One thing that would be nice to have is if we could remove the vertical dashed line (drag handle) if the toolbar is not draggable.

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.addons.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/dndaddon/IBFDragAgent.java -> Should this really be "parts" or do you toolbars (or trim elements)?

Patrik, any update here? 

Since bug 472761 fixed the understanding on whether a toolbar is draggable or not, my comment about removing the handle does not apply anymore. So what is left to do here is take care of Lars' comment.
