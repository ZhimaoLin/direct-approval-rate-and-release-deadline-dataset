I would have preferred the CSS property approach, but I suggest to integrate this, as the whole implementation is internal we still can improve it later, if we want and we should not miss the opportunity to have a kick-ass dark theme for Linux. 

I wait for Brian, but +1 for integration from my side.

Thanks Sopot.  It's almost there.  Just a few tweaks:

The bundle name needs to be changed: perhaps org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.gtk?

The bundle version should be 1.0.0 since it's a new bundle, unless there's some compelling reason otherwise.  I assume this version is there because you copied org.eclipse.ui.cocoa.

I'd suggest using @EventTopic on the processor.  Otherwise you need xxx@xxx.xxx to clean up the event handler.

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.gtk/fragment.xml -> Remove the id since we're not using it and it's the pre-filled in value from PDE

Line:32, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.gtk/src/org/eclipse/ui/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> pc seems somewhat less than optimal.  The beauty of the annotations and injection is POJO code can still call in should they need to.  So generally we want methods to be properly named.

init?  initialize?  install?

All that said, you could xxx@xxx.xxx here instead, couldn't you?

Line:35, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.gtk/src/org/eclipse/ui/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> If you don't use @EventTopic, you should have xxx@xxx.xxx to remove the handler.

Line:4, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.gtk/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Name should be an .e4

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.gtk/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The version number seems funny for a new bundle.  This should be 1.0.0, right?
