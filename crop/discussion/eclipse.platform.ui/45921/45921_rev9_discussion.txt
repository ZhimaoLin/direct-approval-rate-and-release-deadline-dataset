Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/swt/internal/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> I'd document here that we use the IEB explicitly because the annotation is unpredictable with processors within the debugger

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/swt/internal/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> And add a comment here why UISynchronizer isn't appropriate since this code must be on the SWT thread.

Patch Set 9:

Oops: meant to add: My only tweak would be to add a comment to the processor to explain why we're not using xxx@xxx.xxx and why we're not using UISync
