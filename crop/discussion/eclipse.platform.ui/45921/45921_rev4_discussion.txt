Minor thing, can you set the formatter on the fragment project to "Eclipse" and reformat the source? We use 120 characters as line length these days.

Patch Set 4:

I like the current implementation. Using Shell for styling is a good workaround, Sopot explained in an email conversation that if he uses MApplication he cannot reset the theme.

Brian, any objection from your side to commit this change?

I already have Eclipse as a default and activated on Save actions. Which file is not conforming to the formatter?

Patch Set 4:

Source might be correct, but I do not see the "Eclipse" formatter in the project properties set. Should be in the .settings folder
