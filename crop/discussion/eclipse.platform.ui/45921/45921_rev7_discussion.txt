I updated the patchest. The ID on the fragment.xml is needed as it's mandatory and spawns validation errors. Also I changed the name but omitted the css part as there's no CSS related change.

Sorry, two more niggles.

The package should be .internal.

Since you seem determined to avoid @EventTopic :-)  xxx@xxx.xxx IEventBroker directly.  Then you can get rid of the .core.contexts dependency.

Line:10, org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> If you inject the IEventBroker directly then we can remove the .core.contexts dependency

Line:30, org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/swt/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> Just inject the IEventBroker

Line:35, org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/swt/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> You don't need the argument since you're injected it above.  But if xxx@xxx.xxx IEventBroker then you don't need the context at all.

Line:66, org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.gtk/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/swt/gtk/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> You don't need the argument nor the context fetch
