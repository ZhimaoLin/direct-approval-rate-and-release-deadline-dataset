I would prefer the usage xxx@xxx.xxx we still in process of cleaning up the renderers which using the old way. If you do not know how to use it please see WBWRenderer

I know we've been doing the cleanup as I've done some of it myself (so I know how to use it).

Because of the way in which events are sent in ThemeEngine#sendThemeChangeEvent (through the EventAdmin directly, not IEB) the annotation way does not work for me in this case. So listening to :

@Inject
@Optional
public void xxx@xxx.xxx Event event) {

does not work. The reason behinds this demands investigation and changes which are beyond the scope of this bug.

Thanks for the explanation. I agree that this is out of scope for this bug. Please open a new bug for this.

I leave it to Brian for final comments and / or the merge.

Will do. Basically when you go through IEB (not EventAdmin) the data object is put in the dictionary with the key IEventBroker.DATA. This causes the type-sensitive injection of the event payload.

ThemeEngine#sendThemeChangeEvent does not bother to do it so the injection fails.

Patch Set 8:

xxx@xxx.xxx for THEME_CHANGED definitely works: it's how the PartRenderingEngine listens for theme changes (see PartRenderingEngine#subscribeCssThemeChanged).

I suspect the problem is that in the debugger you're not explicitly specifying a run-level for org.eclipse.equinox.ds and so it is being started after we've run the processors.  As a result the EventObjectSupplier/EventTopic service isn't being resolved, and thus the event listener isn't being registered.

This is kinda annoying, so I'm fine with the explicit registration here.

Sorry Sopot: tHere's still one more change: you've got the bundle in the wrong place.  It needs to be moved under bundles/.
