Patch Set 3:

I think the build failure is unrelated, seems to be something wron with the infrastructure:

> [INFO] --- tycho-surefire-plugin:0.25.0:test (default-test) @ org.eclipse.ui.monitoring.tests ---
> Warning: VNC extension does not support -reset, terminating instead. Use -noreset to prevent termination.
> Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused
> An error has occurred. See the log file

Can someone please schedule another build for this patchset?
