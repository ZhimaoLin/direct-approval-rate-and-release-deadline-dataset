DESCRIPTION

Bug 497331 - [GTK3] Platform.UI JFace, some tests fail on gtk3

Fixed all JFace errors encountered on my fedora 24.
testRefreshWithAddedChildren: GTK3 processes adding new children a
slower than GTK2. Using a waitForJobs() call gets the correct assertion.
testExpandToLevel: Similar issue as above, but solved using a
processEvents() that was missing.
testColorsAndFonts: SWT bug, table items were falling back to parent
foreground color when foreground = null, fixed so it is set to default
color GTK_LIST_COLOR_FOREGROUND.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Hmmm... 

I think this is a good patch in general. 

The only problem is that the test cases slow down by the sleep function. If we slow down jUnit tests to solve problems, eventually the jUnits will take longer and longer to run. However the idea with jUnits is to get them to run as fast as possible. 

I understand that this may be a limitation of Gtk+. However, as more and more bugs of the nature seem to crop up, it may be worth investigating. Would you be able to investigate if we can manually flush idle workers? If you cannot find a way, would you be able to write a native snippet that reproduces the issue and submit a bug in Gnome's GTK+ bugzilla and get M.Classen to maybe comment on it?
