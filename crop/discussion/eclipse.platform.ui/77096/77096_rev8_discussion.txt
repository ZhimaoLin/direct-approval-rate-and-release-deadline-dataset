DESCRIPTION

Bug 497331 - [GTK3] Platform.UI JFace, some tests fail on gtk3

Fixed all JFace errors encountered on my fedora 24.
testRefreshWithAddedChildren: GTK3 processes adding new children a
slower than GTK2. Using a waitForJobs() call gets the correct assertion.
testExpandToLevel: Similar issue as above, but solved using a
processEvents() that was missing.
