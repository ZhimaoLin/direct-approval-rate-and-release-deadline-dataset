Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

This works fine on Windows. The shell is
Shell {Eclipse SDK}
and it appears in the task bar and the switcher.

There seems to be some other issue here.

Patch Set 2:

Dani, with this change I think the behavior will not change on Windows but fix Linux. 

I'm all for a proper fix, but if that is a subtle difference in SWT I would prefer to have the same behavior on Window / Linux and Mac in Luna rather than have good behavior in Window and bad in Linux.

Why not apply the fix, do you see any harm in creating another top-level shell?

Because I don't add code when I don't know why it needs to be added - "it works" is a bad reason. If you can provide a sound explanation why the current code doesn't work on Linux and why using a non-parented top-level shell works, then I might reconsider.

Patch Set 2:

According to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=427540#c3 this also happens on Windows. Maybe a specific version of Window handles that differently.

AFAIK by SWT a dialog only shows up in the task manager, if  it is created with a "top level" shell (based on Display).

Patch Set 2:

I've tested the patch a while but it didn't work. I've found the working combination to be a modal top-level dialog, which can be created like below. No other changes were needed in IDEApplication. This contribution complies with http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CoO.php

    private URL promptForWorkspace(Shell shell, ChooseWorkspaceData launchData,
			boolean force) {
        URL url = null;
        do {
            // ensure the workspace selection dialog appears in the task lists of the operating system
            new ChooseWorkspaceDialog(null, launchData, false, true) {
              protected Shell getParentShell() {return null;}
            }.prompt(force);
