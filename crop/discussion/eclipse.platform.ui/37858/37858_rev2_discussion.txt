Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

I imported the sample project and was able to reproduce this issue.
The removeDynamicMenuContributions call on the renderer actually did the trick. 
I even had a look at the workLeon Ochoach.xmi file between application sessions and really the xml with several menu items.
I also run the menu tests without any failures.

Thanks for your patch and patience Marco.
