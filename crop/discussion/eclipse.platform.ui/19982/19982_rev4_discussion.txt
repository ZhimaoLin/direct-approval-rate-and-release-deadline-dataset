DESCRIPTION

Bug 400835 - Add search box to property sheet

Improved implemetation of properties view filtering. Localized changes
only to PropertySheetView class

Implemented desired changes from last CR.  
* Didn't implement mouse listener because I don't handle default initial
text therefore no code is needed there.
* Didn't implement traverse listener because didn't understand what it
did in the FilteredTree class.
* Didn't change getControl method because it would disable the whole
property sheet.

Thanks. I leave Paul to comment on the content but I see lots of trailing whitespace. We like to avoid adding extra whitespace. The whitespace in the Java comments is a bit annoying, JDT used to add that. Sorry for that, you can use Eclpise 4.4M5 in this release we finally fixed JDT, so that this whitespacse is not added anymore.

I think "Remove trailing whitespace" in the save actions (Eclipse Preference) might be able to remove all this extra noise, at least it might be worth a try.

Btw. I hope after all these iterations we will see more patches from you. The second patch is much easier... :-)
