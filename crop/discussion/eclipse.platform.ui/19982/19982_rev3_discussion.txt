DESCRIPTION

Bug 400835 - Add search box to property sheet

Improved implemetation of properties view filtering. Localized changes
only to PropertySheetView class

Implemented desired changes from last CR.  
* Didn't implement mouse listener because I don't handle default initial
text therefore no code is needed there.
* Didn't implement traverse listener because didn't understand what it
did in the FilteredTree class.
* Didn't change getControl method because it would disable the whole
property sheet.
