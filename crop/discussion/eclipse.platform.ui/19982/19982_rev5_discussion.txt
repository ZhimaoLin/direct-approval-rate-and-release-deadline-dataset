DESCRIPTION

Bug 400835 - Add search box to property sheet

Improved implemetation of properties view filtering. Localized changes
only to PropertySheetView class

Implemented desired changes from last CR.  
* Didn't implement mouse listener because I don't handle default initial
text therefore no code is needed there.
* Didn't implement traverse listener because didn't understand what it
did in the FilteredTree class.
* Didn't change getControl method because it would disable the whole
property sheet.

I've comments inline about fixing the clear button.  Also, the layout needs to be fixed (the text field+button should be as wide as the property tree).

Line:270, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> The clear button should be done as http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse%20UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredTree.java#n384

Line:271, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> As an aside, any test to be shown to the user in eclipse should be translated through the NLS support.  $NON-NLS-# is for string constants and stuff.

I don't understand why the button needs to be initialized in a different function. What do we gain here?
An setting the width of the filter text box does not seem an easy task... I guess this change will be going to /dev/null after all :-(.
Tough luck.

Patch Set 5:

The clear button doesn't have to be initialized in a different location, but it should be initialized in the same manner as the FilteredTree clear button.  i.e. they should look exactly the same, having come from the same framework.

As for the layout ... it looks bad right now, we can't accept that as is.  You created the composite contains both the filter text, button, and the treeviewer so you must control the layout.
