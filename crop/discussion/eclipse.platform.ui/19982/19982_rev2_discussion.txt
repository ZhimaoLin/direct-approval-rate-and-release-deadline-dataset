It looks like the right direction, but the filtered text box should look like what's in FilteredTree.  I've included a link.

Line:187, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> I don't think we can use FilteredTree here, but we should probably initialize this the same way we do in FilteredTree to be consistent.  http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse%20UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredTree.java#n632

Line:660, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> If this has always returned the Tree, it's a public method on a public class, I don't think we can switch around what it returns.

Line:1495, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> If getControl() returns the tree, do we add another method to return the composite?

Answering comments of previous review.

Line:187, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> What part of the initialization in FilteredTree do you want me to add? There is a lot of code there and I'm not sure what is relevant and what not.

Line:660, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> The contract of this method is that is returns the control of this element. If classes assume the control is of a specific type, they are the ones breaking the contract.

Line:1495, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> See my comment above

Line:187, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> I'd create the Text field using the same style as doCreateFilteredText(*), as in http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse%20UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredTree.java#n859  Then the rest of the method in http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse%20UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredTree.java#n632 adds an accessibility listener (we probably need that), a focus listener (assume we're running with useNewLook==true) a traverse listener, a mouse listener, a key listener, and something to listen for cancel button click (I'm not sure if we need it or not).  You've already got the modify listener.  Plus it adjusts the layout.

Line:660, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/properties/PropertySheetViewer.java -> With a legacy class like this, it's not that cut and dried ... I'd like to leave it returning the Tree for now. I found a  couple of places in the test and at least one place in PropertySheetPage where it casts to the Tree.  You'd have to go searching through the code base to find those places and fix them.

What problem do you have with the push? You need to amend the original commit or push a new commit with the same change-id to update this request. Patches are really bad for review.

I was unable to push to Gerrit. I used my own keys, then tried generating new keys in eclipse and uploading them to gerrit and the key was not accepted by gerrit.

Can you post the error message you got?

Patch Set 2:

OK, I managed to upload the key.
Now I want to push the changes and I get xxx@xxx.xxx fatal: Project not found: gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.ui"

I know I'm in the correct branch because I pulled the changes from the previous CR. I am using "Push to gerrit" from the team->remote project context menu, using gerrit branch "refs/for/master" as is explained here: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit

Patch Set 2:

You have to remove "gitroot" from the URL. Please complain in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=420696 about this. 

this should work:

xxx@xxx.xxx

If sucessful you should see a new patch version here. I don't think that push worked. Did you use the same Change-Id?

Patch Set 2:

Can you change your remote URL from
xxx@xxx.xxx
to
xxx@xxx.xxx ?  It's not clear that it would help, as the validation seems to have cleared you as a contributor with a CLA, but it's worth a try.

The other thing you can do is a  git log (or history) of the 3 or 4 commits before your commit, so we can see if there's any merge commits.
