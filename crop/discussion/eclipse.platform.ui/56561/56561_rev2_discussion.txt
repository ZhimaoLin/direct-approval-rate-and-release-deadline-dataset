The MWorkLeon OchoachModelActivator does nothing, and is the product of an automated
configuration that exists due to a default setting in a genmodel. Remove it.

OK I've done sufficient testing to feel comfortable that the removal of the MWorkLeon OchoachModelActivator has no observable difference. Still not sure about the model question though.

There is not activator by default. I guess there was once an .edit bundle for this model, which would use the activator then, but this was probably removed. Besides that, the activator is used to acces localizations, which we currently do not have and register validators, which we currently also do not have. So I think it can be removed.

going back +1 in case you did not regenerate the model to check if the genmodel is still valid

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/model/UIElements.genmodel -> regenerate the code

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workLeon Ochoach/model/UIElements.genmodel -> I'll try asking a different way.

How do I regenerate the code?

Sorry for not understanding :-)

You open the genmodel, you right click on the root node and select "generate model". There should be no changes then, as you have not changed the model.

There's two root nodes in the UIModel.genmodel - a UIElements.genmodel and UIElements.ecore. I also don't have a 'generate model'. Do I need to install anything other than the base Eclipse SDK to do this?

Yes, you need the EMF SDK including the gen model editor. It is included in the modeling tools EPP...
