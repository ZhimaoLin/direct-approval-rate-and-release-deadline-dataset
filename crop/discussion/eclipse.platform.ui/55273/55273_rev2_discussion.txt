Replied inline.

Line:97, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/TestPlugin.java -> I think in URLs the delimiter is always "/" (as opposed to file paths). Also in the iconPath variable above "/" has been used with no problem. The JVM probably takes care of converting it in the right way when going from URL to file path.

The Javadoc of getEntry also says "A path value of "/" indicates the root of this bundle."

Line:97, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/TestPlugin.java -> I cannot validate that as I have no Windows, but I guess we can just release and see in tomorrows log if the test works. :-)
