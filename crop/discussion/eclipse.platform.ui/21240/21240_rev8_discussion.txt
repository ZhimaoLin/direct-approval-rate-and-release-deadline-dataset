Hi Paul, I uploaded some new changes. I will try to fix problems with error handling, improve preference storage and refactor new classes in the evening, so I think it would be better to check in next commit tomorrow instead of this one.

OK, I'll wait until tomorrow.  When you amend and push tomorrow's commit, can you update the body of the commit message from WORK IN PROGRESS to something like:

Refactor the workLeon Ochoach Progress view to run on Eclipse4.  Includes:

* progress support
* Eclipse4 ProgressView
* ... whatever else that was added
