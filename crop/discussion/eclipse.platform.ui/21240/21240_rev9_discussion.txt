Patch Set 9:

In the latest commit I was focused mostly on taking advantage of DI framework and reducing the number of explicit singletons (in some places I think I gone too far - will be corrected). In some cases I was not able to create and inject objects xxx@xxx.xxx annotation, so I provided temporary workarounds. I think the current code is stable. I will be providing improvements and fixes regularly.
BTW. Daniel R. suggested that it may be better to push the code temporarily to e4 incubator branch. In my opinion it is good idea. Paul, what do you think?
