This goes into the right direction but the registry should be cached and not read on each access (see EditorRegistry).

Line:275, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/IDEWorkLeon OchoachPlugin.java -> Should be synchronized

Patch Set 2:

I suspect the operation of choosing the strategy to happen about once ever several minutes. Isn't caching it a bit over-optimization given the use-case?
The drawback of such optimization is permanent memory cost, and complexity in code in keeping cache synchronized with extension registry.

Sounds fair. But the requested change in IDEWorkLeon OchoachPlugin is needed.
