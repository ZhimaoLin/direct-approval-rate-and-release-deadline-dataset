Hi Brian,

I checked the cause for the exception, and IMHO it is a bug in the intro, not my patch. I created https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463043 and provided a patch for that too.

I also rebased my patch to the latest code base.

Hope this way my patch makes sense now.

Greez,
Dirk

We should only null out the ref when it's the correct ref, right?
Could you create a quick test?

Line:173, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/LazyStackRenderer.java -> Shouldn't this check:

if(element.getCurSharedRef() == ph) { element.setCurSharedRef(null); }

Line:837, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/PartRenderingEngine.java -> Shouldn't this check:

if(ph.getRef().getCurSharedRef() == ph) { ph.getRef().setCurSharedRef(null); }

I agree with the spirit of the change, but we have to verify that we're nulling out the right ref. 

I think a test is necessary: I put a breakpoint on your two changes to test that the placeholder's ref == placeholder.  I opened two perspectives and then closed the unselected perspective, and the breakpoint triggered.
