Patch Set 2:

Sebastian, thanks for contribution, I think we don't need two patches for that bug :-)

Regarding the patch (which would be mostly OK if I would not push my few seconds earlier :o) ):

1) Comment should be formatted differently, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform_UI/How_to_Contribute#Commit_Message_Conventions
2) As you see in my patch, I prefer to return faster to avoid deeply nested if statements.
