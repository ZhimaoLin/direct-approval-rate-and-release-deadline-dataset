Patch Set 4:

> Stefan, can this also be replaced with
> innerComp.getParent().requestLayout();?

Probably not. Most likely the author wrote this because they new innerComp had changed, in which case it should be replaced with innerComp.requestLayout().

requestLayout() is invoked on controls which changed, and layout() is invoked on the root of the controls affected by a change, so the calls won't line up 1-to-1.
