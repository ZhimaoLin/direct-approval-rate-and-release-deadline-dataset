Patch Set 5:

|Probably not. Most likely the author wrote this because they new |innerComp had changed, in which case it should be replaced with |innerComp.requestLayout().
|requestLayout() is invoked on controls which changed, and layout() |is invoked on the root of the controls affected by a change, so |the calls won't line up 1-to-1.

I opened a separate bug 485898 for this change
