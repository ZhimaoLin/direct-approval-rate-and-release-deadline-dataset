Patch Set 2:

This didn't work reliably in my eclipse.  Restart a session with the editor open but not on top.  Open CTRL+F6.  Select the editor (the icon changes).  Open CTRL+F6.  Still shows the old editor.

In 3.x instantiating the part kicked of a refresh, like http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse%20UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPartReference.java?h=R3_8_maintenance#n607

You might not want to refresh all of the properties, but maybe start with creating an ImageDescriptor from the part.getTitleImage() and calling setImageDescriptor(*) on it.

It also doesn't fix the icon when using Ctrl+E.
