Looks good except for some minor polish.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Use a a colon instead of a dash, i.e.
Bug 409332: Image....

Line:138, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPartReference.java -> Image should be in lower case.

Line:416, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPartReference.java -> The brackets around the two conditions are superfluous and should be removed.

Line:418, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPartReference.java -> I would add a comment behind the setImageDescriptor call that mentions that this will set the image to 'null'. Otherwise its hard to see that the code actually refreshes the image.
