Hi Dani,
Thank you for the review. I have updated the code according to your comments. In terms of unnecessary brackets in the "if" statement, in my opinion they just improves readability (but I removed them anyway).
Could you take a look once again and in case everything is OK, push the patch set to the master branch?
