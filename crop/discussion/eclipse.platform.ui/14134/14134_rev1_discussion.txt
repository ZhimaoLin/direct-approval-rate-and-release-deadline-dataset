Paul,

The patch seems to fix the issue. However if you have better idea how to fix it just let me know and I will modify it.
I was not able to find any document regarding the resolving key binding conflicts so I don't know if it breaks sth or not.

thanks in advance for review,
Daniel

The change would allow the best context to be switched to a parent context, but the parent context is more general and the children contexts are more specific ... and we always want more specific context to win.
