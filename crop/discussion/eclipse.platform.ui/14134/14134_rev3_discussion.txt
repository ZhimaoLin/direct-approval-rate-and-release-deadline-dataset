Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/contexts/ContextActivation.java -> I've noticed duplicated entries in the ContextAuthority.activationsBySourcePriority sets so I've fixed it too. It skips some unnecessary event processing

Line:113, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/contexts/ContextActivation.java -> I'm not sure that this is a good idea.  The ContextActivations are tokens (so equility by identity).  If 2 equivalent tokens are added, and one is removed, the other is still valid.  Doesn't that remove the only token from the hashset though?
