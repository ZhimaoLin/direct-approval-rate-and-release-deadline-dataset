DESCRIPTION

Bug 501590 - Project Explorer > Filters and Customization... dialog: ba

Changed title from "Available Customizations" to "Filters and
Customization". see: http://imgur.com/tA9JV1u.png

Note: I did not rename the property
org.eclipse.ui.navigator.hideAvailableCustomizationsDialog to avoid
adding compatibility problem filters
