DESCRIPTION

Bug 501590 - Project Explorer > Filters and Customization... dialog: ba

Changed title from "Available Customizations" to "Customize Project
Explorer"

Note: I did not rename the property
org.eclipse.ui.navigator.hideAvailableCustomizationsDialog to avoid
adding compatibility problem filters

+1 to changing the message, but -1 to this specific change: CN is used in a lot of places, and not all consumers are called Project Explorer.  Does CN have a name?  Otherwise "Customizeâ€¦" might work.

Thanks for the hint. What about "Filters and Customization"?
