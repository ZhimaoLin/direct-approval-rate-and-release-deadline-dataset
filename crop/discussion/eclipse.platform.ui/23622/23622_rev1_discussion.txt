We generally encourage you to change only one thing in a review. I see in some classes that you also changed brackets other things. 

I don't mind that for smaller changes, but not for such a big change. 

Please also create a separate review for CSS2PropertiesImpl.java as this is so big.

Abandoned

Instead of getting fetching it from gerrit and rebase it on master.  I will redo the change later....it will be faster!
