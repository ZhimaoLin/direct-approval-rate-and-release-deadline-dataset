DESCRIPTION

Bug 486901 - fixed "remove incompatible type" in ResourceToItemsMapper

The code never removed list from map if it was a last resource from the
list (the wrong key was used!). The list could be later reused for a
different resource and the mapping for current resource would point to
absolutely unrelated data from different resource.
