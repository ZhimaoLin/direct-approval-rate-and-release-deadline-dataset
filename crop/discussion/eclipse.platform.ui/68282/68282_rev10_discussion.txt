This looks great, but are we allowed new API in M7? Or does this have to wait for Oxygen?

Sorry, changing my +2 to a -1 -- I just thought of a potential memory leak.

Line:257, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> Delete this method. Unlike the other methods on this class, it is intended for creating short-lived temporary ISideEffects. If someone were to use it for this on ISideEffectFactory, the temporary side effect would leak.

Line:65, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/observable/sideeffect/CompositeSideEffect.java -> Maybe we should add a special case here for the singleton no-op side effect? That one will show up fairly often and it would never need to be part of a composite.
