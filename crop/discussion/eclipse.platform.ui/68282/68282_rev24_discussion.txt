Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/databinding/swt/WidgetSideEffects.java -> Consider moving to the end of the class since the ctor is the least important part of the class.

Line:155, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/observable/SideEffect.java -> I would change the message to: "The resume() method was called more times than pause()."

Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/observable/sideeffect/CompositeSideEffect.java -> Please.

Line:138, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/observable/sideeffect/CompositeSideEffect.java -> See a comment in SideEffect class.

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Resuming more times than pausing is a bug, isn't it?

Line:28, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/observable/sideeffect/SideEffectFactory.java -> Please.

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> Good point. I can't think of a use-case for it... and it's probably safer to treat it as an error until we think of one.

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ISideEffect.java -> And the code already does that :-)
