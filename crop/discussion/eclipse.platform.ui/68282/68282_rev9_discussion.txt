Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> Remove "for the creation of an xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffectFactory} and the following comma.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> Suggested addition:

, which are created by this factory. They do so by passing in a consumer which collects the side-effects constructed by the factory, allowing xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffect#dispose()} to be invoked on them at a later time.

Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> Suggested addition:

The consumer must guarantee that {@link ISideEffect#dispose()} will be called on every xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffect} it receives at some point in the future.

Line:67, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> Suggested rewording:

"The lifecycle of the returned xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffect} will be
managed by the factory. Callers are not responsible for
disposing the resulting xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffect}."

I wouldn't mention createFactory here since most people exposed to this method won't see the call to createFactory.

Line:76, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> Reword: Callers may call {@link ISideEffect#dispose()} on the result if they wish to dispose it early, but they are not required to do so since the lifecycle of the returned xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffect} is managed automatically.

Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> See above.

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> See above.

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> See above.

Line:128, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> see above

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/sideeffect/ISideEffectFactory.java -> See above.
