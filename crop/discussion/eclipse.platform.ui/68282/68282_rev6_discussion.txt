Line:45, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/ICompositeSideEffect.java -> You forgot to fix the typo. :-) Should have read:

"Removes the given xxx@xxx.xxx ISideEffect} instance from the composite."

The patch looks generally good to me, once the typo is fixed.
