Patch Set 27: Code-Review+2

I just pushed an update with the following fixes:
- Although we removed ICompositeSideEffect, we forgot to move the concrete implementation to an API package as a replacement (done).
- There was an incorrect comment on CompositeSideEffect suggesting that it was an interface.
- One of sergey's comments from patch 24 hadn't been addressed (there was an incorrect comment on ISideEffect.resume that suggested that it was valid to resume more times than the side effect had been paused).
