Patch Set 2:

Mixing unrelated changes in a Gerrit review is typically undesired. This makes the review much harder. Please avoid such things in the future.

Fixes the issue and the changes look good to me in general (even though the mixing of more fixes did make the review unnecessary hard).

One typo and one question about a potentially unnecessary parameter.  

Also I personally would prefer Lists instead of arrays as argument types. I created https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=443282 for the related discussion.

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/monitoring/FilterHandler.java -> Why pass in the size of the array as parameter? As see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=443282 for the proposal to switch to lists.

Line:190, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.monitoring/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/monitoring/EventLoopMonitorThread.java -> Typo
