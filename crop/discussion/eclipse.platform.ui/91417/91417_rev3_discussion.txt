Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Few issues:
1) Can we please separate the fix for the tab list order from the tab list look and feel? The tab order looks right now (so I would like to see this ASAP merged), but the rest needs more work.
2) I'm wondering why the editor list shown by Ctrl+e should look differently as the editor tab list shown by clicking on the "hidden tabs" button in the editor area. This does not mean I like the current implementation of that later list, but we should have some kind of consistency in IDE. In the later one hidden tabs are shown in bold (which is wrong IMHO) and the current tab has no special visual highlight.
3) The patch itself creates new Font objects without disposing them later => resources leak.
4) I don't like italics, neither gray foreground for hidden tabs. I personally would not use both, but change the background to some kind of light gray, see few screenshots how I did this in my plugin for 3.x: http://andrei.gmxhome.de/skins/examples.html.
