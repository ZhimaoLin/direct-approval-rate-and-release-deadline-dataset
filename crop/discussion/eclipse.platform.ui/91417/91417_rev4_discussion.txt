Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

1.) As requested, this first change fixes the MRU order. This change should be good enough to be submitted.

2.) The Ctrl+e editor list is a different implementation as the editor tab list shown by clicking on the "hidden tabs". With some work, we can unify the approach using only the first one.

3.) and 4.) based on (1.), I'm submitting another change to address these two points.

Patrick, the functionality works, so only few cosmetic issues, see comments below.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> What is this?

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbookEditorsHandler.java -> this method do not need to be public, and it is also can be made static.

The return value type does not need to be reference, it can be just primitive boolean.

The name is better be isMruEnabled, because it reads more natural this way.

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbookEditorsHandler.java -> Please remove this empty comment, also the one three lines below.
