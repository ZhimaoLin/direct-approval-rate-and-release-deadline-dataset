The change looks good to me.  I'm a bit apprehensive about this being the thin edge of the wedge for pushing further non-CSS workarounds.

Line:1831, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Might it be cleaner to rename to updateBusyState() and follow the approach of your addHighlight() and removeHighlight() by pushing the is-css test into it updateBusyState().  Like:

   if(!partActivatedEvent) {
      // tag-change event
      updateBusyState(cti, isCssEngineActive, newValue, oldValue);
   }

?

Thanks Brian for review!

Line:1831, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Yes, I've considered this first but it would mean to capture 6 arguments (part, cti, isCssEngineActive, partActivatedEvent, newValue, oldValue) for the new method, which would be not nice.
