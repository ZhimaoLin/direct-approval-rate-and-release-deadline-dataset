Patch Set 2:

Is it expected that a fast view that was at the bottom in Eclipse 3.x is on the left after import to 4.x? I see such case when testing Java perspective with minimized Problems view.

In my tests the stack was placed where it was when I exported it, e.g. imported attached perspectives3x.epf and opened FastAndMinimizedView. Can you provide the detailed steps? Best in the bug report itself.

For me all scenarios from bug 378811 are working fine with this patch set.
