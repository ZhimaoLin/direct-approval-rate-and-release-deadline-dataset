DESCRIPTION

Bug 325937 - Make selected part more visible

On GTK:
* Put more "light" on selected part (introduce a shade of grey for
others)
* Remove light on inactive part stack (no white, only greys)
* Remove gradients to remove the "relief" feeling that conflicts with
the light pattern.
On Windows:
* reduce contrast on inactive tab gradient
* reduce contrast between inactive tab and unselected inactive tabs by the use of a light blue background color

It is a small improvement, but it is definitely an improvement, and it does not looks completely different as before.

Someone with the Mac, just to confirm that the small change in the basestyle doesn't break something there.

Brian, you're a mac user, right?

It looks ok to me: the net effect is that the active tab text when the window loses focus becomes a very very dark grey: it still looks black to my tired old eyes.
