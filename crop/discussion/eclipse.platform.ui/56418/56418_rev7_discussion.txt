Just wondering if we can get the author of http://www.codeaffine.com/2015/11/04/clean-sheet-an-ergonomic-eclipse-theme-for-windows-10/ to help on this one. His theme looks really nice.

That would be nice to get some additional opinion indeed.

However, I believe it's not the right approach to wait for a patch to be perfect about theming before merging it. We can go step by step, to make theme better and better.
What I'm afraid with your proposal is that the suggested change gets stalled on a potential other contributor opinion, whereas it already makes Eclipse IDE better.

Mickael, I agree. I just wondered if we can get some more help on it.

The last patch I've tested on Windows (can't do this right now unfortunately) introduced light blueisch color which for me was a step backwards from a "clean" grey/white shema.

I'm trying to diff the changes to the recent patch, on ancient GTK versions from RHEL7.0 - can you briefly describe how this looks like now, or attach pictures? Have you introduced the tab gradients again (it looks like they were removed in previous patches)?

Ok. The blueish color is a color I reused from current CSS. However, I can replace it by a middle-dark grey if you prefer.

OK, I've figured out that I was testing without having the project imported into the workspace :-)

I personally feel the introducing the blue color not nice. The theme is more "distracting" as before, sorry. Please replace it to some variation of gray color.

Question: why have we lost tab gradients? While switching back to the original state I found they were nicer as now, "softer".
