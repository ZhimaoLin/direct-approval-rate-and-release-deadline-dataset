@Andrey: since you appear to find this better than current status on the Bugzilla, would you have the opportunity to review and merge that?

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Arrgh, I forgot I have no Linux workstation at the moment (only windows notebook), so I can't review GTK theme, but I've reviewed default Windows theme, see attachment at bug 325937 comment 43.

Except this small above issue it looks more discreet without all this distracting gradients. Now with clear separation of content from tabs it is just easier to find things. I like it.

I will get access to the Linux workstation in a week from now.

Patch Set 3:

What you see about the "active tab of the active site" changing style when a dialog is open is to highlight that the focus isn't on the tab at this moment. Since many dialogs are not modal, we also need something to make the difference based on focus. WDYT?
