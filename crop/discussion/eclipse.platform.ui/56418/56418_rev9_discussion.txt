DESCRIPTION

Bug 325937 - Make selected part more visible

On GTK:
* Put more "light" on selected part (introduce a shade of grey for
others)
* Remove light on inactive part stack (no white, only greys)
* Remove gradients to remove the "relief" feeling that conflicts with
the light pattern.
On Windows:
* reduce contrast on inactive tab gradient
* reduce contrast between inactive tab and unselected inactive tabs by the use of a light blue background color
