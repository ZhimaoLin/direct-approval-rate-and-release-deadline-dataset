Patch Set 4:

Patch Set 4 introduce "soft lines" around the active tab and content even on the selected stack. This makes it much easier to make distinction between a tab that just has "hover" and the one that is just selected.

@Andrey: I don't have a Windows 10 to try the theme, I only try it over GTK3. So if you wish to amend my commit to fix some Windows 10 related things, feel free to do it.
Also, my intention is mainly to "reverse" the light to put light on selected parts. Every other change about gradients and so on is not intentional, and I wouldn't mind if they were removed.
