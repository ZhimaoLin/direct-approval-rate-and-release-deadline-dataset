DESCRIPTION

Bug 325937 - Make selected part more visible

* Put more "light" on selected part (introduce a shade of grey for
others)
* Remove light on inactive part stack (no white, only greys)
* Remove gradients to remove the "relief" feeling that conflicts with
the light pattern.

Patch Set 8:

I've updated a patch set 8 which is removing gradients (that provide a complex relief impression not consistent with the flat light one used on most part of the IDE and in most other applications), and that keeps everything in shades of grey.
