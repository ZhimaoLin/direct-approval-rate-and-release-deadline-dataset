Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(5 comments)

The direction looks OK, but I had a few comments inline.

Line:326, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardResourceImportPage.java -> Isn't this changing the signature of a protected method on a class that can be extended?  Or we think this is OK because IElementFilter was internal and had a note about exclusive use by the import dialog?

Line:1097, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceTreeAndListGroup.java -> Why is this method not needed anymore?  Was it just orphaned and no one noticed?

Line:188, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceTreeAndListGroup.java -> The aboutToOpen() method says it must be called, but AFAICT is never called.

Line:714, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceTreeAndListGroup.java -> Does this method need to be public?  I couldn't find it used anywhere in the SDK.  I also couldn't find the matching getTree().

Line:24, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/IElementFilter.java -> Is the intent to allow users to implement IElementFilters, just not extend the interface?

(5 comments)

I responded to the comments in the changes

Line:326, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/WizardResourceImportPage.java -> I assumed it was fine because of the note, plus it makes sense to use the new API version. We could of course keep the internal version and have it extend the new API one or we could deprecate this method and create a new one using the new API

Line:1097, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceTreeAndListGroup.java -> I could not find it being used anywhere, so rather than provide it as API, I removed it

Line:188, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceTreeAndListGroup.java -> That method was always public (with that comment), it could probably be removed, but I left it as-is to see what you thought about it

Line:714, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/ResourceTreeAndListGroup.java -> This one could probably also be removed. It was part of the internal class as-is

Line:24, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/dialogs/IElementFilter.java -> Correct, clients should be able to create filters but not extend
