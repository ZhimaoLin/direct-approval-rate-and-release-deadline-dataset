Patch Set 1:

If you copied the code from HandledContributionItem, why don't you consider moving the code to the abstract super class to avoid code duplication?

Patch Set 1:

I wanted to have a feedback on the issue first.
Moving the code up, would introduce a new method in the super class. This would be either a method for retrieving the "commandId" which is strange in the super class as it doesn't know about commands. So it should be something like getHelpId, which leads also to code duplication as the commandhelpService is reused for retrieving the helpid currently.

Patch Set 1:

I don't think treating the elementId as a commandId makes sense â€” they would likely just use a HandledContributionItem in that case.  Perhaps this is a case for a persistedState key like HELP_CONTEXT_ID?

Patch Set 1:

I agree, that the elementId is not a perfect alternative for the commandid. But the problem already exists in the HandledContributionItem as there is no e4 specific ICommandHelpService implementation. There is a bug for this without an answer yet: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=468636
