DESCRIPTION

Bug 507298: Use fitting color for Heap Status 

Heapstatus is not a tooltip. It should not be using tooltip colors.
This improper use of Tooltip color makes heapstatus have very
poor contrast on Gtk. (See screenshot)
Since it is a regular widget, it should be using regular widget
colors.
(See screenshot attached to bug to see before/after).
