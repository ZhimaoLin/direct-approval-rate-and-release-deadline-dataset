Line:345, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/MenuManager.java -> If getListeners() was not final, and menu manager couls be extended, this can break existing code. I have no IDE right now to check this.

Line:345, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/MenuManager.java -> I don't understand the objection. The listeners list is private aswell as this method. So even on extending MenuManager this should not break anything. Or do I miss something?

Line:345, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/MenuManager.java -> I think the change is OK, even though the Javadoc of ListListener is not really clear. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488508
