DESCRIPTION

[185445] User a volatile listenerList for atomic assignment to field

The listenerList field is wrongly set to transient when it should be
volatile. The field is lazily set to an instance in synchronized methods
but is also used in non synchronized method. To let these methods see
the change, the field must be volatile.
