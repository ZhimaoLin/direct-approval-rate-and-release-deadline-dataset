Since now it is stored in the transient data we don't have to remove it (it will be cleared when the model item gets disposed). However I can clear the proper transient data here, if you want

It's possible in some cases for a model element to be reused, and if we find an existing ICI we'll use that as well (even if it's not in the correct shape, having already been disposed).
