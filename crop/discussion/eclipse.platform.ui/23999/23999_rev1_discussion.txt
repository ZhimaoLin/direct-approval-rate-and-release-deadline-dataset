Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributionManagerRenderer.java -> This is an invalid assumption.  The model element lives in its window, you can't guess what it is by what's selected.

Line:153, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/ContributionManagerRenderer.java -> I expected that it won't go. Do you think the direction of the patch is correct? If so, do you have any idea how to match the Menu/Toolbar model item to window? I was trying to find the parent window by the "Model.getParent() -> getParent() ..." loop, but it didn't work.

thanks in advance for help,
Daniel
