Line:414, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> This text is used if there is a keybinding?  Then why do they need to run "toggle full screen" to deactivate?  The keybinding should do that.

Maybe:
"Use {0} to disengage from full-screen."
"Use {0} to leave full-screen."

Line:414, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> Currently we do not have a key binding for toggling between full screen and non full screen. This will be done in another bug. When the other bug is fixed we can change the text as well. But for now only quick access or the menu entry can be used to invoke the command.

Brian, see Bug 491572 and Bug 491785. The shortcut for this is still under discussion.

I'm aware of those bugs. This text will be filled in with the appropriate keybinding once settled.

Uh, I didn't mean to submit this.

Line:414, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/messages.properties -> But this text is shown when they *do* have a keybinding.  It may be inactive for now, but will become active once a keybinding has been defined.
