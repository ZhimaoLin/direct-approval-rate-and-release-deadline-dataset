Our flags were set to be flags, not absolute values.  != IN_TRIM doesn't make sense, and it's still in the block not protected by IN_PART

Patch Set 1:

Not adding the IN_TRIM check will find Handler located in Parts.  

elements = modelService.findElements(application, MHandler.class,
				EModelService.IN_TRIM, getSelector(MHandler.class));
		assertEquals(0, elements.size());



So do you recommend to use this check instead:
if ((searchFlags & PRESENTATION) != 0 
|| (searchFlags & IN_PART) != 0
|| (searchFlags & IN_ANY_PERSPECTIVE) != 0)
