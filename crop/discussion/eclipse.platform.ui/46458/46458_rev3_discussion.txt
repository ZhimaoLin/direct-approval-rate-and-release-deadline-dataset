Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Thanks Stephan. This change contains a mixture of unrelated changes and format changes which we typically not like. So for the next patch please ensure that you only change stuff which relates to the bug, e.g., the enhanced for loop has nothing todo with the databinding change.

For as this seem to be your first patch... Thanks a bunch, merged.
