DESCRIPTION

Bug 460988 - [cleanup] most of org.eclipse.ui.views.markers.internal is
obsolete and should be removed - part 3

Last part of the cleanup: removed MarkerList, MarkerFilter, TaskFilter
and old Marker/Task/BookmarkView related code. The rest of the classes
in the org.eclipse.ui.views.markers.internal package seems to be really
used.
