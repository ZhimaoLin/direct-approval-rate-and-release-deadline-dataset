DESCRIPTION

Bug 420956 - Fix perspective customization on 4.x

This is hopefully the last patch in the series of patches towards usable
perspective customization on 4.x.

The CustomizePerspectiveDialog shows now all toolbar/menubar
contributions from action sets (with right labels) previously shown in
3.x stream, allows properly disable/enable their status per perspective
and persist the state in the model. Additionally the label provider is
enhanced to show the availability of almost all contribution depending
on the action set state.
