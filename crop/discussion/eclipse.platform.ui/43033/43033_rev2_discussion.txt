Line:38, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/progress/TestJob.java -> I didn't touch the class after extracting it. But you're right, should get rid of this ugliness. Also I updated the copyright section, to point to the original contributor, since this is basically a cut-paste fix.

Line:42, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/progress/TestJob.java -> Done

Line:31, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/progress/ExtendedJobInfo.java -> Done
