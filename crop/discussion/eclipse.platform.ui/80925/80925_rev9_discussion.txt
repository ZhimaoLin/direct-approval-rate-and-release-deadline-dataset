Good news: 
 - now the "red button" is disabled after clicking on it
 - no exception anymore on closing the wizard with the scan running
Bad news:
 - clicking on "red  button" still does not stop progress
 - typing in the text still does not stop the running scan
 - see also comments in the code

Mickael, can you please test this Wizard with "/" or "C:/" starting point? Just type it and try to cancel scanning, this is my simplest use case which failed with every changeset so far.

Line:163, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/wizard/ProgressMonitorPart.java -> Why should we access thiss if the indicator is disposed? This will fail same way as the other if branch?

Line:773, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/SmartImportRootWizardPage.java -> We should check if the tree is still not disposed.

This is the one I'm using for all my tests. However, I don't reproduce the issue. It might be platform-specific...
If you have the opportunity to debug it and to put a breakpoint on SmartImportRootWizardPage#stopAndDisconnectCurrentWork that would help.
