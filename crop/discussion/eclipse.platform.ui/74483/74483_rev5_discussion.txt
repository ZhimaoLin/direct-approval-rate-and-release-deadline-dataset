I have the impression that this use-case shows the need to make some static methods non-static. However, it would be nice fo someone more experienced with that part of the code could have a look.

Line:151, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> As those 'registerLegacyHandler' methods are only invoked from that class (which is internal), wouldn't it make more sense to make them regular methods rather than static one receiving several state variables?

+1 for the actual fix, -1 for the number of unrelated changes.

Can you please undo the unrelated formatting stuff & rebase?

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> Can you please undo all the white space / formatting changes? If you think they are important, please apply them *after* the actual fix in a dedicated commit.

Line:151, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> Static code allows you to make sure no internal state is affected by the change, only input arguments.

Line:563, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/handlers/LegacyHandlerService.java -> Can you please comment here why the clearActivations() is required? For someone not familiar with the code this looks strange.
