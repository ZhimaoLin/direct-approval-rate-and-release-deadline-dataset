The review is needed for the backport not the merge into master.

Patch Set 7:

For the backport it would be good to have Gradle as consumer, as they requested this feature. Stefan, do you have something cooking to use this in Buildship?

Patch Set 7:

I'd rather have reviews on master, so the quality of the patch is better thanks to review, so backporting later in simpler.
BuildShip and Stephan didn't really request that change, it's just that the importer got inspired by one of their ideas. However, maybe this is sufficient to cover some of their concerns regarding adoption of Smart Import.

LGTM

@Lars: As Mickael mentioned, this is not relevant for Buildship. It's just a better default that was inspired by how Gradle handles de-duplication.
