Patch Set 4:

The latest version of this patch adds tests for SmartImport (finally!) and a specific one to verify naming behavior.
I didn't find it useful at the moment to extract a dedicated class for the naming parts, and since this is expected to be in maintenance branch, I believe it's also good to keep the changes minimal. So I simply extracted a private static method at the moment.
