DESCRIPTION

BugÂ 519771 - Add new option "Working Sets with Open Projects"

Instead of adding another option to the "Select working set" dialog I
added a filter to hide working sets, that are either empty or contain
only closed projects.

I have the impression this change can break the current expected behavior of "Open Projects".
