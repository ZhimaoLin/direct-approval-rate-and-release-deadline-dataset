DESCRIPTION

BugÂ 519771 - Add new option "Working Sets with Open Projects"

Instead of adding another option to the "Select working set" dialog I
added a filter to hide working sets, that are either empty or contain
only closed projects.

I would give +1 if I would see a better proposal for the filter name.

Line:28, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/plugin.properties -> Sounds not nice. What about "Empty working sets or working sets with closed projects only" ?
