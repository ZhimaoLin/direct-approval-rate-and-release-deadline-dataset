DESCRIPTION

Bug 383569 - [Contributions] [Perspectives] "Reset Perspective" does not
reset toolbar and menu contributions

Toolbars can be now disabled and enabled without affecting other
perspectives via CPD. Also reset perspective works fine for toolbars. 

Known issue: on next startup toolbars disabled in one perspective aren't
shown anymore in *all* perspectives, however reseting *any* perspective
(or enabling those toolbars) restores they state for all perspectives
again.
