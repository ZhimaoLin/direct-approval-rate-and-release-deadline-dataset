DESCRIPTION

Bug 388476 - [EditorMgmt] Editor tab management lost "working set" (MRU)
functionality

Introduced global switch to control if CSS (themes) or preferences
(user) are controlling the MRU functionality. Per default MRU behavior
is controlled by preferences now, independently what the CSS themes
says, so that switching CSS themes does not affect the actual MRU value.

3 preferences for the "org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.renderers.swt"
instance are added:

 - "mruControlledByCSS":  if the "most recently used" behavior should be
controlled via CSS or preferences. Default will be "false" now.

 - "enableMruDefault": what should be considered as default MRU value if
this is controlled by preferences. Default will be "true" now.

 - "enableMru": what should be considered as actual MRU value. This
preference can be changed by user if the "mruControlledByCSS" is
"false".

Only the last preference is exposed to users by new "Enable most
recently used order for tab placement" checkbox on the
"General->Appearance" page. The default value is "true" and corresponds
to the "enableMruDefault" preference above. If "mruControlledByCSS" is
"true", this checkbox is not visible to user.

Important: if product owners want to keep on current behavior, they can
revert the effect of all proposed changes by specifying
"mruControlledByCSS=true" in the  plugin_customization.ini.

For details on proposed solution see bug 388476 comment 120.

Patch Set 4:

Patch set 4 (beside fixes for Sergey's comments) also considers the case if theming is entirely disabled via "-cssTheme none" command line argument.

1) Previously the preference page was completely disabled, not the three theme unrelated preferences (including MRU) are shown to the user and can be changed.

2) If theme dosn't provide mru settings, default values are taken from preferences.
