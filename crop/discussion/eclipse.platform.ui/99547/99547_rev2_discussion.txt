Can you explain why the test passes on Windows? I think this is exactly one of those cases where one should investigate why the additional loading happens (or not).

I think such a test and investigation belongs into a bug for eclipse.platform.ua and not into platform.ui. I still do not have access to Windows. If you plan to investigate on Window, please follow up on this bug.

This is currently on hold because of Danis -1, I will not be able to investigate on Windows.

Well, on Windows it's not loaded, which is better then loading it ;-). So, you can very well investigate why the cheat sheet bundle is loaded. Something I can't do on Windows. If you post here what's loading the plug-in, I will do the same on Windows.
