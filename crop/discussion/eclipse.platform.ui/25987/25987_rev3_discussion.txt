DESCRIPTION

Bug 433778 - quick access dialog not executing in the correct context

Execute the QuickAccessElement after the Dialog has been fully closed/disposed.
This causes all context to be adjusted again and so the CommandExecution will be
able to resolve the variables.

I think we need to look at 1) taking the Snapshot ... is it the snapshot of the workLeon Ochoach before we open the dialog and 2) When we go to execute the command in context, are we honouring the snapshot or do we need to do some more work there.

It is important to get this fixed in RC1.

Line:211, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessDialog.java -> I don't think we can go this way.  Basically, we can't guarantee that we're executing in the right context, and pushing this into an asyncExec means it will execute at some indeterminate time later, in some random context.

It did work, at least for my usecases :-)
