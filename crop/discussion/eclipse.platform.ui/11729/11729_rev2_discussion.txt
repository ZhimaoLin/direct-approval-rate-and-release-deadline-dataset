We need to protect ourselves against listeners that remove themselves during their callback.

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/AbstractSourceProvider.java -> Could we use listeners = new ListenerList(ListenerList.IDENTITY);?  We often run into a problem in Platform UI where a contributed listener removes itself during a listener call out, which causes a ConcurrentModificationException.

Looking into the suggested changes.

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/AbstractSourceProvider.java -> I'll have a look. And expand the JUnit to cover removal during call out.
