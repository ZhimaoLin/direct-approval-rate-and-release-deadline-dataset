I was planning to run the tests locally but if you did validate that the tests are still running (and the number of total tests is the same), even better.

According to https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/test/?width=800&height=600 the number of tests that passed when this patchset (#6291) was verified by Hudson is consistent with the history. Do you think we can use this as a confirmation for this and future test migrations?

Patch Set 7:

Unfortunately the tests are not included in the Tycho build. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417258 and also Bug 441850. Once we have the tests running in Tycho the world will be a better place.

IIRC you were planning to have a look at Bug 441850, I search my email on this and ping you if my memory is correct.
