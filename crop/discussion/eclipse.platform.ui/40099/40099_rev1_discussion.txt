project, .settings folder is created and complicates the work with the
git repository. Adding .settings folder to .gitignore solves the
problem.

No problem, could you then please add a correct .settings folder in the top folder? (Would an acceptable .settings folder contain org.eclipse.m2e.core.prefs too?)

We currently do not have a .settings folder in the top level. .settings are specific to the project, why would you like to have a .settings folder on the top?

> why would you like to have a .settings folder on the top?

I personally see no reason for having the top level .settings folder in git. I prefer having it ignored, because as I already said in the commit message, when importing the top level project to workspace as a Maven project, .settings folder is created and complicates the work with the git repository.

Why I import the top level project into my workspace as a Maven project is a distinct but related topic: because I like to issue maven commands from the workspace and see their output in Eclipse console view.

Please also note that when nested projects feature https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38119/ gets accepted, it will probably get very common that people will want to import the  top level folder as a project just to have it as parent of the underlying projects and folders.

So this is explicit to ignore the settings in the top level folder? In this case I think the change is fine. Can you open a bug report for this change? We need this for the reference in the commit message.
