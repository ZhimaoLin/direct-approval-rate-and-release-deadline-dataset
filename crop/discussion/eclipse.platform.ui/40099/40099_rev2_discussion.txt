DESCRIPTION

Bug 169591 - Add top level .settings folder to .gitignore

When importing the top level project to workspace as a Maven
project, .settings folder is created and complicates the work with the
git repository. Adding .settings folder to .gitignore solves the
problem.

Change is fine by itself, you just need to update the commit message with the correct bug number (in case you have not done so, you need first to open a bug report for this change), please also describe how you import the top-level project, as it does not have a .project file.
