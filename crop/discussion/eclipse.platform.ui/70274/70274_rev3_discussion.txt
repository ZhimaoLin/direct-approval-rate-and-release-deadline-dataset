Do you have the svg version of the icon? If not please create a new bug for it and ask Sheldon Collins if he can help with it

Nope I don't have an SVG. I found it as it in a Sirius Git repo (by the way, is it legal?).
About seeing the menu, it requires to start the platform product; it doesn't show up if you simply run the workLeon Ochoach application.

I suggest to remove that icon and handle the new icon separately via its own bug.

This whole change is about adding an icon, I don't understand what we'd save with another bug.
