Really? I thought we are only doing this for external contribs we are not really referencing all bugs in the header if the change is done by a committer, do we?

AFAIK this is still desired or depending on the point of view required. We discussing to drop this silly requirement. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=438633 for a detail discussion.

No, committers on the same project never update the copyright note and Tom is a committer on Platform UI.

Nice. Didn't know.....and I vaguely remember that Dani requested in the past from me to update the copyright for platform.ui ;-) Good to know that it is optional.

Sorry Tom for the noise from my side.
