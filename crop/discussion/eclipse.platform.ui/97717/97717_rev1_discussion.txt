DESCRIPTION

Bug 517068 - key binding conflicts check for enabled commands

Invoking a keybinding wasn't taking into account whether command is
executable or not. This can be annoying in case of multiple commands
bound to the same binding: user got asked to choose which command to
invoke, but some of those commands were not executable and resulted in
an error message to user.
With a filter to only use executable commands, in most cases, we
shouldn't even see a pop-up as commands on a same shortcut are usually
mutually exclusive, and in case the pop-up shows up, it would only
propose commands that can run properly.

I'm working on an automated test to make sure we don't see regression there, I'll change the visibility at the same time when I publish the test.
