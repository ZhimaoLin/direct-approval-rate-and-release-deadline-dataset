Uses the incorrect formatting of space to avoid strange looking
intention in the Gerrit review. We should replace spaces with tabs via a
separate commit

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2

The default for those methods should not be empty. Then better not set a content provider (in most cases both methods do nothing).

My bad. I only checked accesses to ContentViewer#contentProvider which says:
* This viewer's content provider, or <code>null</code> if none.
and the field is everywhere protected against 'null'. However, #setInput has this:
Assert.isTrue(getContentProvider() != null, "Instances of ContentViewer must have a content provider assigned before the setInput method is called."); //$NON-NLS-1$

Hence it makes sense to add empty default methods.
