I made some initial review via Gerrit, but did not load it into the IDE since I could not rebase the change (most likely due to the "related" change.

Please rebase it manually.

Line:58, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/schema/unassociatedEditorStrategy.exsd -> This also needs to be documented
==>
a unique id that will be used to identify this unassociated editor strategy

Line:65, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/schema/unassociatedEditorStrategy.exsd -> This also needs to be documented
==>
the fully qualified class name implementing the interface org.eclipse.ui.ide.IUnassociatedEditorStrategy

Line:706, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> This should just call the old method like in 4.5:
==>
return getEditorDescriptor(file, true);

Line:1012, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> Change to Javadoc on deprecated method looks wrong to me.

Line:1055, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> Change to Javadoc on deprecated method looks wrong to me.

Line:16, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/SystemEditorOrTextEditorStrategy.java -> Please replace remaining "unknown"
