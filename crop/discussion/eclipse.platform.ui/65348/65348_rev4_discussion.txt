Line:781, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> I think a new bullet is needed to describe that this code also will also try to query the default opening strategy as the last step.

Line:1081, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> Same as above.

Line:1147, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> I would not add the logic above but introduce the new boolean flag to the strategy interface: isInteractive() (don't know why it is a TODO in the patch here).

I would also forward the allowInteractive flag to the call to getUnknownEditorStrategy(), and there if the configured strategy says that it is interactive, select SystemEditorOrTextEditor. 

line 1176:

if(res == null || (!allowInteractive && res.isInteractive())) {
  res = new SystemEditorOrTextEditor();
}
