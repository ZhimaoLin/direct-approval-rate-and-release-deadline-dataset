Took a quick look and still see unrelated whitespace changes.

There is no need to touch the Javadoc of #getEditorDescriptor(IFile) expect deprecating it - it is expected to work as it did before.

Patch Set 7:

One important thing: all the old/deprecated methods and their Javadoc must be restored (behavior - not 1:1 code, see below) to what they were in 4.5, i.e. they must not throw OperationCanceledException.

The deprecated methods should not have any real code but call the corresponding new ones with 'false'.

When 'false' is used, the new methods must not throw OperationCanceledException.
