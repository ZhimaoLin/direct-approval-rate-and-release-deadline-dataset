Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/UnknownEditorStrategyRegistry.java -> The question for me: is this xml configurable or should it be the part of the interface? I personally prefer to use interface and ask the object, which might have some dynamics regarding whether it needs UI or not.

Line:127, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/UnknownEditorStrategyRegistry.java -> Here I would log an error about missing contribution.

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> For the new API javadoc on all new methods where the list of steps is given: please add the "strategy" step to the list of steps performed to calculate the descriptor.

Line:1156, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> This check is not needed, since the getUnknownEditorStrategy() never returns null.

Line:1180, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/IDE.java -> Please add after last dot: Never returns xxx@xxx.xxx null}.
