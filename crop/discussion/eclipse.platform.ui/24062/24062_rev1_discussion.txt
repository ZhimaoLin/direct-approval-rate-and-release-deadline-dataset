Patch Set 1:

The IDE can have two model elements with the same ID several times, e.g. the menu menu if you have several windows.

Should the merge for menu and toolbars not be done based on the MWindow?

Patch Set 1:

I'm not sure what you mean - the IDS you see being used are the technical ones and 2 windows should never have the same ID how the merge finds the location is defined based on the logic in MModelFragment.merge!

Patch Set 1:

Just select Window -> New Window and check the ID of the main menu. It will have the same ID.
