Line:191, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ContentViewer.java -> We should not throw this.  If you follow the stack trace, many important items will be skipped.  Because this is a dispose method, we should do the best we can to clean up.

Also, the input changed exception should not affect any disposing logic.
