DESCRIPTION

Bug 492252 - Instantiate FinishedJobs in ProgressViewAddon

FinishedJobs object should be created as a field within ProgressManager.
Unfortunately its internal dependency to mentioned ProgressManager
introduces a cycle. Therefore it should be created manually along with
ProgressManager.
