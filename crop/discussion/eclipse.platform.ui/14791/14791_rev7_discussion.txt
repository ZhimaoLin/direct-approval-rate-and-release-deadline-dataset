Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ViewerSorter.java -> I don't think it's necessary to deprecate fields and methods of a deprecated class. Everything that belongs to a deprecated class is deprecated anyway.

IIRC JDT does not show the methods of a deprecated with strike-through but I need to re-check this.

Patch Set 7:

The method calls will not trigger deprecation warnings, but any reverence to the class itself will. Since it not possible to call a method of a deprecated class without naming the class itself, it should be sufficient. The only exception is a chained call:
@Deprecated public class D {
 public void bar();
}
public class A {
 public D foo();
}

A a;
a.foo().bar();

There will be no warnings in a.foo().bar(), but it is good because it's the method A.foo() that refers to the deprecated class, not a.foo().bar().
