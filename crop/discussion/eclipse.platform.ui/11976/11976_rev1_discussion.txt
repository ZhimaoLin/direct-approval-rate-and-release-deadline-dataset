DESCRIPTION

398925: After prolonged usage Eclipse becomes unusable :
java.lang.Object cannot be cast to
org.eclipse.e4.core.commands.EHandlerService

Added defensive code that  checks for unexpected return values from
IEvaluationContext.getVariable, logs a message and takes a reasonable
default action.
