DESCRIPTION

Bug 368977 - [Compatibility] Ctrl+E does not work when no active editor

Ctrl+E dialog is completely re-done using the approach used in
CycleBaseHandler. 
The user can filter over a table displaying a list of all the open
editors. 
This looks decent in dark theme also.
The filtered table can be transformed into a cyclable list just by
changing a flag.
