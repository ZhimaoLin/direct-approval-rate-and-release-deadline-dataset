DESCRIPTION

Bug 368977 - [Compatibility] Ctrl+E does not work when no active editor

Ctrl+E dialog is completely re-done using the approach used in
CycleBaseHandler. 
The user can filter over a table displaying a list of all the open
editors. 
This looks decent in dark theme also.
The filtered table can be transformed into a cyclable list just by
changing a flag.

I did not review the code in detail (sorry, no time) but tested the functionality and it works well and looks also much better in light and dark theme. Thanks Patrik. If you feel confident, I suggest to merge it so that it gets a lot of testing.
