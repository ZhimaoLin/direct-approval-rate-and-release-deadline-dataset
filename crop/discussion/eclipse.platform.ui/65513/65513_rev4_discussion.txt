DESCRIPTION

Bug 486859 - Editor Selection dialog should offer one-click "for all

Line:630, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/EditorSelectionDialog.java -> If rememberEditorButton is selected and remember type button doesn't exist (case of files without an extension such as "Dockerfile"), then this will return whereas we do want to store the association.

My advice would be:

boolean associateEditor = false;
EditorRegistry reg = ...
if (rememberEditorButton != null && rememberEditorButton.getSelection()) {
  ...
  associateEditor = true;
}
if (rememberTypeButton != null && rememberTypeButton.getSelection()) {
  ...
  associateEditor = true;
}
if (associateEditor) {
  ... set mappings...
}
