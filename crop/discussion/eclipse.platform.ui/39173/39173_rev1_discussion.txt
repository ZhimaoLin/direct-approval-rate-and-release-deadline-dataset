Patch Set 1:

Very cool Fabian. As a first step, can you remove the whitespace, set the formatter to the Eclipse project and activate in the save actions that whitespace should be removed?

Patch Set 1:

Daniel / Paul, any concerns to add a new bundles for a "pure" e4 about dialog? Several of our (vogella GmbH) asking for it and Fabian provides one here. I have not yet received the code in detail, I just wanted to check if adding a bundle for this is OK.

It would probably make more sense to add it to org.eclipse.e4.ui.workLeon Ochoach.swt

Fabian, can you move the code. Also it looks like you forgot to ammend your commmit, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/39179, please use interactive rebase to combine both.
