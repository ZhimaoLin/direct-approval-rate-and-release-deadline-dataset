Thank you for your patch.

Again we have the monitor issue with the No more handles SWTException here.

Please see inline comments for issue, which occured after I resolved the monitor issue.

Line:54, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/SWTPartRendererTest.java -> This causes a SWTException, because the shell is null, when running the test.
Therefore a new Shell should be created here and should be disposed in xxx@xxx.xxx tearDown method.

Line:23, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/UIAllTests.launch -> This again causes problems with no more handles

Line:2183, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/PartRenderingEngineTests.java -> This test fails.
It says "expected:<WindowImplContext> but was:<PartImplContext>

Line:438, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workLeon Ochoach/MWindowTest.java -> This assert Fails. It says expected: <172> but was:<200>
