DESCRIPTION

Bug 487385 - Should unselected-hot-tab-color-background have an
swt-prefix?

Use the new name of the property to prevent the following message on the
console.
Also fix the respective handler to support the new name (which it
wasn't) and the old deprecated one.

!MESSAGE CSS property 'unselected-hot-tab-color-background' has been
deprecated: renamed as swt-unselected-hot-tab-color-background
