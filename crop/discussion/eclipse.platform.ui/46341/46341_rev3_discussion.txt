DESCRIPTION

Bug 142228: [EditorMgmt] Don't expect File->Open to invoke system editor

This patch takes advantage of the
org.eclipse.ui.ide.editorAssociationOverride extension point to override
the default editor association. If the workLeon Ochoach cannot determine an
associate editor for a given text file then the extension will return
the internal text editor. For binary files nothing is changed - they
still will be opened in the external system editor if the operating
system can provide one.

The tricky part is how to determine if a file is a text or binary. The
current implementation in the TextFileDetector class is quite heuristic.
It uses the CharsetDetector from the ICU library and check the level of
confidence. It's not perfect, but gives good results for such a simple
implementation.
