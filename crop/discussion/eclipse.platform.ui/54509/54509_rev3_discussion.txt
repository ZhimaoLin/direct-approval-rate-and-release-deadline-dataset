Patch Set 3:

David, FYI I think I need to merge this before the next I-Build to avoid a build failure. SWT delete the TableTree widget (as announced several years ago). I just have to wait for the Hudson build verification.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

Fine with me to remove them ... even if SWT announced removal "years ago" ... wouldn't hurt to re-announce, say on eclipse-dev? And be sure to upgrade migration guide (or, what ever the procedure it ... since some people may not migrate each release, but might move up to Neon, say ... from Kepler or something?
