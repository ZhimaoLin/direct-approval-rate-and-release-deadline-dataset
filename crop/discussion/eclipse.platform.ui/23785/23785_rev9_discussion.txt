Paul, any feedback? I would like to get this into M7 so that people can start using PartDescriptors.

I'm on Mar 21st, so I'm almost caught up with this change.  It should be OK, M7 is another 3 weeks.

I wasn't able to rebase the changes in ViewLabelProvider, there were too many differences.

Comments on the un-rebased version

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewContentProvider.java -> Shouldn't we make sure we remove the Intro view?

Line:160, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewContentProvider.java -> Shouldn't this filter MPartDescriptors?

Line:231, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ShowViewDialog.java -> What happened to quick selection mode?

one more.

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewComparator.java -> These could still have mnemonics in them.

See answers inline, I would need your feedback on two of your suggestions.

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewContentProvider.java -> I can do this, but I did not understand why we would do this. Why should it not be possible to open the intro view from the Show View menu?

Line:231, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ShowViewDialog.java -> Next patch will include it again

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewComparator.java -> How do I handle this case for mnemonics? Any example in our code base?

Line:130, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewContentProvider.java -> Because that's controlled by a different, separate, menu item under Help.  "Welcome"

Line:160, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewContentProvider.java -> I mean, if that's what we're showing in the dialog?

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewComparator.java -> That's probably what DialogUtil.removeAccel(*) was for.
