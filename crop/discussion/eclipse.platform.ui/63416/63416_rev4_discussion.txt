Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

In my opinion a pseudo class ":link" for the linkForeGround is not a best fit. 
Since 
* it is a separate property on the Link widget,
* it does not have the unvisited information. 
> [a]:link - a normal, unvisited link


I would prefer a property "link-foreground-color".
