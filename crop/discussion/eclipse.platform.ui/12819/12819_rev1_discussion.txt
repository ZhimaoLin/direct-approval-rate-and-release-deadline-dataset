Line:734, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> Why do you need to check for the widget before setting the model element's visibiliyt?

Line:737, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> This line shouldn't be necessary.  Setting the toolItem visibility should be picked up by the ToolBarmanagerRenderer with will do a ToolBarManager.update(true)

Line:734, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> OK, It seems that it was sth with my local env. After rebuilding all projects and removing the checking against the widget disposing it has started to work. Thanks for hitting it

Line:737, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/CoolBarToTrimManager.java -> I was able to refresh toolbar differently by calling, as you said, ToolBarManager.update(true).
