DESCRIPTION

Fixed bug 431924: [Preferences]
org.eclipse.ui.internal.preferences.WorkingCopy.keys() returns removed
keys

New: Generified temporarySettings variable based on review, removed
unnecessary casts and made iteration of entries in all methods happen
via the entrySet view to be consistent.

Changed keys-method to add to or remove from results any temporary keys
based on if the key's value is null.
