Change-Id: I0e3c6e5306fa66c4dbf404508cadba31c1264fd2
Message: Now, for a custom perspective, we try to get the original id by
considering three different behaviors in saving custom perspective ids: 
[1] keeping spaces (observed in Neon), [2] replacing spaces with
underscores and trimming (in eclipse 3.x according comment 12) [3] just
trimming spaces (observed in Eclipse 3.8)
