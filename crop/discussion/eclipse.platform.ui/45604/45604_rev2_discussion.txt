DESCRIPTION

Bug 427393 - Splash is blank after Workspace Launcher dialog appears

Bug 455162 is also addressed by this fix: there is no gray rectangle in
front of the prompt dialog anymore and after the workspace prompt dialog
is closed, the splash with the progress bar is shown again (was broken
too, see bug 455162 comment 8).

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

This patch looks better then https://git.eclipse.org/r/44545 - it addresses more issues (especially with the never visible progress bar in KDE), so let merge this one instead. The previous patch changes (alpha for the shell) are removed here.
