DESCRIPTION

Bug 427393 - Splash is blank after Workspace Launcher dialog appears

Bug 455162 is also addressed by this fix: there is no gray rectangle in
front of the prompt dialog anymore and after the workspace prompt dialog
is closed, the splash with the progress bar is shown again (was broken
too, see bug 455162 comment 8).

Looks good, code-wise. Can't test the change, as the error only shows on KDE

Lars, I'm also interested to know if the change does not introduce new regressions on NON KDE environments. 

So if you can confirm that this works on NON KDE platform this would be very valuable.

Patch Set 1:

Tested on Ubuntu and it works still fine. 

Random observation, not related to this change: The ws selection dialog is not centered if I start a runtime IDE, I never noticed that before. But this is unrelated to this change, even if I revert the change, I still get the workspace selectioni dialog on a strange place on my second monitor.
