The good question is why such serious issue wasn't reported earlier - the CSS engine is commonly used for some period of time and for sure it would be noticed by someone ealier

Line:45, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/ButtonElement.java -> I've noticed preparing the patch for 4.3.2, that this line has to be also removed since the dispose method does not have it.
The line looks like some sort of optimization for applying styling in the dynamic manner. There are still some bugs reported to it (performance claims for instance) so I believe it will be implemented in other way
