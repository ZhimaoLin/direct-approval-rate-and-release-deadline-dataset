I think we also need to listen for changes in the binding and update the Shortcut, if the binding changes

Lars makes a good point.  I wonder if you add a binding listener to IBindingService and and a context listener to IContextService that you'll find that the trigger sequence shows.  It may be that the SearchField is created when prior to a context being activated.

Line:319, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> We should only go through getBindings() if getActiveBindingFor() returns null.

Patrik, can you fix that. I suggest to open a new bug for the dynamic update of the text. Currently we show for Mac the wrong shortcut and that should be fixed ASAP.

The workaround in this change should display the correct Shortcut on Mac. 
I think Brian can confirm. Correct ?

Line:318, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Can you not get IBindingService injected?

@Inject IBindingService bindingService; as field should work.

Line:318, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> I would suggest to use DI to get IBindingService in this case.

Line:319, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Lets follow Brians suggestions here. Please also open a bug report for that the fact that getActiveBindingFor() returns null even though we have an active binding.
