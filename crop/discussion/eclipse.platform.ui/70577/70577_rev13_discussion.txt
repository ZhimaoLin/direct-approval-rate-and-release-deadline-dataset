Patch Set 13:

The only "drawback" is that if the user has different shortcuts for different scopes that we will not update this shortcut. But I think that scenario is really esoteric and it is better that we do not trigger updates all the time in the Quick Access field if the binding context is changing.

I merge that change so that we also see the correct keybinding on Mac (and not my hard-coded stuff). If Brian finds issues with this on Mac, we might have to revert the change but from his previous comments the old change seemed to have work for him and we have "only" changed the way we are listening to changes.
