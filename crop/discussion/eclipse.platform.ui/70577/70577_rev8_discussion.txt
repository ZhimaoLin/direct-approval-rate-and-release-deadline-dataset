A few things still

Line:367, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> You should reference the bug here.  But you should still use the IBindingService.getBestActiveBindingFor() here and only use your workaround if not found.  Because your workaround will not produce the right result when there are multiple bindings for the Quick Access in different contexts.

Line:396, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> I don't think "Quick Access ()" looks right when no binding is found

Lars' commit for 491312 should have introduced a new message for the "Quick Access ({0})" rather than replace the text for QuickAccessMessages.QuickAccess_EnterSearch as that text will have already been translated without the keybinding location.  So please restore QuickAccessMessages.QuickAccess_EnterSearch and use it in the case where there is no keybinding, and create a new message for the case with a keybinding.

> This works in Win an Linux.
 > I solved by searching in all contexts

I don't see the issue on Windows using IBindingService.getBestActiveBindingFor(). Opening and closing the dialog updates the QA text with the binding

And I'm unable to see the issue in Linux, where I also see the text properly updating.
