We should apply this to all other methods as well, but IMHO the current solution is not ambiguous.

Line:46, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/databinding/viewers/ViewerSupport.java -> Isn't it ambiguous, when having this method and the new one with varargs? I think this method should be removed then.
