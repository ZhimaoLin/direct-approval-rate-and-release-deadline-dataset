Patch Set 2:

I completely agree with you Brian, but the actuall cast was already present before this patch. So some functionality might depend on passing in the data from the given Dictionary or Map directly to the Event object.

That is true, but we didn't modify the dictionary/map.

So this patch is almost right except that it's now always creating a new dictionary/map.  Let's only create the dictionary/map when required, and avoid creating garbage unnecessarily
