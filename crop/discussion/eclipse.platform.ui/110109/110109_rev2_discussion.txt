Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

For a 1st iteration, since this bundle requires JDT and PDE to work well, I think it would be simpler to include it into eclipse.pde.ui.
Then, once it's working there, we can try to move the tests in the repo that's best for them (eclipse.platform.ui, eclipse.jdt.ui...)

Patch Set 2:

The failure says RedDeer is missing in the TP. It's a releng issue and we'll look at it.
