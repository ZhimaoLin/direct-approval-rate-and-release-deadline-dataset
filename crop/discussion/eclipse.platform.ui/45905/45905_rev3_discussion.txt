Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

The argument that convinced me is in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=256982#c9:
"
Lack of symmetry between FileEditorInput, which adapts to IFile, and FileStoreEditorInput which doesn't adapt to IFileStore, is troublesome and doesn't seem to have any rational justification.
