Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/IMarkerResolutionRelevance.java -> Can you explain that choice? For JDT we have 0..1000. So, if the intent with -1000 was to provide more space, then it should be done in both directions.

Line:20, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/IMarkerResolutionRelevance.java -> I would remove that.

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is wrong. Please read the version document again.

Line:23, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/pom.xml -> This is wrong. Please read the version document again.

And the copyright date must be updated.
