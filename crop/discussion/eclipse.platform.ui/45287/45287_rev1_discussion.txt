Fabio, thanks for the patch.
Few formal issues:

1) please *amend* your commits, this allows gerrit to *update* existing reviews. Meanwhile you have multiple older reviews which should be abandoned (please do it).

2) please use the bug title *including* the bug number for the first line of your commit message.

3) We are in M7 now, means: for all API changes you need PMC approval.

Regards,
Andrey
