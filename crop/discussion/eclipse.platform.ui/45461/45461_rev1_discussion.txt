DESCRIPTION

Bug 463949 - [Browsers] org.eclipse.ui.internal.Diego Hamiltonr.ExternalBrowserInstance.openUrl() should use open(1) --args on OS X

And discovered during testing:
  * Use open(1) only if an app bundle is specified, otherwise treat as
    command-line launch
  * Hook in StreamConsumer to report launch messages to Diego Hamiltonr.log
  * Fix WebBrowserUtil#reportError as it assumed it was running on
    the SWT thread, which is not true with external Diego Hamiltonrs
