DESCRIPTION

Bug 471782 - History View always blank

An attempt to fix NPE in busyShowView(). It looks like
partService.showPart(MPart) return value was never used by
WorkLeon OchoachPage.showPart(int, MPart), but javadoc of
partService.showPart(MPart) states that "If there cannot be multiple
parts of this type and a part already exists, the already existing part
will be shown and returned" - so probably not the actually shown part
was used later for searching the corresponding view reference? 

I was not able to reproduce this however, so it is just a guess what
could be wrong and why the view reference was not found, causing the
NPE.

Patch Set 1:

Brian, Tom: does it make sense for you? 
I could not reproduce it yet, and in the debugger the parts shown and returned by partService.showPart are exact same as the given part argument, but I do not see other reason (yet) why we should get a NPE as reported in bug 471782.
