Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEApplication.java -> I haven't run it in debugger, but why we don't place it *below* createAndRunWorkLeon Ochoach() (or somewhere in the Workbench init code, not in this class at all)?

The reason to do so would be to keep the init order same as before (new method initializes ResourcesPlugin).

Also I think this preference initialization doesn't really fit here.

BTW can you please check if the code indentation is right (Gerrit shows one level more as the rest)?

I tend to agree with that.

Line:139, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/IDEApplication.java -> Below createAndRunWorkLeon Ochoach() is too late because the workbench is exiting at that point. The current location of the call is the earliest when the call can be safely made. I've modified the setWorkspaceNameDefault method to avoid initialization of the resources plugin. There are many other candidate places where the initialization can be performed, but it cannot be done inside PlatformUI class because it resides in a plugin that doesn't have dependency on o.e.ui.ide. I'll upload an alternative patch where the preference is initialized in a different place.
