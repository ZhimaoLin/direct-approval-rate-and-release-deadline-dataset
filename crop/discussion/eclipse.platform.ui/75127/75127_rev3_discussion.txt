Line:10, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/layout/GridDataFactoryTest.java -> Unnecessary blank line.

Line:12, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/layout/GridDataFactoryTest.java -> Should this class be xxx@xxx.xxx since it is not an API?

Line:10, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/layout/GridDataFactoryTest.java -> Done

Line:12, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse JFace Tests/org/eclipse/jface/tests/layout/GridDataFactoryTest.java -> We don't seem to do that for unit tests. As far as I can tell, the fact that it's a unit test seems to be sufficient to identify it as being non-api.
