DESCRIPTION

Bug 491334 replace unneccessary comparison with result

In the situation where the value of the equal condition is null we have
a slector of type "E[foo]" which "Matches any E element with the
"foo" attribute set (whatever the value)." see [1].
But at the place of the unneccessary comparision a check using
hasAttribute already passed, in this way the result of the method is true.
