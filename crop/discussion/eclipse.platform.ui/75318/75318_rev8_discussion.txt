DESCRIPTION

Bug 495567 - allow "saveable" parts define dirty state behavior

Implementation for solution drafted in bug 495567 comment 18.

This patch makes the "dirty" state propagation behavior for Properties
view configurable. Per default, Properties view will not be "dirty".
After applying this patch bug 495567 can be considered as fixed.

To be backwards compatible, "dirty" state propagation behavior is
implemented as "opt-in": per default, framework do not shows the "dirty"
state for Properties view (or any of ISecondarySaveableSource
instances), even if the connected ISaveablePart is dirty. To do so, a
new interface "org.eclipse.ui.ISecondarySaveableSource" is added, which
implements isDirtyStateSupported() method and by default returns
"false".

PropertySheet implements this ISecondarySaveableSource interface now and
re-implements this in the way that it delegates the
isDirtyStateSupported() decision to the PropertySheetPage / connected
ISaveablePart. Therefore, if desired by a some tool/workflow, the
"dirty" state tracking of ISaveablePart can be enabled for Properties
view.

The default "false" can be changed to "true" by:
1) Contributing custom IPropertySheetPage implementation to the tracked
part and overriding getAdapter() to return custom
ISecondarySaveableSource.
2) Contributing custom ISecondarySaveableSource adapter to the tracked
part.
3) Contributing global IAdapterFactory which provides custom adapter to
ISecondarySaveableSource (not recommended, because if not properly
implemented this can affect unrelated code).

Looks good AFAICS. I guess we will need to verify this in various scenarios, but we will have some time I guess. :)
