Line:266, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workLeon Ochoach/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ReopenEditorMenu.java -> The additional checking fixes the NPE issue that can be reproduced in the following way:
1) Import project to the Eclipse
2) Open some resource of the project
3) The resource will be listed in the file menu. Next restart the Eclipse and remove the project added in the first step
4) Try to open the resource mentioned in the 3rd step from the file menu list. The warning dialog about invalid resource will be displayed (expected behaviour). 

Without this fix the Nullpointer exception is thrown. 

Unfortunately there is similar issue with deleting project  and invalid EditorReference that generates the NPE when the user tries to make active the editor with resource of deleted project after restarting the Eclipse (the issue is connected to skipping some actions when the EditorHistoryItem.isRestored function returns true). It will be fixed using separate bug.
