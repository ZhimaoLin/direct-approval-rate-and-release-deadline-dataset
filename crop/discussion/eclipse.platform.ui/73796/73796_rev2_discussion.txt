DESCRIPTION

Bug 494680 - Disable Window > Editor > Toggle Split Editor if no editor
active 

"Window > Editor > Toggle Split Editor" are now disabled if no editor is
selected. 

Removed default handler from the command and added a proper handler,
with an <enabled-when> tag, to enable the menu item only when an IEditor
is selected. 

I also removed an empty constructor from the Hander.
