DESCRIPTION

Make Quick Access (Ctrl+3) Extensible.

This commit introduces the IQuickAccessProvider and IQuickAccessElement
interfaces into the API. Further, the concept of matching is separated
from QuickAccessEntry into the new QuickAccessMatch class that is also
part of the public API (elements provide matches that are used to build
instances of QuickAccessEntry which remains private). Finally, a new
extension point is added that lets plug-ins contribute quick access
providers.

Patch Set 2:

I made a change to IQuickAccessProvider; instead of passing the MWindow and MApplication (as inspired by ViewProvider), I pass the the IEclipseContext to the providers instantiated by via the extension point.

The @since 4.5 is wrong: we don't use product numbers, but follow a well-defined versioning scheme. The version for the bundle has already been increased for 4.5, it's 3.107.0. Therefore it should xxx@xxx.xxx 3.107. The API filters aren't needed once you fix the since tags.

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162006#c12 also needs to be taken into account.

Detail: Please make sure the copyright date is updated to 2015 in all touched files.
