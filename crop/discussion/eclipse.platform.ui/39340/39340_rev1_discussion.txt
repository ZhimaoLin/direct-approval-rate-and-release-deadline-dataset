DESCRIPTION

Make Quick Access (Ctrl+3) Extensible.

This commit introduces the IQuickAccessProvider and IQuickAccessElement
interfaces into the API. Further, the concept of matching is separated
from QuickAccessEntry into the new QuickAccessMatch class that is also
part of the public API (elements provide matches that are used to build
instances of QuickAccessEntry which remains private). Finally, a new
extension point is added that lets plug-ins contribute quick access
providers.

Patch Set 1:

I've commented on the bug that I think a natural evolution of this is to pass the IEclipseContext to the providers instead of passing the MApplication and MWindow individually (I copied this pattern from the ViewProvider class). I'll upload an updated patch over the weekend.
