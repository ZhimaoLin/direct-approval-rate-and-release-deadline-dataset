DESCRIPTION

Bug 162006 - [QuickAccess] Make Ctrl-3 extensible

This commit introduces the IQuickAccessProvider and IQuickAccessElement
interfaces into the API. Further, the concept of matching is separated
from QuickAccessEntry into the new QuickAccessMatch class that is also
part of the public API (elements provide matches that are used to build
instances of QuickAccessEntry which remains private). Finally, a new
extension point is added that lets plug-ins contribute quick access
providers.
