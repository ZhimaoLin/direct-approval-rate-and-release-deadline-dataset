Looks good, but I think the bug reference is incorrect.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is this the correct bug number? I only a change in the dark theme based on the improved handling of section gradient from Bug 430205. Maybe we should open a new bug for this CSS change?

Patch Set 4:

In general I would agree, but in the subject "[dark theme]" is explicitly mentioned and therefore I think this Bug is suitable, isn't it?

Patch Set 4:

[dark theme] is our classification for bugs which manifest together with the dark theme. The description of the related bug must fit to the change. You find this [classification] widely used in platform.ui.

Please update the commit message with a valid bug reference.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I suggest to configure the field to use a solid color. I would assume the following works but I still see a gradient:

Section {
	background-color: #4F5355;
	color: #AEBED0;
	background-color-titlebar: #4F5355;
	background-color-gradient-titlebar: #4F5355;
	border-color-titlebar: #4F5355;
}

Patch Set 4: -Code-Review

Lets wait to merge 23565. Please already adjust this review to display a solid color for the section in the dark theme.
