DESCRIPTION

Bug 443483 - New action in the UI for adding a file

New 'Add Files...' action in Project Explorer context menu, next to
Import and Export actions. It is not a placeholder for Import -> File
System, but a shortcut for simple cases when the user wants to quickly
copy/link external files without going through the wizard. It opens a
dialog prompting for files, followed by the drag & drop file operation
dialog to specify how files should be imported into the project (copy or
link files).
