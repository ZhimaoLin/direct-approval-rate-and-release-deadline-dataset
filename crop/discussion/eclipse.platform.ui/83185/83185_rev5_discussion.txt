DESCRIPTION

Bug 501404 - Workspace save outside of locks

IDEWorkLeon OchoachAdvisor.disconnectFromWorkspace() deadlocks if called within
a workspace lock. Deadlock is caused by an attempt of background
ModalContext thread to acquire workspace lock, which is never released
by UI thread waiting for ModalContext to complete. This happened, for
example, when editor was in process of saving a resource.

To prevent deadlock, workspace-bound background operation is postponed
for later under such circumstances.
