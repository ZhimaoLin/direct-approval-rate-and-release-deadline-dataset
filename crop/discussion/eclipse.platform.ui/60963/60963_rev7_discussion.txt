Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

Unfortunately, this is a breaking change now since doReplace is API and has been API for some time. Any existing implementation of doReplace almost certainly worked around this design flaw by doing their own conversion within the doReplace method.

Any such implementation would be broken by this change.

The way I see it, we have two options here:

1. You can also work around this design flaw by doing your own conversion within the doReplace method of your custom update strategy.

or:

2. We can deprecate UpdateListStrategy and replace it with a new variant. ListBinding will accept both versions. Internally, it will only use one of the two and it will use an adapter to convert from one interface to the other.

...but I don't think API breakage is justified in this case.
