DESCRIPTION

Bug 491572 - Provide a shortcut for the full screen mode

The Shourcut Alt+F11 now is mapped with M3+F11, and it is limited to gtk
and win32, as in cocoa and carbon the keyb shortcut is already used.

Looks good to me. I leave it to Brian to give the final go for that change, as he did the Mac implementation

I added two shortcuts, one per platform

Line:1213, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.xml -> Please note I probably found a bug, as if I write platform="gtk,win32", the shortcut does not work anymore

Thanks, I was mislead by docs where I read withouth much attention: 
"For example, the following strings are considered valid: win32, gtk, motif, carbon and photon."

motif, carbon and photon are not supported since a while. Can you open a bug report to remove them from the docs?

I read the +1 from Brian as "go ahead and merge".
I wait a bit more to give Brian the chance to protest.
