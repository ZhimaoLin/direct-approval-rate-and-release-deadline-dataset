Looks good (haven't tested in debugger yet), and one question left, see below.

Line:51, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/nested/NestedProjectsContentProvider.java -> Why is this needed? The listener is attached to POST_CHANGE only.

Line:51, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/nested/NestedProjectsContentProvider.java -> See "resourceChanged". It's need on PRE_DELETE as well because once a project is deleted, I didn't find a way to retrieve the parent to refresh. The getLocation or other fields of the change or deleted project on a POST_CHANGE return null, making it impossible to compute parent.
