Patch set 9: I've simplified refresh: if we do a full refresh, we don't need to do any other refreshes.

I may have found a corner case that fails with this patch (and with previous ones most likely): From a project such as jbosstools-arquillian, if one deletes "bundles". "features" and "tests" projects simultaneously, it seems like not all children are shown under the folders.

Works fine here.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review+1

I've checked again few times: all examples are working. What is interesting, is that I see the order of elements changes after the projects are removed and folders are shown instead. The re-appearing folders are always added at the end of all other, previously existed siblings. I think this is a minot issue.

Patch Set 9: Verified-1

Yes, the order of the elements feels randomish (because of sorting by type and also by SCM "dirtyness"), but I agree it's a minor issue.
I tried again the test of mentioned earlier and still cannot see the children of one of the folders after delecting two "intermediary" nodes at once. I've made a screencast: http://www.screencast.com/t/O4ePlqziY7K

xxx@xxx.xxx can you reproduce the scenario of the video?

Mickael, I can't access the video neither on Win 7 nor on RHEL7. It requires Windows Media Player to be installed...

Patch Set 9:

Dumb site. It's just a good old .avi, no need to require Windows Media Player... Anyway, I enabled a download link on this same page (in the Details, beside name and size of the file). You can try to download it and watch it with regular media player on any OS.
