Patch Set 6:

When deleting a project, the PRE_DELETE event is triggered first, then the POST_CHANGE happens later. So the refresh only needs to happen on POST_CHANGE.

Mickael, if the last patch is good for you, I'm OK too.

Patch Set 6: Verified-1

Hierarchical project views seems to be completely failing with patch set #6 here.
Here is what I tried:
* Check out patch set locally
* Start a new workspace
* File > Open Projects... selecting eclipse.platform.resources and importing all
* Move Project Layout to flat.

With Patch Set #6, the nested project aren't even shown at all. An exception I see is java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
	at java.util.TreeMap$NavigableSubMap$SubMapIterator.nextEntry(TreeMap.java:1699)
	at java.util.TreeMap$NavigableSubMap$SubMapEntryIterator.next(TreeMap.java:1747)
	at java.util.TreeMap$NavigableSubMap$SubMapEntryIterator.next(TreeMap.java:1741)
	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.nested.NestedProjectManager.hasDirectChildrenProjects(NestedProjectManager.java:211)

With Patch Set #4, nested project are shown, deleting the eclipse.platform.resources/tests project replaces it with a folder immediatly.
