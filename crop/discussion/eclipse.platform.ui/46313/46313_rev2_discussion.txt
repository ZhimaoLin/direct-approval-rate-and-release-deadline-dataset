DESCRIPTION

Bug 443174: Make default skipTests to false

Plugins that cannot run exclude themselves from execution, but default
behaviour when not overriden is to run the tests, as Maven best practices
and common usage dictates.

Patch Set 2:

There are currently two patches for the same ticket in Gerrit. What about this one? Is this still valid and needs review or should it be abandoned? In case it is still valid, it needs to be rebased. Maybe some manual tasks are necessary in order to solve merge conflicts.

Patch Set 2:

I believe the other Gerrit patch is about eclipse.platform.runtime (the issue was filed against Releng and requires 1 patch for each Eclipse repo).
The other one about eclipse.platform.ui was abandoned some days ago.
