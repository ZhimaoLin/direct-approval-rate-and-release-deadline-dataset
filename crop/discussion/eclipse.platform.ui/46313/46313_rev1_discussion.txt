DESCRIPTION

Bug 443174: Make default skipTests to false

Plugins that cannot run exclude themselves from execution, but default
behaviour when not overriden is to run the tests, as Maven best practices
and common usage dictates.

Nope, it doesn't require a change in the master pom. You'll see with Hudson build reports that the same amount of tests should run, without changing the command-line.

@Lars: Please read my last comment on that old patch. It doesn't require change in parent pom, and it's totally safe to merge it.
The sooner the better as whenever one makes a test plugin work with Tycho, the patch becomes out of date.

I'm OK to merge this one, if you manually rebase it.
