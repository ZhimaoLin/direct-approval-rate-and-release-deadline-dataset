DESCRIPTION

Allow pluggable API's to register bucket specific privileges

We should allow users to register privilege types that apply to
specific buckets. This will allow the permissions module to handle
updating privilges when buckets are added/removed and means that
pluggable API's don't need to update the permissions list themselves.
