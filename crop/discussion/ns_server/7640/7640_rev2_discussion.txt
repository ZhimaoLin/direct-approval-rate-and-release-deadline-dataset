Patch Set 2: Verified

Alk, thanks for the quick feedback. I hadn't tested this thoroughly enough.

The latest patch, however, is much more battle tried. The code's essentially the same, just checking the correct object for the concat thing and assigning newSamples the current samples output available.

That said, I think more could be done to handle missing prevSamples...just not sure what all the fail scenarios for this are. Hopefully this handles the core case(s).

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

this is essentially what I tried first. And it doesn't work very well when after upgrade set of supported stats is extended. This change leads to stats graph scrolling from left to right rather then other way around for new stats.

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

this needs to be abandoned. My guess about cause of this was definitely wrong. And we cannot 'fix' without understanding it.
