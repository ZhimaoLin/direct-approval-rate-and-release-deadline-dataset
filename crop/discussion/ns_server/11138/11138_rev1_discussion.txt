DESCRIPTION

use "Starting Up" string for undefined replication status

Right after POST-ing replication document we don't have any status due
to replication manager needing some time to notice it and start
replication. In this period of time replication status is
undefined. Thus we report undefined as "Starting Up".

There may be some other reasons for undefined status, but those should
be nearly impossible in practice, so doing what we do is fine.
