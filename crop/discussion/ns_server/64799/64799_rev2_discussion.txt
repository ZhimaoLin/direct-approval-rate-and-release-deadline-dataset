DESCRIPTION

MB-19752 do not remove read-only user account when setting admin user

I decided not to check if the admin and roadmin user names match because:

1. We won't be able to do it for LDAP user
2. During the login the admin user is checked first, so whoever comes
   with this common name will get full admin access. Which makes this
   situation not harmful and easily correctable.
