DESCRIPTION

MB-6060: weakly set cluster_compat to undefined when joining

Given that static config has cluster_compat_version set to latest
version, we really need to 'reset' it as part of joining to lower
version clusters. Use of set_initial has desired effect of preventing
conflict with 2.0+ value of this config variable.
