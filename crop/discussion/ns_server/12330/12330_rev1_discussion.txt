DESCRIPTION

Split single_bucket_sup into two supervisors.

So now there is a separate supervisor for ns_memcached and all the
processes that depend on it. On the other hand capi_set_view_manager
and capi_ddoc_replication_srv are independent of each other and
ns_memcached_sup. Thus it's valid to use one_for_one restart
strategy. With this change some transient crash in, for instance,
capi_set_view_manager does not compel stats_reader and friends to
restart.
