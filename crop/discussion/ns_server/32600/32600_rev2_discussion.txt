DESCRIPTION

MB-9945: Set correct UPR port in ./cluster_run

The couchdb component needs to know on which port it can
find UPR. It's the same port as memcached runs on.

This change can be merged on the master branch as an
additional setting shouldn't do any harm if it's not
used.

would be even nicer if you could update capi.ini as well

Patch Set 2:

Alk: an update to capi.ini is not needed as it is set in the default couchdb configuration. But I should update that configuration as it currently points to port 12000.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

I've verified it locally. I've also enabled the Jenkins jobs to run testrunner tests on the UPR branch (which use ./cluster_run). This means that on the next commit to the couchdb upr branch (changing the default port to 11210) we'll have a full verification that everything went smooth.

Someone from the ns_server team please merge it if you're OK with everything.
