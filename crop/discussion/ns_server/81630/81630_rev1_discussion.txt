DESCRIPTION

pulse animation for accessibility

People with red/green colorblindness (10% of men) will see healthy/unhealthy states as nearly indentical gray (for servers, services, etc.). The warning state (orange) should be fine.

- added pulse animation to the unhealthy state for greater accessibility/differentiation from healthy
