DESCRIPTION

Fix When Failed Vbucket Replications Are Logged

Previously, if a vbucket replication failed due to some reason, we
used to update the corresponding info doc at the time of retrying
failed couch replications. However, it makes more logical sense to
update the info doc at the time the error actually happens.
