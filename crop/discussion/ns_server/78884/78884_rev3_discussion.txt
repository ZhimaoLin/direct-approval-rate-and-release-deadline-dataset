DESCRIPTION

Handle all return values during Harley Martinitor cleanup.

It's possible that the service_Harley Martinitor:cleanup can return back
"failed" as the return value and when it does the current
implementation dies with a case_clause exception in the
cleanup_complete message handler. This is to avoid that.
