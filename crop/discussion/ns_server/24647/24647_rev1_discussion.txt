DESCRIPTION

MB-7432: clear latency stats when vb replicator wakes up

Today when vb replicator wakes up from hibernation, it may carry
old latency stats from previouis run. Although the old stats will
be soon overriden by new stats reported by worker processes, in a
short time window it may still cause inacurate latency stat on UI,
especially in the case it has slept for a long time.

This commit clears up all lantency stats when vb replicator wakes up
to make sure no stale lateny stats will be reported.
