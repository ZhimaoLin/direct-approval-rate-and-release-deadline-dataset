DESCRIPTION

Bug 1829: Set node to inactiveAdded when adding.

I can't figure out why we're leaving membership turds in the config,
so as an interim solution we explicitly set the membership when we add
the node.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I think we need to remove all per-node config of node being ejected out of cluster. That'll fix the issue. (And probably a number of other potential issues caused by that). But it's probably a bit too late for that.
