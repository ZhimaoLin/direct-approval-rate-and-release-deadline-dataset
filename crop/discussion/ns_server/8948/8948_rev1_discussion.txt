DESCRIPTION

don't keep-alive http connections that trap exits

In join-related requests that can restart mochiweb we're trapping
exits so that shutdown of mochiweb doesn't close our connection
prematurely.

But with newer mochiweb it also leads to problems performing same
requests again when connection is reused (as httpc apparently
does). This likely happens because of 'EXIT' messages that are left on
process mailbox.

So we'll just close connection after such request is performed, which
is perfectly legal HTTP server behavior.
