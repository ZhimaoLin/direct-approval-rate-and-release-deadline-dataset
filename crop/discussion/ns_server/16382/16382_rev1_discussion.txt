DESCRIPTION

Use vbucket-detail instead of hash stats for /diag/vbucket

hash is a very invasive stat that counts all items and records their
depths and sizes vs. tracked sizes to verify consistency and stuff.

Patch Set 1:

Farshid checked the 1.8 branch and apparently this stat didn't exist then.
