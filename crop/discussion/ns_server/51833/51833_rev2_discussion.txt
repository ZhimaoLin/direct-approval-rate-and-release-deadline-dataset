DESCRIPTION

MB-14844 Don't support tlsv1.

Erlang SSL is vulnerable to TLS POODLE attack. It was fixed in r18
branch:
  https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/e53c55dd0ab69982bc511396ccf8655d27c6d38c

Our simplest option is to not support tlsv1 (higher tls version
require padding check and I verified that erlang code indeed does
check it).
