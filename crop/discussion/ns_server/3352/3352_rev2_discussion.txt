DESCRIPTION

Don't delete destination vbuckets before transferring them

Deleting them and then dumping a lot of data into them can cause a
memory overrun because persistence is currently blocked during
deletion.

This will result in deleted data's possibly being resurrected if the
deletes occur during rebalance and a transfer is retried, or just
before rebalance and a vbucket master is moved on top of a previous
replica.
