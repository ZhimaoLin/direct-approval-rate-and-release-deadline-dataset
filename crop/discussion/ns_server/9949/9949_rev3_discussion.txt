Patch Set 3: Verified

I can split out the jQuery UI CSS file if you like. It's in the later commit as that's the first commit that uses the CSS changes. Slider isn't used anywhere (until the next commit), so I kept the UI CSS updates there instead of here.

I can change, that, though as the slider CSS additions won't effect anything.

Not sure it's worth the academic effort (now that the next commits layout issue is fixed), but let me know if you want it split out.
