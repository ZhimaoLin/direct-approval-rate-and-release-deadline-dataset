DESCRIPTION

MB-8726: implemented terse bucket details REST API

And facility to cache those terse bucket details.

New url endpoints are /pools/default/b/<bucket-name> and
/pools/default/bs/<bucket-name>. The later is streaming one.

New endpoints are HATEOAS-discoverable. /pools/details now contain
buckets.terseBucketsBase (and terseStramingBucketsBase
correspondingly) field. That field advertises "prefix" to terse bucket
details urls: /pools/default/b/. HATEAOS client needs to append bucket
name to this string and it'll get path to GET in order to receive
terse bucket details (or streaming bucket details
correspondingly). Such approach of avoiding buckets list request
shortens bootstrap and enables mega-buckets concept.

This bucket details response contains "useful" subset of fields of
usual bucket details response. I.e. it only contains fields that
matter for smart clients and omits everything else. Response is
exactly same as output from CCCP-aware memcached on not-my-vbucket
condition. Notable difference is that it also works for memcached
buckets.

Only major difference with parsing existing bucket details, is that in
order to send same output as CCCP-aware memcached, ns_server does not
replace 127.0.0.1 in hostname fields with address that's serving
xxx@xxx.xxx marker string is sent instead of 127.0.0.1. So hostname
would be "@@:9000" and couchApiBase - xxx@xxx.xxx Clients
are expected to be smart enough to perform that replacement.

Here's how typical terse bucket details look:

{
    "name": "default",
    "nodes": [
        {
            "couchApiBase": "http://chi.local:9500/default",

            "ports": {
                "proxy": 12001,
                "direct": 12000
            }
        },
        {
            "couchApiBase": "http://chi.local:9501/default",
            "hostname": "chi.local:9001",
            "ports": {
                "proxy": 12003,
                "direct": 12002
            }
        }
    ],
    "nodeLocator": "vbucket",
    "uuid": "ba07a6a720a2631279d743081d5ce2fd",
    "bucketCapabilitiesVer": "",
    "bucketCapabilities": [
        "touch",
        "couchapi"
    ],
    "ddocs": {
        "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/default/ddocs"
    },
    "vBucketServerMap": {
        "hashAlgorithm": "CRC",
        "numReplicas": 1,
        "serverList": [
            "chi.local:12000",
            "chi.local:12002"
        ],
        "vBucketMap": [
            [
                0,
                1
            ],
            [
                0,
                1
            ], ....
        ]
    }
}
