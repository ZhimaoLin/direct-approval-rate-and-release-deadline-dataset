DESCRIPTION

[bp] ns_pubsub:subscribe_link uses intermediate process.

With pure gen_event handler the subscriber must handle gen_event_EXIT
messages properly. And it's pretty easy to forget about this. In such
a case a crash inside a handler will be ignored. And depending on the
subscriber it can leave it in non-functional state. Thus we introduce
an intermediate process between subscriber and gen_event which handles
this. And if something wrong happens to a handler it exits with
non-normal reason. And this will also terminate the subscriber.

NOTE: if the subscriber sets trap_exit to true then it still needs to
handle EXIT messages from intermediate process.
