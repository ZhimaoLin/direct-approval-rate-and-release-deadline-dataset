Hi Anders,

I am wondering if we can simplify a bit by leveraging some existing code to easily identify the  "Kind" for the stat. 

E.g.  base_stats_directory() is a directory of all stats that is displayed by the analytics page.
serve_specific_ui_stats() returns "not found" if the stat is not found in base_stats_directory().
Except for the stats under "Summary" I think, in most cases the "blockName" should provide a hint for the Kind.

Can you please check if it is easy to leverage base_stats_directory() to get the info we need?

Poonam
