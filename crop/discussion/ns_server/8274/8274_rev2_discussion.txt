DESCRIPTION

WIP: document editing UI

Basic JS and HTML for getting into the new sections (with some
copy/paste from Views...so there is cleanup/removal/changes to be
made there).

Also (and most importantly) there's HTML in the Document Edit screen
which shows an HTML serialization of a complex JSON document. The
format is based on the re:form.ed editor:
http://bigbluehat.github.com/reformed/

The HTML is not a direct map of that, but an improvement. The JS
should implement the serialization and the basic features of
re:form.ed (add key/value pairs, objects, arrays, and array members).
