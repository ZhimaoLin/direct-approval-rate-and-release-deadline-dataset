Patch Set 20:

There are some TODO's left on this

IOCenter intercepts all the http requests that return error codes and I couldnt find a way to stop it doing that. So the error conditions wont work until thats stopped.

And all_docs isnt correctly invalidated when documents are deleted, which leaves stale documents in the list on deletion

today I only have time to skim through.

So far opposed to jquery couch inclusion. We don't need this beast. Seemingly.
