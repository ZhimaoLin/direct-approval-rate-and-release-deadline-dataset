DESCRIPTION

WIP: document editing UI

Basic JS and HTML for getting into the new sections (with some
copy/paste from Views...so there is cleanup/removal/changes to be
made there).

The focus is on shipping a CodeMirror based editor for the JSON
code which matches the functionality of the Sample Docs editor
in the Views section.
