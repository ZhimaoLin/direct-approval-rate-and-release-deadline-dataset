Patch Set 21: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Had more time on this pass.

You likely referred not to IOCenter but to default error handler. Which can be overriden if needed.

Even more opposed to jquery.couch. Why do we need it at all ? We have tiny internal couch CRUD client that's correctly integrated to IOCenter (and thus correctly handles loss of network).

docs can be reloaded by calling #invalidate on list of all docs.

Pagination is missing.
