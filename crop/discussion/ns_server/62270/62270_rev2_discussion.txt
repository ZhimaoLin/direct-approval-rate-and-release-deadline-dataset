DESCRIPTION

MB-17493: display initial doc content in doc list view

This change adds the document content back in the list view. However,
the content is not put through the futon pretty print routine, which does
a pleasing job from a colorization perspective but is very slow on
documents of moderate size (200 KB) -- easy to check in the old UI.

So, right now I just stringify the JSON (or the binary data) and
show the initial characters in uncolorized monospaced font and
there's no noticeable delay in rendering multiplie large documents
in the UI.
