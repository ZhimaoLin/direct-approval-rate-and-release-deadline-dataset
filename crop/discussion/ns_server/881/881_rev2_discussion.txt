Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I think writing extra function for such simple thing is a bit overkill. But we can rename 'verbose' to something like extra_engine_params to better reflect it's semantics.

Patch Set 2:

It can only hold one parameter, though. I think it's fine to translate erlang proplists to command line options without leaking command-line-specific stuff up into the config.
