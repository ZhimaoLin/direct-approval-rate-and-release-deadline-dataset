Patch Set 20:

- "Yes" under Filtered doesn't show tooltip
- If you click "pause" button the spinner spins much longer than on old UI
- If you unpause in the other window, the status keeps being "Paused" for quite a while. In old UI works almost instantly, same with adding/deleting replications

The old UI seems to be more responsive to the changes on server.


Test key entered in old UI as aaa and stored locally appears in the new UI as ["aaa"]

Enter regex: abc key: dddabcdddd
When you focus on Filter Expression control the UI shows Match
When you focus on Test Key control, the UI shown No Match

Patch Set 20:

"Yes" under Filtered doesn't show tooltip
 - tooltip will be implemented separately. I will add this note in the commit description.

The old UI seems to be more responsive to the changes on server.
- as it turned out mnHttp should be improved in order to provide proper order of queries. I'm going to do appropriate changes today

Issue with Match/No Match will be fixed also
