This change contains following bug fixes:

- catch errors from error callback of POST settings/replications/

This change does not consider features for compatibility
mode and enterprise edition. whenGoxdcrEnabled should be replaced
during implementation of appropriate functionality. Also this change
has no tooltip on regex because tooltip will be implemented along with
"what's this".
