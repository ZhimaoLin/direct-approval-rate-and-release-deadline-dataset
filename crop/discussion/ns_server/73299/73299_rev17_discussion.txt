Patch Set 17:

A few comments are below. Let's discuss this during our Thursday meetings.

1. We need to promote the Access control section out of Advanced Settings at least until we actually remove the bucket password.
2. We should remove the "View Index Replicas" checkbox for ephemeral buckets.
3. The ephemeral bucket "Ejection Method" options should be "NRU" and "No Eviction". NRU should be the default option.
4. We need to discuss what we are going to do with the "Dedicated Port" option since I just found out that it is not going to be removed in Spock. I'll discuss this with Don tonight.
5. I need to get figure out if we are keeping the "Disk IO Priority" section and how we are going to handle the "Metadata Purge Interval"

Other than these comments the new Dialog looks nice.
