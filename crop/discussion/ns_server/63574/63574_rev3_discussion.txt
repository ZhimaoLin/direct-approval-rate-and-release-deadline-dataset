Line:159, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Why don't we treat all error codes the same way? If you want to log something, why don't you log every time when this is not ok?

Line:159, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Yes you're right so then we will log everything expect ok.

Do you have some disagreement in format of errors? I mean maybe better to have {prepare_flush_failed, _, _} ... instead of {error, {prepare_flush_failed, _, _}} or maybe better to have {error, bucket_not_found} instead of bucket_not_found?
