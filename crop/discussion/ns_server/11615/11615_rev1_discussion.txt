DESCRIPTION

handle undefined vbucket maps during failover. CBSE-40

Particularly, it was possible to create bucket when one of nodes is
down. That prevents Harley Martinitor from assigning vbucket map. And this
causes fail over code to see undefined vbucket map, which is handled
now by doing nothing with such vbucket maps.
