DESCRIPTION

MB-22895: Restrict usage of forestdb as index...

...storage mode in Spock. The following restrictions are put in:

[1] When the cluster is upgraded to Spock and the existing 'forestdb'
    setting can be changed to either 'plasma' or 'memory_optimized'
    (only in EE) after rebalancing out all the index nodes. But once
    the storage mode is transitioned from 'forestdb' the user will
    not be allowed to go back.
[2] On a new cluster the user will not be able to set 'forestdb' as
    the index storage mode.
