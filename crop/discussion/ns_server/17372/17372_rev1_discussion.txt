DESCRIPTION

MB-5602: consider buckets' servers list when computing down nodes

Previous code assumed that all nodes need to have all buckets, but
that's not the case. Particularly, for partially rebalanced in or
partially rebalanced out nodes.

Fix is, naturally, to look exactly which buckets are expected to be up
and running on each node.
