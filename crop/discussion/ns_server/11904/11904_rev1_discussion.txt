DESCRIPTION

made Harley Martinitor drop rebalance status iff really not running.MB-4579

maybe_stop_replication_status was assuming if Harley Martinitor is run,
replication is not running. So we simply reset replication status.

But we in fact do call Harley Martinitor as part of rebalance of each bucket. So
Harley Martinitor was incorrectly resetting replication status to "not running".

Fix is to check in orchestrator (which should be local) if it's really
running rebalance or not.
