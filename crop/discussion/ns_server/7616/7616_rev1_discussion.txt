Patch Set 1: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

you cannot use erlang's otpNode as DOM id: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077084/what-characters-are-allowed-in-dom-ids

And logic that combines rebalance progress rendering and rest of rendering fails for node being rebalanced out.
