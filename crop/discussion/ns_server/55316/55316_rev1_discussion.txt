DESCRIPTION

MB-16159 Avoid excessive pattern matches on huge mutations.

Pattern matching breaks erlang's binary append optimization, so for each
append new binary will have to be allocated and both original binaries
copied to the new one. Which is both slow and puts a lot of pressure on
garbage collector.

I think we need to move mc_replication:process_data back to ebucketmigrator_srv if we not using it here. So after ebucketmigrator_srv will be removed it won't become dead code.

Patch Set 1:

One more note: for ?DCP_MUTATION we shouldn't really append the data into one buffer. We can proxy the chunk without collecting the whole thing together.

Patch Set 1:

That's exactly what my other change was about. But it's not as simple as you might think because both dcp_producer_conn and dcp_consumer_conn write to the consumer socket.
