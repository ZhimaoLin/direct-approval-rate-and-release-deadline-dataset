Patch Set 5:

In stats_collector.transform_xdc_stats, there is code that computes TotalChangesLeft based on "changes_left" from individual nodes. The code also refers to "docs_rep_queue", but hardcodes it to 0, assumbly because this is an important stats but old xdcr does not yet support it. goxdcr does provide docs_rep_queue stats. Should we compute TotalDocsRepQueue here as well? 

transform_xdc_stats(XDCStats) ->
{RepStats, TotalChangesLeft} = transform_xdc_stats_loop(XDCStats, [], 0),
GlobalList = [{<<"replication_changes_left">>, TotalChangesLeft},
{<<"replication_docs_rep_queue">>, 0}],

The computation of TotalDocsRepQueue is already done in the following code review.

YU, we do compute it in goxdcr_stats_collector.erl
stats_collector does not collect stats from goxdcr
