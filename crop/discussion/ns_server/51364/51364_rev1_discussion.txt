Line:1307, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I don't think nanoseconds is a useful measurement for index scans. Can we display this through the stats as milliseconds? If this is something that the indexer should do then it might be good to have them make the change.

Please see Dave's comment on the ticket. We need to get the unit in the stat title, not the description that is visible only on hover over.

Actually Dave wants both. But please refer to the ticket for the wording.
