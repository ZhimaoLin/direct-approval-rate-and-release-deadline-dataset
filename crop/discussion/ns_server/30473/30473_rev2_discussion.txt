Looks good, just a minor question about default parameters.

Line:15, src/memcached_clients_pool.erl -> The upper bound of max_concurrent_reps is 256, so looks like 200 is not enough. It is better to make it configurable.

Also I am not sure 30 secs is a reasonable timeout for XDCR.  Currently the default connection_timeout is 180 secs.
