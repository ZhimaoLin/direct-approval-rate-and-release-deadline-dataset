DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Don't use couch_config where it makes no sense.

Particularly:
  1. don't ask for replicator db name because in many places we just
  assume its name is _replicator anyway
  2. currently our replications are always continuous and xdcr code
  doesn't even bother to check the value of 'continuous' parameter; so
  I got rid of it too

Patch Set 2:

On _replicator:

*) some code will actually break if we rename this

*) there's no need to rename it

*) there's possibility we'll move away from couchdb database for storing this altogether
