DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Don't use couch_config where it makes no sense.

Particularly:
  1. don't ask for replicator db name because in many places we just
  assume its name is _replicator anyway
  2. currently our replications are always continuous and xdcr code
  doesn't even bother to check the value of 'continuous' parameter; so
  I got rid of it too

I am not sure this is correct, what if db has a different name other than _replicator in future?   You encoded the rep db name in XDCR, which seems not a good coding behavior. 

Also, current code should have no impact to ns_server performance.

Patch Set 1:

if the database name is anything other than _replicator the old code will crash at this line:

<<"_replicator">> = ?l2b(couch_config:get("replicator", "db",		
	71	"_replicator")),

Patch Set 1:

Yes, current code always assumes dbname = "_replicator", which  need to be modified or removed.  

But IMHO it is incorrect to encode "_replicator" later in ensure_rep_db_exists().

Patch Set 1:

I think it is highly confusing if one part of the code assumes something and another part doesn't. Since we are not planning to remove this assumption anytime soon I suggest to keep it consistent.
