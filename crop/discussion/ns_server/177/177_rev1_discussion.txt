DESCRIPTION

/node/controller/license renamed to /node/controller/settings

The /node/controller/settings POST is meant to handle both
license, ip-addr, and port-number changes.

This allows the JS/UI to do one REST post during screen MA.2.1.

And, during the initialization configuration wizard screens,
the license change screen and ip address change screen will
be handled by 2 different POST's to /node/controller/settings
