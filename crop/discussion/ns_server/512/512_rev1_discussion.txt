DESCRIPTION

Using ns_config:search_node() to allow gen_cluster_scripts to work

The new ns_config:search_node() functions search for node-specific
keys first, before trying the usual straight keys.  This allows the
test/gen_cluster_scripts.rb to work again.  So
test/gen_cluster_scripts.rb can generate a config file to allow
multiple-nodes to run on a single development box, for faster
development.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

works and looks ok, although moxi eats almost all CPU and but not all and triggers not very pleasant linux CPU scheduler behavior. There is also undefined-{1,2,3,4}.sqlite files in root dir of project, which could mean that ./gen_cluster_script config is not 100% complete.
