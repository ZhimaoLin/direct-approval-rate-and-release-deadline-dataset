Line:241, src/menelaus_metakv.erl -> In my view, metakv is a generic metadata store which could be used in future by non-XDCR consumers. "/ckpt" is XDCR specific. 
Ideally, metakv should not be exposed to internal details of a key (e.g. /ckpt...) used by a specific consumer (e.g. XDCR).

Instead of metakv parsing for "/ckpt" to decide whether to replicate or not, would it be better if the consumer (XDCR) passed "should_replicate" as one of the parameters in the request? goxdcr can set should_replicate to false while setting checkpoints.

Line:241, src/menelaus_metakv.erl -> I'm not sure if we want goxdcr to make a decision of what to replicate. Especially considering that it makes possible to replicate and not to replicate the same keys at the same time on different nodes.
And I was under impression that metakv is a temporary hack, while we don't have another storage. And it's definitely a temporary hack for the checkpoints.

And we basically agreed to do the ugly customizations in metakv layer.

So if you guys want to change that and have some other convention, I don't mind. But let's make it final.

Line:241, src/menelaus_metakv.erl -> Ok with me, if this is temp hack for checkpoints.
