DESCRIPTION

MB-21616 pass password to mcstats, cbstats and mctimings via env var

Note: passing password via stdin in platform independednt way seems to
be quite problematic if the utility prints anything to stdout before
waiting for stdin. So by now let's pass it via env and may be get back
to it in Spock.next
