Line:92, src/capi_replication.erl -> Unfortunately I don't know how we form a revision for deleted items and if it possible to have the same revision for deleted item in one cluster and non-deleted item in another cluster. But if it's possible then if the item is deleted in our cluster and non-deleted in the remote cluster, then we won't ask to replicate it. But according to do_update_replicated_doc_loop non-deleted item from the remote cluster must actually be preferred in this case.

Patch Set 1:

Thanks a lot for spotting this.

And I can see now that old code did not have same problem. But thinking about this more I think we still have issue here.

Lets assume true remote 'meta' is {10, non-deleted, SomethingSmall}
and true local 'meta' is {10, deleted, SomethingBig}. So we want to prefer remote. But get_missing_revs is can't be sure about that due to missing deletedness.

So code will see that ({10, SomethingBig} < {10, SomethingSmall}) is false and return 'no I don't need this rev'. Incorrectly
