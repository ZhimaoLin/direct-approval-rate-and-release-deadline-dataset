DESCRIPTION

MB-25542 recovery mechanism for corrupted users.dets file

Currently if users.dets will get corrupted, the node won't be
able to start

Lets do few attempts to open and if all of them fail rename file
to some unique name and start from clean slate.

On more than one node clusters users.dets should be repopulated
with users from other nodes.
