Line:333, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> This doesn't make sense. Calling list_to_existing_atom and then in case of badarg calling list_to_atom is an equivalent of simple calling list_to_atom.

The whole idea of using list_to_existing_atom is not to allow number of atoms to grow infinitely, since it is limited in erlang. By calling list_to_atom you actually create new atom for each string passed, which can result in the number of atoms in the app to go over the limit.

Line:333, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> What is StatName? Is it really something that is changing randomly , so that there is a risk of overflowing the atom table, or is it member of a small fixed set of predefined statistics in the system?

Line:333, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> It is a parameter in REST call, therefore user input. So yes, list_to_atom should not be used.

Line:333, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I am not sure if there is really a true raw stat. 
I was planning to ask Aliaksey. Do you know? 

In my testing, I have not come across one. They are either simple stat or computed stat. 

To grab a specific ui stat say “stat1”, the existing code calls get_samples_from_one_of_kind() and iterates thru each kind – system, query, index, bucket … 
For each kind, it grabs all stats for that kind. If “stat1” is not one of them then it goes to the next kind in the list.
If stat1 is a computed stat, then it will show up as raw stat  when it is currently iterating thru the wrong kind.

In a later commit, I am planning to look into the " get_samples_from_one_of_kind()” and see if we can optimize it -  i.e not iterate thru the wrong kinds.

In the mean time, I will replace list to atom with “all” for raw stat. So, that
we do not end up creating new atoms. With "all", the code will gather all stats  for a raw stat - same as what it does today.

Line:333, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Can we just pass StatName for raw stat instead of atom?
