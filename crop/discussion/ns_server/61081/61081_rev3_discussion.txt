Line:552, cbcollect_info -> The indentation is wrong. And also still believe it can be significantly simplified by introducing a helper function for making index-specific task.

Line:552, cbcollect_info -> Will fix the indentation. However, most arguments need to be passed even if I make a new helper function. Args like name, port and password need to be sent to helper function. I can one improvement to put password in variable and use that in invocations of make_curl_task
