Line:550, cbcollect_info -> A minor thing is that it's not really a "template"; rather it's more of a base url. You could convert it to a template as follows:

url_template = 'http://127.0.0.1:%s/%%s/' % index_port

and then inline you can write: url_template % 'getIndexStatus'

Would you mind changing it to a template or renaming it to base_url?

Line:577, scripts/dump-guts -> Line is too long. Would you mind changing to span multiple lines as follows:

Candidates = [{n1ql, query_port, 8093}, 
                       {index, indexer_http_port, 9102}, 
                       {kv, projector_port, 9999}, 
                       {fts, fts_http_port, 8094}],
