I think the right way to deal with that is etags and If-None-Match request header: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.26

Custom revision parameter will also do, probably.

Patch Set 1:

I understand how etags are used for concurrency control, but we cannot do reliable concurrency control due to distributed nature of user storage. Not sure how we can use them to solve the problem of accidentally updating existent user.

My understanding of the problem is:
1. UI caches only one page of users
2. Somebody clicks "Add" button with intention to add the new one
3. Request should be rejected if user already exists

> but we cannot do reliable concurrency control due to distributed nature of user storage

But that's also the case with your patch, isn't it? Basically, I don't think resource semantic should change depending on with http method is used. 

Generally, I think we use POST incorrectly in certain places. POST is supposed to correspond to a process, whereas PUT should correspond to updating a resource. Occasionally we use POST for the latter.

OK. I guess before continuing with this ticket I need to update my understanding of what Pavel actually wants to do with this API. And why simply doing GET before PUT is not sufficient if we cannot address concurrency issue anyways.
