Manik: 

Thanks for submitting. Big comment is you should break this into 2 separate changes. (1) the changes to the memcached configuration and (2) the new top level ns_config key indicating that the cluster should support client certs. 

More detailed comments inline.

Also: 2 more things. There are a lot of changes going on at the moment. Can you:
(1) rebase this and the memcached patch to be more up to date
(2) provide the instructions on how to test end to end

Line:389, src/menelaus_web.erl -> These changes should be part of the second patch - the memcached config changes should come first. 

Please change this name to "clientCertAuth" as this more correctly captures what the config key represents and I'd prefer to avoid the term "SSL" as it has been superseded.

Line:42, src/menelaus_web_mcd_settings.erl -> client_cert_auth

Line:28, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> move all the changes in this file to the second patch

Line:239, src/ns_config_default.erl -> second patch

Line:241, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Remove this. This should be moved down 10 lines or so to the {node, node(), memcached_defaults} section. This will allow folks to turn on client certs on a single node in addition to doing it globally across the cluster -- this is our standard practice. See http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/74214/ for a recent example of how this is done. In your case it's simpler -- you don't need to call an arbitrary function, you can just have the config get generated off the memcached params.

Note that when you add something to memcached_defaults section it is going to break offline upgrade. You'll need to add a config migration piece. See the comments I made on Trond's patch recently to add privilege_debug to memcached.json. He hasn't done this yet so I would ask you to write the memcached_defaults migrator + unit test that we usually write. Let me know if you have questions on this part. (If Trond does the privilege_debug stuff first you'll be spared the work, of course.)

Line:53, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> all these changes move to the second patch.

Also: Manik - would you mind submitting your follow up patches under your own creds? It's nice to be able to find your work more easily - and it should be under your creds. Thanks.
