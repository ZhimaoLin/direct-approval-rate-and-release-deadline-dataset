Can you explain how the connections that ns_server opens agains memcached will work with client cert enabled. I don't see any code that uses client cert for such connections in this commit.

Since we have decided that we will not be disabling the standard memcached port, it follows that ns_server can communicate with the memcached without using the SSL cert.  However, is there any scenario where it becomes necessary for ns_server to communicate with memcached over SSL ?

Hey Manik - I guess I must have missed this in the traffic on the design doc. In answer to your question - there is no scenario in which ns_server communicates with memcached over SSL in Spock or later. --dave
