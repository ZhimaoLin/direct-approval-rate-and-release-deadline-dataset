DESCRIPTION

Do not change vbucket map until vbucket is added to index.

View querying during rebalance usually is subject to the following
issue. Vbuckets that have just been moved to a new node are added to
set index with some lag. But according to vbucket map these vbuckets
are already owned by a new node. This causes view queries to
retry. Basically in many cases views could not be queried at all
during rebalance. This change delays changing vbucket map until moved
vbucket are at least added (but not necessarily fully indexed) to a
set index on a new node.
