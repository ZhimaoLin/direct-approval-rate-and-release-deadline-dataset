DESCRIPTION

always return json for CAPI CRUD GET request

Right now CAPI CRUD is only useful/used by document editing code in
UI. Our main CRUD API is memcached. So there's no point in returning
raw binary bodies. Only json (meta)data.

This also returns $flags and $expiration. In 100% same way as can be
seen through map/reduce views. This closes MB-4549.
