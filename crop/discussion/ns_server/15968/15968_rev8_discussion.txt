good progress but lets do at least one more iteration on this

Line:1, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> lets just replace documents.js instead of creating parallel implementation

Line:207, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> I still think that 'constantizing constant' only creates confusion here

Line:242, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> how about the following name: 'onDocValueUpdate' ? validateJSON sounds like it's going to return some value based on validation. And actual code does more than just validation

Line:262, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> we discussed how we can deal with that right ?

Line:355, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> that's still not "idiomatic" cells. currentPageDocs should automatically depend on current page number and then it'll be automatically recomputed when needed

Line:385, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> so if somebody is very quick and clicks before prevPage is assigned it'll do what ?

That's not big deal perhaps. But perhaps points out that we can do better

Line:394, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> IE8 doesn't have String#trim

Line:428, priv/public/js/documents-refactoring.js -> just as with page number cell, I'm sure we can do better. We can have search term cell and have currentPageDocsURL depend on it

Line:194, priv/public/js/app-ui-misc.js -> lets discuss this tomorrow. I want this to be not very app-specific
