DESCRIPTION

Refactoring of documents.js

In this part of refactoring I have added param 'documentsPageNumber' in \n
hash for working with the pagination through REST. Also I moved html of\n
edit_doc section to documents section. Also some parts of javascript\n
code became similar to views section like startCreateDocuments or\n
doSaveDocuments. It's not a final version so some parts of code can be changed.
