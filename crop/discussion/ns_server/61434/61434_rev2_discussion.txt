DESCRIPTION

wip: MB-18289: concatenate UI app javascripts into single file

This change does the following:
1) Separates the UI app javascripts out of index.html into a new file:
   scripts.html
2) At build time, concatenates the scripts references in scripts.html into a
   new file: app-min.js. This single script is referenced by a new file
   scripts-min.html.
3) At runtime by default includes scripts-min.html to clients, except
   in the cluster_run case when scripts.html is included. This is
   overridable via a cluster_run option: --minified.

This saves ~190 separate JS file downloads.

I'm not actually minifying in this checkin; plan is to do this piece in
a later checkin.
