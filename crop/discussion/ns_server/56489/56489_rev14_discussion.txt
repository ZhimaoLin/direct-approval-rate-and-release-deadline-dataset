Btw, we already have similar proxy in place for couchdb requests. See capi_http_proxy. So you could test your changes by replacing that proxy with your change.

Line:393, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Doesn't look right. Here it's a RestPrefix, but in menelaus_pluggable_ui the formal argument is "Service" -- though the plugin lookup is done by RestPrefix. This should be changed in menelaus_pluggable_ui. Can you do that and add that to the change?
