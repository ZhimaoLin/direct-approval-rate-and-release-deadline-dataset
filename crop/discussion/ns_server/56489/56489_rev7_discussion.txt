Line:389, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Actually, we need to make these "auth"ed.

Can you wrap in a function and return {auth, Fn}? This REST API should only be executed by someone with Full Admin privileges -- at least for now, by which I think I mean "at least for Watson."

Same goes for the other methods.
