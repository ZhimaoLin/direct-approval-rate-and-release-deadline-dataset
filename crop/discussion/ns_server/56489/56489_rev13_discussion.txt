Patch Set 13:

I'm not able to verify this right now. I have the following pluggable config: 
{
  "service": "n1ql",
  "proxy-strategy": "local",
  "rest-api-prefix": "query",
  "doc-root": "priv"
}

and I have a cluster set up with a query service and when I curl against the proxied service I get this:

curl -u Administrator:asdasd -i -d statement="select count(*) from \`beer-sample\`;" http://127.0.0.1:9001/query/query/service
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: MochiWeb/1.0 (Any of you quaids got a smint?)
Date: Tue, 17 Nov 2015 07:54:58

2 problems. 
(1) I get a bad request when the same request against the query port directly succeeds
(2) the response hangs. 

I can look into this more tomorrow - but Anders can you try and verify using the same steps?

thanks
