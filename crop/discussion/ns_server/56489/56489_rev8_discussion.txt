Tested and seems to be close to there. Some comments.

Line:382, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I was thinking that this should actually match against the REST API prefix specified in the pluggable config file. This would allow pluggable UI writers to have a REST prefix different from the service name which may have value. E.g. the query UI component might wish to have a REST prefix of _query so that it's clear that running queries through ns_server is internal only. Without the leading underscore the query REST API against 8091 will be interpreted as a public REST API -- and I don't think this is what we want.

Thoughts? If you agree can you make the change?

Line:385, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Note that later we will need to provide a way to send service specific credentials to the service via probably some custom header. But for now what you have here is good enough.

Line:382, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Does this apply to the previous clause as well, line 380, i.e. static files?

Good question. Yes, it does. 

Reason is say we have 2 UI components that use the same backend service. E.g. say there's a query UI and a separate monitoring UI. The may be both pluggable and the authors would want to ensure that their resources don't overlap. So the authors would choose a unique REST API prefix (which becomes the REST API plus UI resource prefix) so there's no file collisions. You agree?

Patch Set 8:

Just to be clear: a request for a static file will be like
RestPrefix/ui/some/more/path

Then we strip RestPrefix/ui and serve the file found at
DocRoot/some/more/path

Is that correct?
