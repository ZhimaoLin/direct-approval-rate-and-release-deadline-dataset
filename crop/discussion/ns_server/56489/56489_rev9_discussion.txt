Line:256, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Looks like you picked up Artem's changes. You may be able to remove these by rebasing against couchbase master (run the following 2 commands: git remote update, git rebase couchbase/master).

Line:385, src/menelaus_web.erl -> this is confusing. I think this needs to be called PluggablePrefix or something of that nature. To call it Service is confusing to me.

Line:256, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Artem's vhanges have been merged and I have rebased, so I assume that is why this is here.

Line:385, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Agree, I was thinking about doing it but somehow forgot to do it.

Line:256, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Have you tried rebasing after running git remote update as I described? This should remove Artem's changes.

Line:256, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Yes, I have done that. 
But why do You think that Artem's change should not be here when it has been merged into master, and I have rebased to master after that?
