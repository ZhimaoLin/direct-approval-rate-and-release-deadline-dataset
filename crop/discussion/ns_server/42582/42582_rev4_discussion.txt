DESCRIPTION

start couchdb node directly without involving babysitter

...and wait for it to be fully loaded before starting ns_server_sup

this will ensure the proper loading order of processes, so the retrying
will not be needed in ns_couchdb_api

this also prevents couchdb node from being restarted when node name
changes
