DESCRIPTION

implemented parallel running of cucumber tests

Our cucumber tests are 'sleep-heavy' and so they run too long while
barely utilizing CPU. Simplest counter-measure is massive parellization
of those tests.

The patch runs each cucumber scenario in it's own make target. Those
per-scenario targets are run in separate temporary directories.

Use
 # make -j16 parallel_cucumber
to run.
