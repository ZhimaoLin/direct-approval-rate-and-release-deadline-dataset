DESCRIPTION

MB-10057: added ns_memcached api for xdcr checkpointing ops

Notably we're adding new implementation of
wait_for_checkpoint_persistence which is using pool of "very long
call" memcached sockets and not usual path via ns_memcached workers.

It's different than plain wait_for_checkpoint_persistence because we
expect greater concurrency of xdcr wait_for_checkpoint_persistence
requests. Also xdcr variant handles retries and externally specified
timeout which normal variant does not. And for 2.5.1 I want to avoid
changing "normal" code.
