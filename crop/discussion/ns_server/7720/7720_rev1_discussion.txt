DESCRIPTION

adapted autofailover to new requirements

New spec hardcodes 1 node to be automatically failed over. It also
considers node down when any bucket is not serving data.

New spec also handles cluster partitions by performing automatic
failover only when there are no other nodes that are down and only
when cluster size is at least 3.
