DESCRIPTION

set keepalive on ebucketmigrator sockets. MB-5049

We've seen evidence of ebucketmigrator not being aware of other node
being completely down. This makes it fail quicker on kernel level.

Patch Set 1:

At least on my machine Linux would start sending keepalive probes only after two hours of inactivity. So it's not clear that it would improve things a lot in the context of the referred issue. But of course it does not harm at all.

Patch Set 1:

you're right. man 7 tcp mentions that. So I didn't do all homework here. Still it won't hurt.
