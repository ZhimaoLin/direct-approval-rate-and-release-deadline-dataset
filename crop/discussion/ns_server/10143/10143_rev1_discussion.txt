DESCRIPTION

disallow rebalance 5 minutes after rebalance fails

ep-engine named tap connections from failed rebalance need 5 minutes
to die.

We keep extra ns_config field with timestamp of latest rebalance
failure and don't allow starting rebalance if that's between 0 and 5
minutes after that time.

Compatibility note: we have to check that outside of orchestrator
process because in 1.7.x it's possible that older node will either
request or orchestrator process may run on older node.

REST API note: we're using status code 503 (Service Unavailable) with
standard Retry-After header when we refuse rebalance due to "cool
down" reason.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

since there was a change in ns_config we need to rerun upgrade tests and more regressions which will postpone the release for couple of more days.

i will create a 1.7.3 branch in a few hours and then we can merge this there and start testing it and release this afterwards.
