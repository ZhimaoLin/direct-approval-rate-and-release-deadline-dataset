DESCRIPTION

[cmake] Make ns_couchdb depend on ns_server.

Any of our erlang projects can be built (but not used) independently
of each other. For that reason ns_server does not have to depend on
the subprojects. But since ns_server also serves as a place for common
code (and this common code is occasionally is a behavior), it makes
sense to build ns_server before certain subprojects (those who want to
use the behaviors defined in ns_server).
