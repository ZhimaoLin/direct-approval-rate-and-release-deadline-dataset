DESCRIPTION

Mark vbucket as dead when it's deleted.

It's possible that ep-engine will omit sending dead state for vbucket
being deleted. In such cases capi_set_view_manager would think that
vbucket is still alive and misconfigure set views. To avoid this we
now also mark vbucket as dead whenever mccouch gets vbucket deletion
command. It's also guaranteed that no active state message will be
delivered to mccouch after deletion unless the bucket is really
recreated.
