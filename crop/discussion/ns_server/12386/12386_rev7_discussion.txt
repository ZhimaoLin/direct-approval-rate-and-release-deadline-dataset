Patch Set 7:

What do you mean by fail? its still in the document flow because if it isnt the enter as submit breaks, as far as I can tell from your screenshot it isnt actually visible though

There is a difference in positioning of the other elements, but our padding and spacing is pretty much random throughout the rest of the ui so there wasnt anything to 'fix' it to

Patch Set 7:

Well if .invisible is broken what's the point introducing it? I cannot agree with introducing something that looks as a generic 'cure' but fails to work

Patch Set 7:

I was asking how is it broken? things are invisible as far as I can see, the highlight might be hiding something though

Patch Set 7:

affecting layout by having non-zero padding is broken for me. My initial thinking was that adding .invisible will magically hide element completely. But that's not the case.

Patch Set 7:

Well its impossible for it not to affect the layout, it needs to be part of the document flow for trigger to enter

Testing again the current setup (and the fix) is fairly broken in ie8, I dont really like either solution, and the fix is fairly intrusive and best done as part of a larger maintenance fix, abandoning for now
