DESCRIPTION

[cmake] Avoid using ctest for test custom targets.

That is when running "make test" from ns_server directory. This gets
rid of the annoying "<some number>: " prefix in each line. In
addition, ctest seems to do line buffering for the test command
output. The latter is what I want to avoid when running triq tests.
