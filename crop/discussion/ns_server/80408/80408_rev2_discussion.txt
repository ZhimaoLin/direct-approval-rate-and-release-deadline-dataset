DESCRIPTION

MB-25004 consider timestamps equal if they differ by 10sec

this is needed to prevent ping-pong merges on big clusters if the
value of the key is updated almost simultaniously on multiple nodes

The infinite ping-pong happens because the time of previous merge
(which is somewhat random) is a factor in a decision during the next merge.
So if cluster is big enough and there are let's say 2 different values
in play (A, B) distributed equally across the cluster with close, but slightly
different timestamps, during the next merge round, the numbers of wins
for A and B should be almost the same. Each win gets new timestamp, which
is random inside of some short period of time. So after each round of merges
we will see pretty much the same situation as before the round.

If the timestamps match exactly, B wins over A, which gives B slightly bigger
probability to win over the whole cluster, but it looks like with cluster
big enough this advantage doesn't lead to B winning in a reasonable amount of time.

Proposed solution:
Let's consider timestamps equal if they differ by some short period of time,
let's say 10sec. In this case we increase chances of B (bigger value) to win.

The side effect will be that the order of changes made on different nodes inside
of 10sec period will be ignored during the merge and bigger value will win.
