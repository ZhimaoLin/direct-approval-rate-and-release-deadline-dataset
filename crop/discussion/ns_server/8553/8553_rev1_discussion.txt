DESCRIPTION

Take over mastership if current master is of lesser priority.

Version of running ns_server is now taken into account when priority
is calculated: most recent version has the greatest priority. When
candidate node receives a heartbeat from a master with lesser priority
it ignores it. Thus after a timeout this node takes over mastership
(while previous master surrenders since its own priority is lesser).
