DESCRIPTION

Take over mastership if current master is of lesser priority.

Version of running ns_server is now taken into account when priority is
calculated: most recent version has the greatest priority. When candidate node
receives a heartbeat from a master with lesser priority it sends back a fake
master heartbeat. This forces old master to surrender. And after a timeout
some node (of highest priority) will take over the mastership.
