Patch Set 2: Do not submit

This isnt what the bug refers to, tried to explain in chat but guessing your irc issues got in the way

http://dropup.net/ilhw2n-1emk6u.png.html

is the issue, the dialog doesnt show any overlay, you can get that alert with 

menelaus_web_alerts_srv:global_alert(test, <<"test">>).
(there is a seperate bug that may show the dialog from appearing in firefox occasionally)

We definitely shouldnt be interfeering with standard dialog interaction.
