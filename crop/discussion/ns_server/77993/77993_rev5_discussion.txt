Line:67, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/editing/mn_documents_editing_service.js -> If I didn't pass it as a string it was being accepted as a binary. I started seeing the following message: "Warning: Editing of binary document is not allowed".

Please suggest is there is another way around this.

Line:67, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/editing/mn_documents_editing_service.js -> Yes, I get that.

The "create" REST API now has been changed. It accepts 2 parameters: one called "value" which accepts the document and other called "flags" which needs to be set to 0x02000006 if it's a new document or the flags value from the meta data if it's an existing document. The following is how the curl invocation would like:

"curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd -d 'flags=33554438' -d 'value={"abc":123}' http://localhost:9000/pools/default/buckets/b1/docs/foo

Could you please let me know how to achieve this in Angular?

Line:67, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/editing/mn_documents_editing_service.js -> Are you sure that the value should be -d 'value={"abc":123}'  but not -d 'value="{\"abc\":123}"' ?

I'm asking because JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation. So the value of parameter 'value' should be a string when you parse the request on the server.

Line:67, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/editing/mn_documents_editing_service.js -> Actually, you are doing it correctly, you are sending value as -d 'value="{\"abc\":123}"'

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/editing/mn_documents_editing_controller.js -> during parse of meta you can lose number precision for bignum. Try to put 123123123123123123 into browser's console and you will see what I mean. You can use string instead of a number as workaround. If this is not a case for us then +1.

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/editing/mn_documents_editing_controller.js -> The flags field in the meta object is a 32 bit number. So as far as 'flags' field is concerned we are safe.

We can look at the precision problem that you have pointed out in a separate change.

Also, Aliaksey has already given me a +2 for the ns_server related change. If we you think the UI changes are alright could you please give me a +2 as well?  We need to submit these changes together or else things will break.
