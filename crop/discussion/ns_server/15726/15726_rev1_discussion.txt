DESCRIPTION

sleep a bit when failover was not completely effective. MB-5247

As a workaround for MB-5247 lets wait a bit for all partial failover
effects to be done.

I.e. when Harley Martinitor run fails there will still be replications to set up
into failed over node. When this node shuts down it's buckets those
replications will fail and cause max_restart_intensity_reached for
ns_vbm_sup. Sleep will cause this to happen before somebody can click
rebalance and be confused by rebalance failure.
