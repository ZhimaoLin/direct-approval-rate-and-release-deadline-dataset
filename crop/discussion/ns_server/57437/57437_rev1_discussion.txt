DESCRIPTION

Fix UI that's currently broken on browsers other than Chrome

At least Firefox and Safari are broken for me on Mac. I see the following error
in the FF console, complaining about strict in mn_jquery.js.

SyntaxError: in strict mode code, functions may be declared only at top level or immediately within another function

Removing strict at least gets the UI working again.
