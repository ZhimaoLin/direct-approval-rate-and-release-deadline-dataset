DESCRIPTION

Provide minidump dir location to eventing-producer

C++ worker processes supervised by eventing-producer process could
crash some times. In such cases, it's very useful to have coredumps or
minidumps to assist in debugging. Change allows passing location of
minidump dir to C++ worker processes, so they can write .dmp files to it.
