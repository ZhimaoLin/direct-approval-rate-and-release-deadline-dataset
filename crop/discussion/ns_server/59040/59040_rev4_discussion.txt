DESCRIPTION

MB-17568: Make task repeat logic more intuitive

- Currently you can repeat a given task by passing the kwarg
  num_samples to the intialising function

- Unfortunately this actually collects the num_samples + 1 number
  of samples, this is not obvious and the logic for doing so is
  unnecessarily complex

- This commit cleans up the task execution logic which will also
  ensure that the number of samples collected is equal to the value
  passed as num_samples, while also functioning the same as before
