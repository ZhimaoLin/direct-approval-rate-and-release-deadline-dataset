DESCRIPTION

MB-4302 Avoid using _use_global_value in rest port configuration.

An atom _use_global_value supposed to instruct per-node key searches
to take global value instead. But since the changes to
config-related functions are required this causes issues on older
nodes trying to use such values. In particular it breaks rolling
upgrade. Instead of using special value we now have additional rest
property 'port_meta' which can be either 'local' or 'global'. When
it's 'local' then a per node value must be used, when it's 'global'
then a global value must be used. The older nodes just ignore this
property and always see the per node value.
