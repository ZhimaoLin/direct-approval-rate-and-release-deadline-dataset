DESCRIPTION

MB-19708: Add supervision of os_mon on Windows

At high load os_mon can timeout on windows. After 5 timeouts
in one hour os_mon would terminate, forcing a ns_server restart.
A new process is added that supervises os_mon and restarts it
when needed.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

I can not test this on windows but the monitoring and restart has been verified on OS X

Patch Set 1:

We'd need this in all our vms. At least couchdb vm relies on os_mon too.

Also, since I would just start os_mon_sup explicitly instead of starting it using application, since the latter requires sleeps anyway.

I would also like to avoid the code conditional for one specific platform.

Patch Set 1:

Starting os_mon_sup explicitly was my first plan, but it is not possible. os_mon checks internally if it is started, using application:which_applications.

Then we should just patch erlang. Seems like we already (or almost) have windows build of erlang: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBD-1831

Patch Set 1:

The following seems to work just fine:

> application:load(os_mon), supervisor:start_link({local, os_mon_sup}, os_mon, []).

os_mon:call/3 does use application:which_applications/0, but only if it gets noproc error. It shouldn't be a problem for us.
