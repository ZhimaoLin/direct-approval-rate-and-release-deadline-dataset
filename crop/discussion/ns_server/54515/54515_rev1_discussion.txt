DESCRIPTION

MB-16064 Shut down only consumers when terminating replictor.

In the normal case producer node will notice the connection close and
will cleanup producer streams.

In the failover case it's really important not to touch producer at all,
because it will slow down the failover.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

(4 comments)

Due to time pressure, I have done a quick code review. Have few comments/questions below but marking it as +2.

Line:34, src/dcp_consumer_conn.erl -> Nitpick: Calling the state  "closed" instead of  "shut" sounds better.

Line:208, src/dcp_consumer_conn.erl -> Could it get "shut_connection" request in "shut" state? And if yes, then is the handle_call() function which processes unhandled calls below sufficient for that case?

Line:226, src/dcp_consumer_conn.erl -> Why is to_close set to the list of Partitions which were just closed?
How will it get used?

Line:231, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> Can there be a request to close the connection with reason other than "shutdown"?
If yes, then shouldn't it be handled at as well.
