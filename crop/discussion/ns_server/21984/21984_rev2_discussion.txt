Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

In my testing without the patch I don't see any increase of memcached connections neither during rebalance nor during xdcr replication. The patch itself looks good but I don't believe that it's going to solve any problem. Because actually the same behaviour is achieved by the fact that ns_memcached:wait_for_checkpoint_persistence spawns a process that opens the connection to memcached. When the process dies, the connection is closed automatically by erlang.

Patch Set 2:

Apparently Pavel saw accumulated connections over time (even after the replicaion is over) because the connection in priority checkpoint is not closed by ns_server.

If the erlang process closes the connection when the process dies, then we should not see anything like this bug.

This is purely ns_server code issue instead of XDCR. 

Anyway, let's ask Pavel test it and if it does not work, I will pass the bug to you guys.

Any chance of having a non-owner (non-Hugo Blankenship) V this?

Thanks,

Patch Set 2:

I can give +V in advance on this. But I'm nearly 100% sure that it can't help with MB-7017. Aliaksey has similar opinion.

Patch Set 2:

OK, Alk, please take over the bug and come up with your fix since you are the creator of the priority checkpoint API used by XDCR.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We have now good evidence that indeed MB-7017 would not be fixed by this. Apparently, there's no need to merge this.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

MB-7017 is on Chiyoung's table. Seems the root cause is some priority checkpoint requests never come back to ns_server. Abandon this commit.
