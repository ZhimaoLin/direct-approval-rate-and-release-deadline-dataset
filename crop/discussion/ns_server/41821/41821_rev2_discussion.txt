DESCRIPTION

MB-11655: Properly account for getl when displaying stats in the UI

We added some aggregation stats into memcached and ns_server should
now use these stats. They account for getl operations in both
ops/sec and also in gets/sec.

thanks Mike. Really like you attitude.

See inline for minor thing (which we can fix ourselves in subsequent commit).

Also less minor thing is that with this approach we'll have somewhat suboptimal behavior in mixed clusters. Because older nodes will not have total_xxx stats in their samples causing weird aggregation behavior on UI. It might be totally fine given that mixed version clusters are very temporary anyways.

But maybe we can consider simply using old names.

Line:357, src/stats_collector.erl -> there's no need to sum anything if it's just one metric

Line:357, src/stats_collector.erl -> Alk,

I'm not sure the best way to do this and as a result I think it would be more efficient if your team could address this comment.
