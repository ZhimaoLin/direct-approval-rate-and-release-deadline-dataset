DESCRIPTION

MB-11655: Properly account for getl when displaying stats in the UI

We added some aggregation stats into memcached and ns_server should
now use these stats. They account for getl operations in both
ops/sec and also in gets/sec.

Patch Set 4:

I cannot merge this commit because with this commit applied I see ops for idle bucket when other bucket is receiving mutations.

Appears to be some kind of bug within memcached (because I have two types of buckets in my test).
