DESCRIPTION

Add a script to mass-verify/review commits published on gerrit.

Typical workflow:

  - upload changes to gerrit
  - run scripts/review --verified +1

To review:

  - you need to have the changes in one of your local branches (let's
    say it's called review)

  - unless the branch tracks upstream, you need to explicitly specify
    it; so you should call the script like this:
      scripts/review --review +2 --branch=review --upstream=couchbase/master

You can combine --verified and --review. You can also use --submit to
submit the changes.

Use --dry-run to see what the script is going to do.
