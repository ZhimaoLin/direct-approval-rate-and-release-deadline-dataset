DESCRIPTION

Add a script to mass-verify/review commits published on gerrit.

Typical workflow:

  - upload changes to gerrit
  - run scripts/review --verified +1

To review:

  - make sure you have remote set up and that you have review, merge
    and projectname set; the easiest way to do this is to use "repo
    start" to create the branch
  - run scripts/review --review +2

You can combine --verified and --review. You can also use --submit to submit
the changes.

Use --dry-run to see what the script is going to do.
