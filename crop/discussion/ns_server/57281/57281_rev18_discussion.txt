Patch Set 18: Code-Review-2

Pavel - I think we need to push this work out a bit.
Key issues:
1) when run under cluster_run we should not turn autocomplete off
2) the username on the main login doesn't autocomplete - this should support autocomplete

Lastly, we should also add support for the ?na query string to allow folks directly log in when the password is "asdasd" as before -- but this is lower priority. 

For item (1) above we need some work on the server side to communicate out to the UI client that it's a development build. 

If we can get to this work soon, great. If not we should take this checkin out of the stack of reviews.
