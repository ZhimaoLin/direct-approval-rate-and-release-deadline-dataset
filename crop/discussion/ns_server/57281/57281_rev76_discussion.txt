Patch Set 76: Code-Review+2

Well, after reading a bit, It looks like disabling autocomplete is more controversial lately than it was some years ago. However, it's the case that it's controversial -- and not the case that the arguments in favor of allowing browser built-in password managers to do their their thing are clearly unimpeachable. 

It seems to me that the most secure practice is copy-and-paste from standalone, password protected password managers or encrypted files. As such, I believe we go ahead with this change as is. 

In terms of allowing autocomplete for convenience when running with cluster_run: I agree let's do this in a separate checkin.
