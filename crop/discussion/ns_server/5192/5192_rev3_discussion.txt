see inline comment. Also I don't see why this commit needs to be separate from 'main' analytics de-globalization commit.

Line:709, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> this is very bad place to do that. And underscore names break existing naming convention of this code base

I can squash this commit with the de-globalization one, most likely.

Line:709, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> I'll move it. Sorry too for the underscore thing. It's the convention I'm most used too, and a hard one to break.
