see inline

Line:148, src/diag_handler.erl -> lets just turn this into (catch get_disk_data).

It is only diag. And there are tons of possible reasons for disk data to be not available.

Notably it will then obviate need for get_disk_data above

Line:57, src/ns_server_sup.erl -> hm. I think I'd prefer to keep this guy separate from our main supervisor. Just in case. I.e. if this guy constantly fails we don't want our main supervisor to crash due to max-restart-intensity-reached.
