DESCRIPTION

MB-10127 Eliminate xdc_vbucket_rep_xmem_{srv,worker} modules.

In order to avoid the state and messages to these processes being
logged in case of permanent problems on the remote memcached. Which,
we know, may blow up error_logger's memory usage.

And there was only one xmem_worker anyway. Every memcached request
would first go through xmem_srv to xmem_worker. So I converted
xmem_worker into a library which is used in place of old calls to
xmem_srv.
