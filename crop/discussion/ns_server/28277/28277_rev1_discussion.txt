just in case:
I'll remove misc:rewrite_key_value_tuples and replace it with misc:rewrite_tuples in config sanitizing code in a separate commit

Thanks for providing the API.  You will go ahead and change the log using your API, or you want me to do that?

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Junyi, this is not API for you, but rather callback for erlang. So everything is already done and there's nothing you need to do about this commit.

I'm not submitting this because at this time I'm not sure XDCR works at all

Patch Set 1:

this was tested with cherry-picked MB-8828 and it successfully removed all passwords from the storm of crash messages during warmup

even if these crashes will be fixed it will still be better to keep this code as a safeguard against password leaks during other potential crashes

and I think it will do no harm if we submit it now
