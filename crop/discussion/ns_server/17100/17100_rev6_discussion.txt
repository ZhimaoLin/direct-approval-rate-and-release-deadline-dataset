Line:169, src/capi_frontend.erl -> keeping commented out cood is a questionable habit. Git has all old code. Please remove this

Line:197, src/capi_frontend.erl -> I don't think we need to raise any exception here.

Just exiting polling loop and making sure new value of start timestamp is returned should be enough

Line:199, src/capi_frontend.erl -> this needs to be less than equal

Line:209, src/capi_frontend.erl -> I think it would be good if you either explicitly throw exception here, or return something that's clearly understood as error

Line:199, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Why <= instead of < ?  PersistedCheckpointId need to be (OpenCheckpointId -1) to make sure all things before OpenCheckpointId has persisted.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:197, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Does that require change misc:poll_for_condition? If so, this is what Damien suggested a while back. Today it just returns ok or timeout. If it is not critical, we can throw an error here and modify poll_for_condition in another commit.
