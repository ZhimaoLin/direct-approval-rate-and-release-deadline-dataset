DESCRIPTION

MB-16602: Support binary documents in the UI with a prefix of `_local/`

When there's a binary (non-JSON) document which has an ID that starts
with `_local/` it breaks the UI.

The reason is the call to `couch_doc:from_binary/3` which has a special
case for documents with a `_local/` prefix. The whole function isn't needed,
hence a simpler version of it called `capi_crud:is_valid_json/1` gets
introduced, that does only the JSON validation.
