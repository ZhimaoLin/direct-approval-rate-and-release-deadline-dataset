DESCRIPTION

MB-16602: Support binary documents in the UI with a prefix of `_local/`

When there's a binary (non-JSON) document which has an ID that starts
with `_local/` it breaks the UI.

The reason is the call to `couch_doc:from_binary/3` which has a special
case for documents with a `_local/` prefix. The whole function isn't needed,
hence a simpler version of it called `capi_crud:is_valid_json/1` gets
introduced, that does only the JSON validation.

Please see inline.

Line:107, src/capi_crud.erl -> If Data is empty, it will be considered a valid json, which is incorrect.

Also, there are some other places where we use couch_doc:from_binary. Given that actual local docs is something that is not exposed to the end user, do we need to have this special case at all?

Line:107, src/capi_crud.erl -> Your point about needing the `_local/` special case is a good one. Though my main intention of this change is to make ns_server rely less on view-engine internals.

I'm working on separating the view-engine from ns_server, the less calls there are across boundaries, the easier it gets.
