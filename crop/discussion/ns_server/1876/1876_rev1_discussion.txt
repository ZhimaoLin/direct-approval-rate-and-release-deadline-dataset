DESCRIPTION

Bug 2041: Install our own version of log_mf_h.

Our version just truncates any event larger than 64k and logs a
message with a text dump of the event. ns_log_mf_h uses application
environment settings with the same names as the sasl ones for
log_mf_h, but they need to go into the ns_server environment, so I've
also replaced -sasl error_logger_mf_* with -ns_server
error_logger_mf_*.
