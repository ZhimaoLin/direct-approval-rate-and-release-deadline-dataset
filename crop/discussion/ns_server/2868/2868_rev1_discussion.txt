Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I would rather add ns_confing:sync_anouncements() call to ns_orchstrator:create_bucket path to make it synchronous. Async interfaces are inconvenient for our users.

Patch Set 1: No score

hm. sync_announcements will not help, because ns_memcached creates completes initialization before it creates bucket.
