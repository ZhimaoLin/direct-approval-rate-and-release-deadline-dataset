I can't create buckets after this change since it removes the authType parameter. I'll email Artem to figure out how this will be handled in the REST API's.

Line:251, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_buckets_form/mn_buckets_form.html -> We still need the ability to put a bucket on a different port. Can you sync up with Rob to figure out how he thinks this should be displayed?

There's a mystery here. Currently sasl auth and putting bucket on different port are mutually exclusive features. If we remove sasl auth and make all buckets (except default) sasl authenticated, we, by this rule, loose the ability to use moxi against them.
So I need to figure out if we can run moxi on buckets with passwords.
