DESCRIPTION

silently clear buckets when changing disk path in wizard.MB-4548

This can only happen via 'Back' in wizard. And in this case just
losing data seems ok.

Note: we're going to implement sample docs loading. With sample docs
loading we'll need some other fix to this problem.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Given the sample docs loading, what do you suggest? we can

1. Make the datapath readonly once it has been set
2. Confirm deletion of existing buckets when buckets are available
3. Rewrite the entire setupwizard to not save as it goes and do it all on completion

Having the setupwizard run atomically at the end is the best solution, but its also a massive amount of work for a relatively tiny feature, making datapath readonly is my preference

Patch Set 1:

Making database base readonly is not option at all imho.

If user made mistake and really wants it changed how he's going to accomplish that. By re-installing whole package?

Patch Set 1:

meanwhile I believe while docloader integration is still not ready, we should merge _this_ simple change to fix bug.

Patch Set 1: No score

ok sure, seems pointless to fix when we are just going to need to fix again

whats the suggestion then, rewrite the whole setup wizard?

Patch Set 1:

I believe we can delete buckets, warning user. And on docloader step we should indicate if sample buckets are already loaded or not, as extra remind.

Patch Set 1:

ok sounds good to me, it seems it'd be useful for the setup wizard to know the currently loaded buckets, should I add a buckets list to /nodes/self, or just make a one off call for /bucketsInstalled

Patch Set 1:

afaik /pools/default/buckets will work. And it'll be seemingly needed in order to correctly initialize default bucket size.
