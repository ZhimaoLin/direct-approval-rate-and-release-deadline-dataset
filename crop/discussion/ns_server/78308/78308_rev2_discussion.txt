DESCRIPTION

In kv_monitor:get_buckets/0 limit ready buckets to requested

In my previous patch, I changed get_buckets to return ready status
for buckets that might not have been asked for.

In this patch I intersect the ready buckets with the requested
list, reverting to the semantics prior to my previous patch.
