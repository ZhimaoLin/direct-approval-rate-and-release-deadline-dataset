And underscore upgrade fixes should be part of underscore upgrade commit

Line:208, priv/public/js/hooks.js -> _.breakLoop() doesn't exist anymore (as of Underscore 1.1.3):
"Removed _.breakLoop, in favor of an ECMA5-style un-break-able each implementation â€” this removes the try/catch, and you'll now have better stack traces for exceptions that are thrown within an Underscore iterator."

There was another in cells that was commented out (probably some time ago), and I followed that pattern. I'll remove them both, and update this patch--if that's cool.
