DESCRIPTION

Implement separate port server for memcached instead of generic one

Since each port is gonna need its own special treatment, ns_port_sup
doesn't make so much sense any more.

Patch Set 1: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Just to make sure this doesn't accidentaly get approved, Sean and I discussed this, and Sean's going to provide a new version since we had some code/config conflicts with other commits.
