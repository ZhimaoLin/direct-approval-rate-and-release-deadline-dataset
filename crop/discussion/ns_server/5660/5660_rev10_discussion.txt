Patch Set 10: Fails

Doesn't seem to work. I see no spinner.

Here's patch that addes delay to app.js:

Patch Set 10:

Tested again in FF4, IE 7 & 8, Safari 5, Chrome 10, and the loader icon loads fine in all of them.

We could look into tricking the browsers into loading this particular image earlier, but I'm not sure that it's worth it. Thoughts?
