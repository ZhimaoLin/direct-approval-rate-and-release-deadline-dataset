Line:41, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_pools.js -> Don't you want to reject this too so that clients who attach a then to mnPools.get() don't end up getting an {isInitialized, isAuthentcated} object instead of a proper response?

Line:41, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_pools.js -> in case when cluster.pools!read: true and response status is 401 we can strongly rely that the user is logged out, that's why isAuthenticated: false is here. With cluster.pools!read: false we should disable entire UI including wizard, because cluster.pools!read contains the basic data for both admin and wizard. So there is no way for logged in user to get 401 from /pools.

All other mnPools consumers expect that object in "resolve" callback. Actually that response has influence only on one pice of code:

1. this is now:
     mnPools.get().then(function (pools) {
        if (pools.isAuthenticated) {
          $urlRouter.sync();
        } else {
          if (pools.isInitialized) {
            $state.go('app.auth');
          } else {
            $state.go('app.wizard.welcome');
          }
        }
      });
2. and this is your proposal
  mnPools.get().then(function (pools) {
          if (pools.isInitialized) {
            $urlRouter.sync();
          } else {
            $state.go('app.wizard.welcome');
          }
      }, function () {
         $state.go('app.auth');
      });

in general your proposal is better because we don't need isAuthenticated flag at all and your proposal has 9 lines of code vs 11 of the present. Less code = less bugs :). Will be uploaded separately.

Abandoned

we do not need this change, "reject" callback is going to be removed completely
