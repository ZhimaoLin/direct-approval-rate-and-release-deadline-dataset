DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Implement service for managing ctrl token

Committing on behalf of Philip Lara.

- creates new token on memcached when it first requested
- keeps token in memory and gives it to other processes
- monitors the processes for the duration when they use
  the token and resets token if one of them crashes
- allows to reset token if the control command receives
  key_eexists caused by token mismatch
- has a config parameter that can be used to set the
  retry count while trying to set the control token
  (default is set to 10).
