DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Implement service for managing ctrl token

Committing on behalf of Philip Lara.

- creates new token on memcached when it first requested
- keeps token in memory and gives it to other processes
- monitors the processes for the duration when they use
  the token and resets token if one of them crashes
- allows to reset token if the control command receives
  key_eexists caused by token mismatch
- reusing the executing_on_socket API in ns_memcached_sockets_pool
  in ns_memcached and ns_memcached_token modules.

Please move executing_on_socket changes into a separate patch, since they are only tangentially related to this change.

Line:319, src/ns_memcached.erl -> This is not functionally equivalent to the previous version of the function. The old one would fail if Fun returned anything bug {reply, _}. The new one will not.
