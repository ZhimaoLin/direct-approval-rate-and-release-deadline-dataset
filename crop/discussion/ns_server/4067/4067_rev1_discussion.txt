DESCRIPTION

don't fail join if net_kernel:connect_node failed

For whatever reason it reliably fails on windows, however second
attempt succeeds. It looks like some race-condition inside net_kernel
because at around same time as we call connect_node other node tries
to connect to us too. This is visible because net_kernel logs failed
attempt to connect to us.

Pre-rewrite cluster join code didn't depend on result of that check
either.

Inspection of net_kernel code revealed that there is at least one tiny
race here which is:

* other node establishes tcp connection to us

* incoming connection is marked as pending and is placed in net_kernel
  dictionary

* incoming connection handling process continues handshake and reads
  old cookie value....

* we update cookie and enter net_kernel:connect_node

* net_kernel finds pending connection to that node and puts us into
  wait list for that connection

* incoming connection handling process finds cookie mismatch and dies

* net_kernel sees 'EXIT' message from incoming connection handling
  process and notifies waiters (us) that connection establishment
  failed

The fix for that race would be to try calling connect_node twice. But
because that race looks so tiny I decided not to risk and converted
connect_node back into purely diagnostic call.
