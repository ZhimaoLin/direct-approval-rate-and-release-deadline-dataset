Line:158, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> What are your thoughts on abstracting this away into the log_error() function itself as it might be useful to get a backtrace upon every error. It also simplifies the function's interface.

Line:158, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Our log messages are already overloaded with information. And by the way Srini our logging adds ~n to the end of the message automatically. You don't need to do it by hand.
