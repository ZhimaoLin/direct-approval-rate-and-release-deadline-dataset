DESCRIPTION

Made aggregation of two stats samples faster

'Adding' two orddicts can be easily done with O(N) instead of
O(NÂ²). Which is what we're doing here.

We're not using orddict:merge because our behavior is to only use keys
that are present in first proplist. So that we don't try to
merge/display stats that are unsupported/unkown on this node.

Badarith case is likely slightly slower (stats_reader may return
undefined in some rare cases), but it's very uncommon.
