ok. here's the story:

the server code (addNode) has the following validation:
- if the username is not empty it demands the password to be not empty
- if the username is empty it demands the password to be empty

this validation was overwritten on the client with the following piece of code:

if (!data['user'] || !data['password']) {
  data['user'] = '';
  data['password'] = '';
}

so I removed this piece of code to make the server validation work.

No when I know that this was intentional I rolled my change back, but may be we need to remove the server side validation instead?
