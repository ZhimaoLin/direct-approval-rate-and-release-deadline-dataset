this is change of API. While it's quite probable that nobody except UI is using it, you should double check with tools and QE folks if that's indeed the case.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

this should not affect the current tests. I checked the commit on cluster_run. with minor changes, we can pass the server in http://<server-name/ip>[:<port>] format to test different scenarios, both positive and negative. And it works fine now.  But that is our concern, as it is implemented in our tests.

I was wrong about change of API. In fact old APIs work.

See minor advice inline

Line:2057, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I believe it might be more readable to just ++ Errors here rather than passing it.
