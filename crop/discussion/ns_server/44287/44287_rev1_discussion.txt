Patch Set 1:

without this fix I'm seeing some apparent errors when indexer tries to reach projector in my 2 nodes cluster_run environment. With fix at least I'm not seeing any errors in logs :)

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Multi node kv with indexer is not fully ready yet. We will have multinode kv  + kv rebalances working by end of december.
All of 2i components will read portnos as cmdline argument and bind on :port.

Thanks for catching this :)
