Some of this code was taken from a GPL'ed project?  We cannot have GPL infect this codebase.

MIT/BSD/Apache licensed stuff is fine.

Line:1, deps/menelaus/priv/js-unit-tests/jsUnitMockTimeout.js -> Whoops, we have a hard rule to not allow GPL stuff into this codebase.

I knew that GPL is not what we want. But my reasoning behind using this code is that we don't distribute it (it's for tests only), so GPL doesn't apply and we're free to use it.

Anyway I'll mail the author of this code asking for permission to use this under BSD license terms.

Patch Set 1:

Yes, no GPL.  We'll soon be open-sourcing large parts of this codebase, and even though it's just a test framework thing, it'll be a file in the repository.  And, we want to avoid trouble.
