DESCRIPTION

MB-7766:  XDCR code refactoring

No semantic change in this commit. Today we allow users to use
environment parameters to change XDCR internal parameters. These
environment parameters are scattered everywhere in code, which is
hard to maintain. This commit define all environment parameters
in the xdcr header file and we no longer need to modify each source
file in the case the environement parameters are changed in future.
