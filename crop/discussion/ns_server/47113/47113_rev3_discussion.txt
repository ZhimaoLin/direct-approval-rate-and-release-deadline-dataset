Patch Set 3:

Hi, Aliaksey,

I fully understand ns_server prefer new code not to use ns_ssl proxy, rather than using me cached ssl directly. We had a discussion together with Dave and Artem on this topic on XDCR weekly sync up yesterday. The current decision is to keep this old path alive still in goxdcr to support online upgrade from 2.5. We will likely try to use memcached directly if target cluster is on 3.0 and above, still under discussion.

I hope this gives the context on why I raised the review after you and Alk told me that path is discouraged.

Thanks,
Xiaomei

Aliaksey,

I know we havenâ€™t decided\agreed on wether or not to keep the proxy path in goxdcr. Meanwhile, we would like to check in the current implementation using ssl proxy, so QE can test it at least as a backup plan. We need this one-line change in ns_server to make it work. If we decide to abandon this route, it can be easily reverted. Is that OK?

Thanks,
Xiaomei
