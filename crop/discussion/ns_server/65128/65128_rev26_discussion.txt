Patch Set 26:

When I add a new user in the external roles page and click to add roles in the roles section I cannot click on the right side of the text box in order to get the drop down menu. It only works if I click on the bottom of the of the textbox. This behavior isn't in the current UI. Can we get this fixed before merging this change?
