actually say that omitted fields don't matter one should use _ pseudo
field.

Line:313, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Can you please explain why this change from match/2 to match/3 is necessary? What is the issue of current code?

Line:313, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> match/2 is still used. ?XSTORE table stores triples. Thus my understanding is we have to match triple. And apparently #rep{id = XRepId, _ = '_'} is required to match _just_ by XRepId
