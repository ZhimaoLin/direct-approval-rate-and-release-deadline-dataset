DESCRIPTION

MB-11588: disable only replicaIndex checkbox

therefore hidden field will be sent to the server.

The issue occured because at bucket creation time, if replicas are
disabled, we disabled both checkbox and corresponding hidden field for
replicaIndex which triggered default for this field which was true.
