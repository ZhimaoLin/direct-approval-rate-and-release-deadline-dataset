DESCRIPTION

Log error if something fails in ns_config:update_with_changes.

This function is used throughout the ns_config.erl. And shamefully in
many places we just ignore return values of ns_config functions
leaving the room for silent config update errors. So from we'll at
least have an error in log file.
