DESCRIPTION

MB-3415: Retry on restore collision.

This leaves a small window where the first writes to a table could
potentially be lost if we try to recreate a table that already exists,
but that can only happen if the table is created right at join time
and will only affect local_content tables since those are the only
ones we restore.
