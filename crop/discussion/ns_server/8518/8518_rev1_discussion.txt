DESCRIPTION

keep separate result sets for development and full view subsets

In order to avoid running production subset of dev-mode views when
switching to production subset tab we're keeping two result sets. They
both have same 'basic parameters' that are taken from view url and
filter params, but distinct full_set and skip parameters.

We're maintaining separate page number parameters for those subsets
and are applying them independently. So that user experience is
acceptable yet fully back-button compatible.
