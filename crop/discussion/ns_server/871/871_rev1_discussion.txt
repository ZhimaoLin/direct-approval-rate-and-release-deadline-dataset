DESCRIPTION

bug 100 - cucumber features/basic_api.feature:5 passes again

Need to return 404 (instead of 500) to allow old test to pass again.

Feature: Basic API
  As a user of northscale software
  I want meaningful behavior of REST API

  Scenario: Requesting unknown bucket details
    Given I have configured node A
    When I GET path /pools/default/buckets/nonexistant on node A
    Then I should get status code 404
