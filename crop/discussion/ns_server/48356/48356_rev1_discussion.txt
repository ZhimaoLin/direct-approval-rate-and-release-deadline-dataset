See inline. Otherwise looks good.

Line:118, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> With you change, the function name is confusing. Because the function itself doesn't actually change anything. Maybe you should just get rid of this function and pass {memory_quota, NewQuota} to your ns_config:set call explicitly.
