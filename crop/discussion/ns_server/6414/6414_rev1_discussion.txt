DESCRIPTION

made ns_logs use nodes() instead of asking ns_node_disco

ns_log is started before ns_node_disco. And this is correct, because
ns_node_disco logs things. So ns_log should not use services of
ns_node_disco.

Using nodes() which might include non-membase nodes is safe, because
we're doing gen_server:cast, which just ignores missing server on
remote side.
