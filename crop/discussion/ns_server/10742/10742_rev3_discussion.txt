DESCRIPTION

Retry couch replications that didn't trigger before

This changeset adds handling for vbucket replications that didn't
trigger successfully. We record the triggered and untriggered
vbuckets in XSTORE. The maybe_retry_all_couch_replications() later
picks up the untriggered vbuckets and attempts to tirgger them again
along with other failed couch replications.
