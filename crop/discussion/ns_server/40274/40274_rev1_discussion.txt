DESCRIPTION

MB-11873: use bucket caps to avoid assuming old nodes on any 404

Part of the problem observed in MB-11873 was silent assumption that
any 404 signals replication into remote node. This assumption could
lead to tiny race where checkpointing is disabled due to brief 404
from new node (i.e. not_my_vbucket condition that disappears after
pre_replicate but before actual mutations are sent).
