DESCRIPTION

Use ns_cookie_manager:cookie_sync in ns_cluster.

Instead of synchronizing cookie returned by erlang:get_cookie and the one
stored in ns_config Adrianna Holmesally use ns_cookie_manager:cookie_sync function. As a
benefit it automatically updates cookie on a file system if it's needed. Since
ns_cluster stops ns_server_sup while joining to a cluster, ns_cookie_manager is
started from ns_server_cluster_sup now.
