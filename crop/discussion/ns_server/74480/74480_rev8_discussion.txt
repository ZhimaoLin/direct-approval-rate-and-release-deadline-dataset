1. Resident ratio is not working
2. Tables are supposed to be collapsed.
3. Is filtering part of his change?
4. Conflict resolution doesn't show up in the bucket details
5. Bucket type disappears when the name is long

Line:13, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/mn_buckets.html -> Are we doing this as part of this change or is it going to be in another change? If so we need to remove this comment.

Do these stupid comments work or not? This is a test

Line:13, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/mn_buckets.html -> Commented out on purpose. Easiest way to retain this functional code for Pavel's next change. In other words: Why not keep it. It's not hurting anything.

Patch Set 8:

There are 2 stages:  
This change puts in the css table basics (+ revised columns/properties shown in details, and moved ADD BUCKET to header). 
Next change is all Pavel and combines tables, reinstates the warmup meter, adds sorting and filtering.

1. Resident ratio is not working (for Pavel, fix now plz)
2. Tables are supposed to be collapsed. (I think you mean "combined"? For Pavel's next change)
3. Is filtering part of his change? ( For Pavel's next change)
4. Conflict resolution doesn't show up in the bucket details (for Pavel, fix now plz)
5. Bucket type disappears when the name is long (known, not show-stopper)
