DESCRIPTION

MB-17034 gsi: Add drain docs/sec stats

Previously drain items/sec stats was mapped to num_docs_indexed.
With gsi array indexing, new num_items_flushed stat has been added to reflect
the actual number of items inserted into the index (more than 1 per document).
Hence, num_docs_indexed is mapped to drain docs/sec and num_items_flushed
to drain items/sec.
