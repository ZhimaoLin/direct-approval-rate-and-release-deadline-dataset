Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't think we need to specify "type" of connection. memcached operation is enough. 'new' commands such as set, get , sync are data operations. While things like vbucket states changes and stats are stats/control.

Also both processes may try to create bucket. In which case one will write error message stating that it's waiting for shutdown of previously deleted bucket with same name.
