DESCRIPTION

MB-10057: made pre-2.5.1 incoming xdcr checkpointing ineffective

2.5.0 and previous releases have buggy checkpointing. We're
implementing new checkpointing protocol. Which is incompatible with
previous releases.

For previous release we have to pretend that their's checkpointing
protocol "works". Without actually saving checkpoints. Otherwise
previous releases would fail to replicate to 2.5.1+ at all.

Our approach is to simply do nothing on ensure_full_commit and to drop
_local/ docs update on the floor, pretending that it actually
succeeded.
