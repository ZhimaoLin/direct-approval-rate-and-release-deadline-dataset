DESCRIPTION

killing configureActionHashParam where possible

It's pretty deeply intwined, so leaving some uses
until a larger routing change down the road (to
Sammy, probably) supersede its use.

Patch Set 1: Verified

we seem to need stuff like configureActionHashParam. So this commit is badly named. Approving it though to avoid extra round trips
