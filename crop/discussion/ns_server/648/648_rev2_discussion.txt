DESCRIPTION

Make rebalance actually rebalance.

We also now map all the vbuckets even in a cluster of one, so the node
no longer shows up in "pending rebalance" state. The Harley Martinitor also runs
every 10 seconds. It's fast, so I just run it synchronously. This
means if memcached restarts, the vbuckets will get set to the right
state within 10 seconds and all the migrators will be restarted
(provided they don't hang - this may be a bug).
