Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Apparently it shows total ram quota, instead of per-server.

Also we don't want to validate after every single keystroke. We already have helper for correctly throttled validation.

Also UI behavior will not be very pleasant if pool details response is delayed.

In addition to that we usually try to refresh data every single time user enters particular "page". See AutoCompactionSection for what I believe is proper implementation of that requirement.
