Patch Set 8:

Things are getting harder here. I'm totally fine with Pavel's markup and css changes for this. But I -1 change of pool details output in this commit.

We'll have to maybe split this into server-side change and UI-side change. Looks like we're changing format of 400 response from cluster settings.
