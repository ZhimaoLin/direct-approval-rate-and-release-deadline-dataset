DESCRIPTION

MB-16487 add ns_test as part of make test

... and remove ns_ui_test from being part of make test
The ui tests require updating an entire set of libraries starting
from c libraries (requirement to install chrome), which is probably
disruptive to the build process at this point. We need to figure
out a way to run these as part of the build (TBD currently)

Line:115, CMakeLists.txt -> instead of duplicating the command, how about changing the ns_test custom target to run $(CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND} as I did in the change where I added the ns_ui_test custom target?

Line:115, CMakeLists.txt -> Yes, we can for sure. Not super familiar with everything cmake it. 
I will make the change test it out and upload a patch tomorrow. Thanks.

Line:115, CMakeLists.txt -> I would actually remove the ns_test target and leave Hari's version here. Hari's approach is the right way to add a CTest test case.

If there is some need to have an actual target just to run that test, then the target could be changed to invoke ${CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND} -R ns_test .

Line:115, CMakeLists.txt -> I ended up doing as you mentioned. Uploading patch soon.
(Dave probably meant that also. Because that is what he had done for ns_ui_test)
