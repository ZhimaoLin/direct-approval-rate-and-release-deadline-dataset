DESCRIPTION

MB-10942: only allow non-GETs token auth for UI

Our UI always adds header to it's requests. Which CSRF is unable to
duplicate.

So we still do UI auth via cookie. Which is super-convenient
(particularly for /diag link in UI). And we cover our ass from CSRF by
requiring that all non-GET requests (only type of requests that are
vulnerable to CSRF) have ui header added.
