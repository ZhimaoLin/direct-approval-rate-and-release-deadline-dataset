DESCRIPTION

better propagate reason of failure to change vbucket filter

In MB-5258 we're seeing vbucket filter change operation to fail, but
it's not obvious why it happened because just 'failed' is
returned. Now we'll return reason why it failed so that it's more
obvious what happened without looking deeply at logs.
