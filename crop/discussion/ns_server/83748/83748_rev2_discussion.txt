DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Alter 'is_good_address' API to handle...

...an IPv6 address as a parameter.

The current implementation looks for the presence of "." to
determine if 'Address' passed in is a hostname. If an IPv6 address
if passed to this function it would fail with a wrong message. The
fix is to take IPv6 address into account and error out appropriately.

Line:1417, src/misc.erl -> Sure!

Line:1420, src/misc.erl -> Yes, that's true. Will fix it to say something like "Short names are not allowed. Please use Fully Qualified Domain Names instead."

Line:1420, src/misc.erl -> That won't be the whole truth either, since ipv4 addresses are also allowed.
