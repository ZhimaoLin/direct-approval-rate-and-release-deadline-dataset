DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Alter 'is_good_address' API to handle...

...an IPv6 address as a parameter.

The current implementation looks for the presence of "." to
determine if 'Address' passed in is a hostname. If an IPv6 address
if passed to this function it would fail with a wrong message. The
fix is to take IPv6 address into account and error out appropriately.
