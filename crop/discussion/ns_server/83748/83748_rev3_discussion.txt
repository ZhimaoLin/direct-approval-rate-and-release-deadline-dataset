DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Alter 'is_good_address' API to handle...

...an IPv6 address as a parameter.

The current implementation looks for the presence of "." to
determine if 'Address' passed in is a hostname. If an IPv6 address
if passed to this function it would fail with a wrong message. The
fix is to take IPv6 address into account and error out appropriately.

Line:1435, src/misc.erl -> Do we accept IPv4 addresses when we are in ipv6 mode? I guess not.
It looks like this check should be done different way for ipv4 and ipv6 modes with different error message.
