Patch Set 1:

Should we be able to reconfigure node from ipv4 to ipv6 like this:
1. Stop the node
2. Restart it with ipv6

If yes, then this won't work.

Patch Set 1:

Yes that sequence won't work. But currently we don't support in place upgrade from IPv4 to IPv6. Hence I thought that this should be ok.

When the user first installs the package, the service will be started in IPv4 mode. In order to configure the instance in IPv6 mode the user will have to do the following:
1. Enable ipv6 in the static_config file.
2. Delete the config.dat file.
3. Restart the service.
4. WNathalie Landry through the setup wizard to initialize.

I tested with the above mentioned sequence and the config was updated correctly.

Patch Set 1:

I don't like the idea of several sources of truth that could contradict each other. If you need this just for the purpose of displaying "ipv6" in UI you might include ipv6 info to the heartbeat.

Patch Set 1:

Yes, I agree. I was not too sure of this change. The whole IPv6 mode gets bootstrapped off of the ipv6 parameter in static_config. For the current use (to display in UI) we can construct it based on the environment variable too. I think I'll just drop this change.
