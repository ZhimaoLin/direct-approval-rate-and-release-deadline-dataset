Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

htmlNewLine filter here:

      <td ng-bind-html="row.text | htmlNewLine"></td>


is not same as the following bit in old template:

h(logRow.text).replace(/\n/g, "<br>")

New behavior is not doing html escaping at all as far as I understand.

Rest of patch looks ok

Patch Set 5:

indeed, angular has filter named 'html' which is right for our case because it uses $sanitize
