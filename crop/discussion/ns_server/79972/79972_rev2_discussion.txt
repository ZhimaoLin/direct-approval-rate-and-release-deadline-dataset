DESCRIPTION

MB-24648: Fail node add when its already part of cluster.

Currently if a node is present in the nodes_wanted list and for some
reason its config gets deleted we allow the node to be re-added to
the cluster without doing a failover first. This causes data loss.
With this changeset we check first if the node is present in
nodes_wanted and add only if it doesn't already exist.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Hi Amit,

In addition to unit testing, I assume you have run the usual verification steps - ns_server/make test, make dialyzer and testrunner/make simple-test?

If yes, then please go ahead and submit this change. After submitting it to watson, please port it to the master following the steps I emailed few days back.

Patch Set 2:

Hi Poonam, I ran the verification steps. The XDCR tests are failing in make simple-test but they are failing on tha baseline (without my changes) as well.
The error message says "AddNodeException: Error adding node: 127.0.0.1 to the cluster:127.0.0.1 - ["This node cannot add another node xxx@xxx.xxx because of cluster version compatibility mismatch (1 =/= 262150)."]
" 
Even though the error is in the add node path which I have made changes to this error isn't because of my change. I just wanted to make a note of that here. Are you still ok with me merging my changes?
