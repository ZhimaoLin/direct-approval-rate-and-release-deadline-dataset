DESCRIPTION

[async] Library for composable asynchronous computations.

This is mainly aimed to hide low level details of spawning processes,
monitoring them, propagating errors, if any. Async actions can start
other async actions. Then if parent async is aborted, it's guaranteed
that it will also abort children synchronously.

As an example of use, I rewrote misc:parallel_map/3 and
misc:executing_on_new_process/2 to use it.
