DESCRIPTION

flush duplicates when handling idempotent messages

Those are sent by timer and when we're handling them slower than
they arrive everything becomes really bad. Flushing them will make us
tolerate to that.

Patch Set 1:

I may not understand misc:flush() but it looks like we'd be flushing the ones already underway and then adding the new ones?  Isn't this the same?  Or is it flushing those which are queued.

In any event, good catch on the problem.

Patch Set 1:

My understanding of misc:flush code is that it will dequeue and throw-out already queued messages.
