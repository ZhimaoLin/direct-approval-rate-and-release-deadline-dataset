DESCRIPTION

Historical stats.

We now have:

%% Period, Secs, Samples
    [{minute, 1, 60},
     {hour, 10, 360},
     {day, 240, 360},
     {week, 1680, 360}].

The period is just a name which covers the total period over which we
have samples. Secs is the number of seconds per sample, and samples is
the total number of samples at that resolution we keep.

Oops, I forgot to put in month and year. I'll add those later.

Patch Set 1: Fails

breaks single node stats. Just setup fresh single-node cluster and try to see stats.
