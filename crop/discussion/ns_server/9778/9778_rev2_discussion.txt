DESCRIPTION

MB-4302 Delay upgrade of rest configuration until port is set.

During upgrade of config from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2 version per node 'rest'
key was replaced by '_use_global_value' to instruct per-node searches
to retrieve cluster-wide value. But since this requires config search
routines to be changed if some old node searches for such a key it
will get the '_use_global_value' atom instead of expected value. This
actually breaks a rolling upgrade.

To resolve the issue we do not upgrade a rest configuration right
away. Instead it is done only when user is explicitly changes rest
port configuration. This means that by the time port is changed all
the nodes must be of new version. And after this point it's impossible
to add older nodes to the cluster. Thus whenever cluster has nodes of
version older than 1.7.2 or some nodes in the cluster are down port
change request will be refused with appropriate error message.
