Just one question about naming...

Line:599, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> Is there a reason you decided to externalize the usage of the quota?  ie, why not have the option be named "MemoryQuota", and then let the application decide how to spend it internally?

I guess my thinking was, now do we also need additional options for other KV stores?

Line:599, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> Good point.

Right now, it matches the config that was added here: https://github.com/couchbase/cbft/blob/master/cmd/cbft/init_forestdb.go#L67

But, a level of indirection would be good.

I'll do that shortly as an alias where something like "ftsMemoryQuota" is treated by cbft internals, in watson, as an alias for forestdbBufferCacheSize.

After that, if we change our minds in the future on that, it'll be straightforward to change as it should just only be changes on the cbft side.
