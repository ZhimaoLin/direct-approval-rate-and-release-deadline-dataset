Patch Set 7:

> I bet you didn't run dialyzer :)

You'd win that bet.  dialyzer complains about a missing plt, whatever that is, and not aiming to google search to find out about that right now (pressure on other bugs).

> get_memory_quota never returns false.

Whoops, I had a typo.  Fixed so that it's checking for not_found, and repushed for review.

> And again this case is not needed, by preventing crash here you might hide some future bug.

Possible, but I see by my lying eyes that get_memory_options might return not_found.

Patch Set 7:

Yes it can return not_found if somebody Adrianna Holmesally delete fts_memory_quota key from the config. In this case ns_ports_setup should crash, not silently run fts without quota parameter.

Notice that here: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/58983/3/src/menelaus_web.erl you do not check for not_found.
