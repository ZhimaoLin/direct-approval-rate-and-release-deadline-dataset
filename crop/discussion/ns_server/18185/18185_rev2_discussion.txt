DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: remove pull replication support from replicator worker

In XDCR, no longer support pull replication therefore in function
local_process_batch, the source must be local while the target must
be remote. Remove unused code and add log in function find_missing().

Patch Set 2:

Junyi, correction:

This was not for a pull replication, but for a local to local replication. CouchDB supports:

local -> local
remote -> local  (pull)
local -> remote  (push, what xdcr uses)
remote -> remote   (acting as a middle man)

Therefore I think the commit message should be updated.
Otherwise looks good.

Patch Set 2:

Why do we want to remove local to local replication? At least it very useful for testing purposes. And might even be useful for something else.

Patch Set 2:

You can still do local to local. You'll just have to name the target with an URL (http://....).

The local to local approach where both are represented via #db records, is just an optimization to avoid going through the network stack.

I should have first looked at the code. Thanks for the clarification.
