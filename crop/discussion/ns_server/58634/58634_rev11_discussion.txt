Patch Set 11: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Don't we have to fix *all* places where we instantiate mnPoller with a promise (as opposed to a function that returns a new promise)? Promises just get resolved once so the poller doesn't really act as a poller -- it waits on the first promise only. 

This is fine though, but I think that mnPoller doesn't work when handed a promise; it should get a function.
