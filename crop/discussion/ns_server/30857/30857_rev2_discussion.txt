DESCRIPTION

Print for how many vbuckets rack constraints are broken.

Two kinds of violations are considered:

  1. Violation is "strict" when master resides on the same rack as any of
  its replicas.

  2. Violation is "weak" when master resides on a different rack, but some
  of the replicas reside on the same rack.
