DESCRIPTION

fixed /diag/eval handling of complex expressions

Reference to "Req" was causing error producing unused variable
warnings in some cases.

Now:

wget -O- --post-data='(fun () -> ok end)().' --user=Administrator --password=asdasd http://dn2:8091/diag/eval

works. And even

wget -O- --post-data='menelaus_util:reply_json(Req, [<<"ok">>], 200), done.' --user=Administrator --password=asdasd http://dn2:8091/diag/eval

works too.
