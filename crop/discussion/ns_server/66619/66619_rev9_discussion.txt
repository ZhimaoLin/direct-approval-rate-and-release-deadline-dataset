DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Monitor the caller that issues memcached ctrl commands.

The following are the changes added:
[1] Added a wrapper funtion in mc_client_binary module that gets
    the token and passes it as a parameter to the fun that is
    passed in to the wrapper function. The wrapper later releases
    the token.

[2] Made all the control commands defined in mc_client_binary
    module that need session token to accept the Token as a
    parameter.

[3] Removed the cmd_ctrl helper function that was defined to handle
    token server interactions. This is now being taken care of
    by the wrapper function.

[4] The ns_memcached module has been modified to utilize the above
    mentioned wrapper function in the context of all the exposed
    APIs that need session tokens. This would make sure that the
    caller process gets monitored by the token server and the current
    token gets reset whenever the caller process dies.
