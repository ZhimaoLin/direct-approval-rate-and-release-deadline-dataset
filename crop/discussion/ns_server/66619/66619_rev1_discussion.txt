DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Monitor the caller that issues memcached ctrl commands.

The following are the changes added:
[1] Added a wrapper function in ns_memcached module which would be
    called by all the exposed APIs that end up sending the specific
    control commands to memcached that need session token. This
    wrapper function gets the token and passes along the token to
    the mc_client_binary module. This would make sure that the
    caller process gets monitored by the token server and the
    current token gets reset whenever the caller process dies.

[2] The respective control command APIs in mc_client_binary module
    have been changed to accept 'Token' parameter.

[3] Have renamed the dictionary in ns_memcached_token module to
    signfiy what it's being used for.
