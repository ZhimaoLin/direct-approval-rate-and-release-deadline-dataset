Line:10, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_security/mn_user_roles/add_dialog/mn_user_roles_add_dialog_controller.js -> external user is available only when isLdapEnabled enabled. if you want to make builtin user default just leave {type: 'builtin'}

Line:10, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_security/mn_user_roles/add_dialog/mn_user_roles_add_dialog_controller.js -> But don't we still want "external user is available only when isLdapEnabled enabled"? I only care about which is selected by default.
