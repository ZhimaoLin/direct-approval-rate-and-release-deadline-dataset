Not sure about the change in _controller.js // It works to change the default radio button, but I don't understand the isLdapEnabled logic...

Line:85, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_security/mn_user_roles/add_dialog/mn_user_roles_add_dialog.html -> There can be other password restrictions now. Does this still make sense?

Line:2, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_security/mn_user_roles/mn_user_roles.html -> It's not clear to me whether or not we can remove this. I read through the emails with Don and it appeared there was still an open question as to whether this may or may not be useful.
