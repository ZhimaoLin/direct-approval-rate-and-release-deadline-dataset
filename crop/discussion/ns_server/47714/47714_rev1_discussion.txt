DESCRIPTION

Use new way of emitting keys in spatial views

The default spatial view function in the web console should follow best
practices. Since 3.0 the recommend way of emitting a GeoJSON geometry is
within an array. Emitting a GeoJSON geometry directly is only possible
for compatibility reasons.
