I thought about it but I had the feeling that reset_admin_password doesn't belong to web server. but on the other hand validate_cred doesn't really belong to misc

So at the end I agree with you.

Line:135, cbreset_password -> password has to be escaped somehow. Perhaps easiest way is to convert to json or something

Or perhaps even better if we pass password to erlang via stdin.

Line:135, cbreset_password -> " and \ are escaped. I don't think that anything else should be escaped since the password is in ""
