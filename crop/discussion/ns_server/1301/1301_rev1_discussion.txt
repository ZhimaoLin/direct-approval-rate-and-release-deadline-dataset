Patch Set 1: Verified

Patch Set 1:

This is more of an intrusive change, and harder to follow.

For example, if the anonymous Fun()'s were turned into named helper functions with short descriptive names, and there were unit tests against those helper functions, I think that would aid the reader a lot.
