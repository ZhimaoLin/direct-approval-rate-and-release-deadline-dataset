DESCRIPTION

run ns_bucket_sup:update_childs in another process. Bug 2737

Diag for bug 2737 suggests that ns_bucket_sup has reached max restart
frequency on some of ns_memcached childs and during it's resurrection
by parent supervisor we're having ns_config_events doing update_childs
call which in turn calls supervisor process at the same time as init
function in that supervisor does call to ns_config_events making it a
classic deadlock. The fix is to delegate update_childs to another
process freeing ns_config_events for supervisor initialization.
