DESCRIPTION

stop fooling ourselves about net_ticktime of 10 seconds

It was 10 seconds only on dev-mode clusters and (it appears)
windows. Lowering it now seems a bit scary as most of our testing was
for 60 seconds net_ticktime.

So I'm fixing it (making option effective), but changing default to
erlang's.
