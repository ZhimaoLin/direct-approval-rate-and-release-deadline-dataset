Haven't looked at this thoroughly yet. But mixing code for gsi indexes and fts in one makes things harder to understand (at least for me). Do you think having a callback module similarly to base_stats_collector could make things better?

I though about it but decided not to create additional modules for such small amount of code. I can try to redo it tomorrow and we'll see which version will be less confusing. Whatever method will allow to avoid massive copy/paste is ok with me.

Line:52, src/remote_api.erl -> Why not parameterize this, i.e. {get_indexes, index | fts} to avoid two almost identical handle_call clauses?

Line:264, src/index_status_keeper.erl -> This is completely unreadable. Can You refactor so each fun is a named function with a name that describes what it does and has parameter names that describes them instead of just Atom, List, and Bin.

Line:52, src/remote_api.erl -> This is called remotely. Parametrizing will create backward compatibility issue.

Line:52, src/remote_api.erl -> I think You misunderstood me. I meant that get_ft_indexes should do

do_call(Node, {get_indexes, fts} and similarly get_indexes.

Then You only need one 
handle_call({get_indexes, Type}, _From, State) ->
    {reply, index_status_keeper:get_indexes(Type), State}

Line:52, src/remote_api.erl -> old (sherlock) nodes will send get_indexes which won't be understood
