MB-9876: cbcollect_info: Don't break cb config format when sanitizing log

While writing a parser for the Couchbase config section of the
couchbase.log file, I found that cbcollect info corrupts the structure
of the Couchbase config when trying to sanitise the output of the log
file.

This is due to the replacement regex being too greedy and potentially
removing trailing '}' and ']' characters from the changed line.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

what if erlang decides to print password as list of numbers ?

This piece of code was always too naive to be completely correct. And fixes like that make it riskier. Perfect fix would involve sanitizing at config dumping script (and we have nice helper in misc.erl for sanitation already).

Patch Set 1:

I tested against the following passwords / sasl passwords:

"
"}
a"a"}
123

All of which are caught by the regex. Note that the config dumper already escapes any quote marks in the string.

Without this change it's essentially impossible to correctly parse the couchbase config file, which I'm trying to do to allow support to programmatically check for known issues when customers send their logs.

If this isn't deemed safe enough, can I request that someone who knows the config dumper fixes it.

Patch Set 1:

(Hmm, looks like the formatting of my previous quoted test passwords got mangled by Roselyn Villegas. Suffice to say I checked the usual suspects (i.e. the characters we close the regex with, and with a plain numeric password (which is printed as a string).
