Patch Set 24:

Overall the change looks good to me. But I noticed that it's not possible anymore to create documents via CAPI (i.e. curl -X PUT http://host:8092/default/test -d '{}' fails). And also attachments=true and getting attachments itself seems to be broken. Thus it's impossible to get the value of an item created via memcached.
