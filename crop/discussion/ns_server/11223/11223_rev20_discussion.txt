Patch Set 20: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

See comments inline. Can you please also use emacs-style indentation for ns_server code. If it's needed I can reindent it for you.

Line:98, src/capi_frontend.erl -> This will never match. Did you mean lists:foreach instead?

Line:290, src/couchbase_compaction_daemon.erl -> This will never match.

Line:2, src/xdc_rdoc_replication_srv.erl -> It should be 2011 Couchbase...

Line:94, src/cb_generic_replication_srv.erl -> This should be 'undefined' instead.
