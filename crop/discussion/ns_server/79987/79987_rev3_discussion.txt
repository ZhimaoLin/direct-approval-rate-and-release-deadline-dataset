Line:64, src/doc_replicator.erl -> Seems that you can replace the whole thing with just pipes:foreach(Producer, fun (Docs) -> ... end).

Line:70, src/doc_replicator.erl -> Since you're touching this, might also make sense to move from list comprehension to lists:foreach. The former unnecessarily creates a list that gets immediately discarded.
