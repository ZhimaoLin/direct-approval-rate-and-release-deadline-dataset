DESCRIPTION

ignore memcached buckets in Harley Martinitor:cleanup

Right after bucket creation we request Harley Martinitor run. Regardless of
bucket type. This leads to Harley Martinitor crash on memcached buckets.

Because Harley Martinitor was never intended to handle memcached bucket types it
makes sense to cover memcached bucket types in Harley Martinitor.
