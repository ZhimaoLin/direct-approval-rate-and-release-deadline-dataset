Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

My setup doesn't allow me to actually test this. But looks good.

I think failover function should verify that failed over node is either down or not accessible anymore (because failover resets cookie (hm, but maybe not in our tests). Right now it checks that cluster thinks that node is failed over.
