Patch Set 1: (4 inline comments)

Sorry for the "invasion", but noticed a few things.

Line:117, src/xdc_replicator.hrl -> Not needed. Accessible through rep_details. See my comment in xdc_replicator.erl

Line:456, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> Why yet another field to this gigantic record?

You have the doc_id accessible through (State#rep_state.rep_details)#rep.doc_id.

You're only wasting memory.

Line:903, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> Log message always put the PID of the caller. You don't need to add it yourself.
Makes this log message completely useless/unecessary.

Line:915, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> A space after : would make this more readable.
