DESCRIPTION

CBD-120: stats collection within XDCR manager and replicator

This change-set creates an ETS table in XDCR manager to store the
replication stats from all single replicators. The stat is stored at
level of per vbucket of each bucket, identified by XDocId and Vb id.
Stats per bucket is aggreated from stats from all vbuckets and dumped
in XDCR manager at a fixed interval, when the XDCR Vbucket replication
manager is scheduled.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

read-modify-write code here is inherently raceful

Line:456, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> what's the point here? XSTATS is constant right?

Line:32, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> macro. That comment states the obvious and thus of questionable quality

Line:456, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Yes, it is constant. We need pass this table to each replicator. It is not a good idea we access the table defined in xdcr manager directly in couch replicator.

Line:32, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> Will remove in next patch-set
