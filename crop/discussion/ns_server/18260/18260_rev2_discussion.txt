DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: remove unsupported replication in replication worker

In XDCR, all replications come with target #httpdb{} while all
sources are passed as #db{}. In function local_process_batch,
the source and target must be #db{} and #httpdb{} respectively.
This change-set will remove unused code and add log in function
find_missing().
