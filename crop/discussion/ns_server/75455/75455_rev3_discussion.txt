Patch Set 3:

This change adds 'plasma' as an index storage mode. It doesn't restrict usage of "forestdb". This is to allow the UI team to make progress. The restriction in the REST API will be brought in (in a separate commit) once the UI commits the initial changes.

Line:111, src/menelaus_web_indexes.erl -> If this module is aware of actual values of storageMode (see acceptable_values below) why don't you just match to them in this case instead of using is_... functions and tuples? If you want to use defines, you can add them to common.hrl
