Line:131, src/menelaus_web_indexes.erl -> it makes sense to use the same defines here as well. The values you check against this list are binaries anyways.

Line:131, src/menelaus_web_indexes.erl -> I tried it. The value that we get in "validate_string" is actually a binary but we are converting it back to list before comparing against "acceptable_values"  and there it fails with a clause_error.

We have "acceptable_values" for both logLevel and storageMode. This would mean that I'll have to change the logLevel's acceptable values to binary also. Hence I didn't change to use the defines.

Line:131, src/menelaus_web_indexes.erl -> So we shouldn't convert back to list in validate_string and and add <<>> to all values in logLevel list.
