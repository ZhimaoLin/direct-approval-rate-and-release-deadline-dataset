DESCRIPTION

eliminate 'expensive' checks in ns_hearth. MB-5174

Same info is sent, but we don't treat this stuff as "expensive"
anymore. Because it's not, compared to other stuff we're gathering.

Thus it eliminates this race mentioned in MB-5174 where ns_heart can
reply to remote status calls but don't have "expensive" info gathered.
