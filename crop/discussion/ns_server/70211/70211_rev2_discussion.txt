DESCRIPTION

Don't pull config from remote node before merging dynamic config.

It was there to prevent conflicts on {node, node(), membership} that
is set with vclock as part of merging in of dynamic config. Instead we
just set it using set_initial option, like we do with some other keys.

Generally, the set of per-node keys that can be modified remotely is
limited, and I believe it's better to be explicit about them.
