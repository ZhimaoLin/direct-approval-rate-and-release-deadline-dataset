DESCRIPTION

remove failed nodes from ejectNodes list for rebalance.MB-3623

ns_rebalancer doesn't expect this and it causes node that's failed
over to be briefly added to list of servers. This triggers bucket
deletion issue.

Because it's too easy to use our API incorrectly, we're working around
that by removing failed over nodes from ejectNodes list.
