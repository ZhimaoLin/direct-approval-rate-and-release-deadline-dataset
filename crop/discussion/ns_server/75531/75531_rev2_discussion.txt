DESCRIPTION

MB-23429: Specify socket path to saslauthd in memcached.json

It may be modified with the following command:

curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
     -X POST \
     http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
     --data saslauthd_socketpath=/new/path

If this patch is to be merged it has to be extended to pick
out the setting specified in the environement variable
CBAUTH_SOCKPATH as this patch overwrites the default
handling in memcached.

Patch Set 2:

I'm not sure that I understand why do we need this if memcached can grab the path from CBAUTH_SOCKPATH

Patch Set 2:

Picking it up from an environment variable require a restart of memcached if it is to be changed... by being able to pass it on here we can change it without having to do a memcached (and if it is empty memcached won't even need to do any file io to determine if it should try to look in saslauthd)

Patch Set 2:

It means the defaulting can go in one place (ultimately) which is nice. Not a "must-have" for spock, but fine by me if we do it.

Patch Set 2:

This change is incomplete then without passing the sock path to saslauthd port.

Patch Set 2:

It would be nice if someone in the ns_server team could fix that. It would be a lot easier for memcached if we could take all configuration parameters through settings in memcached instead of a mix of env variables and settings in the configuration file. An extra benefit of only using the configuration file is that it is a lot easier to see which settings is being used (in a normal installation people can't grab the environment setting of the process on linux as it runs under a different user).
