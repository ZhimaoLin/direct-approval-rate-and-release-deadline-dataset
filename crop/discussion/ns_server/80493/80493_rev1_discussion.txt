Line:60, src/indexer_fts.erl -> I'm thinking total_compaction_written_bytes needs to be a gague?  e.g., move it up to line 56-57?

Line:60, src/indexer_fts.erl -> Hi Steve, I guess you are suggesting this to support the ever increasing "total_compaction_written_bytes" stat?
But you remember, from our email conversation what I understood was having a bytes written rate would be easier for the end user  to perceive the compaction running/progress status.

Else, from an ever increasing curve focussed observation is needed to realise the upward movement of the curve Or there by realising the existence of back ground compaction or progress of compaction was the point we discussed..

Please let me know whether we need to fallback to the original ever increasing stat.

Patch Set 1:

On a third thought, I guess an ever increasing stat make sense if we are plotting that to a step curve...in that scenario, may be we don't need reset the stat to zero.

Other moss change can be dropped.
And from a step curve, user can easily figure out if its climbing up or its stagnant / parallel to x-axis against the last compaction bytes written stat.

that way, it would align with our original plan as well.??
thanks,
