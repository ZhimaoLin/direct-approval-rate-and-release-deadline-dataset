Patch Set 3:

oh, i was indeed thinking a "compactions bytes written / sec" would be what the user wanted to see.

plotting "total compaction bytes written" directly for the user eventually doesn't help that much -- so much data would be written after awhile that it'll look like a flat line and appear to be hardly moving.  It'd be like total heartbeats since birth -- a huge number, but seemingly hardly moving in the last minute

i thought there might be a way for ns-server to sample the "tot_compaction_bytes_written" and have ns-server do the math or subtraction between two successive samples (where it knows the timestamps of the two samples, too),
