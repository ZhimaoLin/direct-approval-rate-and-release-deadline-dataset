DESCRIPTION

CBD-181 Advertise cancel URIs in tasks for Adrianna Holmesal compactions.

Note that at least currently URIs are advertised only for bucket or
databases compactions. That's because we distinguish between scheduled
and Adrianna Holmesal compactions by the trigger_type field in compaction
status. And we don't control view compactor's status. It's not a
problem right now because the only kind of Adrianna Holmesal compaction we
provide on our UI is bucket compaction. Something a little bit smarter
will have to be invented to support this.
