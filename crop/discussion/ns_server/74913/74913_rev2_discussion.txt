Line:44, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/failover_dialog/mn_servers_failover_dialog.html -> Can we add a <br> here to put the checkbox confirmation on the next line?

Line:36, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/failover_dialog/mn_servers_failover_dialog.html -> I noticed if I click failover after stopping a rebalance I get this warning message when I try to do a hard failover. If I dismiss the modal and click the failover button again and try to do a hard failover then I get a different failover message.

Line:57, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/failover_dialog/mn_servers_failover_dialog.html -> This can be done separately, but we are missing a confirmation checkbox here.

Line:44, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/failover_dialog/mn_servers_failover_dialog.html -> ok

Line:36, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/failover_dialog/mn_servers_failover_dialog.html -> This is how it worked before. If we have some bug here, it should be considered separately

Line:57, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/failover_dialog/mn_servers_failover_dialog.html -> The logic moved from old UI. We had the same logic there. see  getNodeStatuses
