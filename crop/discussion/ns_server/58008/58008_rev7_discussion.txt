DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: improved mnPoll

Line:27, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> don't you want to pass the start timestamp to doCall() here?

Line:36, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> is not used and can be removed

Line:36, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> not used and can be removed

Line:63, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> Can we rename this function to be: isNotStopped(startTimestamp)?

The semantics of this function are: if the poller were started at startTimestamp the function will return true if the poller is not stopped and false otherwise. 

I'd also be happy if you would like to invert the logic and change the name to isStopped(startTimestamp).
