Patch Set 6:

Let's consider the following situation

1. cycle started
2. we want to reload cycle in the same time doCall still in progress, it has status "pending" and for new logic value of timestamp is 1.

With old logic:
1. reload()
2. stop() sets flag isCanceled as true;
3. reload() sets flag isCanceled as false; (we need this in order to allow new doCall)
4. new doCall()
5. status of old doCall() becomes 200;
6. isCanceled === false, self.deferred.notify(result) is going to be notified using result of old doCall (BUG)

With new logic 
1. reload()
2. stop() sets stopTimestamp as 2
3. new doCall() has timestamp 3
5. status of old doCall() becomes 200; (with timestamp 1)
6. !(1 >= 2) === true // return; (there is no BUG)
7. new doCall() becomes 200; (with timestamp 3)
8. !(3 >= 2) === false //continue new cycle

Line:29, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> Ok, I get it. 

Can you do the following: 
1) add a new method on Poller called isStoppedAtTime(startTimestamp) the semantics of which should be returns true if the poller is stopped if it had been started at startTimestamp

Refactor the various checks on whether the poller is stopped by calling the method. I think it'll make it a lot easier to the review. 

Thanks for the explanation!
