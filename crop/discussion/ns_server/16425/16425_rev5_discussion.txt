DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: implemented much faster memcached stats gathering

New implementation via mc_binary:quick_stats/5 uses
inet:setopts(Sock,[{active,once}]) to efficiently read all data from
socket and port driver. That data is then parsed. This ends up more
than twice faster than plain stats call that makes trip to driver
twice (for header and body) for each stat entry.
