DESCRIPTION

implemented new computation of failover safeness level

We still expose it as replication completion level as a number from 0
to 1. Where 0 means no replication, and 1 means up-to-date w.r.t
replication.

Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

+2.718 for the first commit that uses e somewhere in the code.

But, marking as -1 due to a question.

Line:321, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Question: did we lose the "backfilling" input as part of this computation, or is that encoded as part of safeness_level?
