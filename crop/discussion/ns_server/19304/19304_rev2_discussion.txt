Patch Set 2:

I could not get your overlimit logic at all.

And after more thinking:

* I think KISS is really important don't think we need this limit be configurable

* I plan to have different server API for listing docs (excluding deleted docs and stuff like that) where I'll address this skip limit problem

I think we don't need this commit. We'll have a natural limit with new API
