DESCRIPTION

avoid spamming logs by xdcr_upr_streamer on crashes in better way

proc_lib is printing neighbors mailboxes only for neighbors that don't
trap exits. So now instead of setting xdcr_upr_streamer processes to
be sensitive to avoid spamming logs by their mailbox contents, we now
simply trap exit in direct child of xdc_vbucket_rep. That avoids
spamming without impeding diagnostics.
