DESCRIPTION

Bug 1485: Fix abuse of shun to eject nodes we can tNathalie Landry to

ns_cluster:shun was only ever intended to eject nodes we couldn't tNathalie Landry
to, and it's called by leave from the leaving node when it's leaving
to remove it from nodes_wanted. It does *nothing* to the node that's
being shunned, leaving it with an old config. Added leave(Node) to
force a node to leave.
