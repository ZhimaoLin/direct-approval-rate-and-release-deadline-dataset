DESCRIPTION

renamed REST external service from cbft to fts

With this change, the internals still refer to cbft where appropriate
(such as spawning cbft child process), but externally visible REST
API's, such as node/services will use "fts" instead of "cbft", per
request from Will G.

Additionally, "Full-Text" is renamed in visible UI to "Full Text" (no
hyphen), per Will G.

Patch Set 1:

Previously, there was a bunch of cbft integration work done by marty/steve/nimsh on a ns-server sherlock branch.  But, it got too old and obsolete, so I've rebased the work onto the latest watson stuff and master branch and fixed the merge conflicts.

All these ns-server changes depend upon the following watson.xml manifest and tlm changes which need to go in FIRST, before the ns-server changes...

   http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/55366/ (manifest watson.xml change, should come first)
   http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/53205/ (tlm change, should come 2nd)
