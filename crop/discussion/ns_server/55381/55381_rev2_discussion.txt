DESCRIPTION

renamed REST external service from cbft to fts

With this change, the internals still refer to cbft where appropriate
(such as spawning cbft child process), but externally visible REST
API's, such as node/services will use "fts" instead of "cbft", per
request from Will G.

Additionally, "Full-Text" is renamed in visible UI to "Full Text" (no
hyphen), per Will G.
