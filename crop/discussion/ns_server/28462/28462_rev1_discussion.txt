DESCRIPTION

MB-8150 disallow certain ports for cluster and bucket init

- default epmd port (4369)
- ports from erlang kernel port range
- current rest api port (for buckets)
- moxi port
- 2 memcached ports : mccouch_port, dedicated_port, port
- capi port
- any of the existing buckets ports

the fix is made with the assumption that we have one
node per box.

Patch Set 1:

couple of notes:
1. I did check that there are no rpc calls to ns_bucket:is_open_proxy_port in 1.8.1 code
2. considering that there is is_port_free method that doesn't require bucket name, ns_bucket is probably not the right place for all this code. should I move it to ns_config or somewhere else?

Patch Set 1:

I think best destination to move this code is menelaus_web or even menelaus_web_buckets. Not ns_config I think.
