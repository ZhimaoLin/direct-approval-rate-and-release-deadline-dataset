DESCRIPTION

MB-8150 disallow certain ports for cluster and bucket init

- default epmd port (4369)
- ports from erlang kernel port range
- current rest api port (for buckets)
- moxi port
- 2 memcached ports : mccouch_port, dedicated_port, port
- capi port
- any of the existing buckets ports

the fix is made with the assumption that we have one
node per box.
