DESCRIPTION

MB-9209: fix unbounded worker stats dictionary

We incorrectly used {<pid>, <unique ref>} from worker processes as
the key used to store worker stats in the vb replicator state. The
problem is each time a worker returns a different <unique ref> that
causes a new entry is created when worker reports stats to the vb
replicator. Overtime, the stats table will increase unboundedly,
causing memory leak. This fix uses a unique worker id to identify
each worker process and use that id as the key of worker stats table.
Thus the number of entries of vb stats table will be bounded by the
number of worker processes (default is 4).

Patch Set 2:

my bit of concern is that on actual crash dumps we have we're observing pids to refer to dead processes.

So I'm going to double check why this is the case but so far appears that worker processes are not "stable" (come and go).

I'm not yet sure how and if this is indeed the case. Give me some time to double check the code.

Also I think we actually need hotfix for 2.1.1. But lets start with merging it to for-rackaware branch which is what 2.5.0 is going to be

Thanks Alk. I will make a backport commit to 2.1.1

Ravi and Alk, 

I think 2.2 is also subject to the same issue. Shall we  keep this commit to backport the fix to 2.2?  Thanks.
