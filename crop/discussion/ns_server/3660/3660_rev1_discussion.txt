DESCRIPTION

Add replication status to bucket JSON

/pools/default/buckets/$BUCKET now has "replication": <float> where
the float is a number between 0 and 1 representing how "caught up"
replication is from that node to any other node. Currently it's 0.0 if
any of the replicators isn't running, 0.5 if they're running but
there's a backfill in progress, or 1.0 if they're running and no
backfill is in progress.
