Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

This looks good. I added some better vertical spacing and made the validation errors more readable. If this will work without the 0 values, this is a big improvement.

Patch Set 3:

If input type number is empty it should have value null, but we loose it during serialization of params. I think we should convert null value into empty string during serialization.
