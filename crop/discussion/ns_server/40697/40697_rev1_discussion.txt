Line:22, priv/public/angular/auth/auth.html -> you don't need name attr isn't?

Line:20, priv/public/angular/wizard/step5/step5_service_test.js -> it might easily fail. Your _.serializeData may order properties arbitrarily

Line:22, priv/public/angular/auth/auth.html -> I haven't thought about that yet. I had planned to pay attention on that later in separate work.

Line:20, priv/public/angular/wizard/step5/step5_service_test.js -> right, will be fixed by adding sorting inside of serializeData
