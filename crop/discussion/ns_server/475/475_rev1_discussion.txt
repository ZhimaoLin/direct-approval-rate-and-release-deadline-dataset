Patch Set 1: No score; Looks good to me, approved

Code looks good, but hard to read if it matches spec.  Will check that during verification.

Patch Set 1: Verified

I know this says "initial", so I'm not expecting it to be perfect.  Just looking it over though in review, the things on the screen should be:

Bucket Settings
Access Control (missing, has sasl password, etc)
Cache Size
Storage Size
Replication
Blocking Behavior on Writes

Refer to 21_bucket_details_EDIT.jpg

Line:951, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> Missing SASL password auth here.  Final will need this.

Line:960, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> Blocking behavior should be the last thing on the lightbox.

Line:984, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> should be below storage size
