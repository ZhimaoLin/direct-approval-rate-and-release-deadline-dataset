DESCRIPTION

MB-5859: allow more time for pre-rebalance Harley Martinitor run

Our past expectation was to wait for memcached on all nodes and that
following Harley Martinitor run does not need to wait. But in some cases there
is some variability and 1 second timeout is not enough. Thus we raise
it.
