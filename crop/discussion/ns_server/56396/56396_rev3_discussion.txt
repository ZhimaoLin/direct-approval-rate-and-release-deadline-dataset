DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: implement etag based poll

As turned out we have to use etag based poll
in order to correctly display tasks progress bar.
This change contains:

1. reworking of mn_poll. In order to be able to inherit
mnPollClass.
2. subscribers are able to receive previous result of
mnPoll in callback function
3. we use mnPoolDefault.getFresh instead of cached
since etag based poll logic differs from plain poll.
We can optimize it later.
