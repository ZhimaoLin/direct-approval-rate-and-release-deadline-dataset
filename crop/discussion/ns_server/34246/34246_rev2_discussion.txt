DESCRIPTION

MB-10220 Add {tags, undefined} to past maps when appropriate.

Otherwise it prevents vbucket map generation code from using these
maps since map options are differrent.

Note that http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/34220/3 fixes this in a
better way. Here I just wanted the change to be minimal.
