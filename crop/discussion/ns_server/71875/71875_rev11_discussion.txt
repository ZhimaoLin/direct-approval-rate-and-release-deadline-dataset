DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: cluster_run changes to pass IPv6 param.

The cluster_run script has been modified to pass in the right
parameters to the "erl" command based on an environment variable
called "IPV6". The following is how one could start a cluster in
IPV6 mode:

"IPV6=true ./cluster_run --nodes 3"

Line:341, cluster_run -> This is used in the node renaming sequence. We query the Google Public DNS, via 8.8.8.8 address, to determine the IP address of the machine and use that to rename the node. Since we are not supporting raw IPv6 addresses I didn't do the equivalent for IPv6 here.
