DESCRIPTION

MB-10409:[WIP] cluster_run changes to pass IPv6 param.

This change is just a place holder. The final approach to enable
IPv6 is yet to be decided. This currently enables us to test the
IPv6 changes made in ns_server. IPv6 mode can be enabled by setting
an environment variable called "IPV6" to 1.
