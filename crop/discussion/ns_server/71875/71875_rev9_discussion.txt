DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: cluster_run changes to pass IPv6 param.

The cluster_run script has been modified to pass in the right
parameters to the "erl" command based on an environment variable
called "IPV6". The following is how one could start a cluster in
IPV6 mode:

"IPV6=true ./cluster_run --nodes 3"
