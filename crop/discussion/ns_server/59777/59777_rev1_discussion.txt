DESCRIPTION

MB-17262: correct "show this server" link

The "Show this Server" link is shown on the specific state analytics
page. The title of the graph is computed as the IP address of the
host with the port removed if it's 8091. This is done by this bit
of code:
https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/blob/master/src/menelaus_stats.erl#L2394

What this means is that the title is an incorrect hostname to pass
as the statsHostname parameter when the link is clicked.

What should be passed is the name.slice(1) as is done in the old UI.
