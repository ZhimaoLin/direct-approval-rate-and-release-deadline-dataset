Patch Set 2:

BTW, Dave, please take into account that -2 is sometimes perceived as strong indication. "Don't merge". Which some people may perceive as "this is bad idea in principle".

I.e. in my opinion -1 could be enough.

And thanks for taking a look and finding a flaw.

Patch Set 2:

Also in practice -2 versus -1 requires original -2-er to remove his vote before any subsequent revision of patch can be merged. I.e. -2 is a kind of veto (which I can overrule). Keep this in mind.
