Patch Set 4:

@Alk: Thanks for the clarification. In my defence:-

1) Roselyn Villegas labels -1 and -2 as:

> -1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this
> -2 Do not submit

"Do not submit" seems pretty fair for a change whose whole purpose is to add a label to the UI, and the label is incorrectly spelt.

2) Secondly, I haven't seen your description of -1 and -2 documented anywhere. If we have this somewhere then great (and it would be good if it was better advertised). If not, then I think we should have a "developer guide" explaining what the policies and procedure for our development practices.

I think this is particularly important as the company expands, to ensure we have a consistent and well-understood process - to prevent exactly this sort of misunderstanding.
