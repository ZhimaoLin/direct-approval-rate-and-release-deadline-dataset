DESCRIPTION

MB-9862: reuse memcached sockets in find_missing_revs

pooled_memcached_client:execute_with_socket logic was only treating
{ok, _} as successfull return. Causing find_missing_revs which returns
triple to not return sockets to pool.

This is now fixed by treating any return of tuple which starts with ok
as successful response.
