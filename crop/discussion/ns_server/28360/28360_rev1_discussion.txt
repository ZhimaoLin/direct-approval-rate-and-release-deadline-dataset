this appears to help a lot, but will require some perf-testing.

Any thoughts before we pass this to perf folks ?

See minor comment inline.

I also noticed that with your change RSIZE of uninitialized node's beam.smp grew from about 220MiB to 1.4GiB on my machine.

Line:55, deps/ns_babysitter/src/child_erlang.erl -> This will have no effect. Erlang VM will reset it to MAX_CACHE_SIZE which is 30.

Patch Set 1:

Here's steps I've made:

*) bump that "cached msegs limit" in erlang and rebuild it. Double check it works. Tried to bump it in our settings. Found it to not help significantly

*) there was a thread recently in erlang questions ml about memory tuning. I revisited it then erts_alloc documentation. And then I bumped single carrier threshold, bumped multi carrier sizes in effort to make their allocator actually work (and not dumbly delegate to mmap). It helped a bit, but far less than I expected. And yes memory usage has grown quite a bit

*) I was going to accept my defeat, but then I tried setting address ordered best fit in a thought "there's something else going on, it can't be that bad with that much ram". And it made quite a significant jump down.

Today I'd like to see how much I can lower those memory tuning values to lower memory usage while keeping memory allocation rates low. And I'll have to see if there's significant perf impact from my changes. There is probably some. On the other hand mmap and page faults are not fast too, so avoiding them should help. So looking forward seeing that.
