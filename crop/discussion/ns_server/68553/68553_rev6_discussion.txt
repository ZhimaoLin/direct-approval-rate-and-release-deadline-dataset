DESCRIPTION

MB-21281: Add pluggable UI support for UI-compat-versions

With this change pluggable UI components can tell
ns_server where to find the head.frag.html file for different
UI compat versions. This allows pluggable UI components to use
different web resources for different UI version and to adapt
to whatever directory structure is convenient.

A new version-dirs attribute is added to the pluggable UI
config. E.g.
  "version-dirs": [
      {"version": [4, 5], "dir": "."},
      {"version": [5, 0], "dir": "spock"}
  ],

This tells ns_server that the head.frag.html for 4.5 is
to be found under the $doc-root/. (where $doc-root is the
component's specified doc root) and under
$doc-root/spock for 5.0. The pluggable component writer is
free to choose directories that work well for them and
to create head fragment files that share resources.

If no version-dirs attribute is explicit provided,
{"version": [4, 5], "dir": "."} is assumed by default (this
provides backward compatibility for existing pluggable UI
configs.)

Line:411, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> you don't really need atom_to_list here unless you want service name to be in "". ~p will print atom without any "" as it is already done in handle_must_get_fragment
