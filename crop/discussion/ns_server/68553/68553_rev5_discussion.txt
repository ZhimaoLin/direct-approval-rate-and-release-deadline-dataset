DESCRIPTION

MB-21281: Add pluggable UI support for UI-compat-versions

With this change pluggable UI components can tell
ns_server where to find the head.frag.html file for different
UI compat versions. This allows pluggable UI components to use
different web resources for different UI version and to adapt
to whatever directory structure is convenient.

A new version-dirs attribute is added to the pluggable UI
config. E.g.
  "version-dirs": [
      {"version": [4, 5], "dir": "."},
      {"version": [5, 0], "dir": "spock"}
  ],

This tells ns_server that the head.frag.html for 4.5 is
to be found under the $doc-root/. (where $doc-root is the
component's specified doc root) and under
$doc-root/spock for 5.0. The pluggable component writer is
free to choose directories that work well for them and
to create head fragment files that share resources.

If no version-dirs attribute is explicit provided,
{"version": [4, 5], "dir": "."} is assumed by default (this
provides backward compatibility for existing pluggable UI
configs.)

Line:405, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Here's what I don't like about this:

If the plugin does not define any version dirs, the head fragment will always be expected in one of the document roots regardless of  UiCompatVersion, and this is ok. But if you specify at least one version dir, you will have to specify it separately for all possible UIVersions. And every time we introduce new UIVersion all such plugins will have to modify their configuration. I suggest to replace the exact version match with finding the version dir for version <= UICompatVersion

Line:403, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> This needs to be DocRoots to avoid confusion.

Line:405, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> we agreed that this is correct behavior

Line:411, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> consider using html_comment helper here and also ?log_error

Line:403, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Certainly. I left it as I found it, but agree DocRoots is better. Will do.

Line:405, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Done

Line:411, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Yes, of course, good idea about the html_comment. This will show when we bump the version number but a pluggable component hasn't yet done the work to make itself available under the new UI compat version. There could be some debate as to whether that's an error condition or a warning / info condition, but I'm not too pushed either way so I'll put it in as an error as you suggest.
