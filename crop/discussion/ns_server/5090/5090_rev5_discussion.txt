DESCRIPTION

speedup filename:absname calls in ns_storage_conf

filename:absname calls file:get_cwd each time, which is quite costly
as it's call to other erlang process. Optimized implementation omits
this costly call for commmon case of absolute pathes.

Patch Set 5:

I haven't measured isolated effect of this commit, but it was significant on profile and most of time was wasted on needless call to get_cwd.
