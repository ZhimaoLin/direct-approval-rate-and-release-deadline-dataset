DESCRIPTION

speedup filename:absname calls in ns_storage_conf

filename:absname calls file:get_cwd each time, which is quite costly
as it's call to other erlang process. Optimized implementation omits
this costly call for commmon case of absolute pathes.

Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)

How much of a win is this change? It seems like it adds needless complexity.

Line:984, src/misc.erl -> Why is this faster than filename:absname?
