DESCRIPTION

MB-8158:  replace 'git describe' with DEFAULT_VERSION=2.1.0

The 'git describe' command will return the latest tag that is
included in the source.  Since we tag after release, this value
will always be something based on the previous release.  So the
2.0.0 release used 1.8.1, 2.0.1 used 2.0.0.  Also, if someone
adds a tag, the name of that tag will be used instead of the
ones containing a version string.

In this change, use the DEFAULT_VERSION, which on master is 2.1.0,
or if the PRODUCT_VERSION is defined, use that.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

my understanding is that product builds are not using git describe of ns_server. They are instead overridden by voltron's.

Plus this is major change in a way we do product versions which has to be widely discussed first. IMHO

In case I'm not right PRODUCT_VERSION needs to die then
