DESCRIPTION

MB-100: mark expected failed cells test as expected failing

I.e. because I've just spent 10 minutes bisecting for this
failure. And predictably, ended up discovering that I've created this
failing unit test long time ago planning to fix cells to make it pass.

Given plans for cells, it'll clearly not going to be fixed. So we need
to either remove that test or just mark it as expect passing to
prevent folks from wasting time trying to fix it.
