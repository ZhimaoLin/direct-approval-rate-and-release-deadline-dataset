Line:1368, priv/public/index.html -> I did like the higher readability of the previous single-line-per js.

Patch Set 1:

There's some information on the web that suggests that IE7 will load scripts sequentially. It would be nice if you could extend your commit message with links that indicate why we're doing this and what is expected win.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

IE7 loads ordinary <script>s sequentially so this should help there. But it'll only load 2 at once due to RFC2616 that recommends 2 connections per host.

IE8 (tested), FF3.6 (tested) and Chrome 11 (tested) and presumably any other modern browser does <script> loading in parallel. So effect of LABjs is zero on them.

And we definitely need strict (or nearly strict) ordering of scripts. And because UI is live only when app.js is done there's no point in out-of-order loading.

I think LABjs is overkill.
