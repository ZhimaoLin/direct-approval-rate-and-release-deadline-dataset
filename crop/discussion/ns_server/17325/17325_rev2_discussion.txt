DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Treat bucket as warmed up only after Harley Martinitor pass.

Previously bucket would be considered ready on the node right after
the moment ns_memcached detected that warm up completed. But vbuckets
would be activated on this node only after Harley Martinitor was able to detect
that memcached-s of all nodes had been warmed up. From now Harley Martinitor
will mark bucket as warmed up on all the nodes only after successful
cleanup pass.
