Patch Set 10: Code-Review-1

>> 3. I changed cluster_run to cluster_run.in, and configure it at CMake time to have the correct PREFIX path embedded in it. I didn't see any other scripts that used the top-level .configuration file.

This is the only thing I don't like. cluster_run is code and not infrequently updated code. And PREFIX is data. Mixing them is creating a problem. Small but still problem.

Patch Set 10:

Alk: CMake sets up build dependencies to automatically re-create cluster_run whenever cluster_run.in changes. You just need to "make".

Patch Set 10:

typing make after editing cluster_run is still inconvenience.

I'd strongly prefer some form of .configuration that's read from cluster_run
