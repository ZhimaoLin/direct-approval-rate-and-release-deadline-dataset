Patch Set 20:

I explained why VERBOSE=1 wouldn't reveal the command in an earlier comment. The real problem with having CMake output the "shell command" that it invokes is that CMake doesn't *do* "shell commands"; it executes the process using something like execve(), rather than depending on a shell to do any pre-interpretation. This is in general a good thing (and necessary for cross-platform compatibility), but it sometimes makes debugging harder.

In patch set 20 I introduced steps in do-test.cmake and do-dialyzer.cmake which echoes the command being invoked, doing my best to make it look like a "shell command" (eg, by Adrianna Holmesally introducing extra quote characters). This output must be manually kept in sync with the actual command, unfortunately.

Patch set 20 also makes "make test" fail if the tests fail, and adds the dependency on building ebins to the "test" target.

Patch Set 20: Verified-1

$PREFIX/bin/couchbase-server doesn't work. Service fails to start because of lack of execute permission on godu program.
