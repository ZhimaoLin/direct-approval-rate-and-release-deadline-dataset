Patch Set 14:

Patch set 13 introduces fallback Go-compilation support, along with a FindCouchbaseGo.cmake script that might be the start of something useful in other projects.

On unknown platforms, it will search for go or gccgo and use them to create generate_cert and vbmap binaries, which will then be installed as normal.

I still uses the pre-compiled binaries in priv/ for known platform for two reasons:

1. There are a few compilation options in the prebuild_vbmap and prebuild_generate_cert GNUmakefile targets that will only work on Linux and that I don't understand well enough to attempt to copy.

2. When compiled with gccgo on my Ubuntu system, "generate_cert" dumps core. It runs OK with golang's compiler, and vbmap seems to run OK with either compiler. Still.

Patch Set 14: Verified-1

Sorry, now make doesn't work:

# make -j4 
make: *** No rule to make target `deps_all', needed by `all'.  Stop.

Also I don't know if it means anything but is it ok that it prints this:

-- COUCHBASE_PLT set to 

when in fact COUCHBASE_PLT is not empty ?
