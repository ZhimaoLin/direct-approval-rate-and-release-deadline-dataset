Patch Set 17:

Patch set 17 includes making "dialyzer" target depend on "ns_server" to ensure all is built. Also causes "dialyzer" targets to fail if the dialyzer step fails.

Also fixes erlwsh compilation (the beam files were being placed in the CMake binary directory - not sure when that behaviour changed).

Patch Set 17: Verified-1

Dialyzer still fails.

Also may I ask you to set some flag or something so that cmakes stops hiding commands that its executing ? Particularly it looks like dialyzer invocation is incorrect and I cannot see that because of that controversial "feature" of cmake.

Patch Set 17:

Dialyzer fails for me the same way in the original ns_server as it does with all my changes, so unfortunately I can't debug this any further.

There is no single simple flag to get the command output you seek. "make VERBOSE=1 ..." will output everything make does, but there is a great deal of CMake-introduced noise in there.

In the particular case of dialyzer, I had to create a separate CMake script which is invoked at runtime (cmake_modules/do-dialyzer.cmake). The quickest way to see what is being invoked there would be to change the line

EXECUTE_PROCESS (COMMAND dialyzer --plt couchbase.plt ${DIALYZER_FLAGS}

to eg.

EXECUTE_PROCESS (COMMAND echo dialyzer --plt couchbase.plt ${DIALYZER_FLAGS}
