Patch Set 6: Verified-1

I failed to build with this patch due to:

1) The FindErlang is in "conflict" with the other one. We need to merge them (or use different naming for the variables. out of the box the test to find rebar was skipped ==> failure)

2) There are "conflicting" target names. When I tried to do an "add_subdirectory()" for ns_server cmake didn't like that both couchdb and ns_server tried to define a dialyzer target.

3) cluster_run fails.. it looks for .configuration

(I'm currently trying to build the stuff on windows and see if I can work around these problems there)

Patch Set 6:

That's not major but may I ask you to move .cmake things out of scripts/ and into cmake/ ? They are not scripts in a sense that they are not executable. So scripts/ is not best place for them.

Also consider getting rid of trailing whitespace in some files.

Line:10, GNUmakefile -> why is that ?

Patch Set 6:

Yes, we'll need prefix in .configure or some equivalent. So that cluster_run can discover PREFIX where everything is installed
