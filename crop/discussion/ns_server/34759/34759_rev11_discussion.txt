Very well; I restored the config file. I renamed it to build/cluster_run.configuration as it is a generated file and is now unique to cluster_run. It is regenerated at cmake/configure time as always. cluster_run.in renamed back to cluster_run.

Another thing that we spotted is that COUCHBASE_PLT environment variable is not respected anymore. That's super-important feature for me particularly. And it needs to be brought back.

Line:145, CMakeLists.txt -> Yes, but you told me you were OK with having the compilation targets for those binaries being Linux-only.
