Patch Set 12:

Patch set 12 re-introduces COUCHBASE_PLT env var support. It will be read at CMake/configure time and dialyzer targets will use that value going forward. It may be defined via a -DCOUCHBASE_PLT arg to CMake if desired, but if the env var is set it will take precedence. As such I didn't add specific support for it in the configure script; just set the env var like you would have before.

Patch Set 12: Verified-1

It looks like it confuses prefix and couchdb-src. I.e.:

# ./configure --prefix=`realpath ../repo30/install` --couchdb-src=`realpath ../repo30/cmake/couchdb`
couhdbsrc is /root/src/altoros/moxi/repo30/cmake/couchdb
couhdbsrc is /root/src/altoros/moxi/repo30/cmake/couchdb

Patch Set 12:

Also thinking more about gccgo issue.

Aliaksey presented good argument to me in favor of having gccgo fallback. It's not just about giving Trond chance to run his shiny favorite os. It's also about all kinds of potential contributors running their favorite os.

And it from my cmake-ignorant point of view it doesn't look like very hard thing. I.e. instead of warning user about unknown system (or crashing build which would be better), we could do that gccgo invocation that current Makefile is doing.

Is there any specific problem porting that gccgo call?

Patch Set 12:

In the parch I uploaded a long time ago I used go if it was available or gccgo if go wasn't available (and never using those "cached" versions, but it should be a simple thing to add that as well)

Patch Set 12:

I'm looking at the prefix/couchdb-src confusion; that seemed to work for me.

Regarding gccgo, if I'm going to figure out how to compile go stuff, I'm going to make it actually use go/gccgo to recompile those binaries as part of the build, and delete the pre-compiled binaries in priv/. Let's not pretend that Go is optional if it's not. I was hoping not to have to get into that because it'll probably take an extra day, and I hate delaying getting a successful build on platforms we DO support in favor of getting them working on platforms we DON'T support. But if that's required, let's do it.

Patch Set 12:

Agree with unblocking everything first.

But some basic level of sanity must be there. Is that really hard to port those gccgo invocations? If it is, then please at least make build fail of choosing prebuilt binary did not work.
