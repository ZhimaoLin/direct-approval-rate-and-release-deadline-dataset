The later appears to be bug in rebar.config of gen_smtp.

Patch Set 16:

make dialyzer fails (I'll see why shortly). But even worse is that make command succeeds! And the later is not acceptable.

Patch Set 16:

dialyzer fails because erlwsh application is not built at all.

Patch Set 16:

Can you tell me what gen_smtp is dependent on, so I can ensure the dependencies are set correctly? Or, perhaps better, tell me how I can figure it out myself, bearing in mind that I don't know Erlang.

erlwsh is certainly being compiled if you run the default "make" target. It is true that the "dialyzer" target does not depend on any of the compilation targets, I will fix that. Can you tell me what exactly is missing when you said "erlwsh is not being compiled at all"?

I will fix the problem of make succeeding when the dialyzer task fails.

We've already merged fixes for gen_smtp.

>> Or, perhaps better, tell me how I can figure it out myself, bearing in mind that I don't know Erlang.

Could not understand a question.

>> erlwsh is certainly being compiled if you run the default "make" target.

No it's not. It's ebin/ directory is near-empty. And that's what dialyzer complains about.

make && make dialyzer should work (and just make dialyzer too of course). May I ask you to at least do basic checking on your end before uploading further revisions ? I believe we both find this back-and-forth inefficient.

Patch Set 16:

I did do "basic" checking, and more besides. Those targets worked the same for me locally as they did in a copy of ns_server from before my changes. I'm not sure yet what intervening change broke things, but I'll fix up the issues.
