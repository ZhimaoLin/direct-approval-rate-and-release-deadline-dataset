Patch Set 8:

I believe I have addressed all the issues raised here:

1. I renamed the macros in Erlang.cmake. I think we should merge with the FindCouchbaseErlang.cmake in tlm; however, I suspect Alk and others would be unhappy with a build dependency on tlm, so for now I'm leaving this stuff self-contained in ns_server.

2. I renamed most of CMake targets to ns_foo, eg. ns_dialyzer, ns_test, ns_docs. The GNUmakefile targets remain the same as they always were.

3. I changed cluster_run to cluster_run.in, and configure it at CMake time to have the correct PREFIX path embedded in it. I didn't see any other scripts that used the top-level .configuration file.

4. I moved all .cmake scripts into cmake_modules.

5. I removed all the trailing whitespace I saw in the review.

The "SHELL=/bin/sh" line in GNUmakefile was there before my changes. I didn't remove it because I wasn't sure if it might be important for some of the targets that remain in that file.
