DESCRIPTION

Add information to the settings if the auto-failover was stopped
automatically or not.

The auto-failover does disable itself pretty soon, before anything bad
happens. Though the user should get a notification when it happened,
so that he can enable it again. This commit adds the necessary
information to the HTTP API call (/settings/autoFailover).
