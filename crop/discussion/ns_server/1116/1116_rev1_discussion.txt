DESCRIPTION

Bug 1728: Don't crash in ns_port_init on unexpected messages

menelaus_event uses gen_event:call and messages sent to the event
manager for its own nefarious purposes, so any other event handlers
installed on ns_node_disco_event or ns_config_event need to implement
callbacks that ignore anything they don't understand.
