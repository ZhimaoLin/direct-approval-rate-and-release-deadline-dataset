DESCRIPTION

MB-21538: improve drift ahead threshold exceeded alert message

Message is clearer and provides a link to the permanent location
of the doc describing how users are supposed to set up NTP.
UI renders the link in a sanitized and safe way (see angular
docs on ng-bind-html.)

I would like them to be able to include little bits of HTML. How do we resolve this disagreement? :-) Shall we see what the others say? (Others, please chime in.)

Well, I was just polite :) They must be plain text. Email alerts are sent as plain text.
