MB-24041: do not upgrade ui-selectize

ui-select v0.19.5 has issues with ngAnimate
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select/issues/224

Here is workaround https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select/
issues/1325#issuecomment-160922087 to run current ui-select
with new angular version. Add class to ui-select-match and
ui-select-choices with the same name.
