DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Introduce a means of upgrading global keys in config.

It was not possible before for two reasons. First, ns_config_default
upgrade path is executed only during off-line upgrade. Second, it's
safe to upgrade only per-node keys there. Thus
ns_online_config_upgrader is introduced. It's called by
ns_orchestrator as part of switching compatibility mode procedure.
