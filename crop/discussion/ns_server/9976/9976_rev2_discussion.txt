DESCRIPTION

Take into consideration 'deletedness' of the revision.

Suppose we have two changes. One is 'delete' and the second one is
'set'. In case the sequence numbers of both changes are the same we
will prefer non-delete change.

Line:278, src/capi_frontend.erl -> I guess we're not taking deletion into account because get_meta for deleted items returns enoent ?

Line:507, src/capi_frontend.erl -> some case(s) seem to be missing here. Do we take deletion into account ?

Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)

Probably we should wait until get_meta has all the properties we want.

Line:278, src/capi_frontend.erl -> This is because _revs_diff does not contain any information about deletedness of remote document. It's just it's id and revision.

Line:507, src/capi_frontend.erl -> We can't say anything when we know the deleteness only of one side. In this case we can only ignore it. When this function is called either both 'not deleted' values are supplied or none of them. This pattern match is just to fail when the function is called in other manner.
