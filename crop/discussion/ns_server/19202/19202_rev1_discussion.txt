DESCRIPTION

MB-5599: schedule XDCR manager when replicator is done

Today we schedule XDCR manager at fixed time interval which by default
is 5 seconds. This is not efficient if there is small number of items
to replicate and the replicator is done quickly. This change-set will
allow XDCR manager to schedule new replication when current replicator
finishes.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Hopefully you're not forgetting about error handling. I.e. if no replication can work at all (nodes are down) we don't want to eat 100% respawning replicators.
