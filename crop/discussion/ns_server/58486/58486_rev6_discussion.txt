Patch Set 6:

I would probably prefer some json as a REST API payload instead of custom format.

Patch Set 6:

The reasons for using this notation:
1. Can be attaches as a single attribute to the UI elements
2. Looks better as a one string argument in golang api's
3. Looks better and more compact in documents

So basically I want permissions to be strings, not structures for UI and golang components, and parsing happen on ns_server side only
