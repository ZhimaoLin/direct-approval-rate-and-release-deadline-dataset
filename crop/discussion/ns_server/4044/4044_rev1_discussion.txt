DESCRIPTION

implemented better cluster join procedure. MB-3072 and others.

New code exposes same REST API as old, but internal REST calls used to
join cluster were changed in incompatible (but future-proof) way.

The procedure is performed by cluster node (joiner) and is initiated (as
before) by post to /controller/addNode. Joiner node then checks epmd
reachability and renames itself if it's necessary (i.e. if it's single
node cluster and node name is not forced). After that it does HTTP POST to
/engageCluster2 on joinee. Full node info is posted with that
call. Joinee uses that information to validate it's ability to join
cluster and renames itself if necessary.

Successfull /engageCluster2 call returns joinee node info that joiner
uses to add that node into nodes_wanted. After that joiner does HTTP
POST to /completeJoin. /completeJoin implementation on joinee side
does final checks, changes otp cookie and connects to cluster. If
/completeJoin call fails for whatever reason, joiner aborts 'join
transaction' by removing joinee from nodes wanted. This makes new join
procedure more robust.

New join procedure works under ns_cluster process fixing a number of
race conditions in old code. It is more future-proof and implements
better error reporting.

New code also fixes:

* MB-3112 Shouldn't be able to join cluster with "bad name" (new code
  checks reachability of hostname of otp nodes from both sides)

* MB-2745 Rebalance via CLI command fails with "connection refused"
  (new join procedure is synchronous and response is generated
  after everything is restated)

/node/controller/doJoinCluster now works by doing post to
/controller/addNode on joiner side eliminating two join-related code
pathes in previous implementation.
