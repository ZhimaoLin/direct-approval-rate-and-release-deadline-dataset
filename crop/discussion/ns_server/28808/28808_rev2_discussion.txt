DESCRIPTION

MB-100 wait for bucket to warm before loading sample data

  - it is sufficient to check warmup status only on current node
    because at the moment the node gets mark_warmup signal
    memcached should be ready on all nodes
  - I think the mystery of sleep(5000) line is solved now,
    so I removed it.

Patch Set 2:

Is there any reason why we have to poll instead of being notified of this condition?

Patch Set 2:

Polling looks good enough IMHO given relative insignificance and performance un-importance of this code.

However my concern is that warmup-ness of current node does not mean that warmup-ness of other nodes is set already.

Which is apparently easier to do through Harley Martinitor interaction. Which, yes, means we'll have to handle backwards compatibility  and write a bit more code
