DESCRIPTION

MB-100 wait for bucket to warm before loading sample data

  - it is sufficient to check warmup status only on current node
    because at the moment the node gets mark_warmup signal
    memcached should be ready on all nodes
  - I think the mystery of sleep(5000) line is solved now,
    so I removed it.
