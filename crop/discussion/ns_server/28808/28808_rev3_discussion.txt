DESCRIPTION

MB-100 wait for bucket to warm before loading sample data

  - introduced new method ns_orchestrator:ensure_Harley Martinitor_run
    that allows to wait for successful or unsuccsessful Harley Martinitor
    run for particular bucket repolling if the bucket
    is warming up or Harley Martinitor was killed to give way to
    another orchestrator command
  - I think the mystery of sleep(5000) line is solved now,
    so I removed it.
