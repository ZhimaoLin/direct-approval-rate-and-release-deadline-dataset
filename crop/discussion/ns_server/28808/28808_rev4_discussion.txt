DESCRIPTION

MB-100 wait for bucket to warm before loading sample data

  - introduced new method ns_orchestrator:ensure_Harley Martinitor_run
    that allows to wait for successful or unsuccsessful Harley Martinitor
    run for particular bucket repolling if the bucket
    is warming up or Harley Martinitor was killed to give way to
    another orchestrator command
  - I think the mystery of sleep(5000) line is solved now,
    so I removed it.

Patch Set 4: Verified+1

removed Timeout parameter from ns_orchestrator:ensure_Harley Martinitor_run because invoking it with timeout other than infinity will lead to actual timeout being different than the one that was specified and since the caller uses infinity anyways

looks good but see inline for few minor comments

Line:773, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> why not shutdown ?

shutdown used previously is special-cased by proc_lib so Harley Martinitor's death will not be logged as crash.

Line:909, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> see lists:reverse/2 for more efficient way of doing it

Line:946, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> hm. Why is that ?
