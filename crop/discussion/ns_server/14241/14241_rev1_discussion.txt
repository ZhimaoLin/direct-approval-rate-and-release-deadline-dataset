Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Questionable idea. Something else using erlang can be running. Like ejabberd

Patch Set 1:

looks like doing /opt/couchbase/bin/epmd -kill is what is needed.

Try asking --help on your copy of epmd and confirm that -kill seems like right thing
