DESCRIPTION

Grab master events in json format to master_events.log.

This also removes them from diag output. The motivation is that master
events in the format they were dumped to diag.log needed to be converted
to json first, before they could be fed to our scripts. So it saves a
lot of time to have them in json directly.
