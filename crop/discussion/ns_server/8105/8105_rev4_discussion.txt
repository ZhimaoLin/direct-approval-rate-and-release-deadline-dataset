DESCRIPTION

Add couchbase_compaction_daemon

This is a compaction daemon specific for the cluster version of
Couchbase. It's vbucket aware and triggers compaction for all
vbucket databases of a bucket if a small number (hardcoded as
4 for now) of the vbucket databases need to be compacted.

It's based on couch_compaction_daemon (Couchbase Single Server).
