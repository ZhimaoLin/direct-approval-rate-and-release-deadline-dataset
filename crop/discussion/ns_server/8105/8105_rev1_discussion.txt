DESCRIPTION

Add couchbase_compaction_daemon

This is a compaction daemon specific for the cluster version of
Couchbase. It's vbucket aware and triggers compaction for all
vbucket databases of a bucket if a small number (hardcoded as
4 for now) of the vbucket databases need to be compacted.

It's based on couch_compaction_daemon (Couchbase Single Server).

there's no need to start disk_sup. It's started by ns_server to measure disk space.

Right Alk, I know it uses it.
I just don't want to assume any specific ordering about who starts first or not disk_sup.
