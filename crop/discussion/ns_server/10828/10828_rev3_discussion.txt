DESCRIPTION

Retry couch replications in the same process

Previously, a separate timer process was run on a periodic basis to
retry failed replications. This can cause race conditions with the
main process and with other timer processes.

This changeset fixes the issue by having the timer process send
periodic messages to the main process which then actually retries the
failed replications.
