- mnPools.get() should be specified separately for each of
admin/wizard/auth, in order to reduce amount of /pools request
on auth page
- logic in onStateChangeStart entirely related to the app.admin
- removed pool.isAuthenticated flag
- using mnPools.clearCache() on login and logout instead of
mnPools.getFresh() before login and logout.
