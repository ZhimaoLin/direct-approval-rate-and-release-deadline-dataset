Patch Set 15: Verified+1

Main changes in latest patches:

1. To track liveliness of dcp traffic, earlier dcp_proxy set "last_heard" to os:timestamp while handling each packet.  Since os:timestamp may not monotonically increase, Aliaksey suggested to use a flag instead.

2. Earlier {Node, Bucket} entries in the dcp_traffic monitor were explicitly removed by dcp_consumer_conn and dcp_replicator when the connection closed/terminated. 
Aliaksey suggested a better approach of having the dcp_traffic_monitor  monitor the (dcp _proxy) processes that are actively updating the  the traffic monitor and remove the entries when the dcp_proxy processes go away.
