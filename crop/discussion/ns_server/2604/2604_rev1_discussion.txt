DESCRIPTION

Bug 966: log a bunch of stuff at startup.

I log the os type and version and the output of ns_info:runtime,
though ns_info:runtime contains all the same information in a
different form.

Also removed system_info(procs) from the output since it's formatted
in an unreadable fashion. This would probably be good to have in a
reasonably formatted fashion, however.
