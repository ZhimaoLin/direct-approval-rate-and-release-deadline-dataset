DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: implemented faster bucket config access

Apparently sending config out of ns_config process is becoming a
performance problem. get_bucket call even for 4 nodes without notable
vbucket map history and with just one bucket takes around 200
microseconds.

This commit speeds up get_bucket/1 call by doing searching on
ns_config process and thus by avoiding sending out entire ns_config
state. There's also even lighter get_bucket_light/1 call which strips
vbucket map from reply making copying even less expensive.
