and probably others.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

having limits is correct. And this changeset works.

Although information about 4k cmdline limit on Centos 5 is incorrect. For older kernels argv+env limit is 128k. See here: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/418858

And no Redhat haven't changed that. I've checked it myself on Centos 5.4.
