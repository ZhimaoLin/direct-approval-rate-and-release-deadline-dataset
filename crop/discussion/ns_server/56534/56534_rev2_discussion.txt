Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

You misunderstood the point of find_executable. We introduced it at the time when indexer and cbq-engine were not yet integrated into the build system but we wanted to give people a way of starting to test things. It is the case that we don't expect not to find these binaries anymore, but if you want to change find_executable, then you will also have to change the places where it's called. With your change the callers check if the return value is false, but it can never really be false anymore.
