DESCRIPTION

MB-8427: filter out non-UTF-8 keys in XDCR and log them

Non-UTF-8 encoded keys will not be replicated to remote by design.
Within XDCR, if any such key is detected at source side, a warning
msg will be dumped into xdcr error logs with list of non-UTF-8 keys,
e.g., "Warning! These non-UTF-8 keys are filterd out and will not be
replicated:" followed by a list of non-UTF-8 keys.
