DESCRIPTION

MB-8427: filter out non-UTF-8 keys in XDCR and log them

Non-UTF-8 encoded keys will not be replicated to remote by design.
Within XDCR, if any such key is detected at source side, a warning
msg will be dumped into xdcr error logs with list of non-UTF-8 keys,
e.g., "Warning! These non-UTF-8 encoded keys are filtered out and
will not be replicated:" followed by a list of non-UTF-8 keys.

Line:182, src/xdc_vbucket_rep_worker.erl -> Totally irrelevant comment.
The code below is very explicit.

Line:183, src/xdc_vbucket_rep_worker.erl -> Matching against [] instead of checking for length is a better practice and more efficient.
