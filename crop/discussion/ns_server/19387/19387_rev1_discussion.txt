DESCRIPTION

MB-5895: consider upgrading vb map history at rebalance start

When 1.8.1 is added to cluster of 1.8.0 nodes there's initially no
vbucket map history. This happens because 1.8.1 currently considers
upgrading config only when offline upgrading. But for vbucket map
history which is global config element, we need to do that with actual
vbucket maps (after joining cluster) but before rebalance, so that
swap rebalance works.

It will. But 1.7.2 has that master election bug that is _additional_ problem doing swap rebalance upgrade.
