DESCRIPTION

Bug 1634: Fix badmatch in ns_config.

Apparently my assumptions about when we'd see two vclocks that descend
from one another are incorrect: we're seeing vclocks with the same
counters but different timestamps for some reason on the same
keys. Rather than crashing in this scenario, I log it, but only if the
actual config values are different.
