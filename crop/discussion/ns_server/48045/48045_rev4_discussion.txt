DESCRIPTION

MB-13567 Make design documents available on non-kv nodes.

Note, that as of now views still cannot be queried. But the list of
design documents is available on non-kv nodes as soon as they are
rebalanced in. Also new design documents can be created on non-kv
nodes too.

I had to split single_bucket_sup in two supervisors:
single_bucket_kv_sup and docs_sup. And the docs_sup itself into
docs_sup and docs_kv_sup. The _kv_ infix indicates that such
supervisor is running only on kv nodes. docs_sup is running on non-kv
nodes after they are rebalanced in.

One more missing piece (as of now) is master vbucket compaction.
