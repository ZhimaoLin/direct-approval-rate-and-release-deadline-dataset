DESCRIPTION

MB-8194 do not attach bucket uuid to vbucket in vbmap urls

- 3.0 clusters don't need it
- pre 3.0 clusters won't verify bucket uuid in this case, but I think
  we can live with it

Patch Set 1:

this chain fails dialyzer. Not sure where exactly issues are introduced.

I'm also not sure if using + as bucket/uuid separator is a good idea.
