DESCRIPTION

MB-12197: made terminate_and_wait work even for normal reason

When exit is send with reason normal, it gets ignored if child is not
trapping exits.

Recent change of dcp_replicator childs to not trap exits caused
condition where terminate with reason normal got stuck because of
normal exit being ignored.

This commit maps normal to shutdown and fixes MB.
