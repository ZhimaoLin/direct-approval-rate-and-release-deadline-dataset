DESCRIPTION

MB-24256 <header> titles/action links layout

Revised all the components inside the <header> element to behave
more like CBUI tables (i.e. using flex) - sizing and eliding
dynamically.

Abstracted the styles of things in the depots (formerly in admin.html) to their repective pages.

Thanks. Good call. I had fixed that in my next change (responsive styles), but forgot to backport it.
