DESCRIPTION

Don't use misc:safe_multi_call in doc_replicator.

Upon careful inspection, I fail to see how safe_multi_call is
different or any safer than standard gen_server:multi_call. So I
switched doc_replicator to using the latter.

Patch Set 1:

Looking at the history, Alk added safe_multi_call in 2011 while making changes for "increase erlang distribution ports range".  

Currently, I see only doc_replicator using it. That change was done last year. It will be good to check with Artem why it uses safe_multi_call and not gen_server:multicall.

Alk's change.

And it's actually the case that safe_multi_call was never used until Artem's change.
