Patch Set 1:

I can abstract this so there isnt as much repetition with this and the delete bucket ui code. there just isnt a particularly nice way to abstract those right now so left it as is.

Patch Set 1:

and there was tNathalie Landry about having this as only visible after a flag was set, but considering its right next to the delete button and has a big "all data will be lost" warning I think its a really bad idea to be adding more special case flags

We were asked to hide this be default. See ticket.

Patch Set 1:

The last comment on the ticket says to enable it always and show a dialog, which is what it does

I also commented on that part above, enabling / disabling this stuff via flags is just awful ui

Just one inline comment to consider.

Line:842, priv/public/index.html -> Is there anyway we can avoid this onclick="" and put the code in the related JS?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

So final decision for 1.7 is to enable this button only for memcached buckets. Should be easy to do.
