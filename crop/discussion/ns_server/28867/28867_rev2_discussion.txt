DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Factor out node status check into a dedicated function.

Additionally, I changed the way absence of active_buckets key is
handled. Previously we just used empty list as a default. But this
means that for the case of bucket deletion we would decide that the
node successfully deleted bucket when it's not really the case.
