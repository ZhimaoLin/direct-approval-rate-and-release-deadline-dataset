Patch Set 2:

Hi Ritesh,

This might not work during upgrades from pre-Spock to Spock when the cluster has some nodes running  the old version and some the new one. Can you please check the upgrade scenario?

Also, since the new names are already out in 4.0, please check whether this will break any customer and also QA scripts if they are making REST API calls using the 4.0 stat names.

Patch Set 2:

During upgrade, we do not turn on the "4.0" switch until all nodes in the cluster have become 4.0. After that replication will get restarted and run by goxdcr, and ns_server will start processing xdcr stats in 4.0 manner. The proposed fix does not change or break the upgrade scenario.

The xdcr 4.0 documentation still uses the 3.0 names like "docs_latency_wt" and "meta_latency_wt". This is the primary reason we are making this fix. I don't think there is any QE script that uses these names. If there are we will work with QE on that.

FYI for others,
I explained to Yu offline the 4.0/4.5 to Spock upgrade issue.
He plans to discuss it with Ritesh.

Patch Set 2:

Poonam clarified that the upgrade scenario she had in mind was 4.0 to 5.0 upgrade. In this scenario nodes with different versions could co-exist in a cluster, and different stats names could cause problems.

We will check with our PM to see how critical it is to fix this issue.
