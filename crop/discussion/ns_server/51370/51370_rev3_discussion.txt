DESCRIPTION

MB-14914 wait for node() to go down

..after net_kernel:stop() before starting the bringup
because assigning node name to xxx@xxx.xxx is async
and can happen after ns_kernel:stop() had exited which
causes dist_manager to crash during bringup

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

Looks good to me. 

I assume, net_kernel:monitor_nodes() is reliable and will always deliver the nodedown message when the net_kernel is terminated otherwise this code will be stuck waiting for it.
