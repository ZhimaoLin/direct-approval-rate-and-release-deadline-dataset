DESCRIPTION

correctly hide/unhide stuff with when-in-{prod,dev} classes

Setting display:block as was previously done is leaky abstraction
because it was altering original style of element. Making it unable to
use on inline elements.

Fixed version only insists on display:none when stuff needs to be
hidden.
