DESCRIPTION

MB-15761 generate cluster certificate with sha1 signature algoritm

...if appropriate internal setting is turned on, local certificate
will inherit the algorithm from the cluster cert

this is needed to support xdcr from 2.5 to 4.0, since 4.0 uses sha256,
but erlang14 used in 2.5 doesn't support it
