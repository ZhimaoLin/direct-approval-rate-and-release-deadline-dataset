DESCRIPTION

making Menelaus the new _utils

All of this one done with only changes to the CouchDB config
created by cluster_run and mostly path modifications in the
JS, HTML, and CSS.

jQuery was upgraded to the latest (1.6.2) to accomodate
dynamic $.ajax() URL rewriting. Very minor changes were
required to the overall JS to accomodate the new jQuery.
