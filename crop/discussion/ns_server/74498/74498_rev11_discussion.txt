Patch Set 11: Verified+1

Added 2 states for unresponsive node:  initial state with Failover button & "pending removal" state after button is clicked.

This works but sometimes rebalance fails with indexer error; sometimes column values show --- AND 98%; sometimes rebalance button is disabled (correctly) / sometimes enabled (incorrectly)

Maybe related:  Adding a sample bucket puts servers in apparent warmup state (orange status - doesn't change), refreshing the browser sets them back to green.
