Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This is wrong.  In a 2-node cluster, for example, if a single server X fails, and the user Removes server X, server X goes into Pending Remove, and the user should still be able to Rebalance.  This change incorrectly prevents this case.

The user should be see a disabled Rebalance button in the case when there is a unhealthy Pending Add or Active server (not just any server).
