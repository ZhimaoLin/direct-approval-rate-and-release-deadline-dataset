Patch Set 21: -Code-Review

Looks mostly good. One thing: would prefer if the libs and base javascripts were referred to absolutely in the index.html. E.g.

<script src="/libs/codemirror.js"></script>
<script src="/base/app.js"></script>

instead of 

<script src="../libs/codemirror.js"></script>
<script src="../base/app.js"></script>

This will mean we'll need to change minification to be a bit smarter when joining the base dir with the application javascript path -- if the app js returns true from filepath.IsAbs(dir, script) then we don't join it.

I'm ok if we do the "../base/..." -> "/base/..." conversion in a later change. But I'd like to do the /libs change in this one, since it's simple. Can you change and repush?
