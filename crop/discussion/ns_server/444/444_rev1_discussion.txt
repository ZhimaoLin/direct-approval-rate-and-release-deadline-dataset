DESCRIPTION

Make the orchestrator activate buckets instead of ns_bucket

Since the orchestrator already knows which buckets it wants and when
buckets are missing, it makes more sense for the orchestrator to
create buckets when it finds them missing. This gets rid of one
gen_server per node without adding any real complexity.

Patch Set 1: No score; Do not submit

Don't submit this yet; it may still make more sense to have buckets activated locally rather than by the orchestrator since the bucket configuration is local.
