DESCRIPTION

changed default count of vbuckets back to 1k

1.8.0 buckets are using 1k which means 2.0 needs to work fine on
1k. So it makes sense to do all testing with 1k.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

a 3 hours eperf test with 1024 vbuckets passed, similar eprformance as before.
I run a XDCR test, 4->4 nodes on ec2, while rebalancing the destination.
UI was a bit choppy, but all items were replicated.
Filipe verified that it works with 1024 vbuckets for views.

I think we are ready to merge and run more extensive tests.
Farshid, are you ok with it?
