DESCRIPTION

MB-8281: send storage totals with bucket info

We need to synchronize cluster_storage_info and
last_bucket_stats because their values are used
on the UI at moment when bucket details section
is open. Now to get stats last_bucket_stats uses
ns_doctor as like cluster_storage_info.

This commit also makes sure that we send basicStats _only_ if UI
explicitly asks for it.
