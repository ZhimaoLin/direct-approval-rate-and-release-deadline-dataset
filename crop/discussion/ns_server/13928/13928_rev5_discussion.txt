DESCRIPTION

Explicitly trigger doc replication upon startup

Due to a race condition, it may so happen that after a new node is
added to a cluster, the design/replicator docs on existing nodes do
not replicated to the new node. This change set explicitly triggers
the replication of all existing docs by sending the
replicate_newnodes_docs message to all the existing nodes.
