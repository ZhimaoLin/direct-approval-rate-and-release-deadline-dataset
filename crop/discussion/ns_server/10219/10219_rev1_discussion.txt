DESCRIPTION

Fix CAPI's ensure_full_commit() method

ensure_full_commit() used to return 0 as the instance_start_time for a database
but as a binary string. The right data type to send it as is an integer as the
get_db_info() method does. This changeset fixes this inconsistency by having
ensure_full_commit() also return an integer. The problem was discovered during
XDCR integration testing.

Patch Set 1:

I'd be surprised if this didn't give "long line" warnings on upload.  The log messages cut off in "git log" on an 80 column window.

Patch Set 1:

I checked and I did receive a warning. I should watch out for this in the future. I do have my editor set so it gives me a warning if I'm exceeding 80 chars. In this case, though, I didn't know repo adds additional whitespace at the beginning of the line.

Yeah, you really want more like 70.  It's not the worst thing one can do, but I like the tidiness.  :)
