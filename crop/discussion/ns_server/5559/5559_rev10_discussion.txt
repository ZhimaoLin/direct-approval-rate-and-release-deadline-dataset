Patch Set 10:

this really asks for some way to notify menelaus_events (and all it's subscribers) when some node changes state.

unfortunately ep-engine is not too stable to really check warmup

Sorry for the late review...didn't realize it was stuck in "draft". :/

Feel free to consider this for another patch. :)

Line:377, priv/public/js/core-data.js -> Would you be up for dropping this if/else block and making the CSS classes match the node statuses we get from the servers? You'd need to have a default CSS state in case the value was empty or broken or set to some unknown future value, but with that in place, both the JS and CSS code would be simpler.
