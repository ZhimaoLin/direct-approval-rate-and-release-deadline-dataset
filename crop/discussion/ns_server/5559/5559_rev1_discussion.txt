Patch Set 1: (3 inline comments)

will continue reviewing later

Line:85, src/ns_memcached.erl -> should remove it and register normally (though gen_server) in start_link

Line:286, src/ns_memcached.erl -> eating exceptions is a bad practice in general. and this particular place doesn't need it anymore. maybe

Line:86, src/ns_memcached.erl -> My concern is that it's a bit too low. With many buckets will burn lots of CPU for nothing.
