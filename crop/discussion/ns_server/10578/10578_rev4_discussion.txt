DESCRIPTION

Load required modules on remote nodes at start of rebalance.

Instead of trying to upload needed modules for every single vbucket
movement we now do it one time on rebalance start.

And now we upload modules unconditionally. This is needed to handle
modules that exist both on local and remote nodes. We could just
compare module versions but there is no clean way to get the version
of some module from a remote node without transmitting its object
code. So just uploading unconditionally becomes actually cheaper.
