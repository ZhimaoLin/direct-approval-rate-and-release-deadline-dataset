DESCRIPTION

MB-2934: Avoid access violation error on Windows

By using Delete=false, we can close temp files and then add to the
zip file. All temp files will be removed after zip file generated.
Note: the change will only work after python 2.6 due to the delete
attribute.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This looks like it should just be an amend of the previous one, not a new change.  Can you just fix the other one?

Abandoning as it doesn't actually do what it says it does.
