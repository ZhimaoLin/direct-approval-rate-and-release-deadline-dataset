DESCRIPTION

MB-100: use rep_details to check replication mode

Today in vb replicator we use xmem_srv process to check the mode
of replication, which is correct in most cases except that if it
crashed, the terminate function of vb replicator will not be able
to know which mode the vb replicator is using. Actually we have
already encoded replication mode info in rep_details, thus we
should use it instead of relying on xmem_srv process.

in that case it appears to be quite useless. But whatever...
