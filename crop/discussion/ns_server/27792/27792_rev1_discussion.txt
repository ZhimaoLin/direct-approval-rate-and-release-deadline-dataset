see inline

Line:170, src/vclock.erl -> Shouldn't it be TS? And RestTS in the other clause correspondingly.

And more generally, maybe it's better to just use lists:max and list comprehension. It would be more readable and leave less room for mistakes.

Line:99, src/compaction_daemon.erl -> Why did you decide to put it outside per-bucket autocompaction settings?

Line:121, src/compaction_daemon.erl -> Counters are also changed after failovers. It might make sense to reflect it somehow in the name of this function. So that it's obvious that it's desired.

Line:781, src/compaction_daemon.erl -> Timestamps that vclock module uses are not seconds from UNIX epoch. Rather seconds from year 0 (which didn't even exist but anyway).

And lists:max means that in case of recent rebalance we're actually going to purge more that what's configured by user. Is that what we really want?

See inline for reason for separate field.

Line:170, src/vclock.erl -> you're right. Thanks

Line:121, src/compaction_daemon.erl -> see how config_to_record errors on unknown field
