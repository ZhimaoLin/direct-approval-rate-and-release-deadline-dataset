I'm fine with this, but curious what is driving our decisions to change it up vs down?

> I'm fine with this, but curious what is driving our decisions to change it up vs down?

At root, lack of knowledge (by me).

The bump from 20 up to 128 was to check out the theory that fewer pindexes will be better, especially for query performance (less scatter/gather).

That didn't work, as shown by Angelina Mayer's tests, due to current theories related to forestdb and compaction.

So, this change is to push it down, but I was thinking 20 was the wrong number, as it doesn't divide cleanly into 1024.  So, either 16 or 32, and so I chose 32.

No real amazing theory here, unfortunately.

OK, I was just making sure we were adjusting it for performance, and not to accommodate more indexes (which I don't think would be the right priority.
