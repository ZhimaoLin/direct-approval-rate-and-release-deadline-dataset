DESCRIPTION

correctly build document url in docs section

So that _design/XXX can be viewed/edited.

Couch API has one inconvenient quirk which is _local/ and _design/
urls need to be built specially (or resultant redirect needs to be
handled). We have a nice helper that takes this into account. So we
just use it.
