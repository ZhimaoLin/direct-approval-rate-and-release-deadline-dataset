DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Auto-failover to pick hints from...

...liaison module

The auto-failover module, as part of its periodic run, picks
up the nodes present in the "try_failover" list maintained
by the liaison module and passed it on the auto-failover
logic module. The logic module, as part of its node state
handling loop, transitions the nodes present in the try
failover list to "nearly_down".

If the node cannot be failed over the auto-failover module
adds the node into the "cannot_failover" list maintained
by the liaison module. This info is later read back by the
ns_Harley Martinitor and bring the buckets online on such nodes.

Based on Poonam's initial proto-type:
