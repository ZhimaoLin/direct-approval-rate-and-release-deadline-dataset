DESCRIPTION

MB-22850 introduce ssl_ciphers_strength config key

with possible values [high], [medium], [high, medium]
propagate the value of this key to fts and query via env variable

this key doesn't affect ns_server and memcached ssl servers just yet
and this is TBD
for now we just need to provide an integration mechanism for query and
fts to pick up this value and translate it to the list of cipher suites
