DESCRIPTION

MB-22850 introduce ssl_ciphers_strength config key

with possible values [high], [medium], [high, medium]
propagate the value of this key to fts and query via env variable

this key doesn't affect ns_server and memcached ssl servers just yet
and this is TBD
for now we just need to provide an integration mechanism for query and
fts to pick up this value and translate it to the list of cipher suites

corresponding cbauth change:

Patch Set 1:

Why won't we store a list of ciphers in ns_config? What if somebody finds a deficiency in a cipher that we consider high security, then there will be no way to tell the server not to use this cipher.

Patch Set 1:

That is possibly what we can do later on. The problem is finding a common ground between ciphers supported by erlang and ciphers supported by golang and finding a way to map them. It is not exactly a trivial task. For example there's no API in golang to retrieve a list of ciphers recognized by golang. This is most likely Spock.next

In Spock I just want to provide API's for FTS to do exactly what query currently does.
