DESCRIPTION

Add --loglevel option to cluster_run.

It allows to specify wanted logging verbosity. So --loglevel=error
will print only error messages. If the option is omitted then
configuration is read from static_config.

Patch Set 1:

I don't like putting it capi.ini because this value will effectively override any other value (including the one set in cluster_run script). Thinking about how to resolve it.
