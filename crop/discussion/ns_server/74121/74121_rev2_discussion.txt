DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-22626: Restart FTS when certs are refreshed."

This reverts commit f6c95b75baa0bb656cb4019044ea0e3dc56213a6.

Fixing MB-22626 with this change referenced in the previous sentence
causes MB-22947 -- which is a test blocker for QE. We should revert
for now while we figure out how we should fix MB-22947 (i.e. should
we ask FTS to provide a "refresh TLS" endpoint or should be put this
through cbauth so that indexing and other golang services can use it
more easily.)

Patch Set 2:

Note: I spoke to Aruna who told me that she felt that she couldn't afford to wait for say a week to get this fixed. If we fix by providing something in cbauth then I think it will take at least that long given the stuff we have going on. Perhaps Steve & Marty could provide a REST endpoint more quickly. But either way, it seems like the smart move is to revert, reopen the ticket and decide what we should do.
