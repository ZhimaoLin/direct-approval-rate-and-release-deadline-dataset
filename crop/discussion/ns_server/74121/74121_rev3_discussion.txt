DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-22626: Restart FTS when certs are refreshed."

This reverts commit f6c95b75baa0bb656cb4019044ea0e3dc56213a6.

Fixing MB-22626 with this change referenced in the previous sentence
causes MB-22947 -- which is a test blocker for QE. We should revert
for now while we figure out how we should fix MB-22947 (i.e. should
we ask FTS to provide a "refresh TLS" endpoint or should be put this
through cbauth so that indexing and other golang services can use it
more easily.)
