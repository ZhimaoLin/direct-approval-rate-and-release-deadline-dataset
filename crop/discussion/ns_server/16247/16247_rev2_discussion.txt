DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Reimplement compaction daemon.

In attempt to make the structure clearer and more modular I chose to
implement every single compactor as an independent process (possibly
spawning other compactor processes).

Major differences from previous version of compaction daemon:

 - all the compaction settings are stored in ns_server config (to
   avoid unnecessary synchronization back and forth);
 - compactions can be triggered by user via corresponding APIs;
 - compaction daemon can be put in a paused state (e.g. during
   rebalance) and then unpaused again which will cause compactions to
   be resumed more or less from the same point;
 - parallel database and view compaction option has some effect again.
