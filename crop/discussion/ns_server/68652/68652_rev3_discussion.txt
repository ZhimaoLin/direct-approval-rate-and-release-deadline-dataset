DESCRIPTION

MB-21146: Drop the time_synchronization bucket parameter.

[1] Dropped the time_synchronization bucket parameter from the REST API.

[2] If we are upgrading from a 4.5 cluster and if the buckets were
    created with time_sync parameter set then as part of upgrade to 4.6
    we don't remove the time_sync parameter from ns_config. We just
    don't use the time_sync parameter while constructing the bucket
    config.
