Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please change at least the first line of commit message to something descriptive. So that it's easy to understand from 'git shortlog' what actually happened.

And btw, you probably meant 'verified' instead of 'looks good to me, but someone else must approve'.

Patch Set 5: (1 inline comment)



Line:426, priv/public/index.html -> I caught problems with nth-child(2n+1). Background of first row at table going to broken after list is updated, that why I propose use tbody and thead. Alos tbody is required tag
