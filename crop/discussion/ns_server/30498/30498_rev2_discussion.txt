Patch Set 2:

IMHO get_replica name is a bit too confusing. get_from_replica or something that doesn't sound like we're getting information about replica of something seem to be better.

Otherwise looks decent.

BTW timeout is actually very easy to add. I.e. poll_for_condition AFAIK already has optional parameter for that
