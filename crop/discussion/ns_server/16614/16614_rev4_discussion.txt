Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

much better. Now it would be extra awesome if you do same trick to avoid quoting dbdir.

And super nice would be if we stop hardcoding /opt/couchbase as a location of config. There should be some way to access config relative to __FILE__ (i.e. cbcollect_info script itself).
