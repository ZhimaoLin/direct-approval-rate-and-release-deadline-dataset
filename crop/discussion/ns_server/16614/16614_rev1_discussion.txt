Patch Set 1:

not sure every machine has curl but that's less of problem.

You should fetch /diag?noLogs=1 so that logs are not fetched again.

Patch Set 1:

hm. ok. then the only thing that's left is that noLog thing.

I'd also be really careful with passing stuff like password on cmd line. Especially given that in can have spaces and quotes and stuff like that. I strongly suggest you to test of at least space in password is supported
