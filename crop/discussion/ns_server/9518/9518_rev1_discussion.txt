DESCRIPTION

correctly handle invalid auth_type for default bucket. MB-4260

Via our CLI it was possible to try to create default bucket as bucket
with per-port moxi. In this case late logic to override bucket type to
sasl and password to empty was a bit faulty. Particularly,
sasl_password field was missing causing bucket to require admin
password.
