Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:67, src/ns_pubsub.erl -> Looking at misc:wait_for_process implementation it seems to me that that there's a potential dead lock here. Suppose gen_event process (Pid) terminates before we call wait_for_process. Then process spawned in wait_for_process will die since it's illegal to call link() on dead pid. And we will wait for signal from this process forever.
