DESCRIPTION

delete /master db first when deleting bucket.

So that set_views doesn't have to handle seemingly dead-lock prone
deletion of partitions followed by deletion of master database (and
thus design docs).

Works around apparent deadlock in MB-4760.

I've also changed call to binary:part/2 to binary:part/3 because the
later doesn't have to allocate temporary tuple.
