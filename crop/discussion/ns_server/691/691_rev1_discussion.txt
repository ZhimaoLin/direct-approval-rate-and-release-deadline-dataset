Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

This looks better, but doesn't address everything in bug 1372.  Will update that bug.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This change has already bee integrated through other means.  I was going crazy trying to cherry-pick it, but found through Adrianna Holmesal inspection that the change is already in origin/master so will abandon.
