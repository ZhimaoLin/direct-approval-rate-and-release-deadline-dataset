DESCRIPTION

MB-4617: Incorrect disk space reportedx
Prefix matching is insufficient in the presence of bind mounts or symlinks.
eg: we have two devices:
/dev/hda1 is mounted as /mount1
/dev/hda2 is mounted as /mount2
but we also have a bind mount of /dev/hda2/foo, mounted as /mount1/bar

Prefix matching would match the path "/mount1/bar" against /mount1 and decide it is on
device hda1, but actually it is on hda2

Instead we should use the device number of the file, obtained via file:read_file_info/1, and
match this to the device number of a mounted device to find which device it is on.
