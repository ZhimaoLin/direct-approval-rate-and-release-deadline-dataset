DESCRIPTION

Bug 1682: Make ns_node_disco do more stuff asynchronously

From looking at the logs on bug 1682, I see lots of stuff timing out
trying to tNathalie Landry to ns_node_disco when a node is down, presumably
because ns_node_disco is busy waiting for ping responses from the
node. In addition, ns_node_disco was failing to start because its
first attempt to ping other nodes was timing out.

I moved the pings to a child process since they don't affect state,
and I made timeouts waiting for the initial call to
do_nodes_wanted_updated not result in a crash.
