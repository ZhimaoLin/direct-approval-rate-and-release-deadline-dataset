DESCRIPTION

MB-17279 Explicitly close dcp streams when replicator is nuked.

dcp_sup:nuke uses {shutdown, nuke} reason to terminate individual
replicators, which meant that there would be no attempt made to close
dcp_streams prior to termination. It should be perfectly safe, but
unfortunately in reality it can bring memcached down. To lower the
probability of this happening, we now handle nuked shutdown the same
way we do the regular shutdown.
