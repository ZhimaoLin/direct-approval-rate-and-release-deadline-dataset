Patch Set 1:

putting testing set call to ns_memcached is a bit controversial, as this module is supposed to be management-only. And sleep sucks as usual :)

yeh the mb_client_binary doesnt have a seemingly sane syncronous api, I think its probably best to take out writing the test data from ns_memcached and use a dedicated client membase api to write test data, is there a recommended one for erlang? I figured thats what mb_client was supposed to be but its not really suitable as far as I can see, I have already written my own we can just add

Patch Set 1:

I don't understand you comment about 'sane synchronous' API. Your set implementation inside ns_memcached is small enough. We can keep things in ns_memcached or we can just create tiny module with higher-level API for mc_client_binary.
