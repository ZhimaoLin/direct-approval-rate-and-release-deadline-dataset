This looks good, but the compatibility check doesn't seem to be working properly.

I think you'll have to first check the currently configured storageMode value. Depending on the currently set value the corresponding radio button must be selected. If no value is set then, by default, plasma (or "Standard GSI") option must be selected.

Mike, please correct me if I have missed something.
