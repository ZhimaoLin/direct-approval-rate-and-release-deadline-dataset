Patch Set 4:

(4 comments)

Overall code looks good. Few comments/questions.

Line:15, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> Will be good to have one line comment explaining the purpose of this new module.

Line:32, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> I guess the purpose of using an ETS table in this module is for fast lookup. Otherwise, every "get" would need to search ns_config, get the INDEX_CONFIG_KEY, decode the JSON values and return.

Is my understanding correct?

Line:39, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> Why is the function called "dirty"? Asking since it is just "get" of multiple keys.

Line:59, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> What is the purpose of this function? Will it be used during software upgrades?
