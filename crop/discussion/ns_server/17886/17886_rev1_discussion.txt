Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:460, priv/public/js/documents.js -> this is being called only from showDocumentListState which is only called from code below.

I want us to avoid quite complex callee.calback thing. Just set some flag and call afterPage load directly from code below
