Line:17, priv/public/angular/app/mn_wizard/step3/mn_wizard_step3_service.js -> I think we should do "boolValue ? 1 : 0" instead Way more readable for people like me who don't do javascript on daily basis

Line:57, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/details_dialog/mn_buckets_details_dialog_service.js -> I think we should do "boolValue ? 1 : 0" instead
Way more readable for people like me who don't do javascript on daily basis
