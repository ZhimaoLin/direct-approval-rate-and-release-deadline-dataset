DESCRIPTION

MB-1143: revise groups UI to build servers cell from pool details

Because pool details are refreshed constantly in order to get fresh
server stats. And because we only need groups cell to reflect
server-group relation.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

I know that's rubber-stamp, but I want people to start testing with my changes.

Pavel, please have a look at this.

This is essentially what I told you I'd do. We capture host-group relation through groups cell (and rely on ?v to automagically refresh it), and we take node infos from pool details, only using host-group relation cell to assign group name field.

And I've also changed cell in groups section to grab snapshot of that cell and avoid re-fetching it.
