Patch Set 4:

Except the fact I don't like parsing index.html which I expressed to Dave in person, I think we should force some consistent order on the fragments. Currently it totally depends on filelib:wildcard. And since html and javascript are involved, order may make a difference :)

Patch Set 4:

What do You mean with "parsing index.html"? It only injects the fragments at a marker. There is no real parsing going on.

Regarding the order of the fragments, You are correct, I had already agreed with Dave to do it, but it got lost. Will fix it.
