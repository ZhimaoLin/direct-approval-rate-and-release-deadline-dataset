Line:27, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Changed my mind on the name. Can we call it index-frag.html? Just nicer to have the file extension correctly reflect the content.

Line:28, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Would like to be a bit more formal here. How about:
"Inject index-frag.html file content for Pluggable UI components here"

Line:319, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I think it would be good to cache the result in memory so we don't have to do a bunch of disk i/o every time we vend index.html. Did you want to do it in a subsequent checkin or are you against it?

Line:319, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I am not strictly against it but I am not sure that it is worth it.
As I understand it index.html is only read when the user logs in, or does a reload page in the browser. So it will not happen very often.

So I think caching would add a bit of complexity to be able to detect that index.html or any of the fragments have been modified and regenerate index.html this would also lead to disk i/o to read the file modification times, for very little performance gain.

So lets discuss it and add it as a separate change if it really is necessary.
