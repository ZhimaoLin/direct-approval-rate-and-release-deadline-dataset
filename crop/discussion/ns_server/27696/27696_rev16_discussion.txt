DESCRIPTION

MB-7960: XDCR on pipelined memcached binary protocol

This commit implements XDCR over binary memcached binary protocol
(MBP), namely, "xmem" replication mode. We keep current XDCR to
CAPI, namely "capi". The default replication mode will be "xmem",
but users can switch back to "capi" through ns_server parameter:

"xdcr_replication_mode",

or, environtment parameter:

XDCR_REPLICATION_MODE

e.g.  export XDCR_REPLICATION_MODE="capi"

Like existent XDCR parameters, env parameter will always override
ns_server paraemeter.

In "xmem" mode XDCR, each vb replicator creates a server process
(xmem_srv), which may create one or multiple child worker process
(xmem_worker) responsible for all communications to remote memcached,
e.g, connect, select_bucket, build and send memcahced request via
MBP, and disconnect. The server process will relay request from vb
replicator worker (vb_rep_worker) to xmem worker process, and return
results back to vb replicator worker. The xmem_srv process is also
repsonsible for load balancing, stats collection and report, and
replay errors from child xme_worker process to vb replicator. The
default num of xmem_worker created by xmem_srv is 1, which can be
adjusted by ns_server parameter "xdcr_xmem_worker" and environemnt
paraemeter "XDCR_XMEM_WORKER".

This enhancement provides an alternative replication mode along
with current CAPI mode. It is completely a lower level data commutation
protocol change and has no impact to upper level XDCR protocol. The
benefit is mostly performance-wise: increased throughput, improved
scalability, etc. It should be completely transparent to users, in
particular, we maintain these invariants:

no change to current replication protocol;
no change to current XDCR stats;
no change to current XDCR checkpoint behavior;
no change to current XDCR behavior during topology change;
all current XDCR functional tests shall pass.
