See couple of the comments inline. Haven't finished looking yet though.

Line:216, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> You can just say S#service_state{mailed_too_small_cluster = SvcNodes}.

Line:235, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> Look at misc:key_update function. You could extend it to handle the tuple that have more than two elements and also where the key is not necessarily the first element (like lists:key* family of functions). In that case you could write something like the following:

misc:key_update(Service, #service_state.name, ServicesState, Fun)
