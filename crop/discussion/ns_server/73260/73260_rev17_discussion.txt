Line:132, src/auto_failover.erl -> if you do not insist on crashing here in case if auto_failover_cfg flag is not found, there's ns_config:search_prop/4 that implements this logic. And use ns_config:latest() instead of ns_config:get(). It is faster.

Line:132, src/auto_failover.erl -> The auto_failover_cfg is always expected to be present in the config as it's in the default config. So, I thought of explicitly checking that it's present. I will use the ns_config:latest() as you have suggested.
