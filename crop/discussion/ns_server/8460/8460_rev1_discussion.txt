Patch Set 1: Fails

Seems it's going to take a bit more code than that to make this really work:
 - stale needs to be displayed in the Filter form UI
 - stale also needs to be removed from the params if it's not present in the Filter form UI

Right now, it's "stuck" there, and doesn't show in the Filter form UI.
