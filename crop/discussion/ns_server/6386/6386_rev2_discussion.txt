Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

this needs fixing. See in-line comments

Line:457, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> desc is not string here. It's whole description object. I know this naming is a bit confusing, but renaming it to title is even more confusing.

Line:466, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> same as before
