Patch Set 9:

Hey Pavel:

I'm not comfortable suppressing negative numbers in all these cases. It's could be seen as OK in the specific case of "Other buckets" on disk usage since we do a subtraction on the total disk used across the cluster and the disk used by one bucket. However, these values has the same source (ns_doctor) but there can be a time separation in their calculation times. As such I think we should first look at this on the server side -- but we shouldn't do it in watson. I'm going to push the ticket out.
