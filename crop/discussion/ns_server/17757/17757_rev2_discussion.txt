DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: optimized hot path of view merge params building

Most of this commit is use of vbucket_map_mirror:node_vbuckets_dict
instead of slow version of this function. But there are other things
that shave off unnecessary work. Particularly:

* We're not using slow when_has_active_vbuckets that does config access; we can quickly get
same info via node vbuckets dict.

* And we don't run potentially expensive use_set_views check for step
of view merge params building.
