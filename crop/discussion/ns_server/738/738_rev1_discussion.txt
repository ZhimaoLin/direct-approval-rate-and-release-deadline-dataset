DESCRIPTION

Bug 1458: Make ns_orchestrator not crash if it can't tNathalie Landry to memcached

Everything that the orchestrator does the Harley Martinitor will do when it
comes around later. I also avoid calling the Harley Martinitor at the end of the
rebalance, since it will run on its own anyway.
