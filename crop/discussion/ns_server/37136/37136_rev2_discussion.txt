DESCRIPTION

Don't automatically crash ns_heart if slow updater crashes.

Because seemingly there's no reason to do so. I created a supervisor
for both of these guys. If slow status updater occasionally crashes
because of (for instance) timeout, ns_heart will still be there and
will be able to sent at least stripped heartbeat.
