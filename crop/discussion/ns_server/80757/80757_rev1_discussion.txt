DESCRIPTION

[supervisor2] Don't delete pid from state when delaying restart.

Instead we mark it as being restarted. The reason this is needed is as
follows:

 - If on the delayed restart attempt the process crashes in the init
   function, yet another restart attempt is scheduled using
   try_again_restart path.

 - try_again_restart expects the child to be in restarting state,
   otherwise it ignores the request. This logic seems to be inherited
   from regular supervisor.

 - It's the restart function that's supposed to mark child
   restarting. Again, it's inherited from regular supervisor. But it'd
   mark the child as being restarted only if its old pid is present.

 - That's where it breaks. Since the child was deleted when scheduling
   delayed restart, the pid was set to undefined. So restart function
   wouldn't set the child state to restarting, and hence if the child
   then crashes in init, try_again_restart will be ignored. And then
   there'll be no attempts to restart this child whatsoever.
