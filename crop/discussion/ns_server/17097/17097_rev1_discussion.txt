DESCRIPTION

MB-5521: two commands have the same op code 0xaa

CMD_CREATE_CHECKPOINT and CMD_NOTIFY_VBUCKET_UPDATE have the same op
code 0xaa, which causes conflict. Now we change the op code of
CMD_NOTIFY_VBUCKET_UPDATE to 0xac in ep_engine and need to change
that in ns_server accordingly.

Patch Set 1: Verified; No score

The change on EP engine side has been merged. Can you please approve this commit if it fine? Otherwise, things will break if we use different op code. Thanks
