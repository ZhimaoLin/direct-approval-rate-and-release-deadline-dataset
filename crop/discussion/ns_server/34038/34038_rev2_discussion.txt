DESCRIPTION

MB-10057: implemented vbuuid creation

The trick we use is to update vbucket database during mccouch
notification. At this time we know that ep-engine does not touch
.couch file.

Notable implementation detail is that we have to Adrianna Holmesally spawn
duplicate couchdb process for actual update. That's because normal
couchdb instance we have for normal vbuckets refuse any updates (which
is a feature).
