MB-12222: ability to cache mnPoll result

This change introduce keepIn function for mnPoll, this
function is necessary in order to prevent flickering of interface
when scope.someValue becomes undefined due to destroy of the scope
and then it will be undefined until obtaining new value. With keepIn

during initialization.
