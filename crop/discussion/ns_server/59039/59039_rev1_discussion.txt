Line:134, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> Hey Anders --  Actually the way you've implemented it is a little different than I understood on the phone. Does this actually work - i.e. have you tested this in the UI by running a view query from the Views tab on the beer-sample bucket? Reason is that I don't think it will work (because I think the list of authenticated users by token is in ns_server and not in couchdb) but of course I could be wrong ...

Line:134, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> I second that. It won't work. The whole idea of "Capi-Auth-Token" was that we outsource complex auth to ns_server and then ns_server just tells couchdb node that the request was safely authenticated.

I was planning to rewrite this particular place as part of the RBAC project, so lets abandon this commit for now.

Line:134, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> No. I take it back. In the previous commit rpc call is done to auth token on couchdb node

Line:230, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> since we don't have custom token for views anymore, this fun can be removed. all these headers are copied anyway.

Line:134, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> So what is Your conclusion? Is this a good way to do this? Or should I do something else?

Line:134, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> Yes, this works for me. There may of course still be something wrong with this. When I started the Views in the UI stopped working, but with my changes it started working again.

Line:230, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> There is no ns-server-auth-token in the request from the UI.
menelaus_auth:extract_ui_auth_token gets the token from the Cookie.

Line:134, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> This looks fine. I didn't notice the previous commit when I wrote my first comment.

Line:230, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> True. Now I remember that we had to introduce this header because we had problems with cookie name mismatch. Let's leave it like this.
