DESCRIPTION

MB-3262 Include bin path and reformat output

Should include <installpath>\server\bin to the path, where
browse_logs.bat belongs.
Since wmic command outputs in UNICODE format, need to add reformat
attribute in wmic related tasks so that we can reformat into ANSI.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

I was just about to -1 this -- didn't solve the problems I brought up previously.

Line:39, collect_info -> I don't think you should use hasattr here.  That's kind of strange looking.
