DESCRIPTION

Move the code moving single vbucket data into a separate module.

No anonymous or private functions are spawned on remote nodes
now. Additionally, since all the code performing the actual move is
concentrated in a single module, it will be easier to update it on
remote nodes. Together with new master election algorithm this will
allow us to perform cross-version rebalance even if vbucket mover
versions differ across the cluster.
