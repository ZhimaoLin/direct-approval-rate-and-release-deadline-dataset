Line:841, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> menelaus_web:validate_cred function does exactly the same thing plus enforces the minimum number of characters in password. If we don't want to apply the same restrictions to the bucket passwords I would extend it like this and reuse:

validate_cred(P, admin_password) when length(P) < 6 -> <<"The password must be at least six characters.">>;
validate_cred(P, admin_password) ->
      validate_cred(P, password) ->

Line:841, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> No, it doesn't do exactly the same thing. It also differs in handling of spaces. I could have generalized this too. But given that this change will most likely be unneeded in current form in the next release, I decided that it was not worth it.

I'm going to approve this but will not merge it in hope we can abandon it.

Line:841, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> I agree with Aliaksey.

Well ideally we'd just refuse to do this at all but that's another story.
