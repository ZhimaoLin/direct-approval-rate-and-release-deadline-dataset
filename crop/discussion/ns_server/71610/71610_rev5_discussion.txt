DESCRIPTION

Add function to compute same URL on different node ...

... running a specified service.

This is needed for cases where a UI page can't be presented because
a required service is running on a different node. Query, FTS and
views all have need of this functionality and all do it differently --
it's time we unified.

The function computes the URL for the same $location on a different
node. It retains the same logic around correctly handling
$locations under HTTPS as the old code.
