DESCRIPTION

MB-17295: allow pluggable tabs to specify preceding OOTB tab

...and tab template, so registerConfig should looks like this

mnPluggableUiRegistryProvider.registerConfig({
  template: '<li ui-sref-active="currentNav">' +
    '<a ui-sref="app.admin.query.workbench">Query</a>' +
  '</li>',
  index: 4,
  plugIn: 'adminTab'
});

advantage of this method is that folks have full control of their
tabs.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Pavel: I very like the idea of preserving the HTML (nice!) but I don't want the following parts:
1) I don't want pluggable UI writers to supply their own tab bar template. This should be provided for them and their config should integrate with it.
2) I don't want pluggable UI writers to specify the tab index where they should be inserted. That's actually not capturing what they want. They want to be "after a given tab" or "at the end" -- so I want to have the pluggable config specify an "after" value so that the tab gets placed in the right spot. See my other change for the proposal on how I think it would be nice to do it. 

Thanks,

I got your point, but what you are going to do if folks will need 
ng-class="{currentNav: ('app.admin.query' | includedByState)}"
instead of
ui-sref-active="currentNav"
or 
ng-show="rbac.cluster.query.read"

Patch Set 4:

Hey Pavel 

Good questions. Today, we only support pluggable UI components that have a single state. We can wait until folks need multiple states or we could change the templates to have an expression like "{curentNav: ('{{ config.parentState || config.state }}" | includedByState)}" so that pluggable UI writers can get multi-state working already. 

On the RBAC question - we'll probably need to add readPermission to the config.
