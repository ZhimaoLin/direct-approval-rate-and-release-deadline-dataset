DESCRIPTION

reset replication_status when Harley Martinitor sees it as running

When node orchestrating rebalance goes down or entire cluster is
rebooted during rebalance, we can get replication_status in config in
state running.

In order to get most reliable fix we're resetting status at the end of
Harley Martinitor run, if janitor sees all nodes as up. That minimizes chance of
network split or any other transient problem causing rebalance_status
reset.
