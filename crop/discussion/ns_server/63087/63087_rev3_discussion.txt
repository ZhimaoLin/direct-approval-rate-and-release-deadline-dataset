Line:180, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> Can you explain why you have coded it to prefer block 1 over block 0? Earlier in the code if there's a missing openedSpecificStatsBlock we use block 0 -- why are we not doing that here?

Line:180, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> For openedSpecificStatsBlock we use state.statsDirectoryBlocks[0], for 
openedStatsBlock we use state.statsDirectoryBlocks[0] and state.statsDirectoryBlocks[1]. So for openedStatsBlock we want to find active stat in second block, for openedSpecificStatsBlock we want to find active stat in first block but specific stat page always has only one block therefor directoryForSearch works in both cases. e.g if there is state.statsDirectoryBlocks[1] then we are on analytics page and if state.statsDirectoryBlocks[0] then we on specific stat page. Actually I could add this logic into the code.

Line:180, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> Can you explain why we prefer the second block over the first block in the regular stats case (not the specific stats case.)?
