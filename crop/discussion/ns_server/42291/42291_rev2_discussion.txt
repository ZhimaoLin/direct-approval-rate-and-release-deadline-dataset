Line:21, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/overview/mn_admin_overview_controller.js -> In better implementation this won't be needed

Line:8, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_service.js -> this will probably not work. I think your groups call will fail by this time.

I think "groups available" and "is enterprise" can be initialized once on login and then reused everywhere.

Line:90, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_service.js -> why ?
