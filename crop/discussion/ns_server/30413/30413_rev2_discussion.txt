DESCRIPTION

MB-9589: handle incomplete cluster leave

When cluster leave function fails we can end up in a state where node
remains in a limbo state forever.

New code places marker file on filesystem to indicate that leave is
happening. With that, if ns_cluster dies during leave cluster
procedure, it'll detect incomplete leave in init and complete it (or
fail while doing it).
