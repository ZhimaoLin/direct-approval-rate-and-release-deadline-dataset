DESCRIPTION

MB-19677 Skip compaction for moved out vbuckets.

Since we get the list of vbuckets to compact in the very beginning of
compaction iteration, it's possible that by the time we get to
compacting some of them, they are already moved out from the
node. With this change we don't pollute UI log with unnecessary
"compaction failed" messages.
