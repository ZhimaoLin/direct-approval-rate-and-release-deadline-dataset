DESCRIPTION

MB-17417: Clear recovery-type after full recovery.

The recovery_type and failover_vbuckets keys in the ns_config get
cleared in case of delta recovery completion but they don't get
cleared in case of full receovery earlier. This patches clears
them up.

Line:1198, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> This is not causing any problems, but technically failover_vbuckets should be set to []. 'none' doesn't have any special meaning here. In fact, in apply_delta_recovery_buckets also incorrectly sets failover_vbuckets to undefined (with no impact). We should probably change this in both places.
