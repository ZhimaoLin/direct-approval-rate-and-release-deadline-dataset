Patch Set 1:

I don't quite understand how exactly 'rebalance_prevented_failover' flag in a state record intended to be used. For example, the following test fails for me in the last expression:

rebalance_2_test() ->
    State0 = init_state(3),
    {[], State1} = process_frame([a,b,c], [], State0, true),
    State2 = process_frame_no_action(4, [a,b,c], [b], State1, true),
    {[{rebalance_prevented_failover, b}], State3} = process_frame([a,b,c], [b], State2, true),
    #state{rebalance_prevented_failover = true} = State3,
    {[], State4} = process_frame([a,b,c], [b], State3, true),
    {[], _State5} = process_frame([a,b,c], [b], State4, true).


But if this is actually expected, then I believe it deserves either a comment or reference in commit message.

Patch Set 1:

Agreed. My basic idea was to avoid logging "cannot autofailover due to rebalance" continuously. So this flag that we'll reset as soon as rebalance is not running or as soon as node we wanted to failover is healthy again or if some additional nodes are unhealthy preventing failover.

When this flag is set we don't try to log this but we don't try to failover as well.

I'll update commit. Thanks for pointing this out.

Your description coincides with my expectations. But as you can see from the test case I posted it doesn't work as expected. Or maybe I'm missing something there.

even better than. We've found bug.

Indeed test now fails. Thanks a lot for finding it. I'll update commit.
