Patch Set 9: Verified+1

Latest patch contains changes to the precedence order. Data service is given highest precedence. Other services treated equally. Also, fixed some indentation.

With this the main auto-failover policy change is done.  

Other minor changes and Aliaksey's code review comments  will be done in separate commits:
1. Replace log_debug with User log for the auto failover disabled for a service message. Maintain service specific state in auto_failover_logic for mail_too_small and auto_failover_disabled.
2. Use lists:map while creating service config.
3. Replace index_auto_failover_disabled with {auto_failover_disabled, index}
4. Update wording in cluster too small auto-failover alert message. 
5.  New eunit tests  in auto-failover-logic. 
6. Optimization: Do not calculate nodeuuid and service config on every tick.
