DESCRIPTION

[rebuild_replicas] Sync ns_config before rebalance/bucket update.

That minimizes the chances of conflicts even if mastership moves to a
different node.

Another source of config conflicts is the fact, that repl_type is
updated on the node executing the script, not the master. So this is
also addressed.
