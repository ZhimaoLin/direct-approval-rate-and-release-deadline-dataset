DESCRIPTION

implemented vclocks for non-list ns_config values. MB-3813

Also very likely MB-3829.

We're using non-proper lists with 'cdr' of first pair being config
value. This is natural extension of vclocks support for list values
(tl/1 of raw value returns meta-data-less value). So it's even reasonably
backwards compatible.
