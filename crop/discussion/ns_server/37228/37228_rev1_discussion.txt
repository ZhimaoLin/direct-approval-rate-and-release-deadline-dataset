DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: include lastTS into cbcollect task hash

... so task url is changed every time when we have new cbcollect_info
run. this fixes infinite spinner problem

the problem: if cbcollect_info fails quickly so task never goes to
status = running, but goes from idle to idle with result = failed,
then the tasks url was never changed and the UI had no way to find
out that the tasks should be retrieved. this caused the UI to display
infinite spinner.

Thanks.

BTW, could someone point me at some documentation for our 'Verified' policy? I note that some projects appear to use a CI build for this, and others (ns_server?) seem to use a self-or-peer review system?

We do not need an additional flag to detecting it. UI could change page on result when '/collectLogs/start' success. Also Also when I run auto collect at first time and it fails with error

xxx@xxx.xxx cbcollect_info exited without outputting a status. Exit value 2

then perNode contains nothing but perNode appears after refreshing the page

I was wrong, lastTS is needed for proper working of equality (ns.tasksCollectionInfoCell.equality) function in case when auto_collect task was quietly changed
