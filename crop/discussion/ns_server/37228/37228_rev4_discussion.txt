DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: include lastTS into cbcollect task hash

... so task url is changed every time when we have new cbcollect_info
run. this fixes infinite spinner problem

the problem: if cbcollect_info fails quickly so task never goes to
status = running, but goes from idle to idle with result = failed,
then the tasks url was never changed and the UI had no way to find
out that the tasks should be retrieved. this caused the UI to display
infinite spinner.
