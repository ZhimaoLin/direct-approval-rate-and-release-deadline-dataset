DESCRIPTION

MB-18024: fix head frag inclusion code under multiple docroots

Previously the code blew up trying to filename:join() a
{multiple_roots, ...} tuple to "head.frag.html". This fix
searches all the docroots for "head.frag.html" and includes
the contents if it exists.

Patch Set 2:

I think this is mostly fine. One minor comment is that services with multiple docroots will cause errors in the logs for every docroot that doesn't contain a head fragment. I'm not sure this is an error condition -- but I can also see how it could be. I.e. we might say that each doc root should contain a head fragment that refers to the resources in that doc root that are to be loaded. I.e. in general we would recommend that head frags only refer to resources that are in the same docroot. Is this what you are thinking?

Patch Set 2:

I spent some time thinking about it and couldn't really decide what to do about it.
I think it is better to warn about missing fragments, rather than hiding it just because there happens to exist a fragment in one, or more, of the other docroots.

I also think that it seems reasonable to require that if there exist a docroot there has to exist a fragment that manages all the references to the content. Otherwise what is the point of having multiple docroots?

In the worst case the service designer can add an empty head.frag.html to signal that they know what they are doing.

Patch Set 2:

Hmm. Thinking about it more, ideally I think we should only log an error if no head fragment is found in any of the docroots.

The point of having multiple docroots, at least for CBFT under cluster_run is to allow them aggregate UI resources from different repos in order to merge into the product Web Console. Bleve has no need of a head fragment for instance since it has no knowledge that its UI resources are also getting sucked into the web console. Basically Steve built an "adapter layer" directory that builds the CBFT UI in the Couchbase web console leveraging resources from other repos like bleve. It would be ugly to inject a head fragment into bleve -- Marty would be right to ask: "what do I need that for"? :-)

So actually, thinking about it more I would be happy to require that there be only one head fragment. And I'd also be happy to require that it just be the first docroot -- which should make the implementation pretty straightforward. 

Thoughts?
