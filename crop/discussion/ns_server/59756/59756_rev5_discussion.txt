DESCRIPTION

MB-18024: fix head frag inclusion code under multiple docroots

Previously the code blew up trying to filename:join() a
{multiple_roots, ...} tuple to "head.frag.html". This fix
searches all the docroots for "head.frag.html" and includes
the contents if it exists. An error is logged only in case
there is no "head.frag.html" found in the first docroot.
Errors in other docroots are ignored.
