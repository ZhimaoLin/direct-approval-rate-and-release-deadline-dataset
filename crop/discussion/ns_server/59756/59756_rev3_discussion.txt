DESCRIPTION

MB-18024: fix head frag inclusion code under multiple docroots

Previously the code blew up trying to filename:join() a
{multiple_roots, ...} tuple to "head.frag.html". This fix
searches for the file in the list of doc roots first
(in the case of multiple docroots only) before continuing with
the existing path of reading and including the file contents.
