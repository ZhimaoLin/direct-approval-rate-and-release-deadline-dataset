DESCRIPTION

MB-100 some menelaus_stats re-factoring

- moving parsing the parameters higher in callstack
  Reason: it is quite confusing that gather_op_stats
  returns parsed parameters along with gathered stats,
  creates an impression that Step, Period and Count
  are calculated from the stats
- made some variable names more consistent, removed
  some unused parameters etc..
