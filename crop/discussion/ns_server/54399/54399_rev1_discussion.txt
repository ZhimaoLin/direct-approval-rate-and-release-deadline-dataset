DESCRIPTION

MB-16040: change compute on computeEager for is40СompatibleCell

there are couple of places in code where is40СompatibleCell is used
a bit incorrectly like is40СompatibleCell.value instead of
is40СompatibleCell.getValue() in order to maintain the first case (.value)
we should compute is40СompatibleCell as fast as possible via computeEager
