that doesn't look like right fix. I.e. build_recover_task is called from do_build_tasks_list where it's result is appended to.

Perhaps better way would be to add {struct, _} in place where tasks are sent or something like that

Patch Set 1:

Not sure I understand. Recovery task is supposed to be an object so it needs to be enclosed in {struct, _}. You can see that we do the same thing for rebalance task and every other task there:

PreRebalanceTasks = [{struct, V} || V <- PreRebalanceTasks2]
RebalanceTask = {struct, RebalanceTask0}
MaybeRecoveryTask ++ [RebalanceTask | PreRebalanceTasks].
