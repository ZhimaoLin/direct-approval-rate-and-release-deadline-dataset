DESCRIPTION

refresh DAL.cells.capiBase value instead of keeping old value

Previous assumption was that capiBase don't need to change. So we just
kept old value forever, thinking that there's small benefit of that.

But this value _can_ change in fact. When node is started, it's
capiBase is 127.0.0.1:8902, when first other node joins it, we rename
it, thus changing capiBase.

This fixes bug when view creation via UI could fail sometimes.
