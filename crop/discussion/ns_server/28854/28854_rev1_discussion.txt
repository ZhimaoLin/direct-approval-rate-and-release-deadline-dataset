pretty good but see inline

Line:538, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Given there is parse_validate_replicas_number and given this function is merely for adding warnings I suggest adjusting it's name to better reflect it's meaning and avoid confusion.

Line:548, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Given you're adding two strings here you may want to add something in between. Like "and" or whatever.
