See inline.

Line:652, src/capi_set_view_manager.erl -> Should we use a sequence number that is always safe here? Otherwise it would be possible to purge unindexed deletions because of intermittent failure of any sort.

Patch Set 3:

If it's transient errors, then as far as I understand indexes will reset itself once past "purge point".

On the other hand if it's permanent errors than at least we'll not break deletions purging.

So in this place I like ignoring errors more than not ignoring them.
