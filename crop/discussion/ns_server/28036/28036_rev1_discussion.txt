Patch Set 1:

I haven't even tried to run this yet. But I have to run already.

I'm uploading this to show what I'm trying to do and how it appears to be feasible.

Please, see if you find any issues with _approach_ I'm taking.

Without nak I'm going to finalize this work tomorrow morning.

Patch Set 1:

(1 comment)

Line:821, src/compaction_daemon.erl -> It should be union of ?set_seqs(Group) with ?set_unidexable_seqs(Group).

The later is for "paused" partitions (the stuff that happens during rebalance).
I can add an API to do that.

Otherwise all seems ok.
