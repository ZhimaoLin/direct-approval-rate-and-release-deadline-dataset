Patch Set 35:

noticed a bug when picking a role - the characters I type also appear in the role selector box so I "Admin admin" shows up. 

Also prefer to check this in with the next checkin "moved settings tabs under security tab" since otherwise folks are going to get confused with the non-functional "Certificate" and "Audit" links under the security tab.
