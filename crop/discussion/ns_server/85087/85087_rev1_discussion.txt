DESCRIPTION

MB-26479: Pick the CAPI bind_address based on...

...the networking mode in which the cluster has been configured.

We pick the CAPI bind_address from the capi.ini file which specifies
a default address of 0.0.0.0. If the cluster has been configured in
IPv6 mode and if the user doesn't specify the correct IPv6 address
via the capi.ini file then we would use IPv6 inaddr_any as the bind
address.
