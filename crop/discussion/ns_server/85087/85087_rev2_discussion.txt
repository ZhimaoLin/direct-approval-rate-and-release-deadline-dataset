DESCRIPTION

MB-26479: Pick the CAPI bind_address based on...

...the networking mode in which the cluster has been configured.

We pick the CAPI bind_address from the capi.ini file which specifies
a default address of 0.0.0.0. If the cluster has been configured in
IPv6 mode and if the user doesn't specify the correct IPv6 address
via the capi.ini file then we would use IPv6 inaddr_any as the bind
address.

Patch Set 2: -Verified

Harsha and I were thinking about introducing a new ipv6 specific bind_address parameter in the CAPI.ini file. I think that's probably a better approach. Will mark this as unverified.

Line:99, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> I don't see a reason why to introduce misc:is_good_address/2 just for this. I think it's better to use misc:is_good_address/1 and do the rest of the logic here.
