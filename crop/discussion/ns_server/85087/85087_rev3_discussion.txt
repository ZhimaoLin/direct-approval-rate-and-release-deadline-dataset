DESCRIPTION

MB-26479: Pick the CAPI bind_address based on...

...the networking mode in which the cluster has been configured.

With the support for IPv6 introduced we are now adding separate
bind address parameters in capi.ini file. Depending on the
networking mode in which the cluster has been configured, the
corresponding bind address will be chosen.
