DESCRIPTION

use past vbucket maps to optimize vbucket movements

New code picks closest of past but matching vbucket maps and newly
generated vbucket map.

Unit tests particularly ensure that failover/add-back case is handled
with minimal movements. Also simultaneous removal of N nodes and
addition of N other nodes performs minimal movements as well (transfer
of vbuckets between this nodes).
