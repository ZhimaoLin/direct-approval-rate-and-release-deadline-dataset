DESCRIPTION

MB-8656: allow adding vm flags of child vm via env variable

By setting environment variable COUCHBASE_NS_SERVER_VM_EXTRA_ARGS it
is now possible to add erlang vm flags of child vm. It is interpreted
as erlang term which must represent list of strings.

E.g. in order to pass +swt low you can do the following:

COUCHBASE_NS_SERVER_VM_EXTRA_ARGS='["+swt", "low"]' ./cluster_run
