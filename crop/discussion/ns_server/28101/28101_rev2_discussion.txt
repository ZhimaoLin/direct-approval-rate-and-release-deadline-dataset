DESCRIPTION

MB-8787: make XDCR bach size use correct parameter

Today XDCR uses incorrect parameter to batch, e.g., parameter
xdcr_worker_batch_size means the max number of docs we can
put in a batch instead of how much data to make a batch (size
of batch). This commit will make XDCR using correct parameters
to batch, in both "capi" and "xmem" mode.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I have the same fix sitting in my queue. And since I've got lots of other xdcr related changes it's better to submit mine. I hope to upload everything tomorrow.

Patch Set 2:

What do you mean by "same fix"? Please specify the ticket.  The "per replication" parameter stuff should be totally independent of this one.
I am not sure why it is better to merge more complicated commit with many things.  Thanks.
