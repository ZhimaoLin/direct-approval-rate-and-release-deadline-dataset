Patch Set 7: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Looks like it's working for enterprise, however in community the security tab doesn't show and the old "Account Management" tab is long gone so folks can't manage their read only users. I didn't test this out under the various upgrade scenarios - though we need to. I'll send a note to QE on this. Let's push this and I'll file a bug on the missing readonly user mgmt tab in Community.
