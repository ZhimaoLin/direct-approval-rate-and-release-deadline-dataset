DESCRIPTION

MB-10273 create copy of compaction_daemon as a base for further development

unfortunately we need to keep compaction_daemon fsm for backwards
compatibility with older nodes. so I have to copy the whole code under
different name and after the new compaction_new_daemon will be fully
functional I'll rewire all the requests to it and turn compaction_daemon
into the empty stab the whole purpose of which will be to reroute
old nodes requests to compaction_new_daemon
