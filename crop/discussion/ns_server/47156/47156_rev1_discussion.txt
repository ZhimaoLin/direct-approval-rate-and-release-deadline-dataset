DESCRIPTION

MB-13031: compute mb_map:move_cost faster

Those calls to usort were quite a lot slower than straightforward
simpler code and I did them purely to get rid of multiple occurences
of undefined.

We still leave use of erlang:'--' because it's BIF and because our
chains are very short. And we handle possible trailing undefined-s by
open-coding our fixed-upper-bound length().

In my simple tests it made rebalance_count_experiment-s faster by
almost 2x.
