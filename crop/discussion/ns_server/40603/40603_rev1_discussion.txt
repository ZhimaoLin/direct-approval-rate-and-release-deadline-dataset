DESCRIPTION

better log Harley Martinitor source data for bucket config update decisions

In MB-11890 it looks like we're dealing with the case when vbucket is
seen in vbuckets stats after it is deleted. But I have to infer it
from the code and from other log messages. Having all incoming state
explicitly is going to be helpful for cases like that.
