DESCRIPTION

don't upgrade rest port config for nodes with defined port_meta

If some node already has per-node rest config with port_meta, this
means that somebody already set right value.

But most importantly because we run upgrade code for initial server
startup, previous code always set port_meta to global (because initial
run is always with 1 node). Breaking ./cluster_run badly.

Not upgrading when port_meta is set fixes cluster_run, while
preserving correctness for normal production upgrades.
