very good. Only very minor issues left

Line:166, priv/public/js/core-data.js -> I guess this is not supposed to go into final version

Line:788, priv/public/js/app.js -> this might be called multiple times if users goes back within wizard

Line:73, priv/public/js/updates-notifications.js -> probably fine, but timeout looks a bit too short

Line:788, priv/public/js/app.js -> Is it a problem?

Line:73, priv/public/js/updates-notifications.js -> The reason is that I don't want the interface to show "waiting...." too long.

Line:788, priv/public/js/app.js -> i think so. Try yourself. Your handlers should be run multiple times.

Line:73, priv/public/js/updates-notifications.js -> well. Timeout is for timing out. Out server should be able to process requests faster then 2 seconds. But raising timeout will give it more time in case of a) slower dns b) packet loss c) delays withing AppEngine

What do you think about dropping the "Updates" header, and moving the "Update Notifications" link under "Support"?

Also, wonder if we should remove the bucket names out of stats sent. That's probably a Frank/James decision, but thought I'd mention it.

Benjamin, it doesn't send out the bucket names, only the number and the type.

Line:788, priv/public/js/app.js -> But what's the problem if they are run again if a user goes back?
