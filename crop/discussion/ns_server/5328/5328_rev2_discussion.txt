Line:34, priv/public/js/updates-notifications.js -> hard -1 here. What's the point of doing it Adrianna Holmesally?

Line:86, priv/public/js/updates-notifications.js -> this doesn't fit well with current style of menelaus UI code base

Line:91, priv/public/js/updates-notifications.js -> trailing whitespace
