Patch Set 1:

(6 comments)

Line:585, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> We should keep the discription of meta_latency_aggr and meta_latency_wt.

Line:611, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> This would also apply. It should be kept

Line:575, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> The stats below are aggregated stats from all cluster nodes on this replication spec.

Line:951, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Why do we change "doc checks rate" to third row from second row? We should keep the UI as long as it is possible.

Line:953, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> wtavg_docs_latency is removed above, should this be removed as well?

Line:959, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Any new stats added here, we need to make sure there is a corresponding aggregation logic for it.

Line:585, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I can add them back if we are planning to add these metrics

Line:611, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> were you refering to wtavg_meta_latency or wtavg_docs_latency? the latter is already available from goxdcr and does not need extra processing.

Line:951, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> but we are adding new stats. We want to show stats of higher importance earlier, right?

Line:953, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> it was removed from above not because it is not available, but because it was readily available from goxdcr stats and needs no extra processing.

Line:959, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> This part is what I am not sure about. The existing aggregation logic for XDCAllRepStats only handles a fraction of all stats. For the stats that are not handled, is it that they are not aggregated and displayed at all, or is it that they are aggregated using some default rules, e.g., counters are added up and rated are averaged?

Line:959, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Checked erlang code and runtime results. They actually do not do aggregation at all. They simply list all stats on all nodes one by one:

http://127.0.0.1:9000/pools/default/buckets/default/stats/docs_written:
{"samplesCount":60,"isPersistent":true,"lastTStamp":1424124536039,"interval":1000,"timestamp":[1424124478039,1424124479039,...],"nodeStats":{"10.17.2.102:9000":["undefined","undefined",...],"127.0.0.1:9001":["undefined","undefined",...]}}

"undefined" does not seem to be the right values. The format is pretty clear, though. 

The erlang code should work for our new stats as well.
