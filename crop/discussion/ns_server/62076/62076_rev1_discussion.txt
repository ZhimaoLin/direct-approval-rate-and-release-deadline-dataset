Line:68, src/indexer_gsi.erl -> I don't know how often this is called but ++ is not efficient, it copies its first  argument. So instead of [a,b,c} ++ T, use [a,b,c | T].

If the order is not important this will be better
T = [a, b, c],
[x | T]

In that case since T is a constant, it will be build at compile time and put in the constant pool. No copying will be done.
