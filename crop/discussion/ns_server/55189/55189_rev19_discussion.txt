DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: documents section

Angular implementation has following difference from current UI:

1. documents list is synced with other tabs via mnPoll
2. filter params are applied immediately after entering
3. it has no error about nonexistent bucket inside bucket dropdown
   (because I think it should be on top of list like other errors)
4. it has no preview of the document in documents list due to known issue
   (MB-13975)
5. you'll be redirected from document editing to document list in
   case bucket name is changed
6. it is possible to change pageNumber Adrianna Holmesally directly in hash as well as pageLimit

Also it has one bug (MB-16355)
