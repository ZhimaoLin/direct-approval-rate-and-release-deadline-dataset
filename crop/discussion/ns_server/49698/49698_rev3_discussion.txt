DESCRIPTION

Store checkpoints in simple store.

XDCR uses metakv to store various XDCR related stuff which includes the 
checkpoints. Internally, ns_server stores this data in ns_config. The 
1024 checkpoints stored and updated per bucket overloads ns-config. Use simple-store
to store XDCR checkpoints.
