Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

You can verify your change by setting goxdcr_enabled to false in ns_config like this:

ns_config:set(goxdcr_enabled, false).

After this /pools/default correctly returns goxdcrEnabled false. But I still see at least "advanced filtering" checkbox when creating a replication.
