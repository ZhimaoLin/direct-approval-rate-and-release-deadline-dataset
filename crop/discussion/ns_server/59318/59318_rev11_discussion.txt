DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: update ui-router to version 1.0.0 alpha0

We have to use latest ui router because it has transitionsProvider,
we need transitionsProvider in order to properly handle transition
to the state with rbac permissions
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0alpha0

Old ui-router is deprecated
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/0.2.17

Process of migrating is pretty smooth, although there are couple bugs
