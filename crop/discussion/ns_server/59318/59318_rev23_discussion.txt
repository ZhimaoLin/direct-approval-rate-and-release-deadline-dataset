DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: update ui-router to version 1.0.0 alpha0

We have to use latest ui router because it has transitionsProvider,
we need transitionsProvider in order to properly handle transition
to the state with rbac permissions
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0alpha0

Old ui-router is deprecated
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/0.2.17

Process of migrating is pretty smooth, although there are couple bugs
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2504
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2503

couple of comments, but I think this is fine to merge.

Line:34, priv/public/ui/app/app_config.js -> can we always put the from first? confusing to read this way.

Line:47, priv/public/ui/app/app_config.js -> does this make any difference? Isn't a falsy value (undefined or false) always returned here? Why bother with the switch on response status?

Line:34, priv/public/ui/app/app_config.js -> yes, we can

Line:47, priv/public/ui/app/app_config.js -> That's in accordance with documentation:

Finally, the promise returns a boolean value; returning false from a hook (either through a promise or directly) will cancel the transition.
https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0alpha0

Probably we can return undefined but specs says that it should be boolean, so it is.
