DESCRIPTION

rework of erlang name assignment logic (bugs 757, 995 and others)

This patch changes the way ns_server assigns erlang name. When clean
and fresh node starts it assigns self xxx@xxx.xxx name. When this
node joins existing cluster or some other nodes joins this node we
re-assign name. We connect to erlang port mapper on other node and get
source address of that connection. We use this source address to build
node name. We don't change node name after that anymore.

As a result of that dist_manager is not application anymore but a
single gen_server taking care of node name.

This approach allows us to pick meaningful and correct ip address. So
that both nodes ensure that they can connect to each other. See bug
995 for explanation of why it's important.

Patch Set 1: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Still digesting this changeset, but I think the concept is sound.  One minor fix needed, though, on where the ip address is stored in the filesystem.

Line:24, src/dist_manager.erl -> I think the config/ns_X subdirectory would be better place for this, so that multiple ns_server instances running concurrently on a developer machine don't stomp the same file.
