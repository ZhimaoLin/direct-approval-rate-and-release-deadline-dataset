DESCRIPTION

rework of erlang name assignment logic (bugs 757, 995 and others)

This patch changes the way ns_server assigns erlang name. When clean
and fresh node starts it assigns self xxx@xxx.xxx name. When this
node joins existing cluster or some other nodes joins this node we
re-assign name. We connect to erlang port mapper on other node and get
source address of that connection. We use this source address to build
node name. We don't change node name after that anymore.

As a result of that dist_manager is not application anymore but a
single gen_server taking care of node name.

This approach allows us to pick meaningful and correct ip address. So
that both nodes ensure that they can connect to each other. See bug
995 for explanation of why it's important.

Patch Set 2: Verified

Just rebased old version. Works relatively ok. Except UI showing welcome screen on initially joined node.

Before I forget, something to look for: we also store otp node id's in the ns_config, in both keys and values.

In values, for example, under 'nodes_wanted'.

In keys, we have key tuples that look like {node, xxx@xxx.xxx some_actual_key}.  At least, cucumber tests have keys like that.  And, I was actually going to use that kind of tuple-triplet pattern to store node-specific key-values for membase.

How does a customer "add server" ... This is OK for join FROM a node, but how can you pull in a node?

Patch Set 2:

The patch affects only old-style cluster join. We can drop it entirely and implement same idea for pull-style node addition.

Regarding comment about config keys that contain node names. Most often nodes change names when they join cluster and in this case they forget their ns_config. So this case should be ok.

The not ok case is when node changes it's name when first node joins it's cluster (i.e. we had single-node cluster and now it's cluster of two nodes). We can either rewrite config in this case or don't allow name changes for first node of cluster.

In later case we still get simpler setup procedure for new nodes. In welcome wizard user can choose to join cluster. If he/she does that, than we don't need IP configuration step.
