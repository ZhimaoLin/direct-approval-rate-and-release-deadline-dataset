In the filter test I convert the received header name to lower case. But I have missed to make my filters lowercase. 

I just realized that I had also missed converting a user provided filter to lowercase. I will revise this change

Dave, regarding why we were not able to recreate the problem, looks like Ander's change was merged yesterday after I had rebased my changes. 
Rebased them again and now see the issue.
