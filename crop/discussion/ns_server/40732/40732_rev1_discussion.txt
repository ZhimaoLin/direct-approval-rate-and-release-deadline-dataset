DESCRIPTION

MB-12028: correctly handle missing master vbucket

The bug was due to setting ChainStates element to missing instead of
pair {N, missing}.

I've also added more logging and make sure that we assert that at
least head of ChainStates is a pair. Tests are added for cover all
paths through do_sanify_chain.
