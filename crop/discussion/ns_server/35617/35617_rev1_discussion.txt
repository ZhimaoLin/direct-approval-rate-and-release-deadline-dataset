Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Filipe, Sarath, our understanding of MB-10840 is that it might be "it". I.e. previously capi_set_view_manager always thought that on-disk state is the right one. Now that views don't care about disk, vbucket creations are still fine, but deletions might temporarily cause mismatch between memory and disk (and previously indexes due to trait of capi_set_view_manager I mentioned above).

We think this fix should do the right thing and make synchronization right.
