Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi, can you add the bug number (MB-5080) to the subject line for these last 1.8.1 bug fixes?  It makes those last reports ("what's going into 1.8.1") much easier.  Thanks, Steve.

Patch Set 1:

But it's not actually a fix for MB-5080. It's just a minor bug that was spotted in the diags attached to this ticket.

Patch Set 1:

I think Steve's concern is addressed. MB-5080 is not fixed by this. But issue this commit fixes was found in logs attached to MB-5080. So ticket is not referenced directly.
