DESCRIPTION

spock-ui: initial implement new spock layout

- "analyticsBucket", "documentsBucket" and "viewsBucket" params
  are replaced on just "bucket". There are no reasons why they should
  be unique.

  It helps us easily detect and render current bucket name in child
  states view.

- Added new component which is called mn-element-crane in order to
  have possibility to move some part of view into some other place and
  save scope bindings of that view.

  We currently support the following places
    mn-element-depot name="alerts" - for page specific alerts
    mn-element-depot name="subnav" - for section specific subnav
    mn-element-depot name="header" - for page specific info (e.g. Overview page)
    mn-element-depot name="actions" - for page specific action buttons

  Use mn-element-cargo directive in order to move elements into the
  allowed places e.g.
    <mn-element-cargo depot="alerts">
      Part of your angular template goes here {{withBindingsToCtl...}}
    </mn-element-cargo>

- Added possibility to specify state title and parent via
  data property e.g.
    state('app.parent.some.state', {
      ...
      data: {
        title: 'State Title',
        child: 'app.parent'
      }
      ...
    })

  Special header view with back button will be shown in case when
  "child" property is presented.

- Fixed couple of minor issues when active tab class was not applied.

- Child states were moved under their parents in order to have correct
  state hierarchy. Some childs may have multiple parents therefore their
  ui-sref values became relative. e.g. ^.some.state

- Added name to the main ui-view (ui-view="main") in order to be able
  to render child states in main view container, so that every main
  state view should be correctly configured e.g.

    state('app.parent.some.state', {
      ...
      views: {
        xxx@xxx.xxx {
          controller: ...
          templateUrl: ...
        }
      }
      ...
    })

- lostConnState message moved into mnAdminCtl in order to not duplicate
  it on each page
