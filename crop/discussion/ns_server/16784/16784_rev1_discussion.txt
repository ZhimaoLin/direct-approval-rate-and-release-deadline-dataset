DESCRIPTION

MB-5402:fp: avoid system_stats_collector crashing other services

System stats gathering is a cool thing. But MB-5402 points out that
sometimes we want to count some stats quite before
system_stats_collector configured ets table for stats. We're just
ignoring any exceptions from trying to update those stats now.
