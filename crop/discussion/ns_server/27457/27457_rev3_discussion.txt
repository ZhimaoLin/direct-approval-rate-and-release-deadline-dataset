Patch Set 3: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I disagree with the behavior. 
I think it would be better to add quotes to these fields automatically than to force the user to enter them.

Patch Set 3:

I agree with Artem.

In views filter we allow arbitrary json as filter keys. So we have to demand quotes etc.

But in documents there are only strings. So our UI can and should add quotes (and whatever json-escaping it required) in order to make user's life easier
