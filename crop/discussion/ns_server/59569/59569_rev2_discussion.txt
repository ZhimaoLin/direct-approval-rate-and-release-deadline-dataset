DESCRIPTION

MB-17901: Add custom header for request timeout in pluggable UI

Requests to services using the pluggable UI can add a custom header
"ns_server_proxy_timeout" to specify a request timeout when the request
is proxied to the server handling the service.

The header is removed before forwarding the request. If the
request times out a 504 Gateway Timeout response will be given.

One question inline. Otherwise I really prefer this implementation. :-) Worked out nicely.

Line:37, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> seems like our current naming scheme is to use dashes? E.g. ns-server-ui, ns-server-auth-token?
