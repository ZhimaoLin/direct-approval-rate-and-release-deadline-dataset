DESCRIPTION

MB-17901: Add custom header for request timeout in pluggable UI

Requests to services using the pluggable UI can add a custom header
"ns-server-proxy-timeout" to specify a request timeout when the request
is proxied to the server handling the service.

The header is removed before forwarding the request. If the
request times out a 504 Gateway Timeout response will be given.
