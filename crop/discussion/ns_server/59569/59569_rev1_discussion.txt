DESCRIPTION

MB-17901: Add request timeout query parameter for pluggable UI

Requests to services using the pluggable UI can add a query parameter
plugin_ui_timeout to specify a request timeout when the request is
proxied to the server handling the service.

The query parameter is removed before forwarding the request. If the
request times out a 504 Gateway Timeout response will be given.

I have verified that this works correctly. Changing the units from milliseconds to seconds is probably a good idea, let me know if you do that.

Hi Anders

As we discussed on the phone today, I think using a custom header rather than tunneling this information over a URL parameter would be better. It would simplify the logic in the proxy as you wouldn't have to parse and reassemble the request. Also: if only implemented for URL parameters it would be inconsistent: folks would equally expect it to work for parameters in a form post.

Since we already use some custom headers (ns-server-ui, ns-server-auth-token) it seems we should continue this naming convention. I suggest: ns-server-proxy-timeout. Let me know if you've thought differently about this since we chatted.
