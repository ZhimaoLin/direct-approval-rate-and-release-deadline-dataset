DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: added method setDefaultBucketName to mnHelperProvider

Previous implementation doesn't work as expected. It may block browser
back button.

This change allows us to set some value from async operation as default
value of ui.router state before opening the page.

Patch Set 4:

Well it sucks that mnBucketStats isn't actually cached, so every time we navigate to the indexes tab were sendings a pools/default/buckets query. It seems like we're constantly issuing this query just to figure out which bucket is 'default' or is the first bucket returned. Is the cache in mnBucketStats coming back?

Anyway for now let's go ahead and check in and we can figure out what to do about mnBucketStats later.
