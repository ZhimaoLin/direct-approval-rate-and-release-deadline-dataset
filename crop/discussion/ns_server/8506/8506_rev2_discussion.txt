DESCRIPTION

save and restore filter values per view

Care has been taken to still respect view parameters set via
'back-button'.

We're performing all view changes caused by user activity other then
back button through ViewsSection.setCurrentView, where we're asking
ViewsFilter to initialize filter for given view url. We're keeping LRU
of filters in DOM localStorage (present in all supported browsers) and
limit history length to 256 items.
