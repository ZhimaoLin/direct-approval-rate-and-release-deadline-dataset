DESCRIPTION

MB-24017 - the getUrlsRunningService function uses $location.path(),
which is inappropriate if the function is being called while the
browser is on a page unassociated with the service. This change allows
the caller to send an optional path string.

Also, none of the links were working before because they needed a "!"
after the "#".

fix for "!" after the "#" should be in a separate commit

Theoretically, you shouldn't call getUrlsRunningService while the
browser is on a page unassociated with the service. See how we use it in views page http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/priv/public/ui/app-classic/mn_admin/mn_indexes/mn_views/mn_views_controller.js
