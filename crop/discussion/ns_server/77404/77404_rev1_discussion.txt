DESCRIPTION

MB-24017 - the getUrlsRunningService function uses $location.path(),
which is inappropriate if the function is being called while the
browser is on a page unassociated with the service. This change allows
the caller to send an optional path string.

Also, none of the links were working before because they needed a "!"
after the "#".
