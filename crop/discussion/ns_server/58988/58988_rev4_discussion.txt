DESCRIPTION

MB-17421: Capture /proc/diskstat multiple times

- Currently we only capture the output of /proc/diskstat a single
  time, this is not very useful.

- In order to calculate more in-depth IO statistics, we use iostat,
  however this tool is not installed by default on most Linux
  systems, often our customers do not have this installed when
  they collect logs, which can be frustrating.

- The aim of this commit is to capture /proc/diskstats multiple
  times in a certain timeframe so that it can be used for
  rudimentary time-series based analysis.
