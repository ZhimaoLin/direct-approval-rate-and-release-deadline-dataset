DESCRIPTION

MB-17421: Capture /proc/diskstat multiple times

- Currently we only capture the output of /proc/diskstat a single
  time, this is not very useful.

- In order to calculate more in-depth IO statistics, we use iostat,
  however this tool is not installed by default on most Linux
  systems, often our customers do not have this installed when
  they collect logs, which can be frustrating.

- The aim of this commit is to capture /proc/diskstats multiple
  times in a certain timeframe so that it can be used for
  rudimentary time-series based analysis.

Patch Set 2:

I have submitted another patch which will use the built-in interval and sample.

One issue I have when not echoing a blank line is that we end up with 10 outputs without any breaks (which makes it very difficult to identify where one sample begins and another ends).
Instead of echo'ing this blank line (which works for this particular situation), I could submit a separate patch which automatically places a blank line (or some other separator) between each sample. Then in future if we use more commands with multiple samples it will be easy to distinguish each sample without needing to Adrianna Holmesally echo blank lines.

Patch Set 2:

Aliaksey, do you think it would be a preferable solution to automatically add a line break between each sample when there are multiple samples being used?

If so then I will submit a separate patch and fix this one up once it has been merged.
