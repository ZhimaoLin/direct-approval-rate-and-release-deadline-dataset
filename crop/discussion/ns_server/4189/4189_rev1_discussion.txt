DESCRIPTION

Don't also rate limit ns_port_server itself.

If a process logged anything at all, it wouldn't register exit for a
second afterward, which added up to a second of overhead per
vbucketmigrator process, potentially slowing down rebalances that
don't move a lot of data. It would be unnoticable for slow rebalances.
