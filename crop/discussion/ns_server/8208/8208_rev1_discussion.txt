DESCRIPTION

Touch ebucketmigrator timestamp for any tcp activity

letting NOOP's through for vbucketId 0.

Patch Set 1:

Chiyoung will try to verify if this makes things better.

The theory is that now() timestamps were captured before sending packets to the downstream socket.  The send might block for awhile (longer than the timeout window?), so instead capture now(0 timestamps for every message and only after sending to the downstream socket.
