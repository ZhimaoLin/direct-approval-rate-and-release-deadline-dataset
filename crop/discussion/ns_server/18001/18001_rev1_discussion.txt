DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: avoid useless logs spamming by xdcr

Without this fix its logging "starting vb replication manager" each 5
seconds.

And it can be seen that for each defined replication it will log
message from inside of loop in manage_vbucket_replications. So we just
get rid of this log message.
