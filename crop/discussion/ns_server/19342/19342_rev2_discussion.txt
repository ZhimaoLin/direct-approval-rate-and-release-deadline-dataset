Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)

see inline

Line:1364, src/misc.erl -> Loud warning name is good. But I think it would be good to also assert that trap_exit is actually true.

Line:1377, src/misc.erl -> I think that this comment is more appropriate for sync_shutdown_may_i_am_trapping_exits function since it's the function that is supposed to be called from outside.
