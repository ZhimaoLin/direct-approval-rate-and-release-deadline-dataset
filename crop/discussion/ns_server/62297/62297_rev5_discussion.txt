DESCRIPTION

update ui-router to 1.0.0-alpha.1

New version has alot of bug fixes. Also it's better to use
$transition$.params() where it's possible because ui-router is
moving away from global state, such as $state.current, $stateParams.

More details here https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2666
and here https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha.1

Pavel - change is fine - but can you take care of cleaning up the dependencies?

Line:14, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_analytics/mn_analytics_controller.js -> no used

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_helper.js -> None of these need to be injected.

Line:8, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/list/mn_servers_list_controller.js -> not used

Line:8, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/list/mn_documents_list_controller.js -> not used

Line:8, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_documents/list/mn_documents_list_controller.js -> not used

Also, Pavel can you name ui-router as follows in index.html:
    <script src="libs/angular-ui-router-1.0.0-alpha.1.js"></script>

I'd like start the practice of including the version in the script file name on library scripts. It's handy because it's easy to know what version of the script we're running and it also allows us to specify a long max-age cache control header. Not a big deal, but I think good practice.
