DESCRIPTION

update ui-router to 1.0.0-alpha.1

That's not clear when we should use $state.params vs $transition$.
params() new ui-router spec doesn't describe it well . By trial and
error, I found that $transition$.params() is better to use during
transition e.g. resolve method of a state. $state.params is better
to use when transition is finished e.g. controller.
