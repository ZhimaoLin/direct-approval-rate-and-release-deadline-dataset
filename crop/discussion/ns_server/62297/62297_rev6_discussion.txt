DESCRIPTION

update ui-router to 1.0.0-alpha.1

New version has alot of bug fixes. Also it's better to use
$transition$.params() where it's possible because ui-router is
moving away from global state, such as $state.current, $stateParams.

More details here https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2666
and here https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha.1
