Patch Set 7:

This should be tested on top of these 2 commits:
http://review.couchbase.org/52068
http://review.couchbase.org/52262

In this case REST api takes care about erroring out if you try to insert mapreduce view into spatial document or vice versa. So the sections that duplicate this functionality should be removed. (see inline)

It is possible that you'll have the document like this one:
"json":{"views":{"lala":{"map":"function (doc, meta) {\n  emit(meta.id, null);\n}"}},"spatial":{}}}
This currently handled incorrectly as mixed spatial and mapreduce doc. Though in fact it is just mapreduce doc.

In case if the user somehow will be able to produce mixed document the UI should not display AddView buttons, but show the warning: "No new views can be added to this document. Please delete either mapreduce or spatial views first" 

If the document has no views, I think we should display both Add View and Add Spatial View buttons.
