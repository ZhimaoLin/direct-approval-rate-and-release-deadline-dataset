Line:30, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/sample_buckets/mn_settings_sample_buckets.html -> We don't have buckets versions. For example, even a bucket upgraded from 4.6 to 5.0 is still a 5.0 bucket. Would this make more sense to say same buckets (in Couchbase 5.0+) can only be accessed ...

This message sounds like we have different bucket versions.
