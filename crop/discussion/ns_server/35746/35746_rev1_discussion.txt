DESCRIPTION

MB-10860: retry checkpointing http requests on errors

Because we're using connection pool and because http server may always
close "used" connection without warning, we must expect errors on
attempts to reuse sockets.

Luckily our checkpointing POSTs are idempotent, so we can freely retry
them.
