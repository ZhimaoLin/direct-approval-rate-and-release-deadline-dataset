DESCRIPTION

Remove unnecessary sync_announcements from delete_bucket.

Git history suggests that it was there as an early attempt to make
sure that bucket deletion is synchronous. But it actually doesn't
guarantee much: the events are processed asynchronously. In addition,
we do have a logic that waits until bucket is gone on all nodes. So
there's no need for this sync_announcements call.
