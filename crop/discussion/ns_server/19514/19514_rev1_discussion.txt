DESCRIPTION

MB-6167: fixed saving map/reduce functions into wrong views

This was caused by idiotic behavior of lazy Cells that I introduced
some time ago. See test case that's now fails.

Basicaly I wanted re-subscribtion to detached cells to not recompute
formulas and not re-fetch values (if formula computes to future). And
that's causing current code to keep old value when cell is
detached. And that in turn caused #getValue to just use old value
instead of triggering cell recomputation.

Because fixing it either requires bigger changes or change of behavior
it's a bit too scary for now. Thus I added failing test and changed
affected cells to eager type.
