Line:1577, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Why use an after rather than just swallowing all exceptions?

Put another way, why isn't the entire rest of the function in the after (other than that would be ugly)?

Line:1580, src/menelaus_web.erl -> could other messages in parent queue might hurt here?

perhaps the parent needs to receive some expected msg rather than an open receive?

will improve based on comments

Line:1577, src/menelaus_web.erl -> There's generic exception handler higher up the stack. That logs errors and prints backtraces.

Line:1580, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I'll convert to make_ref() to make it 100% robust
