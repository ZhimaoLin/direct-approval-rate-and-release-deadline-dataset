DESCRIPTION

Upgrader for ns_config 1.7.2 to 1.8.0

Change paths from /opt/membase/bin|etc|lib to /opt/couchbase/X.
However, don't change /opt/membase/var paths as they might
be customized by users to different disks/mounts and we
want to keep those across upgrades.

Need to backport fix for port_servers from 2.0 branch first.

Line:362, src/ns_config_default.erl -> There are certain complications with upgrading non per-node keys. The upgraded value will be replicated to old-version nodes. In this particular case it means that these old nodes will not be able to run memcached and moxi because of invalid paths. Actually port_servers key was made a global key by mistake. We have a fix for this in 2.0 branch. So it should be backported first.

Patch Set 3:

If this is ok for single node, I say let's keep on rolling forward (allowing QE to test single node installs and upgrades), and get the backport into a separate change.
