DESCRIPTION

Reduce the timeout in the periodic warmed buckets check and ...

catch it when it happens.

This path gets executed only when there is no dcp traffic
including dcp no op for atleast 2s. By reducing the timeout, we can
identify issues sooner.

Line:28, src/kv_monitor.erl -> Just a clarification. Since we are reducing the timeout it is possible that the aggregate time required to get the warmed up buckets can breach the 500ms timeout (more easily than before) even though some of them are warmed up. This is ok because from the local node's point of view we found those buckets to be inactive in "local_node_status" function?

Line:28, src/kv_monitor.erl -> It is possible that under some scenario it breaches the 500ms timeout. But, I did not see that in my tests.

When tested on a cluster with max buckets (10), ns_memcached:warmed_buckets(),  returned, on an average, in 5ms. This is on cluster with zero/low load.

I had also done a test - wrote 10Million items to a bucket which generated significant load with compaction etc on my local cluster. This increased the time taken by warmed_buckets() but still did not see the 500ms breach.

Also, this code gets traversed only when the dcp traffic monitor returns the bucket as inactive.
