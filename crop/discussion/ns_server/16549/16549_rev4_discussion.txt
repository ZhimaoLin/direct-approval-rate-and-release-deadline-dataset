Line:156, scripts/cbmovevbucket -> Do we need to consider window platform even though both cbvbucketctrl and cbmovebucket will be at the same direcotry?

Line:222, scripts/cbmovevbucket -> I don't think we create directories other than standard /opt/couchbase/bin or /opt/membase/bin or bin directory.
