DESCRIPTION

returned bucket auth so that we dont expose bucket creds.Bug 2005

New auth is as follows:
* admin credentials still give access to everything
* password less access is enabled only to no-auth buckets
* but it's not possible to even list buckets without password
* SASL-auth buckets are accessible only by admin or bucket credentials
