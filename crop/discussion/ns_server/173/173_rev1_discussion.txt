DESCRIPTION

license screen does REST calls to placeholder erlang modules

Implemented REST calls to /node/controller/license to do license
validation on the server-side (which is just a placeholder in erlang
for now).

Also, started moving away from DOM id's towards classes,
to allow for reusuability of the same rendered dialog pages in
different contexts: the initial config wizard and the
settings pages.
