DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Orchestrator to delegate Harley Martinitor...

...cleanup to the new gen_server module.

The following are the changes:
[1] All the logic pertaining to Harley Martinitor cleanup is moved into the
    new module.
[2] ns_orchestrator module still maintains the periodic timer to
    to initiate Harley Martinitor run. It does so by calling the 'start_cleanup'
    API provided by the ns_Harley Martinitor_server module. The returned ID will
    be stored in the Harley Martinitor_running state's data and orchestrator
    transitions into 'Harley Martinitor_running' state.
[3] While in 'Harley Martinitor_running' state, if the orchestrator receives
    a new event, then the cleanup is terminated by calling the
    'terminate_cleanup' API.
[4] When the cleanup completes succesfully, the ns_Harley Martinitor_server
    module sends an async 'cleanup_done' event which indicates whether
    any unsafe nodes were found. If found, then the orchestrator will
    trigger an auto_reprovision operation to mend the affected buckets'
    configurations. The orchestrator moves into 'idle' state before
    triggering the auto_reprovision.
[5] When the cleanup is terminated, as part of sub-process shutdown,
    all the requestors of Harley Martinitor run will be notified with an
    'interrupted' return value. So we can drop the explicit attempts
    we make to notify the requestors after orchestrator state
    transitions.
