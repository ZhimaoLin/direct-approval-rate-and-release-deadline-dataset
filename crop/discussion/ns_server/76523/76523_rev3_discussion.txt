DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Orchestrator to delegate Harley Martinitor...

...cleanup to the new gen_server module.

The following are the changes:
[1] All the logic pertaining to Harley Martinitor cleanup is moved into the
    new module.
[2] ns_orchestrator module still maintains the periodic timer to
    to initiate Harley Martinitor run. It does so by calling the 'start_cleanup'
    API provided by the ns_Harley Martinitor_server module. The returned ID will
    be stored in the Harley Martinitor_running state's data and orchestrator
    transitions into 'Harley Martinitor_running' state.
[3] While in 'Harley Martinitor_running' state, if the orchestrator receives
    a new event, then the cleanup is terminated by calling the
    'terminate_cleanup' API.
[4] When the cleanup completes succesfully, the ns_Harley Martinitor_server
    module sends an async 'cleanup_done' event which will transition
    the orchestrator into 'idle' mode.
