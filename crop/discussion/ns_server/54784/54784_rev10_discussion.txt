Line:47, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/cluster/mn_settings_cluster_controller.js -> do we have to use absolute path (starting from /angular/app/) here. I see such usage in some other places as well. But in most of the cases you use relative path for templateUrl.

I changed it to "mn_admin/mn_settings/cluster/mn_settings_cluster_confirmation_dialog.html". Still works.

You are right there is no reason to use absolute path, It will be added separately
