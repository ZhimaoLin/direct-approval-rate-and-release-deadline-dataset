DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Implement a registration API in the token server.

The following are the changes:
[1] Added a new 'register' API in the ns_memcached_token module.
    This new API is used to track the registered caller processes
    so that when they restart we can make sure that the actions
    done by the older incarnations can take effect before the
    operations issued by newer incarnations are processed.

    The caller will have to pass in a RegistrationName which is
    unique and the API implementation makes use of the caller's
    PID to distinguish between multiple instances. The caller
    is also expected to pass the same RegistrationName while calling
    the get_token API.

    The token service maintains 2 dicts, one mapping RegName to
    {RegPid, RefCount} tuple and the other mapping Pid to RegName.
    The register API implementation will add the details of the
    caller process in both these maps.

[2] The get_token API has been modified to accept a RegName as a
    parameter. This RegName is then added into the mc_caller_refs
    dict along with MonRef. The get_token also increments a reference
    counter that is maintained against the RegName. This reference
    counter is used during the unregistration process to determine if
    it's safe to unregister the caller.

[3] The release_token API has been modified to fetch the corresponding
    RegName from mc_caller_refs dict. It then decrements the ref
    count for that RegName.

[4] The 'DOWN' message handler has been modified to first decrement
    the reference count for the RegName (fetched from mc_caller_refs)
    as the caller would not have gotten the chance to release the token.
    It then checks if the PID is a registered caller and if so it tries
    to perform the unregistration. If the ref count for the RegName
    is non-zero then it fires off a timer to carry out the unregistraion
    else it unregisters the caller.

[5] A wrapper API called 'register' in ns_memcached module has been
    added. This in-turn calls the ns_memcached_token's register API.

[6] The Harley Martinitor_agent module has been modified to call ns_memcached's
    register API in its init callback and pass the RegName to all
    the control commands.
