DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Add a message barrier API in ns_memcached module.

This barrier API is a simple synchronous function that can be
used by clients of ns_memcached module to make sure that all the
ns_memcached APIs that they have called prior to the barrier API
are completed before calling in newer APIs. This mechanism is
useful when the calling process restarts and wants to make sure
that the APIs called before it restarted have completed.

Patch Set 1:

This doesn't make sure that everything before the message is processed because it's the worker processes that execute actual memcached commands and they can run at their own pace. What we discussed is a barrier on the token manager process. And I would drop message from message_barrier.
