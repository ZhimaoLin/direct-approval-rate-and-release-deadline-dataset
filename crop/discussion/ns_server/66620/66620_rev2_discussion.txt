DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Add a barrier API in ns_memcached_token module.

This barrier API is a simple synchronous function that can be
used by clients of ns_memcached_token module to make sure that all the
APIs that they have called prior to the barrier API are completed
before calling in newer APIs.
