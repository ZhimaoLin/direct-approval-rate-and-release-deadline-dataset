Patch Set 50:

A big issue for me is that the nav gets busted easily if you click around at all and you have to force refresh to get back to looking at the buckets page. I'm not going to insist that this blocks this checkin but we should plan to fix this pretty soon (over the next week or two.)

Second issue for me is that the screen stretches to use all the available horizontal width. Even at 1480 pixels this starts to be less readable for me than our currently approx 1000 px width. Because the screen is so wide, when a bucket is expanded I just "see" the memory and disk bars. The labels are off to the left and right in my peripheral vision and it's less readable. We should think about this - basically put this on the list to explore with folks we test with.

Minor issue in that the "compact" button doesn't show clicked state, so after you push the button for a few seconds you're wondering if it "took" until the cancel compaction button shows up. The old UI doesn't have this issue.

But overall I think it's ready.

Patch Set 50:

If the nav gets busted on overview page it's normal and will be fixed pretty soon otherwise would you tell us more about that?

Patch Set 50:

You should be able to easily reproduce the issue on Chrome. Just click back and forth between the Overview tab and any other tab. If you cannot reproduce it then I can send you the console log I see when the issue happens. Also, I tNathalie Landryed to Dave and he is ok if this gets fixed in a separate patch.
