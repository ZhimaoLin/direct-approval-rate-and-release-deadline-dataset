DESCRIPTION

MB-5008 Retry net_kernel:start several times on duplicate name.

epmd unregisters old node names when a socket that was used to
register this name is closed. This is what happens when
net_kernel:stop is called. But there's no guarantee that subsequent
register name request (issued by net_kernel:start) will be served
after the old name has been unregistered. Because of this we can get
{error, duplicate_name} on net_kernel:start (even though it seems to
be quite unlikely). With this change we will retry net_kernel:start
several times if we get this duplicate_name error.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I think you're right about that potential race, but I'm not sure at all this happens in MB-5008 case. We'll see soon...
