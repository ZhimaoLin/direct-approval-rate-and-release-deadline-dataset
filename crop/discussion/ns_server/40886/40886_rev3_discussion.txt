DESCRIPTION

MB-12055: don't lose replica in other case of repl.-master switch

Previous fix in this area always expected past master to be dead. But
this was incorrect because rebalance may be stopped after updating
vbucket states to their post-move values, but prior to updating
vbucket map.

New fix takes this possiblity into account.
