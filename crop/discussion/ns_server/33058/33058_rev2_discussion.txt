Please see inline.

And unfortunately you'll have to replicate this logic in scripts/dump-guts.

Line:126, src/ns_config_log.erl -> Not absolutely sure about this but having certificate in the logs might be useful in certain cases (debugging, etc.). So maybe it's better to call ns_config:strip_metadata on the value and extract the certificate.
