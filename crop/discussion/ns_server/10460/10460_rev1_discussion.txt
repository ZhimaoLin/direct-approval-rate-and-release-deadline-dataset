DESCRIPTION

Fix Usage of ets:lookup_element()

ets:lookup_element() throws error:badarg exception if the element
being looked up doesn't exist. This change set wraps the calls to
lookup_element() in a try-catch block and returns an empty list if an
element isn't found.

Patch Set 1:

It would be nicer if you could wrap all usages in special function that catches exception and does this logic. So that it's more idiomatic and catches only right exception from only one call.

Still going to merge though.
