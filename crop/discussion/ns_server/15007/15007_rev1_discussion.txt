DESCRIPTION

fixed ns_config saver race in reload and terminate. MB-5110

wait_for_saver doesn't imply that last config is saved. It imples that
config that was current by the time saver was spawned is saved.

We may need to wait_for_saver twice if we really need to wait for
current config to be saved. Otherwise we race.

Terminate previously didn't do correct waiting as well as
ns_config:clear implementation. Given it's really reload's problem to
wait for pending saves to be complete I've moved waiting for saver(s)
to reload.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Aliaksey pointed out that we're already handling this double wait. So MB-5110 still remains a bit of mystery
