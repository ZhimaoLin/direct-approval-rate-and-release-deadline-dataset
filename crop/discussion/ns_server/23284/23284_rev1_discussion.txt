I was going to do that through simple fast-fordward instead of empty merge. But this is fine too.

Patch Set 1:

Master would be at same commit as 2.0.1. I.e. without empty merge commit as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/HZy6H.png

How it's done? Dustin told me it's possible to push to gerrit master branch via usual git push thing.

I.e. i'd do:

git push for-review origin/2.0.1:master

Most likely it's a privilege not everybody has.

Ah, I think I tried that, but gerrit didn't allow me to push.

Then instead of simple git merge couchbase/2.0.1, had to do
git merge -q --no-ff --log  couchbase/2.0.1

Like this it adds that empty commit and gerrit allowed it.

Patch Set 1:

Most likely because you don't have privilege of doing that in ns_server project. Not sure it makes sense to not allow that.
