DESCRIPTION

MB-6131 ns_mail is not a gen_server anymore.

Because seemingly it does not make much sense to serialize email
sending. And it actually fixes the following issue. Suppose user
somehow specified invalid email settings. This may cause
gen_smtp_client:send_blocking to block for a significant amount of
time. In such case subsequent attempts to send emails would timeout on
gen_server:call without even trying to send anything.
