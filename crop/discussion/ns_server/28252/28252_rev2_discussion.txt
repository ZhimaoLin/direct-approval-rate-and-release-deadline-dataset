Patch Set 2:

I rebased you patch. Make sure I didn't screw anything up. Your change didn't work because it POSTed replication parameters to createReplication endpoint. The latter one just ignored them. I added a change that lets you do this: http://review.couchbase.org/28321. Seems to work for me.

Editing replication settings doesn't work for me though. It causes some javascript error.

Another thing I noticed is that the dialog for editing the settings has "Create" button.
