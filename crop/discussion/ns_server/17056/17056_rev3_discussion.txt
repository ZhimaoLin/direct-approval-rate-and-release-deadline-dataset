DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Generic way to set couch settings introduced.

All the keys of the form {couchdb, {Section, Key}} or {couchdb, Key}
are synced to couch_config. In the latter case section defaults to
"couchdb".

I also removed a separate worker process syncing all the couchdb
related keys on any notable change since now we don't expect couchdb
related keys to be changed often and in bunches.
