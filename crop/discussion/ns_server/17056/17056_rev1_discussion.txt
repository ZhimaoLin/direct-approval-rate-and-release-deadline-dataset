DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Generic way to set couch settings introduced.

All the kv pairs that go either to couchdb or {node, node(), couchdb}
represent a setting synchronized to couch_config. A key of such a pair
must be a pair of the form {Section, Key}. Utility functions to hide
these details are provided in cb_config_couch_sync.

Patch Set 1:

I think putting whole bunch of different options under one key is a bit of mistake. It IMHO makes sense to allow them to be independently set & replicated. I really regret we didn't make this for buckets for example and now we have to replicate all bucket configs after any vbucket map change.
