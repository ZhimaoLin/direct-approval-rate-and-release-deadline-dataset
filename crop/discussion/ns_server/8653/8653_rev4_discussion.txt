DESCRIPTION

MB-3961 Work around inet:getiflist() bug under multi-home

inet:getiflist() doesn't work well if multi-ipaddress are configured.
Both uuid.erl and addr_utils.erl depend on this function. As such,
either we use inet:getifadrs() and reimplement uuid to remove this
dependency.

Patch Set 4: Verified

Instead of reusing couch:uuids, just use a self-sufficient implementation of uuid. It is verified in a customer setup.
