DESCRIPTION

MB-5000 Introduce ns_config_rep:synchronize_remote function.

This function ensures that all the messages sent to remote nodes so
far are processed. An important detail is that every node will ensure
that has processed all the messages as well.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

(2 inline comments)



Line:162, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I don't believe this is required given ns_node_disco_conf_events initiating partial config replication on config changes and sync_announcements making sure it reaches ns_config_rep. But that won't hurt anyway.

Line:128, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> push is not strictly speaking needed here. We in fact may want to back this out due to excessive config replication load.
