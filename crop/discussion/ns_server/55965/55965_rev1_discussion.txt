Line:880, src/misc.erl -> What can it be if it is not a binary or a list? Shouldn't there be an error here?

Line:880, src/misc.erl -> Theoretically it could be 'undefined'. I don't want to introduce any regressions in 3.x and xdc_rep_utils:sanitize_url has this clause. So I decided to keep it.

And we definitely don't want to crash in sanitize, this can result in useful information not being printed to the log file.
