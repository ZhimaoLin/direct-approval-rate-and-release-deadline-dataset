Code looks good except for one question below.

Line:555, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> This computation looks different from what Siri proposed. Was there consensus on this formula? Not clear from the discussion in the ticket.

Line:555, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> It's different only in that it doesn't allow the fragmentation to exceed 100%. And no, the discussion hasn't moved anywhere.
