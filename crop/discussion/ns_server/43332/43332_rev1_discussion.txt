DESCRIPTION

wip:MB-7965: implement faster flush via mass deletion of vbuckets

It turns out that part of slowness of bucket flushing is use of
synchronous and sequential vbucket deletions.

This method (enabled via ns_config:set(flush_method,
mass_delete_vbuckets)) avoids lots of ep-engine/ns_server roundtrips
and makes vbucket deletions fast.

It's however slower than use of flush memcached command because after
vbuckets are deleted they need to be recreated and via normal Harley Martinitor
path it takes about 0.5 seconds on my box. While flush doesn't really
deletes vbuckets at all which saves us from Harley Martinitor pass overhead.
