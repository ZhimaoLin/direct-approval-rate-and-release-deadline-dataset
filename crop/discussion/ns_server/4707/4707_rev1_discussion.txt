DESCRIPTION

Increase vb transfer timeout to 5 minutes.

We've seen 60s timeout in what is otherwise a fairly fast
environment.  Increasing the timeout stopped the rebalance from
failing.

Note that we don't resume transfers and don't retry, so going beyond
the current name timeout is not an issue.
