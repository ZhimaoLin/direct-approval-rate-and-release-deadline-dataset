Patch Set 2:

I understand url encoding for views where it's part of href attribute. But I don't get why we need url encoding for data- attributes. Simple html-escaping should be enough there. No?

Yes, but html-escaping not save us from double quotes that can  allow execute a function. Try something like this:

" onclick="alert('it is really bad')"

Patch Set 2:

It is serious problem, because:
if we use encodeURIComponent we should remember that all attrs in html should be with double quotes like attr="some".

encodeURIComponent(" ' "); // "%20'%20"
encodeURIComponent(' " '); // "%20%22%20"

encodeURIComponent do ton convert single quote in %xx

This article very useful in our case http://xkr.us/articles/javascript/encode-compare/

Patch Set 2:

That's great catch. How about fixing escapeHTML so that it quotes " as well?
