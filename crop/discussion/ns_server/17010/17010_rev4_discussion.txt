Patch Set 4:

I suppose we should update underscore library which is already contain _.escape (http://underscorejs.ru/#escape) similar to escapeHTML and <%- for escaping in _.template (http://underscorejs.ru/#template)

good but needs small improvement

Line:1390, priv/public/index.html -> h already escapes. h is alias for escapeHTML that's convenient for our templates

Line:74, priv/public/js/misc.js -> &quot; can seemingly be shortened via &#22;

Line:78, priv/public/js/misc.js -> Don't think we need this. If we do, please extract into separate commit

Line:297, priv/public/js/replications.js -> I don't think we need to unescape html here. It's be automagically unescaped when our template will be parsed
