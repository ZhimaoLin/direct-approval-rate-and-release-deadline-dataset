that's actually wrong thing to do

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

gerrit will make the 2.0.2 branch in github as soon as it processes its first change.

I found a string that looks like it's referring to the current produce version, but I don't know the code and this is user-facing, so please review and make sure I didn't introduce a bug.

Once this (or any other) change is submitted through gerrit, the branch will be pushed to github.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

that's a wrong thing to do. If you want "empty commit" feel free to touch CHANGES or readme
