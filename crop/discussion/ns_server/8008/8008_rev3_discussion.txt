Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)



Line:29, src/capi_crud.erl -> Don't do this. Open the database with the right user context.
open_doc receives a #db record, so use Db#db.user_ctx.

Line:34, src/capi_crud.erl -> I would prefer to not have the catch here. It can mask bugs regarding the database reference counter.

Line:616, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I think you have the fields of the 32 bits flag in reverse order. (See Dustin's spec at https://gist.github.com/039d4b16b3fb96554df1)

Should be something like:

<<0:16/big, 0:8/big, 0:4big, ...

Also correct the comment "length of keys" to "number of key specs following".

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

Also doing sync via our current ns_memcached process will block this process for potentially very long period of time. Blocking ns_Harley Martinitor, replicator and stats_collector access. This is not acceptable. Ok for now, but really needs fixing.

Also command encoding details need to be moved to mc_client_binary, so that we can add second ns_memcached-like process more easily.

Line:215, src/capi_frontend.erl -> can we stop that $dev_design madness at last?
