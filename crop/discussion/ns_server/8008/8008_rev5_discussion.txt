Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I havent tested against current sync implementation, putting a timer:sleep(1000) in mc_client_binary:sync is an ugly workaround.

I dont retry on CAS failures as I havent yet managed to get CAS operations to fail, doing delete operations / set operations with an invalid cas from my first testing returns an error but still performs the operation.

Patch Set 5:

sync will need larger timeout

we 100% will need separate memcached process (or even pool of them) for data operations so that we don't block stats and Harley Martinitor from memcached

not-my-vbucket still needs to be added
