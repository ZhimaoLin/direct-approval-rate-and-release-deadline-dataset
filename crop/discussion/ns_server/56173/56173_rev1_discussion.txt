Seems like this should be with the previous change. What's the reason you split them out?

I think I am not up to speed on the workflow and gerrit. I missed this in the first commit and didn't notice until I actually was able to test it. How do I modify a previous change?

Patch Set 1:

Basically, undo your changes and then re-push. Something like as follows

Steps:
1) make the changes
2) git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/<branch>
3) change your mind
4) git rebase -i HEAD~n
    * n is however many changes you want to go back
    * this is an interactive rebase and you can choose which commits to rework
5) decide which to “edit” or “rework” the commit message (follow the instructions)
6) edit the files
7) git add any changed files
8) git commit -amend
9) git rebase -continue
10) git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/<branch>

Patch Set 1:

In this case you'll do your git rebase -i HEAD~2 and follow the instructions to squash the commits together.

Keep the change ID - from one of them and abandon the other I think.
