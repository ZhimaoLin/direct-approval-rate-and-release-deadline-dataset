Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:1531, priv/public/index.html -> this needs to be button (and thus not middle-clickable). Or if you do want to to be middle-clickable, you'll need bucket name as well, so that new tab can display same page, find doc and display delete confirmation.
