Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

one thing is quite severe. See inline

Line:334, priv/public/js/documents.js -> I don't think we can use ID here. ID has whole bunch of characters disallowed.

How about data- attribute ?

Line:752, priv/public/js/documents.js -> I think this is not used anymore right?
