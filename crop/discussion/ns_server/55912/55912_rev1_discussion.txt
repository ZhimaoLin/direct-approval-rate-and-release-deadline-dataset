Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Verified+1

(1 comment)

Verified, works fine. Code review -1 for now while we debate the verbiage.

Line:63, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Prefer:     "IP address seems to have changed. Unable to listen on ~p. (Underlying POSIX error code:  '~p')";

I sent a screenshot of how this looks in a mail.
