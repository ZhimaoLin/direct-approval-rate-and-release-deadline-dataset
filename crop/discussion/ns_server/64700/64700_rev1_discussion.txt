DESCRIPTION

MB-19832 add 1 second delay before waking up if dcp_notifier returned error

this is needed to wait for things to settle out and prevent opening
unneeded streams. for example if the vbucket changes status from active to
replica, the stream will end with status=2, and xdc_vbucket_rep will wake up,
wonâ€™t get any data and then open new notifier stream. some time later the
xdc_vbucket_rep will die, but stream will remain open, until status changes
again

1 sec delay will prevent this from happening in most of the cases

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

If we continued to support erlang xdcr, I'd say that dcp_notifier should monitor the subscribers instead (topology change is not the only situation where things like this will happen). But given the abandonment of the erlang xdcr, the change is fine with me.
