DESCRIPTION

amputate jquery's support for layer{X,Y} due to Chrome's warning

Chrome developers decided to implemented extremely annoying warning
for uses of layerX and layerY properties. We've never used them, but
jquery's code to copy event properties from native event to jquery's
emulation touch them. See
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=101733

Easy fix is to stop copying those.
