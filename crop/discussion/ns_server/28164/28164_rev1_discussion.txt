DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Replace randomized logging with special logging category.

I would argue that the only useful values for the trace_dump_invprob
were 1 and infinity. Given that, I replaced all the randomized logging
with a logging to a special logger called ?XDCR_EXTRA_DEBUG. And
xdc_rep_manager adjusts the threshold loglevel for this logger based
on the value of xdcr_enable_extra_debug config parameter.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Thanks for looking into this issue. I believe your commit msg is incorrect. For data path logs, we need more log levels than in this commit.  Let's hold off this commit to 2.2 since QE has started testing.
