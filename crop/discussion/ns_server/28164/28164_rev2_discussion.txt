DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Replace randomized logging with special logging category.

I would argue that the only useful values for the trace_dump_invprob
were 1 and infinity. Given that, I replaced all the randomized logging
with a logging to a special logger called ?XDCR_EXTRA_DEBUG. And
xdc_rep_manager adjusts the threshold loglevel for this logger based
on the value of xdcr_enable_extra_debug config parameter.

Could you please elaborate a bit on when do you think you would need more fine grained logging?

Patch Set 2:

I am working on a leveled XDCR logging to allow users to choose leveled logging at runtime, and dev can choose its trace level in code depending on how critical the trace is. This is to address one of Damien's comments in the XMem project.

You can improve logging in ns_server component, but there is really no need to have this thing in XDCR at this time.

But this approach would allow you to implement you leveling easily.

Patch Set 2:

And there is no need to reimplement part of what is already implemented in the logger we use. And there's a good chance the our logger would do this more efficiently. Because it uses code generation to create the code that is specialized for current value of loglevel. And if certain loglevel is disabled, when you try to log anything with this loglevel almost no code is executed.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Junyi, even if you plan to do sampled tracing ala Google Dapper (http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36356.pdf) this is more than good enough start.

Our erlang logger is a very advanced facility.
