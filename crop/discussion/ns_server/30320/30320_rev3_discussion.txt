DESCRIPTION

MB-9209: enforce aggressive garbage collection in XMem

We observed increasing beam memory usage during replication
caused by inefficient Erlang garbage collection. This commit
will enforce aggressive garbage collection for XMem.

Each VBucket replicator will trigger garbage collection when
when both following conditions are satisfied 1) report seq_done
or work_done; 2) this vb replicator has not conducted garbage
collection in past 5 seconds. Condition 2) is to avoid over
garbage collection.

It will enforce garbage collection at three levels: 1) "global":
garbage collection for all processes; 2) "xdc" level: only gc
for xdcr processes including concurrency_throttle; 3) "none":
no garbage collection at all. By default global level gc is
enforced.

A new env parameter can be used to control the level of gc.

"XDCR_GC_LEVEL" = ["global" | "xdc" | "none"]
