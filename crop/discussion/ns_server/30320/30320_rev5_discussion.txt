DESCRIPTION

MB-9209: enforce aggressive garbage collection in XMem

We observed increasing beam memory usage during replication
caused by inefficient Erlang garbage collection. This commit
will enforce aggressive garbage collection for XMem.

Each bucket replicator will trigger garbage collection when
when both following conditions are satisfied 1) report seq_done
or work_done; 2) this vb replicator has not conducted garbage
collection in past X seconds. Condition 2) is to avoid over
garbage collection, where X by default is 10 and configurable.

The default interval for global gc is extended to 60 secs
since there is another commit to reduce memory usage in
storage layer.
