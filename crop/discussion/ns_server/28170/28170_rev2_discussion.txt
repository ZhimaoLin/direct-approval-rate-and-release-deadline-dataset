DESCRIPTION

MB-8663 Let users choose between xmem/capi replications.

I just added 'type' parameter to the ones understood by
createReplication REST endpoint. Valid values are capi and xmem. They
translate to type=xdc and type=xdc-xmem in replicator document
correspondingly.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

I'm not sure default of xdc-xmem is best possible choice. But I don't have strong arguments against it.

I was not sure too. But I got under impression that it's what PMs want.
