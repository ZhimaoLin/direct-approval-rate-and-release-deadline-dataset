Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

this code will apparently redraw graphs every time buckets list cell is updated. There's no need for that.

Patch Set 1:

I guess graphs will be refreshed without this subscription too, because statsBucketDetails need DAL.cells.bucketsListCell but anyway I'm going to make like you wish.
