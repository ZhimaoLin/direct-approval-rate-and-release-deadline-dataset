DESCRIPTION

MB-9707: remove dead vbucket entry from stats table

Today due to race conditions during rebalance, in some cases
we see dead vbucket entry in stats table, such dead vb rep
stats is aggregated and pollute bucket-wise replication stats.

This commit will check that each vb replicator entry in stats
table is a live vbucket replicator, if not, it will be removed
and logged.
