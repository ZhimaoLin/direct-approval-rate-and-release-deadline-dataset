Patch Set 5: Fails

The following scenario fails:

1. Create a document via CAPI:

   curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8092/default/test -d '{"test":"test", "test2": "test"}'

2. Get it via CAPI:

   curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8092/default/test

Result seems to be compressed:

{"test":	<,"test2":"test"}

Patch Set 5:

The following also fails:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8092/default/test -d '{}'

In this case document body is passed to capi_crud as ejson. But mc_client_binary expects a binary value.
