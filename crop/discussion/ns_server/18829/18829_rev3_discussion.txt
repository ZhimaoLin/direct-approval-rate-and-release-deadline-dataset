DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Include cluster and bucket UUIDs in more advertised URLs.

This ensures that any information retrieved via such an URL is an
information relevant to the same instance of the cluster and bucket as
URL. And not, for instance, an information from the other cluster that
was configured on the same address or recreated bucket with the same
name.
