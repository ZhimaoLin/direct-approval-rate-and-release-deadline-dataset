DESCRIPTION

MB-24101 make index def easier to copy

Added ng-click="$event.stopPropagation();" to the container around the definiton so it does not automatically close when clicked.

With subsequent css changes (to cbui-base.css), the cursor will change to a text-selection cursor in that same area.
