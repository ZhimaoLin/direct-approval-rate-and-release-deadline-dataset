See couple of comments inline.

Line:169, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> I don't thing you need lists:flatten, as far as I understand, string:join always returns flat list.

Line:176, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> Missing spaces around =.

Line:209, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> What if get_info failed previously?

Line:169, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> 1> A = ["aaa", "bb"].
["aaa","bb"]
2> B = ["ccc", ["ddd", "eee"]].
["ccc",["ddd","eee"]]
3> string:join([A, B], ",").
["aaa","bb",44,"ccc",["ddd","eee"]]
4> lists:flatten(string:join([A, B], ",")).
"aaabb,cccdddeee"

Line:176, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> Done

Line:209, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> I see. Thanks.

Line:169, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> Only if the elements in the list are flat.
The elements in Attributes have not been flattened, so it has to be done here.
