DESCRIPTION

Check the node status through Memcached.

In order to check for the node status we request stats from
Memcached. If they aren't returned, we consider the node as
down. This includes nodes that are currently warming up the
cache (this is intended).

Nodes that are pending (they were already failovered) are
not taken into account.

Patch Set 5: Fails

still fails in same way.

6 nodes. One is virtually disconnected via os:cmd("iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j DROP; iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -j DROP"). And after few minutes it's still not failed over. Even after it's marked as down.
