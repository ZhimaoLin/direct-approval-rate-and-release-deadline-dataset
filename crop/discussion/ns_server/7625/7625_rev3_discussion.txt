DESCRIPTION

Check the node status through Memcached.

In order to check for the node status we request stats from
Memcached. If they aren't returned, we consider the node as
down. This includes nodes that are currently warming up the
cache (this is intended).

Nodes that are pending (they were already failovered) are
not taken into account.

Patch Set 3:

Doesn't work. I blocked everything on one node and here's what  I've seen in logs:

                                                              {gen_server,

Apparently, it's passing this large term instead of node.

Weird, all my tests pass. I'll have another look tomorrow. Can you tell me what you did to make it fail?

Patch Set 3:

Also entire commits chain doesn't pass dialyzer.

I simply made iptables drop all packets to/from some node.
