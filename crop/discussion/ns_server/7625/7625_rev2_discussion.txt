DESCRIPTION

Use check the node status through Memcached.

In order to check for the node status we request stats from
Memcached. If they aren't returned, we consider the node as
down. This includes nodes that are currently warming up the
cache (this is intended).

Nodes that are pending (they were already failovered) are
not taken into account.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I think it needs improvement

Line:280, src/auto_failover.erl -> this needs to be sent in parallel (a-la gen_server:multi_call or misc:parallel_map). So that total check duration is limited. Otherwise you'll end up accumulating check messages, because check might take more than 3 seconds

Line:435, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I disagree with such parameters overloading. It's too dangerous and confusing.
