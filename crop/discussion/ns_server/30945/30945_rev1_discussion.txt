DESCRIPTION

MB-100: add type in concurrency throttle

Concurrency throttle is a generic service and components may create
their own throttle processes, e.g., in XDCR, there are two types of
concurrency throttlesP init throttle and replication throttle. But
without type in throttle state, it would be hard to make enchancement
such as adaptive scheduling and differentiate traces in logs from
different throttles.
