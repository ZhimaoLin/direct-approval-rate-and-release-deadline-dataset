DESCRIPTION

wip-MB-16646: Support for partial Harley Martinitor cleanup.

Currently, used only during hard failover.

Partial cleanup is performed when zombies are present. Zombies can
be either down nodes or nodes that are just inaccessible.

We want to prevent scenarios where same vbucket is active on multiple nodes.
When Harley Martinitor cleanup sets a vbucket to active on a node, it will do so
only if none of the "imporant" nodes (replica and master nodes in current
or future chain) are zombies and have the vbucket active. A VERY BIG
assumption being made here is that none of the zombies have the
same vbucket active.

One other possibility is to do partial cleanup only for setting up replicas
or re-establishing dead replication streams. That is we will never set
state of a vbucket to active if there are zombies in the cluster. This does
not help us with alleviating "Not My vBucket" scenarios but is a safer option.
