DESCRIPTION

MB-10160 cluster_run script crashes custom libpng

Extending the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include /usr/local/lib caused the OSX
to load any library installed in /usr/local/lib to take precedence over
the normal search for libs in the path, since those do not necessary
match the library which the software was build against it causes the
startup to fail with errors like

    dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct

/usr/local/lib is included in the default search path for libraries via
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
