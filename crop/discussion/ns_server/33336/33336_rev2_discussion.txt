DESCRIPTION

MB-10160 cluster_run crashes with custom libpng

Extending the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include /usr/local/lib caused the OSX
to load any library installed in /usr/local/lib to take precedence over
the normal search for libs in the path, since those do not necessary
match the library which the software was build against it causes the
startup to fail with errors like

    dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct

/usr/local/lib is included in the default search path for libraries via
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH

I cannot approve this commit. I'm not OSX guy but your description looks like problem in your environment. And your commit looks like workaround and not a fix. But that's just my OSX-ignorant thinking.

I've added some our OSX gurus in hope that they can help resolving this issue.

Patch Set 2:

Actually the current setup just reorders DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH which is not supposed to be done in OSX since it messes with the build in library lookup. The thing really is either the path needs to be modified while building and loading, or not at all, what currently happens is that the build happens against the normal search path, but run happens against a reordered path, so if a library is installed in multiple versions we build against one and run against the other which might break, depending on the versions and their compatibility.

Patch Set 2:

Going to remove myself from this list. I cannot approve it due to lack of understanding of specific issue OSX seem to be having here.

Folks, please consider giving it some thought and +2 or -1 -ing (or giving any other marks) accordingly.

Philipp's reasoning seems logical to me. Perhaps there's some reason why it was introduced by whoever did it, but without comment, we'll just have to take the risk and find out. +2r +1v
