DESCRIPTION

Get rid of type passed to wait_for_memcached.

The only difference in behavior between up and connected would be if
query_vbucket_states returned false. But that's impossible now and as
far as I can tell was never possible.

Patch Set 1:

I was wondering about mixed version clusters - watson node issuing
query_vbucket to pre-Watson nodes. 
But, type is not passed to "query_vbucket_states" so I think should be OK.
