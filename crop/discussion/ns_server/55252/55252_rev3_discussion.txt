Line:87, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http.js -> if config.isNotForm === false then this doesn't get deleted from the config, unlike the case where config.isNotForm === true. Doesn't seem consistent.

Shouldn't we "delete config.isNotForm" regardless?

Line:87, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http.js -> Yes it make sense. But I don't think that we should pass isNotForm: false because in js false and undefined are falsely therefore !undefined === true. Anyway we should pass to $http only $http specific parameters. So one of the ways to do this is to separate mnHttp specific parameters into it's own property like
{
  mnHttp: {
    isNotForm: true
  }
}
and then
delete config.mnHttp

I'm going to do this in separate commit
