DESCRIPTION

wip: NOT FOR CHECKIN pluggable registry is now a provider

Change showing how the toy hello and goodbye pluggable components
need to change to adapt to the pluggable UI registry being a
provider. (TL;DR - it's easy, you just registry your pluggable
component at config time instead of run time.)
