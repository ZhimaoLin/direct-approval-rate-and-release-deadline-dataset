DESCRIPTION

MB-10118 Reimplement docs REST endpoint using get_keys command.

Our approach is as follows:

  1. The node that handles the all docs request sends subrequests via
     ns_memcached to all the nodes in the cluster. It passes a list of
     vbuckets it expects destination node to have and all request
     parameters with two exceptions: 'skip' is not sent, 'limit' is
     set to 'original limit' + 'skip'. After receiving all the nodes'
     responses, the coordinating node skips 'skip' smallest items and
     returns next 'limit' number of items.

     Coordinating node will retry the request fixed amount of times
     with some delay upon receiving not_my_vbucket error from any of
     the nodes.

  2. Each node that handles all docs subrequest sends a get_keys
     command for each of the vbuckets. Assuming that keys span
     vbuckets more or less evenly, the limit it uses is
     2 * ('original limit' / 'number of vbuckets' + 1). Then it gets
     'original limit' number of keys from results. If for any of the
     vbuckets the list of keys gets exhausted, another request is sent
     to receive more keys. After this is done, as a separate stage the
     values for the selected keys are retrieved (as long as
     include_docs parameter is set to true). Care is taken to select
     more keys if any of the items happen to be deleted by the time
     we try to get their bodies.
