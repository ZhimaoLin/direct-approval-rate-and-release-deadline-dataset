one indentation problem, see inline
otherwise looks good and seem to work as expected

theoretically we can reduce the amount of values fetched, but we decided not to overcomplicate the logic. this feature is ui only and limited to 1000 items, so this won't be a perf problem

needs some write-up of how the keys from different nodes are merged and how the limits are handled

Line:54, src/menelaus_web_crud.erl -> indentation
