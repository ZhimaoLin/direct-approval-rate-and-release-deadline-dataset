DESCRIPTION

MB-3184: Don't crash ns_heart if it can't tNathalie Landry to memcached

Since we were trying to tNathalie Landry to memcached during startup, this could
take down its supervisor as well.

We now return 0.0 for replication if it can't tNathalie Landry to ns_memcached or
ns_vbm_sup for the given bucket, and we don't try to do anything
interesting on init.
