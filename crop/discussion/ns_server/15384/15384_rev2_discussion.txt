DESCRIPTION

Don't attempt to save non-imporant couch config changes.MB-5183

MB-5183 has signs of issues caused by couch_config:set synchronusly
saving config. Under load that may take ages and cause timeouts.

Couch's db & index dirs are our source of truth, so their changes are
persisted. But other settings are always taken from ns_config. So
there's no need to save them.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

looks good...including filipe, not sure if persistence changes impacts the work he's done to improve parallel indexing.

Patch Set 2:

That's not affecting Filipe at all AFAIK. But there's a bit of question "do we really need it". Particularly, have you been able to reproduce this issue again? Have you been able to verify this commit fixes that issue?
