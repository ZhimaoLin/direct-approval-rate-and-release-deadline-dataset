DESCRIPTION

Improve view engine partition logging

Currently the logging results in log files with a lot
of whitespace and line breaks. That makes them hard to
deal with tools line based tools like grep.

With this change the function call and arguments are
printed in a single line.

I don't debug partition state bugs too often, but when I do I'm annoyed by the current log format.

Though I'm not sure about this change, please leave you comment whether you like it or not and why.

I forgot to mention that I'll add a proper MB in case this change will be merged.

IMHO "proper MB" is near-insane. MB-100 will be fine IMHO.

I think it makes sense, in case people wonder "why do the logs look so different suddenly".

Anyway, that is easy to do, once the change is reviewed.
