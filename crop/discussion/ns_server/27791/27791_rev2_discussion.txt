DESCRIPTION

MB-8733: Improve view engine partition logging

Currently the logging results in log files with a lot
of whitespace and line breaks. That makes them hard to
deal with tools line based tools like grep.

With this change the function call and arguments are
printed in a single line.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

I've verified with running `make simple-test` (successfully) and watching that those logs are in one line now. I think it's ready to be merged.
