I don't think that resetting the form is the right approach here. If enter any information in the form and just switch to another tab, I expect the values to be preserved.

Could you clarify to me follow questions
1. Which exactly fields UI should keeping between tab switching?
2. Should UI keeping those values between page reloading?

As I understand, you want UI to keep only "Customer name", right? In purpose of not annoy users with filling his name each time, right?
