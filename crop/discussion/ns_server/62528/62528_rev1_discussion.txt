DESCRIPTION

MB-19105: "redirect" user to destination after login

This change does the following.
(1) transitions to the app.auth state now in certain
    cases instruct the URL not to change (using the
    {location:false} mechansim in ui-router
(2) a new dynamic parameter "destinationPath" is added
    to the app.auth state, which when not null and
    not equal to the auth state itself, will cause the
    auth controller to sync to the URL post login

Ultimately, this has the effect that we want: a user can
paste a complex analytics URL into the URL bar on his  or
her browser and post login will be taken to that exact
graph.

Line:14, priv/public/ui/app/mn_auth/mn_auth_controller.js -> destinationPath

Line:17, priv/public/ui/app/mn_auth/mn_auth_config.js -> You don't need that instead of check destinationPath you can check $location.$path in success function of login

Line:58, priv/public/ui/app/app_config.js -> you don't need this check because we can always return false in that case because return false doesn't change url
