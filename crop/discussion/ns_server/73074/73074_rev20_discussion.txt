Also, is there any way we can hide the "Reset Password" if the user is not allowed to change their password? If so we should discuss this with Rob since it would be better for the user to just not have the option as opposed to fill out the change password form and find out that they can't reset their password.

Line:87, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin.html -> These two spans don't end up looking like they are on the same line. The username seems to be a little bit lower than the "Sign Out" text. Why not just make it "<span>Sign out {{adminCtl.user.id}}</span>".

Line:72, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin.html -> Currently, only builtin user able to reset password. I left such ability for Administrator as well since it should work for Administrator but not implemented yet.

Ok, let's support only builtin users for now.

Line:87, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin.html -> Done
