Line:22, deps/menelaus/priv/js/monitor-buckets.js -> Should the test here be...
  list && list.length > 0
Instead of...
  !list || list.length

Line:22, deps/menelaus/priv/js/monitor-buckets.js -> The idea is that when bucket list is unknown (list is undefined) we display our 'subsection' block and spinner inside it. And we display it when we know that list is not empty. Otherwise we hide.
