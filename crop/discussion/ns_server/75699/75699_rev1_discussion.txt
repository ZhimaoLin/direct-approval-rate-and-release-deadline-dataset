DESCRIPTION

MB-23500 Fix memory quota alignment in setup

Firefox issue: shifted a few things to improve layout.

Change-Id: I470bb647d194848ea92ee58e849b5ecc6012febf
Unrelated: I moved the setup gray bar and all modal dialogs up a few pixels to get back some vertical real estate.

Not sure why this conflicts with Servers Table... these changes are limited and most recent, so should win in a direct conflict situation.
