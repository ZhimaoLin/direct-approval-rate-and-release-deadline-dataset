DESCRIPTION

MB-10400: added xdcr_upr_streamer

This is initial implemenation of performance-oriented upr client for
xdcr. There are plenty of code that will change when upr server
actually supports flow control. And there are plenty of debugging
stuff that I'm leaving in for now, until implementation is finalized.
