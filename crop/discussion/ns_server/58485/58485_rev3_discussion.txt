Line:102, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> This gets a complete copy of the configuration data. Isn't there a cheaper way of getting just the roles_definitions?

Line:225, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> Nitpicking: I think You should be able to replace this with lists:foldr, if You also change the foldl on line 231 to foldr.
