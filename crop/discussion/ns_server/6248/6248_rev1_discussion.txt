DESCRIPTION

don't spam server when real-time stats are empty.MB-3836

Our real time stats requests are normally are push-like. We provide
last timestamp and server waits till newer timestamp is collected and
replies. So we normally send new requests as soon as we have result
from previous one. This approach allows as to perfectly handle timer
jitter.

But if stats are empty we cannot send any haveTStamp parameter and
thus server cannot wait for next stats sample. So we must not send
request immediately in this case.

Luckily continuation-passing style of samples restorer that was mainly
done to handle multi-value return more naturally, allows us to insert
delay completely trivially.

This is UI-side of MB-3836. With stats_collector unable to collect any
samples at all we had empty stats which triggered 'stats spamming'
from UI.
