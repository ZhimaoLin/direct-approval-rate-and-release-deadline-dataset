Fix for MB-17875 - Make redirection links more consistent.

After some discussion with Dave F., Rob, Perry, and myself, we chose a
consistent message for Query, View, and FTS. This change updates it
for View.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

Alos Eben please notice that font-size of query warnings more than main tabs font-size. I propose you to use  font-size: 12px; color: #616062. Looks like you have to remove h1 tag
