DESCRIPTION

MB-26206: cbcollect_info: fix recursive loop in /sys/block

When dumping the block device settings in cbcollect_info; if there's a
symlink in one of the directories that points back to the same
directory (or higher up), the 'grep -R' will loop indefinitely.

Fix by changing to '-type f' in find. Also flip to xargs for
multi-file processing as it's faster than '-exec' (0.01s vs 0.3s on
mancouch).
