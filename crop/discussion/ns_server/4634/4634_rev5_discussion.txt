Patch Set 5:

Sorry I just missed this review, but could we stick to the erlang conventions with comments

%% 2 signs for function comments

somefun() ->
   % one sign for inline comments

http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR36

otherwise I have to go around Adrianna Holmesally indenting everything when erlang mode indents it to the convention. (not a big deal, just mentioned for future)
