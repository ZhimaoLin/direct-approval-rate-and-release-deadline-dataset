DESCRIPTION

screen S.6 implemented - Secure This Server, in initial config wizard

Leverages the pre-existing /settings/web REST URL.

The menelaus handler for /settings/web was changed to allow port input
field parameter to be "SAME", and also take the initStatus input
field to allow the re-use of code path.
