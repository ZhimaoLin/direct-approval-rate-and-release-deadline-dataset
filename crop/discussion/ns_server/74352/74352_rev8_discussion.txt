DESCRIPTION

MB-22909: Support XATTR replication.

In order to support replication of XATTRs we need to negotiate
the XATTR feature on the target node when we are setting up the
DCP proxy. If the XATTR feature is enabled on the target node
then we need to set the XATTR bit while issuing an open conn
DCP command.

During upgrade the replications will be setup without XATTRs
and when the cluster becomes Spock then we need to reset the
connections in order to enable XATTRs on all the replications.

In the mixed mode, the expectation is that a client is not
allowed to set XATTRs and any attempt to do so will result in
a failure.

Line:221, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> Is this really helpful?

Line:41, src/dcp_sup.erl -> This function is only ever used to get the nodes we're replicating from. So maybe we should change its name and have it return just a list of nodes.

Line:95, src/dcp_sup.erl -> This message will be coming from all nodes, which I think will be confusing.

Line:102, src/dcp_sup.erl -> This will crash with already_started error if dcp_sup has a mix of xattr aware and non-xattr aware replicators. I'd suggest to merge both of this cases into a single one and compare the expected children list to whatever is actually present (similar to what ns_bucket_sup does).

Line:102, src/dcp_sup.erl -> I'm not sure though if it's possible to have a mix.

Line:221, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> Will remove it

Line:41, src/dcp_sup.erl -> Sure!

Line:95, src/dcp_sup.erl -> I thought it would be a good way to know that the replicators were restarted on all nodes.

Line:102, src/dcp_sup.erl -> Yes, I was also thinking of when can we have a mix. Maybe we are ok here right?

Line:41, src/dcp_sup.erl -> On a second look, it seems like this is being used in dcp_sup:nuke to get  the PIDs of the children. We can perhaps make this instance get the PIDs of the children using supervisor:which_children.

Line:41, src/dcp_sup.erl -> Oh, missed that. Let's leave it as it is then.
