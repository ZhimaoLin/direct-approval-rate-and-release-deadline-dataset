DESCRIPTION

MB-22909: Supporting XATTR replication.

In order to support replication of XATTRs we need to negotiate
the XATTR feature on the target node when we are setting up the
DCP proxy. If the XATTR feature is enabled on the target node
then we need to set the XATTR bit while issuing an open conn
DCP command.

In the mixed mode, the expectation is that a client is not
allowed to set XATTRs and any attempt to do so will result in
a failure.
