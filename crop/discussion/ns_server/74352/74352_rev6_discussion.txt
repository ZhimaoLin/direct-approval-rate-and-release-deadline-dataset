DESCRIPTION

MB-22909: Support XATTR replication.

In order to support replication of XATTRs we need to negotiate
the XATTR feature on the target node when we are setting up the
DCP proxy. If the XATTR feature is enabled on the target node
then we need to set the XATTR bit while issuing an open conn
DCP command.

During upgrade the replications will be setup without XATTRs
and when the cluster becomes Spock then we need to reset the
connections in order to enable XATTRs on all the replications.

In the mixed mode, the expectation is that a client is not
allowed to set XATTRs and any attempt to do so will result in
a failure.

Line:228, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> There doesn't seem to be any need to return the socket. Also, this will badmatch.

Line:125, src/replication_manager.erl -> This is unsafe. It's possible that while recreating replications something goes wrong and and that crashes the replication manager. But that may leave some replications non-converted (dcp_sup is not restarted when replication_manager crashes). So when replication manager restarts, it will assume that all replications are xattrs aware, which is not the.

I think you should just have xattr be either true or false, and dcp_sup needs to keep track of what value the actual replicators use.

Line:28, src/dcp_sup.erl -> Please don't use ?user_log. These constants are totally useless. Just use ale:debug(?USER_LOGGER, Fmt, Args)

Line:228, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> Oh! Yes, you are right about the socket too. Will correct it.

I wonder why the dialyzer didn't catch it. Probably because it's ok to return different values from a function but the caller was expecting a tuple.

Line:125, src/replication_manager.erl -> Ok. Will work on it. Since dcp_sup is supervisor, what is the best way to store some state in a supervisor. ETS tables?

Line:28, src/dcp_sup.erl -> Sure!
