DESCRIPTION

MB-5546: raised some timeouts to cope with some paging

When system is on the limits some ops take longer. Apparently our
experiments told us making some timeouts twice longer helps.

NOTE: ticket also requests raising ns_memcached_connected timeout
which I'd like to avoid. Thus that's the only timeout that's not
raised out of timeout raises requested.
