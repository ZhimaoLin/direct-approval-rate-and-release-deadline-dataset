Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Almost. But commit message is still not good enough. You need to explain in english what you're doing here. If English is a problem for you, then let me know please.

Regarding diff itself, this looks workable. However, I think it would be more in line with rest of logic to put currently displayed metric's description into graph configuration cell.
