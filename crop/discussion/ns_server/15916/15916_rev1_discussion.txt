Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

close, but not there yet.

Also please write descriptive commit message. Subject line needs to be 65 chars or less. It should also reference ticket.

Then goes blank link and "body" of commit message. Where if you need it, you put actual long description of why and how.

Line:1010, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> It can be harmful in very subtle ways when you change same piece of dom in 2 difference "places" of code. I.e. ordering between this and previous subscribers can cause issues.

I'd prefer single cell with description that works in both modes. And then just "draw" it in single place.
