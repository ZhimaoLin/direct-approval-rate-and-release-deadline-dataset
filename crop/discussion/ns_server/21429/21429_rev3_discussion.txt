Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Corrected tab & whitespace per Aliaksey A.

Since Farshid oved MB-6823 to .next release, I am not sure when this change will be taken. Anyway, verified with Mike's change on memcached/daemon/isasl.c, and existing _admin & default and new bucket creation work fine.
