Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

One issue and one nice to have.

Line:521, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> Similar to MIN_FREE_RAM_PERCENT, will be good to define a macro for the default value, say DEFAULT_RAM_PERCENT.

Line:524, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> before this change, value was compared with MIN which was "max of MIN_BUCKET_QUOTA and total_buckets_ram_quota."
But with this change, the value is being compared only with MIN_BUCKET_QUOTA.
