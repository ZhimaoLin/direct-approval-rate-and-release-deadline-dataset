DESCRIPTION

Allow modifications to connection_idle_time in memcached

Memcached allows for dynamically tuning of the connection idle
timer. By default this timer is disabled in Watson due to upgrade
problems from 2.5x where ns_server creates connection to the
cluster by using the bucket credentials. These connections is
used for stats handling while the node have other connections
open to perform TAP replication. These versions of ns_server
does not gracefully handle the stats connections being disconnected
from memcached unless there is something wrong.

In a cluster without any 2.5 nodes people may want to use the
connection idle timer to automatically release idle (and potentially
stale) connections. To enable this the operator may run:

curl -u Administrator:asdasd \
       -X POST \
       http://127.0.0.1:9000/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
       --data connection_idle_time=360
{"connection_idle_time":360}

The following may be observed in memcached log file:

    NOTICE Changed connection_idle_time from 0s to 360s

Note: This change depends on http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/60538/
Without that change we set the timeout on each connection to 0 secs
which would cause the connection to be disconnected immediately.
