DESCRIPTION

Flush memcached config changes when doing ns_config:sync_announcements

ns_config:sync_announcements already sent a synchronous ns_config_event
'barrier'. This event is not handled synchonous by bucket_info_cache
by forwarding it syncronously to bucket_info_cache_invalidation
event subscribers.

Patch Set 2:

I don't think it's wise to block ns_config_events behind call to memcached (with 180 seconds timeout). If we want to do something like this (which, like I said before, I'm not sure is worth the time spent), we should have a separate sync call just for the terse_bucket_info_uploader (and everything that it needs).
