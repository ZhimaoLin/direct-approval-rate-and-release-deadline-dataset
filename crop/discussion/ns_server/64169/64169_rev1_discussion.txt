DESCRIPTION

Flush memcached config changes when doing ns_config:sync_announcements

ns_config:sync_announcements already sent a synchronous ns_config_event
'barrier'. This event is not handled synchonous by bucket_info_cache
by forwarding it syncronously to bucket_info_cache_invalidation
event subscribers.
