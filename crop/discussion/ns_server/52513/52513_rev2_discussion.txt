Patch Set 2:

I'm still not comfortable with this change. Mostly, because I find it hard to convince myself that there are know corner cases. So I'd rather play it safe.

One example, given that memcached is also audit daemon, we might lose auditing events, if we decide to restart memcached. And note that even with this change, it's possible to restart memcached on nodes that are already in the cluster.
