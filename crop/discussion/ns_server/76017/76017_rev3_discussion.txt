Patch Set 3:

I'll add the comments from our discussion:

1. The errors text for the replica section needs to go on the next line
2. There is no tool-tip for ephemeral buckets ejection policy
3. I forgot to mention that I find the auto-compaction override setting to be a little bit hard to read since they are not indented.

Also, the code I pushed should address Pavel's comment.
