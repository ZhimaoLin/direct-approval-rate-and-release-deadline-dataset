DESCRIPTION

Change bucket delete logic, to avoid orphaned memcached buckets

ns_bucket_worker, ns_bucket_sup, single_bucket_kv_sup, and
ns_memcached changed so the memcached bucket is deleted in
a more controlled way, instead of during ns_memcached:terminate.

ns_orchestrator makes sure the memcached bucket is deleted on all
nodes before the bucket config is really removed from ns_config.
