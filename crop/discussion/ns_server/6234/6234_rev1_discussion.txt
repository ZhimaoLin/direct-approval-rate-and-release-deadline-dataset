DESCRIPTION

Revert back "start per-bucket supervisor asynchronously".MB-3827

This reverts commit ec08571f5a53f4b85ded61ef1367ebb2bf5b878f.

Unintended side-effect of 'plain' bucket supervisor was that if
ns_memcached crashes in init we don't crash ns_bucket_sup and we don't
try to restart it.

So let's revert to old per-bucket supervisor even though it's
asynchronous-ness is not needed anymore.
