DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: don't compute saslBucketsStreaming twice on each update

menelaus_web:handle_streaming is calling streaming function twice per
iteration. Once with 'stable' argument and second time with
'normal'. This is done in order to remove 'volatile' fields from value
that's used to decide if change needs to be streamed. But
saslBucketsStreaming doesn't have difference for stable and normal
responses.

So new rule is if 'stable' invocation returns {just_write, JSON} we'll
use JSON without calling streaming function second time. And
saslBucketsStreaming is now using it.
