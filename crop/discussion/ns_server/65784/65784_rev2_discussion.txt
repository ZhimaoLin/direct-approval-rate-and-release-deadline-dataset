DESCRIPTION

MB-20162 Ignore size threshold when compacting master db.

Fragmentation size threshold is a value that is supposed to be mean
the max absolute wasted space per bucket per node, so it doesn't make
sense on a per vbucket level (unless scaled properly).

And given that master vbuckets are quite special, we actually cheat and
ignore it altogether.
