Patch Set 1:

This is in preparation for the next change. The LWW feature will be available only on a 4.6 cluster. Hence upgrading the cluster compat version.

The "time_synchronization" bucket parameter will be dropped and a new "conflict_resolution_type" bucket parameter will be added. If there is a bucket created with time_sync parameter set in a 4.5 cluster then as part of the upgrade we decided not to remove it from ns_config but instead not pass it to memcached.
