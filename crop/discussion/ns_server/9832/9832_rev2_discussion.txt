DESCRIPTION

removing Edit and Query View buttons from View list

This is in favor of using the links on the right hand
side for accessing those actions which removes confusion
with the other "action" buttons in the left hand side
area--the most "dangerous" of which is Delete.

Things should feel "safer" for the user by this separation
of the linking actions (accessing edit or query view screen)
from the dialog-based actions (publish, add, delete) and
make things more consistent throughout the UI.
