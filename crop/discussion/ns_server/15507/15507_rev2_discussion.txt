DESCRIPTION

Don't attempt to save non-imporant couch config changes.MB-5183

MB-5183 has signs of issues caused by couch_config:set synchronusly
saving config. Under load that may take ages and cause timeouts.

Couch's db & index dirs are our source of truth, so their changes are
persisted. But other settings are always taken from ns_config. So
there's no need to save them.
