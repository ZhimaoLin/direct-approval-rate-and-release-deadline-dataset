Line:12, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_exception_reporter.js -> not used; should be removed

Line:13, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_exception_reporter.js -> we only send 8 errors before we max out and never send any more? Seems odd. Do I understand the design correctly?

Line:34, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_exception_reporter.js -> looks odd that we are incrementing the sentReports count in the comparison. I.e. even if we don't send the reports we are incrementing the sentReports count. Increment should probably be done inside the if block.

Line:12, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_exception_reporter.js -> ok

Line:13, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_exception_reporter.js -> yes, you do. It comes from  615667e02ffbd3a75381cd30d304c3d8a5f412a3. I guess it's protection from bombarding the server in case of recursive errors or in case of errors in callback of $watch function. In some case user should reload the tab after errors in js, in other cases should not, but I think it is ok because we should not have a lot of errors in UI and because we should not send a lot of requests.

I have tested it with semantic error in watch function and without this logic  server adds message at the bottom of the log - (repeated 4208 times). Also in that case it has huge impact on consumption of cpu.

Line:34, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_exception_reporter.js -> I'm agree.
