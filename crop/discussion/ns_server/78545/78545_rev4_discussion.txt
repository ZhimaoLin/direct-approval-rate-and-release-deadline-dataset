DESCRIPTION

MB-22827: Limit new usernames to 128 characters

Length check does not currently work on erlang16 compiled files,
but this is fixed in later versions of erlang.  This means utf8
codepoints with values > 256 will be represented as 2+ bytes.

Unit tests added to validate this behavior which was noted during
Adrianna Holmesal testing.
