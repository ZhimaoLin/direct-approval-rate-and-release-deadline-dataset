Patch Set 6: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

(1 comment)

Line:35, priv/public/ui/app/constants/constants.js -> Actually I would prefer a simpler design whereby we have one constant called "Constants" that includes all the others. It's a little weird to me to inject "docsLimit" and "docBytesLimit" etc all separately. I'd just like to inject "Constants" into components that need them and then reference Constants.IEC.Mi to get access to the mebibyte multiplier.

However, I'll approve this so we can keep moving forward on the merges -- hopefully you don't mind making this change later.
