DESCRIPTION

Bug 1817: call global:sync/0 when we see a new node.

This reduces race conditions where the global name server becomes
aware of other nodes at an inopportune time, like in the middle of
ns_doctor:init/1.

I also don't ping nodes quite so promiscuously, since the call to
global:sync/1 should be sufficient.
