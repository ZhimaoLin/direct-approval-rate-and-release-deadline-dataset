DESCRIPTION

Bug 1817: call global:sync/0 when we see a new node.

This reduces race conditions where the global name server becomes
aware of other nodes at an inopportune time, like in the middle of
ns_doctor:init/1.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Looks like kludge. And it's still racy.
