Patch Set 2:

This is what I see when the alert pops up. https://drive.google.com/a/couchbase.com/file/d/0B5b18Vo2g9hCSkw4cUdTbktwYTA/view

There's no title on the dialog and the button to dismiss is missing. I assume this is not intended. Can you fix?

Patch Set 2:

Though I should add that if the point of this change is just to tweak some of the styles and not to actually fix the missing title and 'x' button (and that this stuff is planned to be addressed later) then the change is ok. Though: please let me know in the patch message what is being accomplished so I understand better what to review.

Patch Set 2:

The alert uses its own template in xdcr section. You should check the alert in groups section or search by showAlertInPopup method.

Patch Set 2:

What do you mean when you say "the alert uses its own template in xdcr section"? I'm confused; how is that relevant to my comment?
