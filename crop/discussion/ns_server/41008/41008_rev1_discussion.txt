DESCRIPTION

made bucketsListCell.refresh work even if nothing has changed

Which is important for hooks.js which always returns same stuff.

I.e. previously because we subscribed on bucketsListCell which uses
_.isEqual for equality we ended up not calling callback in hooks.js.

Now we subscribeOne on rawDetailedBuckets which has object identity
equality which causes refresh callback to work.
