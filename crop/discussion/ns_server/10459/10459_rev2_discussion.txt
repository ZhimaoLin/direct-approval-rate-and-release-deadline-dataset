DESCRIPTION

Ignore non-XDC Type Rep Docs in Cancellation

Cancellation is triggered in response to a deleted doc but deleted
docs don't have a body, so we cannot determine the doc's type. So, in
order to trigger cancellation only for xdc type docs, we can simply
look up the ?XSTORE to check whether an entry for the doc exists. If
there isn't one, we simply ignore the deleted doc.
