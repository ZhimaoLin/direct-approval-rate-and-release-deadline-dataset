DESCRIPTION

Automatic clustering and declustering of Mnesia.

Add ns_mnesia:promote/1, promote_self/1, and demote/1. promote/ and
demote/1 must be called from a node that's already clustered and isn't
the node being manipulated. promote_self/1 must be called from the new
node.

Both promotion and demotion require that Mnesia be restarted on the
node that is changing state, but not on any existing clustered
nodes. At the moment, the worst this causes is the dropping of a few
stats samples.
