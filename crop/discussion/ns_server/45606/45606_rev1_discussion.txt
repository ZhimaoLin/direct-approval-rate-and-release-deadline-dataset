I've verified locally that it triggers the compaction of spatial views.

You can get the size via:
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9500/_spatial_view/default/_design/dev_foo/_info'|jq '.disk_size'

And then I triggered the compaction via:
curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd 'http://localhost:9000/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/compactBucket'

I've also verified that the code mentioned in my inline comment silences the error when no spatial views are defined.

Line:903, src/compaction_new_daemon.erl -> If you add

    {error, empty_group} ->
        exit(normal)

here it would silence if you try to compact a group which doesn't contain mapreduce resp. spatial views.
