Patch Set 1:

My biggest concern is that is_node_compatible may return false even if correct answer is true. I.e. due to inherent race of getting first hearbeat from newly added node.

It appears to be fine for current use-case, but I'm afraid given subtle-ness of this people may hit this in some future use-case attempts.

I need a bit more time to think about this code.

Patch Set 1:

ns_doctor does rpc:multicall to all nodes during its initialization to obtain the initial heartbeat. So there are 2 possible race situations possible:

1. Another node was down when ns_doctor started. And then came up again.

2. Another node was upgraded but ns_doctor still has old heartbeat.

#1 can be solved by obtaining the version via rpc:call if ns_doctor returns []. And we probably will have to live with #2 if we don't want to rpc nodes all the time

the harm will be done only if the code on the new version of the node won't be able to handle old style input

Patch Set 1:

Then maybe we should make the name of this function more clearly express that it may return false negatives (so that code that may want to use it is aware of that).

Patch Set 1:

And my other thinking is at least for this use case we won't need and trickery because compat mode will be _3.0_ which is above what we need. That was whole point of my ticket in fact.

I'm thinking that some slowdown due to latency is acceptable for 2.2.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

merging with the following thinking which I didn't think about earlier:

current stuff will stuck quite inconveniently if node is down. This code is better than what is currently merged.

I think we'll rename this function in later commit and then for 3.0 we'll do optimization I describe above
