Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

1) lets use our fork of flot (it's faster and better)

2) lets hide jquery and flot inside function scope. So that it doesn't pollute global namespace. Unless we make conscious decision to use jquery. In which case make sure it's jquery that works well with latest angular (faq says they want 2.1).

3) don't include plot-related helpers to global namespace in lodash.mixins.
