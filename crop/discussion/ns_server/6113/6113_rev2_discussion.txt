DESCRIPTION

don't abort nodeStatusesCell if pool details change.MB-3532

If nodeStatusesCell future takes long time to get (which happens in
some cases of node being not responsive) we might get into state where
we abort and restart nodeStatuses request continuosly never
succeeding.

We use separate intermediate URI cell to make sure that
currentPoolDetailsCell changes don't cause recomputations of
nodeStatusesCell.

This fixes UI-side of MB-3532
