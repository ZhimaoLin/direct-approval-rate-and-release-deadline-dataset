Line:56, cbcollect_info -> What about

    def log(message, nl=True):
        if nl:
            message += '\n'
        sys.stderr.write(message)
        sys.stderr.flush()

Patch Set 3:

regarding extra arg with default value. I'm simply following style philosophy that I like and that's also happens to be google's style guide. I haven't checked their python guide, but at least for C++ they recommend against overloading like that.

Another argument is that log(something, false) is less obvious than log_no_nl(something). log(something, nl = false) might be an option on the other hand.

Will use log(something, nl = false) then. Thanks for suggestion

Patch Set 3:

A good example of Python philosophy:

https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#print

Obviously `nl=False` should be used in this case.
