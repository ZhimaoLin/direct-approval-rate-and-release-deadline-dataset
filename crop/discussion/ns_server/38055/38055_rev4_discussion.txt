Line:56, cbcollect_info -> Inspired by example from previous patch set:

    def log(message, end='\n'):

        sys.stderr.write(message + end)

        sys.stderr.flush()

Line:58, cbcollect_info -> No concerns about Windows?

Line:56, cbcollect_info -> Will do it then.

Line:58, cbcollect_info -> No. But that may be due to my python ignorance. Perl and Ruby would both handle it correctly given that stdout and stderr are opened in text mode.
