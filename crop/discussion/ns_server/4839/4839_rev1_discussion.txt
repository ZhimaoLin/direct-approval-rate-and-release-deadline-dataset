Line:875, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> Can we combine these two closures into a reusable function? Or break it down into some less repetitive parts?

The two closures to prevent scope conflicts has a "smell" (in the Martin Fowler sense) to it.

Line:621, deps/menelaus/priv/public/css/screen.css -> Buckets are case sensitive, so we need to keep this around but attach it to the new select box (of course).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Server Nodes Stats list doesn't use this new format for their links--needs updating.

Also, if you select a specific stat on a memcached bucket, then switch to membase bucket, stats fail until you remove the "graph" query param and re-request.

Line:875, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> It's not about scope conflicts. It's just to communicate self-contained-ness of this pieces. And they are sufficiently small and sufficiently different (and close enough in code) so that extracting something common IMHO doesn't make sense.

Line:621, deps/menelaus/priv/public/css/screen.css -> I would prefer getting rid of this text-transform crap if possible. But that's for another commit

Line:621, deps/menelaus/priv/public/css/screen.css -> Ah. Now I see that it's capitalized on Mozilla. Will have to revert for now. :( Thanks for spotting this!

Line:875, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> I see your point. They're so similar, though, wish we could avoid the near copy/paste somehow, but may be unavoidable, I guess.
