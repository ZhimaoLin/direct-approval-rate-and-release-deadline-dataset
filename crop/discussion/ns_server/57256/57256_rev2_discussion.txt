Line:272, src/index_status_keeper.erl -> To avoid unnecessary processing for kv and n1ql, would it be better to just add a clause for fts?

Patch Set 2:

(1 comment)

Line:272, src/index_status_keeper.erl -> The unnecessary processing is minimal. This module's supposed to be more or less independent from its actual instances defined by the callback modules. Besides, it was the intention that multiple notable_event sent in burst would result in only one source update. It wasn't the case due to a bug, but is fixed now. See my previous change in the chain.
