DESCRIPTION

MB-16677 Pass all nodes being ejected to maybe_delay_eject_nodes.

EjectNodes list doesn't include orchestrator node, because it's
ejected in ns_orchestrator when rebalance is complete. So if
orchestrator node is the only node being ejected and it's running a
query service, the logic with the delay won't kick in.
