DESCRIPTION

MB-15374 kill memcached_force_killer

memcached promises to stop bucket quickly with {forced, true} option
so there should be no reason to automatically terminate memcached
process on failed over nodes. plus this behavior causes ns_memcached's
to restart and starting loading buckets, which greatly complicates
the stopping buckets process, and actually causes slowdown.
