Patch Set 6:

Pavel - can you make the minification change *before* you move everything around? Don't want to break minification.

Also: I'm concerned about our strategy of moving things around in the following way. It's going to get messy when we need to modify mn_admin_config.js to include a different HTML template for a given controller. The template references are mostly going to change to ../base/... -- and it's just going to get complicated. 

Why don't we just put non-UI javascript in base? E.g. services, filters, constants and directives that don't have templates? Everything else just gets copied now. I'm thinking this will actually be a lot easier to manage.

Patch Set 6:

Dave could you please clarify, what do you mean when you say put non-UI javascript in base? As you can see in this change ALL js files, except of spec related, are in the base folder.

The template references are not going to change to ../base/, the templates are related to <base href="app-classic/"> or <base href="app/"> 

let's see what we have one more time after that change http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/65256/2

base (all js files)
app (all new html files and probably some specific js files)
app-classic (all old html files and probably some specific js files)
spec (unit tests)
libs (third-party)
index.html (old index file with base to app-classic/)
spock-index.html (new index file with base to app/)

Patch Set 6:

In other words, we are not going to change templateUrl: at least in first phase. templateUrl: is related to its root folder via <base> tag
