Patch Set 14:

Dave, I added changes in accordance with your requirements separately here http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/65429/4. It's more convenient to do that separately.

Patch Set 14:

Pavel - 

Are you proposing that we check in a bunch of intermediate file moves? I don't really want to do that. In addition: there still is the problem with http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/65154 -- this doesn't even compile (minification breaks.) Also - your haven't +V'ed your changes yet -- should I wait until you've done that before I look at them? 

Cheers,

dave
