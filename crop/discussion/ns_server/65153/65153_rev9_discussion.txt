Patch Set 9:

Pavel

You make good points. How about the following:

base -
* contains our "library-like stuff such as: services, constants, filters, and directives
  without associated templates
* no HTML, no CSS
* Pluggable components, in particular, should only depend on JS code in base

common -
* short for "common-ui", but since it's in the ui folder, common-ui seems redundant
* contains UI code that is common to both the current UI and the spock UI
* can contain Javascript and HTML

app -
* contains the app code of the next generation (i.e. spock UI)
* builds on top of common and base
* can contain Javascript and HTML

classic-app
* contains the app code of the current generation UI (i.e. watson UI)
* builds on top of common and base
* can contain Javascript and HTML

Then:
1) we move all services, filters, constants and template free directives to base
2) we move all remaining Javascript to common
3) we copy the HTML to app and classic-app and start modifying app

Thoughts?
