Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Should only delete the bucket on normal or shutdown reasons, not from crashes. Also, it can take far longer than two seconds to delete a bucket if there's data in it, so I'm going to set the timeout to infinity.

I'm working on fixing both of these.

Patch Set 1:

Incidentally, this will inadvertently fix bug 1666, since ns_memcached will shut down before ns_port_sup.
