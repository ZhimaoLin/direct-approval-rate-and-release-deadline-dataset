DESCRIPTION

rename node in ns_config earlier when changing node name

We currently don't stop things when renaming node. Without this commit
we first change node name, then renaming data in mnesia databases and
only after that we rename things in ns_config. This commit moves
ns_config rename right after changing node name. So that temporary
crashes due to missing config keys are much more rare.
