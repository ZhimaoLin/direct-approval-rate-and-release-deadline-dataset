DESCRIPTION

Make sure that stats_archiver never spawns two savers.

It was only possible if saving the stats took more than 120 seconds,
which, obviously, shouldn't happen normally. But unfortunately that
probably can happen because of essentially unbounded number of
processes kept xxx@xxx.xxx bucket.
