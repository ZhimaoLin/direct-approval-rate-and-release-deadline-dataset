DESCRIPTION

Fix Incorrect Tracking of Vbuckets during XDCR

The actual number of vbuckets currently replicating were being
incorrectly tracked as we weren't accounting for those vbuckets for
which triggering couch replication failed. This change set fixes this
problem in both the start_xdc_replication() and
maybe_adjust_xdc_replication() functions.
