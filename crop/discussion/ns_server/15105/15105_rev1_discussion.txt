DESCRIPTION

use all policy modules in node_replicator_triples etc. MB-5128

node_replicator_triples is called from
failover_safeness:build_local_safeness_info which is in turn called
from ns_heart node status computation.

Thus we have deadlock of calling ns_doctor while ns_doctor was calling
ns_heart.

So "fix" has subtle side effect of avoiding ns_doctor usage. And
fixing deadlock.
