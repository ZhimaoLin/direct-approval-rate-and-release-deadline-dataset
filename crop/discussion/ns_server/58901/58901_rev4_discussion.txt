A new, optional, parameter in the pluggable-ui configuration file,
"request-headers-filter": {Operation: HeaderNames}, where Operation is
"drop" | "keep", and HeadersNames is a list of header names. If the
"request-headers-filter" is not included in the configuration file
a default filter of {drop, ["Content-Length","Transfer-Encoding"]}
is used.
