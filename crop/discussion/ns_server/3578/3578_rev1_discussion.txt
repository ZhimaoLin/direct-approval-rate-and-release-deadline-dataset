DESCRIPTION

Always create replicas, even if rebalance fails.

This will ensure that at least vbuckets that were successfully moved
will have replicas. This won't help if the replicas are situated on a
node that started having problems during rebalance, but if the masters
are located on a node that's also having trouble, there's not much we
could do to fix that.
