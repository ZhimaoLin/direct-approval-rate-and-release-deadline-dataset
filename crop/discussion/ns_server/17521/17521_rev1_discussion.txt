DESCRIPTION

MB-5513: don't allow ns_memcached to think it started twice

Under some load it's seemingly very possible to have multiple
check_started messages in mailbox at the moment when warmup completion
is detected. That would lead us to spawn mark warmup as done multiple
times, which would lead to multiple timer:send_interval
invocations. So that'll lead to much more frequent check_config
messages.
