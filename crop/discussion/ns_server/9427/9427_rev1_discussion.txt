DESCRIPTION

Disable the C++ standard memory allocator in Unix-like systems.

Based on the memory profiling results, we observed that using
tcmalloc as the memory allocator for C++ STL and string classes
shows much better behaviors than using the default C++ memory
pooling allcator. This option is also recommended from the
tcmalloc official documents. This makes sense to us because
tcmalloc actually provides the efficient memory pooling per
thread.

In addition, we saw that the tcmalloc profiler is confused by
the default C++ memory pooling allocator.

Patch Set 1: Verified

Verified it through adding the env variable to /opt/membase/bin/membase-server, and restarting the server, and finally mutating lots of items with set/append operations.
