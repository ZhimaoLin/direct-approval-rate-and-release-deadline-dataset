DESCRIPTION

Don't use num_items_for_persistence during xdcr checkpointing

ep-engine flusher decrements num_items_for_persistence before
actually persisting an item, so relying on its value becoming zero
before updating the checkpoint document is not safe. Instead, we wait
for the current open checkpoint id to be persisted. If it gets
persisted before we timeout, the checkpoint document is updated.
Otherwise, we don't checkpoint.
