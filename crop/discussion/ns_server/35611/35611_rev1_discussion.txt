it looks like suppress-logging may simply look at all responses that are not success.

Line:143, src/upr_proxy.erl -> AFAIK mutations are not supposed to be responded to

Line:146, src/upr_proxy.erl -> same about deletions

Line:149, src/upr_proxy.erl -> same about snapshot markers

Patch Set 1:

logging successful responses to the control messages is important because the absence of the response can cause the rebalance to hang

Patch Set 1:

Yes I saw some replies to mutations as well.

But then how about always printing responses to mutations/deletions ? They are not supposed to be sent at all when everything is fine.
