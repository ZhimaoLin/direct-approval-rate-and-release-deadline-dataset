DESCRIPTION

MB-8667 Make alloc_util allocators use malloc.

And also instruct malloc not to use mmaps.

In my testing it decreases the number of page faults during indexing
in about 20 times without noticeable difference in indexing time.

Even better results can be achieved by making erlang use malloc
without its own allocators on top. But this breaks
erlang:memory() and this quite useful memory information is also
missing from crash dumps. So for now we'll stick to current approach.
