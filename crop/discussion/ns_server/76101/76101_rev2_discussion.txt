DESCRIPTION

DcpProducer should be a permission to read, DcpConsumer - write

Trond:
To suck out data from a memcached server you would open a
DCP Producer stream (memcached is producing the data),
The DCP Consumer privilege is needed in order to tell
memcached to _consume_ a DCP stream and apply all of the mutations.
