DESCRIPTION

cbcollect_info: Include historic KV-Engine RocksDB Log files

RocksDB performs it's own log rotation, including rotationg when
starting up. As such we should capture all its log files - particulary
given that if we crash (and restart) then we want to see the previous
log file as the point when we crashed.
