DESCRIPTION

POC-Orchestrator Failover: Fast automatic failover of the orchestrator.

In some cases, auto-failover of the current orchestrator can take longer
than 60 seconds. This is because the new orceshtartor cannot register the
singleton processes untill the ones registered by the old orchestrator
have been unregistered. In some cases, when the old orchestrator has not
been cleanly shutdown, the unregisteration of the singleton processes
happens only after the net_kernel sends nodedown event to the global name
server. The timing of this depends on the net_tick_timeout which defaults
to 60s. Since auto_failover is a singleton process, the new orchestrator
cannot perform automatic failover of the old orchestrator for atleast that
long.

In this POC:
- auto_failover process is not a singleton process. It runs on all nodes
in the cluster.
--- This removes the dependency on unregistering/registering of
singleton processes before performing auto_failover of the old orchestrator.

- ns_orchestrator and ns_tick continue to be singleton processes registered
only on the orchestrator.

- All nodes follow the existing auto_failover logic to determine down nodes.

- But, under normal circumstances only the orchestrator can perform
automatic failover of other nodes.

- A non-orchestrator node say, Node A, will perform auto-failover only if:
--- Node A detects current orchestrator is down. The auto_failover logic
determines it it OK to failover the old orchestrator.
--- And, Node A is the new master.

Given that this is a POC, it has several TODOs:
- Is it OK for non-orchestrator node to perform auto-failover? This worked
in unit tests but need to make sure there are no corner cases.

- Check for race conditions.

- Check for states which normally prevent the ns_orchestrator from
performing auto-failover - e.g. rebalance.

- Unit test convered variou failure scenarios but needless to say more
thorough testing is required.
