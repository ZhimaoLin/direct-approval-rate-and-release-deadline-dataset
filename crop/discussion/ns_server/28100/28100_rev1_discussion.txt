DESCRIPTION

MB-8773: always checkpoint to CAPI unless specified otherwise

XMem enables checkpoint to remote memcached directly. Per discussion
with other engineering members, we decided to keep checkpointing to
CAPI in xmem mode XDCR, unless users specifically want to checkpoint
to remote memcached.
