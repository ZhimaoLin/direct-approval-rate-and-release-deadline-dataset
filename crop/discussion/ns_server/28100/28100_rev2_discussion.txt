DESCRIPTION

MB-8773: always checkpoint to CAPI unless specified otherwise

XMem enables checkpoint to remote memcached directly. Per discussion
with other engineering members, we decided to keep checkpointing to
CAPI in xmem mode XDCR, unless users specifically want to checkpoint
to remote memcached.

Patch Set 2:

Aliaskey,

I self-approved this one because 1) it is very minor change which you have agreed on, and 2) usually it take quite a while to hear comments from ns_server team but QE will start testing XMEM next Monday and the build has to be ready by tomorrow.
