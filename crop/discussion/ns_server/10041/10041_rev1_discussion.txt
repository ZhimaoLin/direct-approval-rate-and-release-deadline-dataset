DESCRIPTION

Disable binding of schedulers to logical CPUs.

From the erlang documentation, it is mentioned that it would
produce better performance to disable binding of schedulers to
logical CPUs if other OS processes also bind threads to logical
processors. From our tests, we observed that disabling this
option gives us 15% of improvement on persistence throughput.
