DESCRIPTION

use #empty instead of #html('') to avoid element data leaking

jquery data is not garbage-collected in any way. js does not have weak
pointers to allow that, and they are afraid to hook stuff into dom
elements due to known issues on IE (6 I think).

So just cleaning stuff with setting innerHTML is not enough. While
calling #empty does cleans up element's data.
