Nice change. Verified. Thanks for fixing my bug and making it work for the wizard step. :-) Couple of minor comments that can be fixed later.

Line:78, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_servers/add_dialog/mn_servers_add_dialog_controller.js -> similarly would prefer "firstTimeAddedServices"

Line:49, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_memory_quota/mn_memory_quota_service.js -> Would prefer this to be named: getFirstTimeAddedServices()
