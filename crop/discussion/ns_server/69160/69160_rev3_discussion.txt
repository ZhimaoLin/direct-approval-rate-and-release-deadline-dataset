DESCRIPTION

MB-21169: Modify REST API to set clock drift threshold values.

[1] Modified the REST APIs to accept drift threshold parameters. The values are
    accepted and stored in ns_config in units of milli-seconds. But when they
    are being submitted to ep-engine they will be converted to micro-seconds.

[2] Changed the ns_memcached module to send set_param commands
    to alter the threshold values.
