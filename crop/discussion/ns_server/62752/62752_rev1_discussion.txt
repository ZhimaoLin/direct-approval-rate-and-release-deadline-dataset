DESCRIPTION

MB-19134: don't open views link in new tab

The behavior of the Views, Query and FTS links should be consistent when
it comes to redirecting a user to avail of the service on a different node.
I think it's best if we use the same tab rather than open a new tab -
I think it's less interrupting for the user. Anyway, as such the
target=_blank is removed.
