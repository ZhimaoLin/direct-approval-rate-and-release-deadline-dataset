I was testing this and 'make ns_test' will output to stdout and also capture everything into a file. The doc says it attaches the file to the stdout. I thought it would redirect, but it just sends it to both. Which may work? Or do you not prefer to have that extra log file created while in dev env?

I would definitely prefer it not to be created. But I can also see how it occasionally be useful too. So I think it's fine. Just add the file to .gitignore.
