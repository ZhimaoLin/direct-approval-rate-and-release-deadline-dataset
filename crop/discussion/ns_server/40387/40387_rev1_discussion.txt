DESCRIPTION

Don't crash on apply_vbucket_state_reply with empty queue.

When rebalance stops and we terminate the apply_vbucket_state_worker,
the latter might have already sent us some reply. This would cause a
badmatch on queue:out and hence Harley Martinitor_agent would crash.

Seen in MB-11890.

Patch Set 1:

It looks like we might still have some problems if response from old worker comes after we've spawned new worker.

I think easiest way to deal with it is to include pid of worker in cast.
