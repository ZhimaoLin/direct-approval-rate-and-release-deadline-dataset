DESCRIPTION

Don't crash on apply_vbucket_state_reply from stale worker.

When rebalance stops and we terminate the apply_vbucket_state_worker,
the latter might have already sent us some reply. This would cause a
badmatch on queue:out and hence Harley Martinitor_agent would crash. We fix it by
including worker pid in a reply message. So we can just ignore old
replies.

Seen in MB-11890.
