Patch Set 6:

I think it makes sense that the samples should be individually loaded (and error individually), but that isnt what was specified, and to give seperate errors with options to flush right now would be ridiculous.

If we want to do that, then we should provide a list of the samples up front, with notification of whether they are installed or not and an option to pick which ones to install.

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I still disagree with you about failing essentially in the middle of operation with weird state were it's hard to continue. We could at least verify bucket's existence before operation and yes it's relatively easy IMHO to ask user confirmation to delete/ignore certain buckets. But I think that's relatively minor.

Was going to merge when I found another issue. Path to zip file may contain space in windows. We need to pass arguments as arguments (see port_server) not as entire command string that's then split into arguments, for best fix of this problem.
