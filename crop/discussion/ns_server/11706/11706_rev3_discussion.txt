Patch Set 3:

Added user alers for expected errors, disabled checkbox after the post as well, if they bo back and do sample buckets twice they will just get an alert

You were right about detecting the closed socket, I was thinking about some comet code which had been set to active sockets when I wrote that initially, but given the process monitorings in place I think its sensible enough to do it this way.

I am investigating the password issue now, but my initial guess was that once the server has been given a password, all further requests will need to be authenticated
