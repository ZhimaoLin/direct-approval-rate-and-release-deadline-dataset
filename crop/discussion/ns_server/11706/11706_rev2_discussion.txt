Patch Set 2: No score

This will only work during the setup stage, once I find out how to run it against an authenticated Couchbase without passing a password via the command line then I will implement that

Patch Set 2:

This is much better.

It seems it'll fail in quite bad way if user will do 'next' from this wizard page and then 'back' to it and then forward again.

Also does it make sense to disable checkbox as well during POST request?

Regarding this docloader invocation after wizard is passed I don't think there's issue with empty password. Just do something about buckets that cannot be used in docloader password-less.

About separate process. From what I know erlang will not detect that socket is closed by user until we try returning response.

And last but not least, it makes sense to do a bit more logging. Including some user-visible logging or success/failure.
