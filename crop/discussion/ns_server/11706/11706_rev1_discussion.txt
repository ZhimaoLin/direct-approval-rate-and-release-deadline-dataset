Patch Set 1: Fails; Do not submit

This will obviously not work, it references my local filesystem as I am waiting on confirmation of what the packaged verison of the migrator will look like.

But I figured there was going to be a bunch of feedback for this feature so I thought I would put it up now. 

During the setup screen there is a new screen that asks if you want to load sample data, if the user confirms I go through the samples directory and load each zip into a new bucket, this is done before creating the first bucket (as by default the first bucket will consume all RAM), each bucket us set with a default of 32MB, the value may need tweaked but I definitely do not think this is something we should be asking the user.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

1) Mockup UI also allows loading samples _after_ wizard is passed. Where is this code?

2) Why some migrator is used when we were told to use docloader that's packaged already ?

3) Why error handling is still totally missing? Particularly, failure to create bucket (because samples are already loaded) needs to be handled. Also why loader command exit code is totally ignored?

Line:361, src/menelaus_web.erl -> why separate process?

Line:368, src/menelaus_web.erl -> DOWN still needs to be eaten here

1) Adding after buckets has been created is a more complicated workflow that needs to be decided upon

2) I sent an email about the confusion with the tooling

3) Failure to create a bucket is already handled, any other errors will leave the setup to carry on as if nothing happened, if that isnt acceptable it can be changed, which is why this is in review before its completed

Line:361, src/menelaus_web.erl -> So the process doesnt die if the http request does (the user refreshes the browser)

Line:368, src/menelaus_web.erl -> you mean in addition to the receive 2 lines above?

See inline.

And regarding #3: it is never acceptable to fail totally silently

Line:368, src/menelaus_web.erl -> yes. 'done' will be followed by DOWN

Line:388, src/menelaus_web.erl -> url here is invalid. What :default: means ?

Line:381, src/menelaus_web.erl -> most importantly there's race here. Bucket is only created ns_config here. There's small lag from here to bucket creation inside memcached
