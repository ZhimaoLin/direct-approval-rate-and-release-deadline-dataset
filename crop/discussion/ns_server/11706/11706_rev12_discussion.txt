Patch Set 12:

Ok I have added the ability to select particular buckets, the samples screens show which are currently installed or not

Docloader speed was a unrelated issue with my install

Doesnt address the data_path issue, thats a seperate issue / commit

Found few issues. Some of them are significant.

I'm ok with data_path issue being addressed in separate commit, but it is related issue and at least knowing what we're going to do there would be helpful.

Line:392, src/menelaus_web.erl -> typo here

Line:477, src/menelaus_web.erl -> ability to return several errors would be nice to have

Line:350, priv/public/js/settings.js -> note: this can change during processing == true

Line:355, priv/public/js/settings.js -> this is bug. When pool details will be refreshed during install call it will be ignored. You seemingly need to force-refresh pool details after installing.

Line:358, priv/public/js/settings.js -> isn't this incorrect? 1MB of free quota will lead to value equal to true

I think you can get required quota (even per sample bucket and how much is currently free) from /sampleBuckets call

Line:420, priv/public/js/app.js -> this is incorrect quotaUsed will also include default bucket's quota if we're doing back from later step

Line:896, priv/public/js/app.js -> doing something better then just silent fetching in background and sudden appearance is preferred

Line:898, priv/public/js/app.js -> our REST requests naming policy is camelCase.

Line:902, priv/public/js/app.js -> lets always do html escaping properly.

Line:905, priv/public/js/app.js -> id conflict here. between this code and cut-n-pasted code in settings.js.

Line:923, priv/public/js/app.js -> end I think doing request and reaction at the end makes more sense. This breaks logical sequence of things. Setup first, get data, react on it.

Right now code below only sets things up and defines functions, but somebody can incorrectly change that.

Line:929, priv/public/js/app.js -> function checkedBuckets()

will be better. On IE8 particularly

Line:954, priv/public/js/app.js -> please, don't do that. Initialize variables separately. And declare too.

Line:391, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> do you think there's any point appending [{ram,...}] ?

You said in the other thread that we would delete the buckets with a confirmation, is that still right?

this commit will show if sampleBuckets are installed or not on buckets screen

Line:420, priv/public/js/app.js -> That is what its supposed to do, report the available ram, the total - used, it will be updated every time this screen is loaded

Line:391, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> the quotaUsed 0 was overriding the actual value from ClusterStorageTotals and incorrectly reporting 0 quotaUsed, the code was messy to begin with but I assumed it was to provide defaults for when these values werent set in storagetotals, to do that it should be appended

Patch Set 12:

I'm ok with deleting buckets when changing data path.

Regarding totals thing. Look here: http://i.imgur.com/XdkfJ.png

And about menelaus_web_buckets. I'm OK with radical simplification of this code. But I believe this is not possible (without dropping bucket parameters validation). The code at that line was indeed overriding clusterTotals default. Because /controller/setupDefaultBucket re-creates default bucket if it's there. It's different from normal bucket creation.
