Patch Set 8: Fails

tried it.

Loading sample buckets eats some node's quota, but default bucket creation step is not aware of it. And it seemingly doesn't perform correct quota validation. So it simply causes it overcommit node's quota by 100 MB.

Any ideas how we can fix that ?

Also I've seen this: http://i.imgur.com/HcxVG.png. Somehow step 3 text is looking very differently compared to similar text on other steps
