Patch Set 4: (4 inline comments)

Progress was made. But see inline.

Line:287, priv/public/js/settings.js -> it seems to be constant. Why not make it constant?

Line:293, priv/public/js/settings.js -> why rounding here? It misleads user that 200Megs is enough while in practice thats not true.

Line:302, priv/public/js/settings.js -> constant is used instead of requiredRam variable

Line:334, priv/public/js/settings.js -> we can seemingly handle 'samples already loaded' error here. right ?

Also see my comment about loading as much buckets as possible. If we do it, we'll need better error reporting.

BTW, dialog box is almost never best way to report errors. Especially if we expect them to happen.

Patch Set 4:

Also I think code that checks if enough quota is left, needs to be moved to ns_server. That's the only place that's aware of count of sample buckets to be loaded.

It just needs some way to report what failed and why and UI needs to show that to user in reasonable way.

Patch Set 4:

Yeh I didnt like having a constant in there and there isnt much of a reasonably way in the current setup to transmit that info

I will have the UI warn if the quote is currently full, since thats a default case that will definitely fail, but if you have 5MB free it will let you try and report a failure
