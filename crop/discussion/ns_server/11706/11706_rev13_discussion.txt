Patch Set 13:

I changed the default bucket rest call to report quotaUsed - the defaults quota if it exists, so the default bucket will still provision on top of its own quota, but will be aware of already installed buckets (like the samples)

Fixed the rest of the comments as well

Patch Set 13:

RAMQuotaUsed is computed twice in cluster_storage_totals path. Can be fixed later though
