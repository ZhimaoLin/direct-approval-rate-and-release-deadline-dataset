Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

found issue

and I'm still not quite happy with aborting when we see any docloader-ed bucket being already created. Why can't we a)confirm their flushing from user b)then delete and recreate them c) do docloader-ing

another small issue with current code is separate 100mb constant in docloader code and in menelaus_web

Line:393, src/menelaus_web.erl -> this is candidate for misc.erl with few unit tests

Line:406, src/menelaus_web.erl -> this logic is incorrect. See menelaus_web_buckets:interpret_ram_quota
