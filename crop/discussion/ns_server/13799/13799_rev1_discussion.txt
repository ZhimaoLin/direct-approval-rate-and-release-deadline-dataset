DESCRIPTION

log normal and not scary message when retry_not_ready_vbuckets

Currently in rebalancing clusters with replica count more then 1 you
can quite often seen "crashes" which are not crashes in fact. But
voluntary death of ebucketmigrators.

This voluntarily death happens if some vbuckets we need to replicate
from are not yet backfilled. In such cases we do some progress with
ready vbuckets and terminate after 30 seconds. This commit changes
crash to normal exit and friendly info message.

In fact I cannot verify that because strangely with or without that I observe that replica vbuckets count is increasing only after all vbuckets are moved.
