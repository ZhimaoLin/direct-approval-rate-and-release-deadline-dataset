DESCRIPTION

Return "unknown" status from rebalanceProgress on errors.

Currently if we're unable to grab rebalance progress, we return "none"
as a status from rebalanceProgress. The same status is returned when
we know for sure that rebalance is not running. With this change we'll
discriminate this two cases. This is required to show error message in
the UI when rebalance fails after its progress has been unknown for
some time. Without the change it would not be displayed.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

not sure silently returning on unknown state is the right thing to do
