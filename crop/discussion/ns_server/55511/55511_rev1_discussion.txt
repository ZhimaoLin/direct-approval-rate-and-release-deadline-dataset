DESCRIPTION

Get rid of reformat task option.

It's purpose is to deal with windows tools returning output in utf-16
encoding. For that it used a subtle detail about python's print
statement, namely that it tries to convert a passed string to the
locale set for the file.

I continue using similar semantics of python's write on text files,
but I removed code duplication. So we have one code path handling all
the cases.
