Patch Set 1: Verified+1

I have unit tested the change.

One of the tests in "make ... simple-test" failed with following error. I am checking whether
it is related to my change.

ERROR: rebalance_in_with_ops (rebalance.rebalancein.RebalanceInTests)

Patch Set 1:

The rebalance failure in simple-test was not due to this change. Also, the change does not 
touch rebalance code path. But, investigated the failure and checked with Aruna if QA also seen the issue - she pointed me to bug MB-14223 that was opened today.
