DESCRIPTION

handle race condition between users and roles on joining the cluster

without this fix ns_config:update in perform_actual_join will delete
roles_definitions key from dynamic config, but static config might
contain un-upgraded version. if the users from the cluster are synched
to the new node prior to roles_definitions any process that will try
to compile roles for user will crash

so we'll just reset roles_definitions to undefined and return no access
while it remains undefined
