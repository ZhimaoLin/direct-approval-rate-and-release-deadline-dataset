DESCRIPTION

Reduce max_dbs_open to 200

Requiring everything to be open all the time increases resource
consumption (lots of memory).

This helps us be more reasonable with resource utilization when we've
got ten or twenty buckets on OS X where we can't have network FDs
above 1024.

Patch Set 3: Fails

Ok, trying it on the latest build with a stat fix and the behavior I see:

•	Loading 1M items, drain rate is 0 until the load is done – no memory change on beam.smp (basically nothing happens)
•	As soon as the load is done, disk drain rate increase to about 5K until about half of the items are drained
•	During that time memory usage increased to ~500m 
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND

•	After that drain rate goes to 0 with burst of 1K exactly every 15 seconds
•	Machine is 10.2.1.13

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We also need to remove this value from /opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/local.d/mccouch.ini (which override this one)

Patch Set 3:

It's not clear what you are considering failure with this change.  Did it not reduce the memory usage?

The mccouch.ini thing is a different bug.  It should never have been there unless you configured it through CAPI (and then it should still be in a capi_overrides.ini or something).

Patch Set 3:

I tired both this and http://review.couchbase.org/#change,8281 together and didn't know which was responsible for this issue. I guess I can try 8281 separately and see how it affects memory.

Patch Set 3:

You need them both together right now, but they do vastly different things.  Did the memory swell up to previous values?  If so, that's a failure here.  If not, that's a success here.

Patch Set 3:

Yes it did swell to 540m, but the write to disk stopped half way through, so I can't tell the end result.

Patch Set 3:

OK.  I'm pretty far along on my delayed_commits happy version.  I'll have it ready later tonight.  There's still just the one edge case where I fear really bad things will happen if I let it out in the wild.

ok,
i don't want to merge before we verify it on an end-to-end system. can you email me beam files if that all that it takes?
