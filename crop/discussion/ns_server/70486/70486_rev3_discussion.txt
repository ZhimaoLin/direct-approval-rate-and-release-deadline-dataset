Patch Set 3:

I did see the next commit. It will sum all stats for all goport's under one name. So we won't be able to see stats separately for each go component. I don't think that it is what we want. Or I understand it wrong?

Patch Set 3:

That's best we can do. Besides, goport is barely important. I even thought of removing it entirely from the stats.

Patch Set 3:

if we do that, how do we monitor mem_size of goxdcr? or any other go component?
