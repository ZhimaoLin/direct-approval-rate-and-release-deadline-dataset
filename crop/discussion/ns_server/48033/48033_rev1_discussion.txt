DESCRIPTION

Start single_bucket_sup synchronously again.

Here's the commit that (re)introduced the asynchronous wrapper:

    Revert back "start per-bucket supervisor asynchronously".MB-3827

    This reverts commit ec08571f5a53f4b85ded61ef1367ebb2bf5b878f.

    Unintended side-effect of 'plain' bucket supervisor was that if
    ns_memcached crashes in init we don't crash ns_bucket_sup and we don't
    try to restart it.

    So let's revert to old per-bucket supervisor even though it's
    asynchronous-ness is not needed anymore.

There ns_bucket_sup wouldn't crash just because the return value from
corresponding supervisor:start_child was ignored. But fixed it in a
preceding commit. So we don't really need this logic anymore.
