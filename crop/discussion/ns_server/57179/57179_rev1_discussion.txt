DESCRIPTION

MB-16758: Add pluggable UI support to cluster_run

Adds the cluster_run option --pluggable-ui=File to make it possible to
spscify pluggable UI specification files that are in non-standard
locations. This is expected to be only used during development of new
services.

The files specified with this option has higher priority than files found
in the standard location. This makes it possible to override the normal
specifications for testing purposes.
