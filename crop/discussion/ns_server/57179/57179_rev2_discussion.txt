DESCRIPTION

MB-16758: Add pluggable UI support to cluster_run

Adds the cluster_run option --pluggable-ui=File to make it possible to
spscify pluggable UI specification files that are in non-standard
locations. This is expected to be only used during development of new
services.

The files specified with this option has higher priority than files found
in the standard location. This makes it possible to override the normal
specifications for testing purposes.

Line:68, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Nitpicking, but a path might contain a comma.

Line:71, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I noticed that you changed foldl to foldr in your previous change, and now you're changing it back. Is this intentional?

Line:71, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Yes it is intentional, in order to get the files processed in the correct order.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1 Verified+1

(4 comments)

Verified, but I have some comments that I'm interested in getting a reply to.

Also: ultimately, once Steve + Eben have written plug in specifications it may be nice to be able to pass the plugin config on the command line (as a string rather than a file name) as this will likely save cluster_run creating tmp files (which isn't the end of the word but is a bit ugly). I don't think we change your checkin at this time, but once Steve and Eben get their stuff basically working we'll need to revisit cluster_run to ensure these plugins are enabled by default for developers (by detecting the existence of sibling directories and plugin files.)

Line:49, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> The command line plugin files are processed first, however, 
1) because of the way the foldl + accumulator are written, these files go to the end of the Plugins list
2) there's no ability to override currently so the comment you've written is a bit confusing.

Line:71, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Using foldl + the way you've written the accumulator so that if you have an FTS plugin and a N1QL plugin then the N1QL index.frag.html will be included before the FTS fragment. Is this intended? I think it's fine (as my main concern is that the order is stable, but just checking.)

Line:222, cluster_run -> missing close square bracket

Line:351, cluster_run -> I suggest you add the ui_configs argument at this place in the script with their own -ns_server lead in as the ui_configs seem like extra args and they are per cluster (and not per node) and where you've added them currently they are per node. Thoughts?

Line:49, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Yes, and because line 71 when validating a plugin it checks if the RestApiPrefix has already been used, and in that case this plugin is skipped. That way the first processed plugins have precedence.

Line:71, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Yes, the way it is now the plugins found in priv will be in reverse order. I don't like doing things that are not necessary, so I sort the list but then it gets reversed by the foldl.
