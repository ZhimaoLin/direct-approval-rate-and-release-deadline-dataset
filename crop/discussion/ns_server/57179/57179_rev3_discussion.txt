DESCRIPTION

MB-16758: Add pluggable UI support to cluster_run

Adds the cluster_run option --pluggable-ui=File to make it possible to
spscify pluggable UI specification files that are in non-standard
locations. This is expected to be only used during development of new
services.

The files specified with this option has higher priority than files found
in the standard location. This makes it possible to override the normal
specifications for testing purposes.

Line:238, cluster_run -> this can simply be removed (no more ugly "global", which is nice)

Line:351, cluster_run -> no need for the non-idiomatic comparison against the empty array. "if pluggable_config" should be used.

Line:352, cluster_run -> lines a bit long (> 100 chars). Can you split into 2 lines?

Line:238, cluster_run -> great

Line:351, cluster_run -> Ok, I haven't done any Python in probably 15 years, so I did't remember/know. But I really hate this type of "magic"

Line:352, cluster_run -> ok
