I have no idea why bucketCapabilitiesVer is an atom, I am guessing the versioning should look something like: 

 [{name: 'sync', version: 1.0}] 
or 
 [{'sync': 1.0}]

will change if thats wanted, I didnt do it since I dont know what is depending on this api

Matt, can you remind us what bucketCapabilitiesVer being equal to sync-1.0 means ?
