DESCRIPTION

change rules to display Security tabs in 5.0

So in order to see the tab the user should have
cluster.admin.security.read permission or should
use Enterprise Edition. When the above condition is
reached we look at the compatibility mode version.
If compatibility mode at least 5.0 we show up link
to new "Users" tab otherwise the link leads
to "Root Certificate".

Also, the patch contains changes that allows
CE users to use Security tab
