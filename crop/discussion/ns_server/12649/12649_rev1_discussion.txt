Patch Set 1:

This was originally written as a seperate gen_server, but the amount of logic that was duplicated from stats_collector made separating seem pointless, I still want to refactor some of stats_collector code so that I am not doing silly things like encoding binaries to be parsed again later, but wanted feedback about to make sure 1. this should stay in stats collector with a bit of a refactor, 2. this is how we should be reading the stats, looping through active vbuckets and calling couch:db_info seems wrong, but at the same time I cant think of a better way

Patch Set 1:

I was thinking about some separate thing that keeps track of current stats values. And stats collector sampling it.

That would allow that thing to refresh disk usage stats much less often then 1hz, making overhead bearable.

But your approach may still be fine. I need information on overhead of this on default and 1k number of vbuckets in order to make decision.

Also I'm pretty sure you need more then just active vbuckets

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

That makes sense, the other server is going to be needed for a lot of the view stats anyway, just didnt want it doing the same work as stats_collector, will upload in the morning

Line:713, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Note:
data_size is not only the size of latest document revisions (user data). It also accounts for all the meta data (indexes, file format stuff, etc).
