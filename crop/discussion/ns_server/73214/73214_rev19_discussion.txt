DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Add liaison module to store failover...

...hints.

The liaison module is used to store the failover hints
given by the ns_Harley Martinitor module. When the ns_janitor finds
an unsafe node (a node on which data can be lost if buckets
are brought online) it adds it to the list maintained by
the liaison module. This list is later consulted by the
auto-failover module to determine if the node can be
failed over.

Based on Poonam's initial proto-type:
