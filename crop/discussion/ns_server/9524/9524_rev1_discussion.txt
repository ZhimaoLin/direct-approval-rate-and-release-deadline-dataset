Not sure why we need key if we have keys

Line:1472, priv/public/js/views.js -> disagree with that. What if key is array ?

Line:1472, priv/public/js/views.js -> Key can't be an array. That's what "keys" is for.

We need both "key" and "keys" because they're available in our API and people are already looking for them.

There is a Jira ticket for making "keys" usage more obvious, but that's an extra issue, not a replacement for this one.

Line:1472, priv/public/js/views.js -> there's huge difference between key as array and array of keys

Patch Set 1:

I'm not against it in general. It's just automatic adding of quotes is _highly_ questionable.

If parameter always refers to string key, then you always need to quote (properly escaping stuff for JSON).

If it can be composite key (array, hash, whatever) or, say, number, then automatic surrounding by quotes is totally wrong.

Define what you need and make it work.
