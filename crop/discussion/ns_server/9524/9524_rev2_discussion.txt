Patch Set 2:

"key" always needs quotes as it can only be string. "keys" is a whole separate animal and will get its own set of patches.

This patch includes the potential that the user might pre-quote the string (entering the quotes in the input field)--which is currently required and anyone familiar with the CouchDB API might do out of habit.

Source tells me otherwise.

Permanent NO until you 'get' my argument about proper escaping.

Patch Set 2:

My bad on the key string thing. I've gotten too far away from CouchDB it seems... Will fix this patch.
