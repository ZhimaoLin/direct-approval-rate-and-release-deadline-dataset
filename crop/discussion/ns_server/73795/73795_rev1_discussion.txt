Patch Set 1:

I preferred lists to queue because the most critical function to optimize is touch_key. I expect lots of repeated hits for just few users which keys will be close to the head of the list. But queue doesn't allow to remove key from the middle of the queue without traversing the whole thing with queue:filter

Patch Set 1:

It's very likely that lists:delete is actually faster than your handwritten remove_first, just because it's implemented as a bif.
