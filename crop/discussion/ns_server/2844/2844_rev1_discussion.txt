Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Please don't add more cross-node calls for rendering pages. This information should be added to the heartbeat (it's cached in disksup anyway) which now goes to all nodes.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Never mind, this isn't adding any new calls, I misread. We can make it get the information from the doctor later.
