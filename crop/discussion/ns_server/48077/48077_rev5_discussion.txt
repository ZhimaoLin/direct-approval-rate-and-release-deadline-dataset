DESCRIPTION

MB-13567 Use special vbucket map for view queries.

It differs from the regular vbucket map in one aspect. If the node
happens to be a non-kv node, then the vbucket map will still have an
entry for this node with value master_only. This will be passed to the
view engine as is. The view engine will use it only to read the design
document from the master db.

Missing pieces:
  - development subset
  - local random document
