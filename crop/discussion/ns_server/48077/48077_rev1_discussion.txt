DESCRIPTION

MB-13567 Use special vbucket map for view queries.

It differs from the regular vbucket map in one aspect. If the node
happens to be a non-kv node, then the vbucket map will still have an
entry for this node (with empty list of vbuckets). This will be passed
to the view engine as a set_view_spec with empty list of
partitions. The view engine will used it only to read the design
document from the master db.
