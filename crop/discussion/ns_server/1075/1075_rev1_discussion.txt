DESCRIPTION

Store stats in Mnesia.

Right now this only grabs the latest stats from the Mnesia table. It
also doesn't remove old stats, so it will fill your disk. Be careful.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

marking this as -1 until the log_info/warning/error() macro mystery is solved -- a separate commit revert'ed the changes related to logging...

The changes actually built fine on macos.  But redhat/ubuntu builders croaked at that step.

See...
