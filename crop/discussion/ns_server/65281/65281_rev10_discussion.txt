DESCRIPTION

prepare js minification to upcoming changes

The proposed new UI structure moves JS files into directories
under priv/public/ui as follows:
* base - contains files that are used by both the new (spock)
  and classic UIs. Most commonly this directory will contain
  filters, constants and services that wrap server side REST
  APIs
* app - contains the spock-only HTML files and their Controllers
* app-classic - contains the current HTML files and their Controllers
* libs - third-party libs
* spec - contains tests

As such, let's change the minification tool to consider all
non-library JS files (those residing under libs/) as
application javascripts that should be minified.

Also added support for relative path <base> HTML elements and
now minify all non-libary javascript (library javascripts are assumed to have "libs/" in the path
