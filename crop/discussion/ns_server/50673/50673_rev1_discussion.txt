Patch Set 1:

Probably we should just change the following line in ns_server:start_disk_sink:

    DiskSinkOpts = PerSinkOpts ++ misc:get_env_default(disk_sink_opts, []),

Thanks for figuring out the problem.

Assuming you mean changing that line to 
DiskSinkOpts = PerSinkOpts ++ misc:get_env_default(ns_server, disk_sink_opts, []).

I thought of that but start_disk_sink also gets called for processes (like map reduce) where the application is ns_couchdb. 

Another option is to special case this code for Name = goxdcr but that feels little kludgy.

Forgot to add disk_sink_opts is set for ns_couchdb app.

Patch Set 1:

This is all somewhat kludgy. But ns_couchdb sets the values for both ns_couchdb and ns_server applications:

    lists:foreach(
      fun ({Key, Value}) ->
              application:set_env(ns_couchdb, Key, Value),
              application:set_env(ns_server, Key, Value)
      end, EnvArgs).

So changing start_disk_sink will probably work.

Patch Set 1:

Alternatively, we could untangle start_disk_sink from ns_server app and also change ns_babysitter:setup_static_config to set the variable for ns_babysitter application. That looks cleaner. But it might be the case that something else in babysitter will have to be changed.
