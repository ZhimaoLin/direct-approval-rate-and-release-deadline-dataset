DESCRIPTION

Rename some vbucket_map_mirror functions.

node_vbuckets_dict_or_not_present -> node_vbuckets_dict

  Because the function in fact also could return no_mmap. So I gave it
  more generic name. And also changed it to give clear indication or
  success and failure.

node_vbuckets_dict -> must_node_vbuckets_dict

  To emphasize that the function fails in case bucket is not present
  or does not have a vbucket map.
