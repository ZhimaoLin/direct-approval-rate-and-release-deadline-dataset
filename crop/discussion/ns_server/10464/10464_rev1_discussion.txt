DESCRIPTION

Fix Incorrect Source/Target Bucket Name Parsing

For a push based couch replication of a local database to a remote
location, the source attribute of the #rep record is a binary data
type while the target is a tuple. This change set parses these
attributes correctly in the maybe_adjust_all_replications() and
maybe_retry_all_couch_replications() functions of the XDC replication
manager.
