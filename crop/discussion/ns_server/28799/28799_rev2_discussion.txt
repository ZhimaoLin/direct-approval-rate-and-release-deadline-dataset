DESCRIPTION

MB-9062: always send set-with-meta options

So that we can be sure we're speaking to 2.1.0+ node which understands
those and most importantly is doing xdcr-style conflict resolution.

Otherwise it's possible for xmem replication to replicate to 2.0.1
nodes thinking that conflict resolution happens automagically on the
other side when it's not the case.
