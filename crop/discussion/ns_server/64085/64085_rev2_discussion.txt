DESCRIPTION

Add rebuild_replicas.sh script.

It drops all replicas for a particular vbucket and then recreates them
from active copy. If vbucket was replicated using tap, then it will also
update the replication to dcp.

Use as follows:

  ./rebuild_replicas.sh <username> <password> <host:rest port> <bucket> <vbucket>
