DESCRIPTION

MB-12075: refresh vbucket_map_mirror cache on ssl port updates

Stale cache was causing node .218 to send node .225 node info without
couchApiBaseHTTPS field. Which caused continous crashes on other
cluster.

It looks like cache was stale because we did not refresh it on ssl
capi port updates.
