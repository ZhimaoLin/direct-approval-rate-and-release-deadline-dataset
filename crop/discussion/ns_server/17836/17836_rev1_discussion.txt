DESCRIPTION

MB-5734 Return random keys efficiently.

In most common case when there's a lots of documents in a bucket we'll
be using couch_db:random_doc_info function. In case there are too few
documents, old _all_docs approach will be used (but on the client's
side).

Corresponding REST call moved to
/pools/default/buckets/<bucket>/localRandomKey.

On the UI side any caching of random keys is removed since we expect
this to be fast now.

looks good but:

* I'm not sure we really need to look up local stats at all. We can if we really need to check vbucket's db doc count but I'm not convinced we really have to

* I'm not sure removing capi_views from .ini is the right thing. Can you elaborare a bit why it was done?

and perhaps we should also be prepared to deal with vbucket being "owned" by us according to vbucket map but not yet on disk
