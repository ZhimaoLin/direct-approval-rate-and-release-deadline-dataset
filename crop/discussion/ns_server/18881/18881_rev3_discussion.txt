DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: simplified math of cluster_run ports assignments

We're moving to the following:

* memcached main port: 12000 + i * 2
* moxi port: 12001 + i * 2
* memcached dedicatedport: 11999 - i

Why? Well because not sure about others but, I cannot quickly multiply
by 3. On the other hand multiplying by 2 is easy.
