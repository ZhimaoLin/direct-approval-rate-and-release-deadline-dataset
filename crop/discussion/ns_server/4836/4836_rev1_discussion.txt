Line:398, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/core-data.js -> Basically changing v.need(bucketsURI) to v.need(currentPoolDetailsCell).buckets.uri

Just trying to avoid extra cells, if possible.

Line:398, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/core-data.js -> Good that you spotted it. It's required so that we don't re-fetch buckets after each pool details update.

So when pool details are updated, bucketsURI cell extracts uri (which will be same) and propagation stops here.

I'll add comment clarifying that.
