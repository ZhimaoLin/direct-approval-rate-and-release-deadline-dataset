Patch Set 2:

timing out stats request in cbstats is probably going to be cleaner. And definitely more cross-platform.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

-1-ining based on .next in For Version field of corresponding ticket.

I'd like to avoid somewhat more complex python code that late in release cycle.

Or at least I'd like to have higher-level decision that we really need this fix for 2.0.2 first.
