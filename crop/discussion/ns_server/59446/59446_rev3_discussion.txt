DESCRIPTION

MB-17295: allow pluggable tabs to specify preceding OOTB tab

Prior to this fix, pluggable tabs could only plug in at the end of the
row of tabs. This changes now treats all tabs on the tab bar (whether
out of the box or pluggable) uniformly and additionally allows
pluggable tabs to specify which tab they are after (their preceding tab.)

This will allow the query UI tab to specify an after value of 'Data Buckets'
and get placed in the desired position on the tab bar.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

disadvantage of this approach is that we restrict folks in control of their tab. For example folks may want to add ng-show directive on their tabs. Instead of generating html dynamically we can allow folks to add their own template of the tab. In that case 
 - html is still html
 - folks get full control over the tabs
