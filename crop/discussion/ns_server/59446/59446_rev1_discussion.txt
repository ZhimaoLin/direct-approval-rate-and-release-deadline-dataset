DESCRIPTION

MB-17295: allow pluggable tabs to specify preceding OOTB tab

Prior to this fix, pluggable tabs could only plug in at the end of the
row of tabs. This changes now treats all tabs on the tab bar (whether
out of the box or pluggable) uniformly and additionally allows
pluggable tabs to specify which tab they are after (their preceding tab.)

This will allow the query UI tab to specify an after value of 'Data Buckets'
and get placed in the desired position on the tab bar.

Patch Set 1:

Pavel - can you take a look at this? This is how I want to allow the query tab to move into the position after the Data Buckets tab. I also refactored the settings tab layout to prove that it works, but didn't bother with the indexes and security tabs for now. (We can always do these later.) Let me know.
