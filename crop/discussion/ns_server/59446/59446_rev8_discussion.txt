DESCRIPTION

MB-17295: allow pluggable tabs to specify preceding OOTB tab

Prior to this fix, pluggable tabs could only plug in at the end of the
row of tabs. This changes now treats all tabs on the tab bar (whether
out of the box or pluggable) uniformly and additionally allows
pluggable tabs to specify which tab they are after (their preceding tab.)

This will allow the query UI tab to specify an after value of
'admin.data_buckets' and get placed in the desired position on the
tab bar.

Patch Set 8:

Dave, pardon for override you work, I think we should work together on this change in order to reduce amount of abandoned changes.

From me:
1. one-time binding expression for templates
2. uniq name for "$scope.config"
3. error handling
4. grab "after" element by ui-sref value
5. removed unnecessary code
