DESCRIPTION

MB-17295: allow pluggable tabs to specify preceding OOTB tab

Prior to this fix, pluggable tabs could only plug in at the end of the
row of tabs. This changes now treats all tabs on the tab bar (whether
out of the box or pluggable) uniformly and additionally allows
pluggable tabs to specify which tab they are after (their preceding tab.)

This will allow the query UI tab to specify an after value of
'admin.data_buckets' and get placed in the desired position on the
tab bar.

Patch Set 10:

Finally I decide to use mn-after-tab instead of ui-sref because  they have different purposes:
ui-sref - for ui-router
mn-after-tab - for ui-pluggable-tabs
id - for css
