DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-24055: Change default ep-engine ht_size from 3079 to 0"

Issues seen in rebalance performance - see https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-24107. Suspect the initial HashTable sizes (and the fact that we only run the HashTable resizer every 60s). Reverting this patch while further investigation continues.

This reverts commit 07b72807568b2fc8ef79bfc7d408a8ee0b27d7c7.
