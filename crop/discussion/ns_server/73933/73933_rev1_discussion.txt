Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Ajit - this change reverts your most recent change, which unfortunately breaks indexing. The projector relies on the list of of nodes and the nodes under nodesExt to be in the same order in the terse bucket endpoint - your change reverses the first list. A simple remedy is to just reverse the list (that works - I gave it a quick test) but better is to revert to unblock folks and have you figure out how you'd like to fix.
