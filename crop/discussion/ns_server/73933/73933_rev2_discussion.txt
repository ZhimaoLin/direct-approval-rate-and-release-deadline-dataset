The easy fix is to fix the projector. We haven't ever guaranteed any order of the items in these lists. Moreover, they can be of a different length. I don't even understand why they have the regular node infos: the extended ones contain all the same information.

So basically reverting the patch just hides the bug in the projector.

Patch Set 2:

Although, one deviation in my patch is that the node infos are reversed and this will be different from the order of servers in the vBucketServerMap. We do have a comment in our code (at the beginning of the function) mentioning about this order which I overlooked. Maybe that needs to be fixed.

But as Aliaksey suggested it makes sense for projector to not depend on the order.

Patch Set 2:

Well, I forgot about the vbucket map. I'd say that then it's reasonable to expect that whatever you see in nodesExt matches the vbucket map. Then you don't need to do an extra hope through the regular node list. So I retract my previous comments.
