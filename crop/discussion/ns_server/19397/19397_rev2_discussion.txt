Patch Set 2:

I didn't bother with the faster config stuff since it really only happens once every 15m by default, but I did get rid of all the hard-coded constants.  I don't think there's often an excuse for such things.

I backported lists:nthtail because it didn't work on the version of erlang I got from homebrew.  I initially built and tested all this on a Linux box, but the backport was straightforward and I thought it beneficial.

Log entries are *slightly* odd, but I figured it'd be better to use ~p than ~s in case something went wrong.  That makes the initial log entry look like this:

    [ns_server:info] [2012-08-10 10:32:14] xxx@xxx.xxx Starting log rotator on "data/n_0/log"/"memcached.log"* with an initial period of 900000ms

And the actual rotation entries look like this:

    [ns_server:info] [2012-08-10 10:32:15] xxx@xxx.xxx Removed 0 "memcached.log" log files from "data/n_0/log" (retaining up to 10)
