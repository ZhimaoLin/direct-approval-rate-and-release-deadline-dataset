This has been observed to work. I'm not sure how ideal it is as the configuration is a bit hairy, but I tried to fit the patterns as I saw them.

looks good. One minor typo inside.

I think config variables can be fetched from ns_config. There's quick way to do that via ns_config_ets_dup. Which I'm using to enable override-abibility of constants. Seems good fit here.

Line:32, src/ns_memcached_log_rotator.erl -> cast here, not call
