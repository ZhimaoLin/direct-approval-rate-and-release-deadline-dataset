Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

It's still a bit weird when you edit a user and set the user's name to be that of another user: that user silently gets deleted. That's a bug: the flow should be to delete a user and then do the rename (since this should be such an unusual flow.) But we can fix this in a separate checkin
