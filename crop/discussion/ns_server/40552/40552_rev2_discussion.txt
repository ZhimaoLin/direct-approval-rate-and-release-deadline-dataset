DESCRIPTION

do not allow to query vbucket states during rebalance

this can happen if the rebalance fails and master is reelected and
Harley Martinitor on new master tries to do cleanup before the dcp connections are properly
nuked.

after this change the ns_Harley Martinitor_vis:graphviz functionality will not
work during the rebalance, which is OK since this is rarely used undocumented
feature
