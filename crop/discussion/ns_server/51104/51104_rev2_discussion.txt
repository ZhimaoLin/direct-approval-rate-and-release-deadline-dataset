Line:172, priv/public/js/replications.js -> Are you simply ignoring empty matches? 

empty matches are real matches and should not be ignored. For example, if there is only one empty match and no non-empty matches, the key of interest should be considered as having matched the expression, and the "match" button should be displayed. This is not the behavior of the current UI, nor the behavior of the UI after this fix.

Putting -1 based on Yu's comment. So that it doesn't get submitted by accident.

Patch Set 2:

You are absolutely right. Also in this case we could say something like "No match groups were extracted."
