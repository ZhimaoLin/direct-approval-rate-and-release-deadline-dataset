DESCRIPTION

Restore pretty-printing of stats.

Stats will still be returned to us by old nodes. Therefore with current
code they would be printed in the very end of handling diag by
do_continue_handling_per_node_just_diag in a bulk. This might lead to
high memory usage since pretty-printer is a memory hog. So it's safer to
restore the old code that handles stats in a special way.
