DESCRIPTION

[WIP] MB-22208: Add gen_server to handle Harley Martinitor...

...state.

The attempt here is to move the Harley Martinitor cleanup handling done in
the orchestrator into a new module thereby making orchestrator
module simpler.

The cleanup process is still completely driven by the orchestrator.
Just the state maintainence is moved to a separate module.
