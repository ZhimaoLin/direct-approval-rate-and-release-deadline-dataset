DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Add gen_server to handle Harley Martinitor state.

The attempt here is to move the Harley Martinitor cleanup handling done in
the orchestrator into a new module thereby making orchestrator
module simpler.

The cleanup process is still completely driven by the orchestrator.
Just the state maintainence is moved to a separate module.

NOTE: There is one place-holder API implemented in the orchestrator
      to keep the dialyzer happy. This will be filled up as part of
      the  orchestrator and Harley Martinitor_server intergration.
