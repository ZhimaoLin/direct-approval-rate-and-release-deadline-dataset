Line:351, cbcollect_info -> This doesn't seem right? Not really a useful error message.

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> OOI, can you give an example of what this prints when you run out of disk space?

Line:353, cbcollect_info -> Why are you printing this and not logging it?

Line:351, cbcollect_info -> This is because the failure will occur halfway though a command that's expecting to print `- OK` or `- Exit code 123` (which is what log_result() does). Without a result to that command, we'd leave that command without a result, and need to start the actual message with a new line, which is a bit awkward.

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> $ sudo /vagrant/cbcollect_info foo.zip
Using temporary dir /tmp
uname (uname -a) - OK
time and TZ (date; date -u) - OK
ntp time (ntpdate -q pool.ntp.org || nc time.nist.gov 13 || netcat time.nist.gov 13) - OK
ntp peers (ntpq -p) - OK
raw /etc/sysconfig/clock (cat /etc/sysconfig/clock) - OK
raw /etc/timezone (cat /etc/timezone) - Exit code 1
System Hardware (lshw -json || lshw) - Exit code 127
Process list snapshot (export TERM=''; top -Hb -n1 || top -H n1) - Error
Error writing to /tmp/tmp1oYAT2/couchbase.log: [Errno 28] No space left on device
Try a different temporary dir using --tmp-dir

Line:353, cbcollect_info -> It seems like we do both throughout. I see your point, but unless we standardise it seems pretty arbitrary?

Line:351, cbcollect_info -> Alright, makes complete sense!

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> Would it be possible to print `e.message` instead, which would just be 'No space left on device'. Seems slightly cleaner than including the Errno which means zilch to the user.

Line:353, cbcollect_info -> I just wondered if it made a difference as to whether or not the output was included in the cbcollect or not (based on https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/commit/0648ddf7bf18f1832e13d6536680d184087ddd34).

Line:351, cbcollect_info -> Done

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> Certainly possible, the reason I did this though was to get as much info as possible if a different IOError occurred. Unlikely, and hopefully even then the error message would be good enough, but still...

Line:353, cbcollect_info -> It's a fair point in terms of the general usage, but given that at this point we've just failed to write to the temp dir, we probably wouldn't be logging this into the zip anyway.
