Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

dont forget to add reviewers, please.

Regarding this change. Direct call to ns_memached:stats is incorrect. First, it grabs stats only from local node. Second, we already grab stats once per second. So looks like you should ask stats_archiver.
