Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Nearly there

Line:40, src/stats_archiver.erl -> this can probably go to separate commit as well

Line:213, src/stats_collector.erl -> move this to ns_stats.hrl please

Line:38, src/stats_reader.erl -> looks like this can be extracted into separate commit
