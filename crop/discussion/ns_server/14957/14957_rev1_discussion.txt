DESCRIPTION

MB-5060 Remove bucket from remaining_buckets upon deletion.

If user request bucket deletion when Harley Martinitor run is in progress, we
shut Harley Martinitor down but we used to keep remaining_bucket list intact. It
means that in certain circumstances subsequent Harley Martinitor run would try
to cleanup the bucket that had just been deleted.
