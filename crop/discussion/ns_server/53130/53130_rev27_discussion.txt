One minor problem here:
The old UI shows:

Index
Query

The new UI shows:
Index Data
Query

Patch Set 27:

The comments here remove the line breaks. What I wanted to say that the old UI shows Data, Index and Query words each in its own line.

The new UI places Index and Data in the same line. Looks less pretty.
