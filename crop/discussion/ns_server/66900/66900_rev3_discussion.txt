DESCRIPTION

MB-20595: Update cbdocloader call to support new docloader

The new cbdocloader is backwards compatibile with the old one
except we do not accept the BUCKET_USERNAME and BUCKET_PASSWORD
environment variables because they were not needed even in the
old cbdocloader.

We also added a flag for verbose output and to use two client
threads when loading sample data.
