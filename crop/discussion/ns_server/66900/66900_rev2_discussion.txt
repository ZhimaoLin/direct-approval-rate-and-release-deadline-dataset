DESCRIPTION

MB-20595: Update cbdocloader call to support new docloader

The new cbdocloader is backwards compatibile with the old one
except we do not accept the BUCKET_USERNAME and BUCKET_PASSWORD
environment variables because they were not needed even in the
old cbdocloader.

We also added a flag for verbose output and to use two client
threads when loading sample data.

Patch Set 2:

I'll need to update my commit message since I made a mistake. I just retested the old cbdocloader and it does need the bucket username and password. This isn't actually "required" and I could easily change the old cbdocloader to not need it.

The reason we don't need it in general is because all of the REST API's that get called by cbdocloader do not required authentication when the bucket that data is being loader to does not contain a password. I'll wNathalie Landry through the various API calls below.

1. Creating a bucket - This API does actually require a password, but in the case of loading data from the Admin Console, ns_server creates the bucket before cbdocloader is run. As a result this API gets skipped in both the old and new cbdocloader.

2. /pools/default/bucket/<bucket_name> - This is how the new cbdocloader gets the bucket password. If the bucket doesn't have a password this API is accessible. The old cbdocloader does not do this and that's why we need the BUCKET_USERNAME and BUCKET_PASSWORD

3. Create View - Not password protected if the bucket has no password.

4. Create Indexes - Goes through N1QL and we have the bucket username and password from step 2.

If the bucket does have a password then both the old and new cbdocloader will not work properly, but we currently only have password-less buckets. If you would like I can work with Artem to get the internal username/password, but I figured that since this change will leave us in roughly the same place as we were with the old cbdocloader that it would be ok. Let me know if you would like me to make any other changes.

I see. We indeed have just been passing empty password all the time. But that will probably stop working in spock since we're planning to do away with bucket passwords.

Patch Set 2:

Yeah, I figured that at some point this would break. Should I address that now or when we remove the bucket passwords?

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

I think this is good to merge as is. I tNathalie Landryed to Artem and he said we can address authentication later in the release when we remove bucket passwords.
