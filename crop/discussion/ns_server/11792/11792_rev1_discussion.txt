DESCRIPTION

fixed setup notifications errors display in IE8

IE8 (quite correctly) doesn't like inserting block level elements into
P elements. That's disallowed by html spec. In order to fix it we're
changing element type to DIV and have to copy styles that were applied
to P element in this place.
