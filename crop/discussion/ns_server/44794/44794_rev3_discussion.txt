DESCRIPTION

MB-13031: minimize allocation of chains to vbuckets better

Previous heuristic was found to be too weak. Most likely due to it's
assumption of chain replication and that it's not possible to
efficiently switch master and replica.

New code tries harder to assign vbucket map chains into vbuckets with
minimal cost. It is still heuristics and thus not always optiomal. It
is simple "eager" heuristic which tries to first assign cheapest moves
that leave most freedom after assignment is made.

In practice it seems to come very close to minimal assignment in
important case of less then 12 nodes and 1 replica (where we know that
our simplistic minimum bound is achievable).

And it is almost always better than old heuristics. I've found very
few exceptions (e.g. 6 -> 5 nodes rebalance by single move). Because
of that, we keep old moves minimizer as well and we try both and pick
best of two results.

Plots of old vs. new vs. min bound can be seen here (graphs plot
number of moves when growing cluster by given "step"):
