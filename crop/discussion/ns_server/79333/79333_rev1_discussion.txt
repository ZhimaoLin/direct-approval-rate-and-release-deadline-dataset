DESCRIPTION

MB-24543 start default moxi on Spock clusters only if there's a

..."default" bucket with passwordless access

because:
1. we no longer support access to buckets other than "default"
   via default moxi
2. we should not allow access to password protected "default"
   because it is a security hole
3. access to passwordless "default" is supported only for upgraded
   clusters, since it is not allowed to create passwordless users
