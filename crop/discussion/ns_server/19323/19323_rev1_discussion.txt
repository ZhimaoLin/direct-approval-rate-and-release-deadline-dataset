DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Fix xdc_replicator_worker:flush_docs error log message.

Seems that it's been a long time since couch_api_wrap:update_docs
stopped converting remote error messages to something that looks
exactly like local error messages. Thus instead of atoms one should
look up corresponding binaries in a parsed object.
