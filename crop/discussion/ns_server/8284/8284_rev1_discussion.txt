DESCRIPTION

Views list padding and "Create View..." button display regressions

Also added empty "Production Views" list message.

Display of the "Create View..." button is affected by a long standing
TabsCell bug that causes subscriptions not to "run" when page is
reloaded if the non-default tab is selected, so in this case the
"in-development" class isn't set if the page is refreshed when
"Development Views" is selected.
