DESCRIPTION

note that vbuckets of vbm sup child vbucket ids are sorted

We already relied on vbuckets field being sorted.
ns_vbm_sup::set_nodes_replicas in fact heavily relied on it.

This change documents this assumption and fixes ns_vbm_sup:add_replica
that did not maintain vbuckets sortedness.

Few optimizations enabled by this sortedness are also implemented.
