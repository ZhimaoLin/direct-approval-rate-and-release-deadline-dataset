DESCRIPTION

MB-21884: REST API to create ephemeral buckets.

The following are the changes done:
[1] The 'bucketType' parameter now accepts a new value called
    'ephemeral'. This is allowed only in spock clusters.
[2] Internally, it'll be stored as 'membase' type in the bucket
    config and additional parameter called 'storage_mode' gets
    stored in the bucket config. The 'storage_mode' parameter
    stores either 'couchstore' or 'ephemeral' as values.
[3] The bucket filtering APIs, get_bucket_names_of_type and
    node_bucket_names_of_type, have been updated to take in
    storage_mode as a parameter.
[4] Updated the callers of the bucket filtering APIs to pass
    in the storage mode explicitly.
[5] The bucket config string has been updated to pass this
    info down to the ep-engine. The 'couchstore' and
    'ephemeral' values get mapped to 'persistent' and
    'ephemeral' respectively.
[6] The length of the update bucket message to orchestrator
    can be different in mixed mode. Handling it accordingly.

Line:1304, src/compaction_new_daemon.erl -> placing these parameters in 3 lines doesn't improve the readability

Line:52, src/index_stats_collector.erl -> can you confirm that indexer will in fact work on ephemeral buckets?

Line:1304, src/compaction_new_daemon.erl -> It's more to do with the line exceeding the 80 character mark.

Line:52, src/index_stats_collector.erl -> Yes!

Only MOI is supported on ephemeral buckets. The following are the tests that I had conducted:

[1] Tried creating MOI on ephemeral bucket which had some documents in it. The index creation succeeded but the index was not completely built. I think there is some work that needs to be done in the indexer for ephemeral buckets.

[2] Tried creating MOI on ephemeral bucket without any documents and the index creation succeeded.

[3] Tried creating MOI on a couchbase buckets with some documents. The index got created and built.

With all these in place I noticed that the "index_stats_collector" got zeros for the MOI stats for ephemeral buckets and MOI stats populated for couchbase buckets. No crashes in ns_server.
