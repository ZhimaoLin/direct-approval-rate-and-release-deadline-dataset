DESCRIPTION

MB-21884: Add REST API support to create ephemeral buckets.

The following are the changes done:
[1] The 'bucketType' parameter now accepts a new value called
    'ephemeral'. This is allowed only in spock clusters.
[2] Internally, it'll be stored as 'membase' type in the bucket
    config and additional parameter called 'storage_mode' gets
    stored in the bucket config. The 'storage_mode' parameter
    stores either 'couchstore' or 'ephemeral' as values.
[3] The bucket filtering APIs, get_bucket_names_of_type and
    node_bucket_names_of_type, have been updated to take in
    storage_mode as a parameter.
[4] The bucket config string has been updated to pass this
    info down to the ep-engine. The 'couchstore' and
    'ephemeral' values get mapped to 'persistent' and
    'ephemeral' respectively.
