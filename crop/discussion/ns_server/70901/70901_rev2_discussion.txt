DESCRIPTION

MB-21884: Add REST API support to create ephemeral buckets.

The following are the changes done:
[1] The 'bucketType' parameter now accepts a new value called
    'ephemeral'.
[2] Internally, it'll be stored as 'membase' type in the bucket
    config and additional parameter called 'storage_mode' gets
    stored in the bucket config. The 'storage_mode' parameter
    stores either 'couchstore' or 'ephemeral' as values.
[3] The bucket config string has been updated to pass this
    info down to the ep-engine. The 'couchstore' and
    'ephemeral' values get mapped to 'persistent' and
    'ephemeral' respectively.

Poonam just pointed out that the ephemeral bucket creation should be avoided if the cluster is not "spock". Will make the required changes.
