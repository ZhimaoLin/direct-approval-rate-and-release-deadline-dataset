DESCRIPTION

MB-21884: Add REST API support to create ephemeral buckets.

The following are the changes done:
[1] The 'bucketType' parameter now accepts a new value called
    'ephemeral'. This is allowed only in spock clusters.
[2] Internally, it'll be stored as 'membase' type in the bucket
    config and additional parameter called 'storage_mode' gets
    stored in the bucket config. The 'storage_mode' parameter
    stores either 'couchstore' or 'ephemeral' as values.
[3] The bucket config string has been updated to pass this
    info down to the ep-engine. The 'couchstore' and
    'ephemeral' values get mapped to 'persistent' and
    'ephemeral' respectively.

Patch Set 6:

"make test" and "make dialyzer" passed. But after a rebase, the simple-test suite is failing. I tried running it on the vanilla spock tree and the same test cases failed there too.

Line:122, src/ns_bucket.erl -> nit-pick: Don't really need a separate function here. Can call proplists:get_value directly.

BTW, if not already done, please also test a memcached bucket to verify no regressions.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:122, src/ns_bucket.erl -> The "storage_mode" is being read at multiple places (from menelaus_web_buckets module also) and hence I made it into a function.
