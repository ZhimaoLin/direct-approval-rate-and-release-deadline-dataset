DESCRIPTION

MB-21884: Add REST API support to create ephemeral buckets.

The following are the changes done:
[1] Modified the Create bucket REST API to accept a new param
    called 'storageMode' which accepts either 'couchstore' or
    'ephemeral' as values. To create ephemeral buckets the
    user will have to set 'storageMode' to 'ephemeral'.
[2] The bucket config string has been updated to pass this
    info down to the ep-engine. The 'couchstore' and
    'ephemeral' values get mapped to 'persistent' and
    'ephemeral' respectively.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Up to you guys, but note that the actual two different on-disk backends (couchdb and forestdb) are already controlled via the 'backend' configuration option.

As such, giving the setting which controls persistence vs.ephemeral "couchstore" could be confusing, as you'd potentially have the following combinations:

* "couchstore" + "couchdb" == Couchbase bucket with Couchstore as disk format
* "couchstore" + "forestdb" == Couchbase bucket with ForestDB as disk format
* "ephemeral" == Ephemeral Bucket.

Patch Set 1:

Dave, we currently don't have a way to accept different backends in the REST API. The idea is to use the combination of 'bucketType' and 'storageMode' parameters to map to the corresponding memcached's  'backend' and 'bucket_type' config options.

For now, the bucketType REST API param will be set to "couchbase" for all bucket types we offer. So based on the values of storageMode REST API param the mapping would be like the following:

"couchstore" => backend=couchdb & bucket_type=persistent
"ephemeral" => backend=couchdb & bucket_type=ephemeral
"forestdb" => backend=forestdb & bucket_type=persistent

That seems fine - as I say it doesn't really matter too much to me. 

(Personally in my head the kvstore (forestdb, couchstore or xxxDB) is only applicable to Persistent buckets, and I see Ephemeral as a third bucket type (alongside Couchbase and Memcache, with Memcache being deprecated in future). Therefore I'd make the REST API reflect that, but as I say it's up to you guys ;)

Patch Set 1:

We have a 'baseline' Ephemeral buckets drop due for QE next Friday (2nd Feb).

Would it be possible to get this merged into master by then?
