Line:865, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Nit-pick:

For clarity, I would rename "enforce_topology_limitation" to "is_this_topology_supported".

Line:154, src/ns_error_messages.erl -> Duplicate "with".

Line:865, src/ns_cluster.erl -> IMHO only functions that return boolean should have names that start from is_

Line:154, src/ns_error_messages.erl -> thanks for finding it.
