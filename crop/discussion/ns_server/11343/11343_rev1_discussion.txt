DESCRIPTION

Pass correct rest port to moxi in all the cases.

Since now we have pretty complicated semantics of how to determine
which config value corresponds to real rest port, we need to
parametrize moxi with correct value in all the cases. So we use a
dedicated function to determine the value to use.
