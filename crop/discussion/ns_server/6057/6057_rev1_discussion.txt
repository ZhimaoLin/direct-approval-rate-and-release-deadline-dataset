DESCRIPTION

made mb_master always react on child supervisor exit.MB-3766

I believe reason for MB-3766 is that supervisor terminated normally,
which was not handled in any way by mb_master.

New code makes sure mb_master exits if any of linked processes
terminates (even normally). But when we shutdown child supervisor
ourselves (when giving up mastership) we carefully consume exit
message and handle it. So only unexpected exits cause mb_master death.
