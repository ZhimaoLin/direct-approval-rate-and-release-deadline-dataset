DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: implemented simple caching for view merge params builder

New service now maintains public ETS table that caches important,
infrequently changed and potentially expensive to compute information
that's needed for view merge params building:

* dict of nodes to lists active vbuckets on those nodes

* mapping from nodes to capi port urls

Service does cache invalidation via config events subscription. Actual
mutation of ETS table entries (including cache clearing) is done in
single-threaded fashion on dedicated worker process. That prevents
races with cache invalidation 'overtaking' cache update that used
previous version of vbucket map.

Looks good. See minor comment inline. And I wonder if there is any reason not to use protected ets table if it's anyway is not supposed to be updated from outside.

Line:69, src/ns_server_sup.erl -> I believe that it does not make any difference for us. But the last element in child spec should be a list of used modules (i.e. [work_queue]).

Line:69, src/ns_server_sup.erl -> right. And ns_config and perhaps lots of other things. We're not obeying this rules anywhere. And it doesn't seem worth to start trying IMHO
