DESCRIPTION

Bug 2508: Don't require auth for buckets with blank password

Here's the new logic:

* We allow access with the administrator password for any bucket.
* If a bucket has a blank password (or no auth set), we allow you in
either with no authentication or with a username and blank password.
* If a bucket has a non-empty password, we require a username and
password.
