DESCRIPTION

WIP MB-10086 [auto_collect]: basic manager and per-node processes

Adds two new processes for cluster-wide log collection:
collect_logs_manager and collect_logs_node.

* collect_logs_manager: gen_server responsible for managing a user's
  logs request, accepts requests for log collection and spawns a
  collect_logs_node process on each cluster node which logs are
  requested from, and aggregates their results.

* collect_logs_node: gen_server responsible for running cbcollect_info
  on a particular cluster node, and returning the result of that
  process back to the manager.

see inline.

I'm not big fan of relatively complex state machine that you're doing in collectinfo manager. Given you're doing things linearly anyways, it would make more sense to do all that stuff naturally in "linear code". One way to do it is to start actual "collection orchestrator" as a child of manager process for each collection. And have it do things linearly and naturally. That's how rebalance works for example.

@Alk:

(Firstly I can't see anything inline - could you check your comments are there? otherwise it's me not using gerrit correctly :)

re: complixity - so I wanted to keep the option to test running in parallel in the near future - this would be obviously much faster but I didn't want to kill clusters. Given that do you think a separate orchestrator task is worthwhile? If so I'm happy to split it out, but I don't think it would simplify things very much...

you can find my inline comments in previous revision of patch.

Regarding state-machine versus my suggestion I won't try to force you.

Patch Set 7:

regarding linking.

So far my thinking is along the line of making misc:start_link work in this place. There seems to be no reason why it would not work.
