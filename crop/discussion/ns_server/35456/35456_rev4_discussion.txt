DESCRIPTION

WIP MB-10086 [auto_collect]: basic manager and per-node processes

Adds two new processes for cluster-wide log collection:
collect_logs_manager and collect_logs_node.

* collect_logs_manager: gen_server responsible for managing a user's
  logs request, accepts requests for log collection and spawns a
  collect_logs_node process on each cluster node which logs are
  requested from, and aggregates their results.

* collect_logs_node: gen_server responsible for running cbcollect_info
  on a particular cluster node, and returning the result of that
  process back to the manager.

Patch Set 4:

Significant change, adds:

- Tasks API for publishing status.
- Upload support
- Tracking of in_progress and completed child tasks (including cross-node spawn/link).
- Handle hanging cbcollect_info / terminating it when Erlang processes exit.
- Expand cbcollect_mock to support these functions.

Still needs to be integrated with cbcollect_info and UI changes, but (hopefully) this is close to feature complete.
