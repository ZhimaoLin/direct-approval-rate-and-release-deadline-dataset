DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: basic manager and per-node processes

Adds two new processes for cluster-wide log collection:
collect_logs_manager and collect_logs_node:

* collect_logs_manager: gen_server responsible for managing a user's
  logs request, accepts requests for log collection and spawns a
  collect_logs_node process on each cluster node which logs are
  requested from, and aggregates their results.

* collect_logs_node: gen_server responsible for running cbcollect_info
  on a particular cluster node, and returning the result of that
  process back to the manager. Prefixes each uploaded zipfile with the
  timestamp when the collection was started.
