DESCRIPTION

MB-4564 Don't delete database files when node leaves cluster.

Instead delete them when such a node is added back to a cluster. Note
that ns_memcached will delete database files only when bucket is
missing from config at all (ns_bucket:delete_bucket was called), as
opposite to when it's missing from the node.
