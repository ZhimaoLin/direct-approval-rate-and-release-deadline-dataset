DESCRIPTION

MB-6206: fixed node membership check race when starting rebalance

All checks are now done on orchestrator, serializing things
w.r.t. node state changes.

Also it can be seen that previosuly no_active_nodes_left check was not
taking into account failed over node which made possible MB-6206,
i.e. rebalancing out all the nodes.
