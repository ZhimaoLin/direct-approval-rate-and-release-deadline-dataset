DESCRIPTION

List failed tests in the end of "make test" output.

Because it's always annoying to look for this in its lengthy
output. Let the machine do this.

An example of the output:

...
=======================================================
  Failed: 1.  Skipped: 0.  Passed: 1081.
=======================================================
  Failed tests:
    index_settings_manager:defaults_test/0
=======================================================
