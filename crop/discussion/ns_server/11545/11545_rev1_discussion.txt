DESCRIPTION

Deliver only buckets changes having needed bucket config in them.

Sometimes during bucket deletion when capi_set_view_manager is not yet
terminated it gets a {bucket, ...} message that already does not
contain the config for the appropriate bucket. In this case
capi_set_view_manager crashes. This crash seems to be completely
harmless but just to avoid unnecessary noise in the log file from now
we will filter such messages out.
