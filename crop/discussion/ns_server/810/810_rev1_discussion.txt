DESCRIPTION

Make Harley Martinitor still able to run with unreachable node.

We'd bail out before if any node was unreachable. There are probably
still cases where the Harley Martinitor won't run with an unreachable node, but
it could cause problems if a node is unreachable anyway, so this needs
testing.
