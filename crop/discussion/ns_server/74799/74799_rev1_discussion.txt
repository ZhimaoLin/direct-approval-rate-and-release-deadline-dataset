DESCRIPTION

MB-23095 GET users api with pagination

example: /settings/rbac/users/builtin?pageSize=10&startAfter=u1'

output:
{
  "skipped": 123,
  "total": 1234,
  "users" : [.....]
}

skipped: how many users were skipped due to startAfter
total: total number of users in storage

Note: pagination will not work for /settings/rbac/users since
we might have duplicate id's

Patch Set 1:

Quite unfortunate that we need to traverse entire database for every request. You should probably use couch_skew instead of your ordered list thingy. See menelaus_web_crud for an example.
