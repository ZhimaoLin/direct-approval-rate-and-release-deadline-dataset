DESCRIPTION

MB-24751: Don't attempt to remove indexes as...

...part of the flush operation on ephemeral buckets.

Views are not enabled on ephemeral buckets. But the flush operation
was not updated to not perform the "remove indexes" step for
ephemeral buckets because of which a crash is seen. This change is
to fix this problem by bypassing the "remove indexes" step for
ephemeral buckets.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Ran the usual set of tests:
[1] make dialyzer
[2] make test
[3] make simple-test

The views related tests fail in simple-test. But they are failing without my changes too. Hence marking it as +1.
