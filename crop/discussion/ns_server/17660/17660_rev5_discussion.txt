Line:221, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> What's the point?

Line:221, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Can you please be more specific? If list2atom is a bad idea, what is the better way to do that?

Line:221, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> DefRepMode = DefRepModeStr == "true",

At the end DefRepMode will contain true or false.

Line:221, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Isn't this the same thing as the case stmt? Seems it is harder to read than a simple case stmt.
