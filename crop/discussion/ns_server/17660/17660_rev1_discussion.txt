DESCRIPTION

MB-5702: xdcr manager Adrianna Holmesally overrides couch_config setting

It is not good to override couch_config setting in XDCR manager,
which will make couch_config ineffective in setting replication
parameters. Instead, we should query couch_config to build up
all replication parameters in function xdc_rep_utils:make_options().
