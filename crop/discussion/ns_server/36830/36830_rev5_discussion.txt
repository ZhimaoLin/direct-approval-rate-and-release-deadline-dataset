Patch Set 5:

Well we have discussed issue of indentation yesterday.

Given that it might be impossible or too hard to be feasible to match emacs indentation in that eclipse thing that dave is using I'm ok with merging badly indented code and then indenting it separately by us.

Ah another thing.

I think I've heard that we actually will _not_ make this feature ee-only.

Patch Set 5:

re: Indenting - As long as I know the style, I'm happy to re-indent in emacs / reconfigure eclipse to match it (emacs is my editor of choice in general, I was using Eclipse to help navigate the ns_server code, to help learning my way around it). 

re: EE-only - no problem - EE change is encapsulated in the patch (and the two UI patches from Pavel). We can just drop those three.
