DESCRIPTION

made ui auto refresh visual settings and stop always polling them

We're using our usual trick to publish url with ?v=<hash> appended at
the end. And we wake up all ui long polling requests if
internal_visual_settings change. When UI sees updated url it'll
automatically refresh visual settings.

New API is purely internal.
