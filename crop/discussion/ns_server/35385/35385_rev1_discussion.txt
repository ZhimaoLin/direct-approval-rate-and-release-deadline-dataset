DESCRIPTION

MB-10742 Pass config_path as atom in cluster_run.

Root case is the same as in MB-9839. Namely, erlang's inability to
correctly escape arguments passed to open_port bif.

Turned out that we pass config_path as an atom in windows package. So
just do the same thing in cluster_run as a work around.
