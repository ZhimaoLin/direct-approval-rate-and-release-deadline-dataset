Line:253, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> name needs to be better

Line:120, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> not able to get this line

Line:127, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> projector? I thought that projector is purely internal thing that is not exposed to clients.

Line:119, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> I did not understand the purpose of bucket_info_cache.erl:build_services() correctly. Since I saw config is populated for n1ql and moxi, thinking that it is used to generate config while babysitter starts them up.

Patch Set 2:

Bucket info will be relevant. It is only way to inform your clients (i.e. niql) about where your indexing endpoints are.
