Patch Set 7:

(2 comments)

Line:281, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> I'd just hardcode something large here. Environment variable affects _new_ buckets. All existing buckets have vbuckets count as part of their config. So if somebody changes environment variable to small vbucket count after creating buckets with large vbucket count I guess badness will occur.

But not big deal (given that folks usually don't change this environment variable) and can be fixed later anyways.

Line:120, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> possibility of undefined here is imperfect (i.e. for 2.x and 3.0 nodes).

Will fix myself.
