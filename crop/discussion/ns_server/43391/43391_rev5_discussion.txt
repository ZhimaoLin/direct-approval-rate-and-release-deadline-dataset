Patch Set 5:

Line:265, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> Is there a way to get current ip address of the node from babysitter/ns_server before starting projector ?

Ideally we would like to have this parameter with node's ip address:
-adminport=ip:ProjectorPort

I see that kv node services are started up even before first couchbase instance is configure (ie, before user provides its ip address itself)
