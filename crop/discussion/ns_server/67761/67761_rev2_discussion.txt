Patch Set 2: Verified+1

[1] Removed the saslBucketsStreaming REST API. I checked the documentation online and I couldnâ€™t find a reference to it.

[2] Aliaksey had also mentioned to check if the cluster compat version needs to be bumped up. It seems like Anders has already done that as part of this commit: http://review.couchbase.org/65160. Also the default config version still points to 4.5 and since we have not made any changes to that we need not bump it up. Right?

[3] I have reached out to the PMs regarding the case (retaining the restart moxi capability and returning proxyPort) that Aliaksey had flagged. I have not modified the original changes. If the PM team says that we need to support it then will make the necessary changes.

Patch Set 2:

ns_test_util deletion should be in a separate change, because it really doesn't have anything to do with moxi deletion.
