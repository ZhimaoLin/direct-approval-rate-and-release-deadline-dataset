DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using the requests library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

See inline

Line:595, cbcollect_info -> Nit: If you're building up a list of all errors, might want to add a full stop to this sentence to make it easier to multiple ones.

Line:601, cbcollect_info -> Ditto

Line:607, cbcollect_info -> Ditto

Line:611, cbcollect_info -> Ditto

Line:615, cbcollect_info -> Ditto

Line:632, cbcollect_info -> I'd re-phrase this as something like "--host specified without --upload"

And if possible I'd specify the name of the extra option they had, easier to tell what's wrong.
