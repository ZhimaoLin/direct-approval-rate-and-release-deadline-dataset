DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using the requests library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

Line:14, cbcollect_info -> Nit: good practice to keep imports sorted, but seeing as they weren't sorted before you started...

Line:89, cbcollect_info -> Whitespace only change - please revert

Line:109, cbcollect_info -> Note that "\n" is a unix-ism - you probably don't want to use it here (and instead just rely on python to output the correct end-of-line symbol.

(here and elsewhere).

Line:166, cbcollect_info -> Nit: Just a single space before the '=' sign.

Line:172, cbcollect_info -> typo - recived -> received

Line:507, cbcollect_info -> I'd re-phase the help, or remove it entirely. How about:

help="Script mode. Outputs in a form suitable for parsing by a script. All detailed progress is suppressed, and only brief status information is output when the script completes."

Line:688, cbcollect_info -> As mentioned above, I'd drop the trailing comma here and let python output  the correct end-of-line delimiter.
