DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using the requests library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

Patch Set 22:

I tend to agree with Pavel. We can do better.

But most notably I think we can improve chances of progress by the following:

* drop _all_ unnecessary stuff. No need to sanity check urls at all. Drop QUIET. Drop SIGINT handler. Drop all that's not directly used by erlang bits. Minimize changes.

* move uploading part into it's own function for clarity and maintainability

All "bells and whistles" can be submitted separately later. With only necessary bits in this patch I'm sure we can reach merge readiness much sooner. Which will in turn unblock merging of rest of so called "auto-collect" patches.

Patch Set 22:

QUIET. 
Is required as cbcollect_info it pretty noise and we communicate via STDOUT.
I can look at do this in a way that requires less code changes if you prefer.

SIGINT
This is how Erlang kills cbcollect_info when a user hits cancel on the GUI.

As for the upload as a function. Having it as a part of the Task class seems to me to be keeping inline with the rest of the code for example the zip function. I will look at moving that too.

Patch Set 22:

Regarding SIGINT: I'm seeing shutdown "command" being sent but definitely not sigint. Also on windows it wouldn't work anyways.

Patch Set 22:

In what way will it not be supported on Windows? Windows does have SIGINT. 

The shutdown "command" sends a SIGINT to the main thread.

Patch Set 22:

ok. Re-visited StdinReader. Why not just exit there ?

windows does _not_ have sigint or signals. It's emulated by it's C runtime library for programs using C runtime. And there's some special binding between Ctrl-Break handler and SIGINT that's also made in C runtime. But this shit only works if there's console. It's possible that whatever API you use in StdinReader works in windows as well by raising sigint. But all of that just looks like a ton of unneeded complexity. Just do exit when stdin is closed _and_ if you're asked to behave in this way.

Depending how far through the cbcollect_info there might be some useful information to pass back i.e logs collected but cancelled during the upload. 

I will look into doing the SIGINT in more platform independent and less complexity way.

Patch Set 22:

Just keep in mind one thing. I want _radically_ simpler way. Drop everything except what's really, absolutely necessary.
