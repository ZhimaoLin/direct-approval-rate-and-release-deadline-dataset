DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using the requests library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

Patch Set 3:

Fixed the formatting and typo problems.

Add the code from mock-cbcollectinfo to handle the shutdown signal from STDIN.

Still need to look at the \n across all platforms.
