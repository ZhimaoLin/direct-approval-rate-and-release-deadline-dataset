DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using the requests library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

Line:707, cbcollect_info -> We need this to be the absolute path so in the REST API can show the full path for the user to grab the file - something like:

 os.path.abspath(artifact)
