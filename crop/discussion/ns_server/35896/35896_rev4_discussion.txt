DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using the requests library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

See inline.

Line:27, cbcollect_info -> Might be worth adding a brief docstring to this class.

Line:33, cbcollect_info -> Looks like you have a copy/paste error here - delete the trailing numbers.

Line:42, cbcollect_info -> Same here

Line:113, cbcollect_info -> Whitespace-only change - please revert

Line:564, cbcollect_info -> You probably want to register the signal handler as soon as possible, i.e. before any argument parsing to ensure you catch Ctrl-C being pressed as early as possible.

Line:670, cbcollect_info -> You'll never use the 'url' variable unless you are uploading, so I'd move this line down inside the upload part of the else below (line 677)
