DESCRIPTION

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using urllib2 from Python standard library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow Erlang to drive cbcollect_info.

Patch Set 27:

Addressed Alk's comments:

- Removed mmap() when uploading.
- Simplify stdin reader / closing:
 - just terminates when EOF is read (no "shutdown" command).
 - Only monitor stdin when run with --script.
- Simplify statis printing - don't try to be "smart" and tell how when the collection was cancelled.

Line:449, cbcollect_info -> might deadlock here because we're not reading stderr yet.

Will amputate myself

Line:643, cbcollect_info -> will amputate this myself

Line:745, cbcollect_info -> will amputate this. Belongs to separate commit if needed at all

Line:643, cbcollect_info -> I'm not sure what you mean here - if you want to remove the three fields being printed we will need to re-work all the Erlang and UI code which uses these.

Line:745, cbcollect_info -> Note that this is also what is called by thread.interruptMain() from the StdinReader class (it raises a keyboard interrupt). If you want to remove the output() call that's probably ok but we need to ensure that sys.exit() is still called.

(Note that raising thread.interruptMain() is the accepted best practice in shutting down a multithreaded Python program, so we only exit() from the main thread.
