DESCRIPTION

MB-10327 limit the number of moves simultaneously running on one node

before we limited only the number of real moves (Src =/= Dst) which
caused in some cases reaching the memcached limit on number of open
sockets by executing most of the replica-only moves at the same time

this commit doesn't introduce any additional testing for this fix,
just regression tests
