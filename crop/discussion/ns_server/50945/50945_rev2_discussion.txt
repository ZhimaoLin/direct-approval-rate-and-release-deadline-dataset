DESCRIPTION

MB-14594 Revert "Start up menelaus_sup as late as possible."

This reverts commit 4f6e743a353783ca4a1e5e8a8b06ab0cdbb0d0da.

Since many of the go components we start expect ns_server rest port to
be open by the time they are started. A better fix for this would
require significantly more changes.
