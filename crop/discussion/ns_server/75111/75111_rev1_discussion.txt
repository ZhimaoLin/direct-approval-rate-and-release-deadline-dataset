DESCRIPTION

Make xattr_enabled overridable by the memcached params

Simple change that consult the params before falling back
to checking whether the cluster is 5.0 or later in terms of
configuring XATTRs in memcached. Only exercisable via
diag/eval this gives us a way to disable XATTRs for users
who don't like the write latency / throughput reductions in
full-eviction DGM cases and are are not using XATTRs.
