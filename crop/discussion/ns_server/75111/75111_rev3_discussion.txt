DESCRIPTION

Make xattr_enabled overridable by the memcached params

Simple change that consult the params before falling back
to checking whether the cluster is 5.0 or later in terms of
configuring XATTRs in memcached. Only exercisable via
diag/eval this gives us a way to disable XATTRs for users
who don't like the write latency / throughput reductions in
full-eviction DGM cases and are are not using XATTRs.

You disable XATTRs as follows:

curl -X POST -u Administrator:password host:port/diag/eval xxx@xxx.xxx <<EOF
Current = ns_config:search(ns_config:get(), memcached, []),
ns_config:set(memcached,
              lists:keystore(xattr_enabled, 1,
                             Current, {xattr_enabled, false})).
EOF

And reenable as follows:

curl -X POST -u Administrator:password host:port/diag/eval xxx@xxx.xxx <<EOF
Current = ns_config:search(ns_config:get(), memcached, []),
ns_config:set(memcached, lists:keydelete(xattr_enabled, 1, Current)).
EOF

Patch Set 3:

The status is that I don't think it can be merged without a bunch of work to figure out how other components would react to 5.0 clusters with XATTRs disabled - and some testing to make sure what is supposed to happen actually does happen.

I will abandon.
