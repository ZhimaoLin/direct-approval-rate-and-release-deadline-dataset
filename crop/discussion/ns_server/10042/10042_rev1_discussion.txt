DESCRIPTION

Increase the persistence transaction size to 10000.

The current default transaction size 1000 was determined based
on Sqlite WAL mode. From performance tests on 2.0, we observed
that a larger transaction size produces much better persistence
throughput.

Note that this transaction size is ep_engine's engine parameter
and also can be changed at runtime.
