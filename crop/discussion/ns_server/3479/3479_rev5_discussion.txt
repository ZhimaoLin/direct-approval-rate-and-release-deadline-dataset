DESCRIPTION

made CallbackSlot#broadcast reentrant

The approach is to allow destructive updates of 'slaves' property only
when broadcasting counter is 0. We don't reset slaves array to empty
list at the beginning of broadcast, but instead we do extra pass over
it at the end of broadcast (only if broadcasting became zero) to clean
dead slaves.
