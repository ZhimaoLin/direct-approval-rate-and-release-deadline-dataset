Patch Set 1:

I noticed that auto_failover count is not automatically reset when auto failover is enabled or disabled. So it looks like this change might affect actual behavior, not just logging.

Please confirm that this is intended effect.

Patch Set 1:

Oh I missed it! Maybe that's the reason why the auto_failover reset API was unconditionally reseting the count earlier?

If the user disables auto-failover feature may be it makes sense to clear the count right? I tried going through the history, but I couldn't make out why it's been done the way it's today.
