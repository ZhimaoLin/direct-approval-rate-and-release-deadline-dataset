DESCRIPTION

[WIP]: ns_Harley Martinitor to look for unsafe nodes to failover.

The Harley Martinitor will try to determine if a node is unsafe or not
based on the vbucket states. Currently the lookout will begin
only if all the buckets are of type ephemeral. It then adds
these unsafe nodes into a list maintained by the auto-failover
liaison module which will be taken as probable failover
candidates by the auto-failover module. From an auto-failover
module's perspective if a node is in failover list maintained
by the liaison module then the auto-failover need not move the
node through all the stages of "half_down" state but instead can
directly move it to "nearly_down" state.

If these unsafe nodes are added into the liaison module's list
successfully then the ns_Harley Martinitor will refrain from bringing the
bucket online on these nodes. This is an attempt to prevent the
dataloss that will occur if we set the vbuckets' state as active
on these nodes because when the DCP replications are established
the replicas will lose data too.

Based on Poonam's initial proto-type:
