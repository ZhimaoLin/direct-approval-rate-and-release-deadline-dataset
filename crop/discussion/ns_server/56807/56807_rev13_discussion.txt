Line:192, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> I don't like the "as mnServersController" -- it's too much duplication. I think it should be written as "mnServersController as servers" (i.e. we should strip out the leading "mn" and the trailing "Controller". If you look at John Papa's and Todd Motto's examples they show this too (e.g. "CustomerController as customer" and "MainCtrl as main".)

Similarly below we should bind the controller / scope to serversListItemDetails (which is already pretty unweildy -- I would actually prefer if this was just serversItemDetails, but I think it's ok.)

Anyway, in general I'd like to apply the rule to drop the leading "mn" and the trailing "Controller".

Line:192, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> I believe it's not enough to use just word "servers". I think it should has postfix Scope (serversScope) or just (serversS), because it's very useful to have uniq name for the scope, so it can't be overridden and it can be easily found using Ctr+F in code editor

Line:192, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> Calling it "serversScope" is confusing, because it's not the scope. It's the controller instance which exists as an attribute on the $scope. "servers" as a name only has to be unique within this $scope -- which is just the mn_servers.html file -- there won't be any other controllers on the same $scope at all. I also don't buy the Ctrl-F argument. If you're looking for servers you can hit Ctrl-F " servers.".

Anyway, let's let the html tell us. Here's a sample of mn_servers.html. 
<a class="auto_failover_count_reset edit_btn when-roadmin-hide-me"
  ng-hide="mnServersController.mnPoolDefault.value.isROAdminCreds"
  ng-click=“mnServersController.mnServersState.resetAutoFailOverCount()"
  mn-spinner=“servers.mnServersState.resetQuotaLoading">
  <span>Reset Quota</span>
</a>

Do we want it to read like this?
    <a class="auto_failover_count_reset edit_btn when-roadmin-hide-me"
      ng-hide="servers.mnPoolDefault.value.isROAdminCreds"
      ng-click="servers.mnServersState.resetAutoFailOverCount()"
      mn-spinner="mnServersController.mnServersState.resetQuotaLoading">
      <span>Reset Quota</span>
    </a>

I like this. However, I can see that folks reading it may not see that "servers" refers to a controller. As an alternative I could live with:

    <a class="auto_failover_count_reset edit_btn when-roadmin-hide-me"
      ng-hide="serversCtl.mnPoolDefault.value.isROAdminCreds"
      ng-click="serversCtl.mnServersState.resetAutoFailOverCount()"
      mn-spinner="mnServersController.mnServersState.resetQuotaLoading">
      <span>Reset Quota</span>
    </a>

If the reader knows the pattern he will immediately know that "serversCtl" is the servers controller. If not, he can grep for serversCtl and find it in the "mnServersController as serversCtl".

Note that I actually like this too: "mnServersController as controller". This is pretty clear to me and would only be a problem if we have 2 controllers working on the same scope - which of course could happen. 

Thoughts?

Line:192, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> I'm agree with you and I like "mnServersController as controller" the good style is to avoid passing of the scope properties to another scope via scope, instead we should inject them as dependency, so theoretically we can use it. In that case we should create service for each controller that is needed for other controller and which still does not have the service.
