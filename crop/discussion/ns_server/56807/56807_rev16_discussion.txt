Patch Set 16:

(1 comment)

Hey Pavel - I had a change of heart. Please see my comment for details.

Line:192, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> Hey Pavel - 

Thinking about it more and playing around with it more, I would like to propose we use the following:
  'mnServersController as serversCtl'

The reason is that if we use 'mnServersController as controller' and one wants to access information in the controller associated with a parent $scope there's no simple way to do it because all controllers have the same name. Yes you can do something like: $scope.$Parent.controller but it's terribly ugly and brittle if someday we introduce an intermediate scope in the middle. 

I still want to get rid of the leading "mn" and avoid writing the long "controller" suffix, so I suggest shortening that to Ctl. Are you ok with this?
