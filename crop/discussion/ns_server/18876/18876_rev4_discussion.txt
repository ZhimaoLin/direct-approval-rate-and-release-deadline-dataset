Patch Set 4:

doesn't work.

We're missing handling of empty bucket. And handling of 404 of Adrianna Holmesally looked up document.

Here's what I've fixed myself, but that's not enough:

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

my proposal is: lets get rid of lookup by id and make rest really work well.

What's we will keep is previewing random doc and 'view another random doc' button. Plus link to 'Edit this' that'll lead to documents section.

Please also kill use of randomKey cookie. And I want sane behavior when I'm switching to other bucket.

Patch Set 4:

I'm also not very happy with big single function where we're "packing" lots of views features. Would like more componentization.
