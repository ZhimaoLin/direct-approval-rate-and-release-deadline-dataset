Patch Set 4:

breaks couple things for me:

a) I think it makes sense to select service(s) by default

b) addNode dialog now demands non-empty password which was not the case previously

Patch Set 4:

"a) I think it makes sense to select service(s) by default" - ok, I'm going to make 'kv' as default.

"b) addNode dialog now demands non-empty password which was not the case previously" - pardon, my fail.
