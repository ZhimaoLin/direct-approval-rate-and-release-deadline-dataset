Patch Set 6:

"b) addNode dialog now demands non-empty password which was not the case previously"

Actually addNode looks a little bit strange, we should provide password for node that doesn't have security configuration yet, and we should provide services for node which already configured. Better implementation of this could be separation of "add server dialog" on two steps.

first step contains:
  Server IP Address*:
  Server Group:

second step contains:
  in case added cluster configured:
    Username:
    Password:
  otherwise:
    Services:
