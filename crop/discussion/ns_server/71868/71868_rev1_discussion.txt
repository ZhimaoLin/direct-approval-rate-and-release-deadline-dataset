DESCRIPTION

MB-10409:[WIP] Helpers to choose b/w IPv4 & IPv6.

These are helper functions that can be used to:
[1] Pass in the appropriate value (IPv4 vs IPv6) while using the
    networking APIs.
[2] To pick the correct localhost and bind-all address
    representations.

NOTE: Currently the distinguishing factor is based upon the ENV
      variable that gets set when we pass the "ipv6" flag via
      the Erlang VM's command line. This method is just a place
      holder and will be changed to reflect the approach that we
      decide to take.

Patch Set 1:

One over-arching comment is that this is really a work-in-progress and hence not marked as "Verified". The way user enables the IPv6 mode is still in flux and needs discussion. But comments are welcome! :)
