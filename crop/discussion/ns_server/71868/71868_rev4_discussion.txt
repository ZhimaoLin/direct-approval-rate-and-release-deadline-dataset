DESCRIPTION

MB-10409:[WIP] Helpers to choose b/w IPv4 & IPv6.

These are helper functions that can be used to:
[1] Pass in the appropriate value (IPv4 vs IPv6) while using the
    networking APIs.
[2] To pick the correct localhost and bind-all address
    representations.

NOTE: Currently the distinguishing factor is based upon the value of
      the ENV variable "IPV6". If it's set to 1 then IPv6 is enabled
      and if not set then IPv4 is used. This method is just a place
      holder and will be changed to reflect the approach that we
      decide to take.
