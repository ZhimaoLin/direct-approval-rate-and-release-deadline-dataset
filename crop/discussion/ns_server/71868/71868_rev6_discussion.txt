DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Helpers to choose b/w IPv4 & IPv6.

These are helper functions that can be used to:
[1] Pass in the appropriate value (IPv4 vs IPv6) while using the
    networking APIs.
[2] To pick the correct localhost and bind-all address
    representations.

The distinguishing factor is based upon the value of the ENV
variable "IPV6". If it's set to 1 then IPv6 is enabled and if not
set then IPv4 is used.
