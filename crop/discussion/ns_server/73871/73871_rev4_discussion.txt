DESCRIPTION

POC purely ets based mru cache

the strategy:

 - group all items in the cache into two sets: recent items and stale
   items

 - when item is added, read or updated, it alwayss end up in the
   "recent" set

 - if on adding new item to the "recent" set we reach max capacity and
   have no stale items, we move all the items that were in the
   "recent" set prior to the operation to the "stale" set; the item
   that triggered this rearrangement is left in the "recent" set

 - all of this guarantees that whenever we need to evict, we always
   have at least one item in the "stale" set

 - we pick the victim according to what ets:first returns; for hash
   based ets tables it should be pretty random

the benefits over the lru:

 - requires less book keeping at the expense of a little less
   precision when a victim needs to be found for eviction

 - allows for more concurrency; access to recent items is independent
   for each key; only when a stale item is accessed or a new one
   added does a global housekeeping lock need to be acquired

 - flush is simpler

 - all ets tables used are hash tables

 - crash recovery is simpler (not implemented yet)

TODO: still needs to be benchmarked

I was going to tNathalie Landry to you about this today. It might be a total overkill for your use-case.
