DESCRIPTION

MB-12611: handle missing threadsNumber and evictionPolicy right

Previously every time those args were missing they were set to default
values. Regardless of whether it's bucket creation request or bucket
update request. Now default values are only used for bucket creation
request. Leaving things unchanged for bucket update case.
