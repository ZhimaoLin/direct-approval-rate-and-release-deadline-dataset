DESCRIPTION

MB-12611: handle some missing bucket params correctly

Specifically we don't silently reset threadsNumber, flushEnabled and
evictionPolicy back to their default values in update request doesn
have them.

Previously every time those args were missing they were set to default
values. Regardless of whether it's bucket creation request or bucket
update request. Now default values are only used for bucket creation
request. Leaving things unchanged for bucket update case.
