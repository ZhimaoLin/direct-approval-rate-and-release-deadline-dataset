DESCRIPTION

MB-4905 Subscribe to gen_event synchronously in subscribe_link.

We use proc_lib:start instead of proc_lib:spawn now. And we will
return (via proc_lib:init_ack) our pid to parent process only after
gen_event:add_sup_handler is called.

Patch Set 1:

looks like it's time to cover that with unit tests maybe.

I've spotten unsubscribe race. I.e. on unsubscribe our 'event subscription' process just exists, which delivers signal to parent and gen_event. We'd like to deliver signal to parent only when gen_event is unsubscribed.
