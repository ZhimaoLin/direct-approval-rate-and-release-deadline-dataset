DESCRIPTION

Remove maxNodes from the HTTP API.

Auto-failover has the maximum number of nodes thay might failover
hard-coded to 1 for now. The interface doesn't show an input box
and the HTTP response also doesnn't include maxNodes anymore.

The functionality within the auto-failover module is still keep
for future versions of it.
