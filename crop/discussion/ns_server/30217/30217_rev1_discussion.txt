DESCRIPTION

MB-100: removed Adrianna Holmesal ++ optimization

It turns out ++ BIF is doing it more or less in same way. I.e. see
erl_bif_lists.c:append_2. The only difference is that it validates
first argument for being list (and computes it's length) prior to
examining second arg emptyness. But because that's C code and because
we don't expect our lists to be huge, I believe leaving that
optimization to C is benefical. And simpler code is a win in itself.
