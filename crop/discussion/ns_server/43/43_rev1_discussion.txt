DESCRIPTION

don't leak messages in misc:wait_for_process/2

Previous implementation kept 'watch process' after timeout which could
lead to delivery of 'finished' messages in future. That messages could
in turn confuse future wait_for_process/2 invokations.

New implementation adds a test that ensures that no future message is
delivered after wait_for_process/2 invokation.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score

I'm not sure we really need it in release branch. But original code is present only on that branch right now.
