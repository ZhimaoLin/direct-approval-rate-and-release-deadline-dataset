DESCRIPTION

CBD-315: Consolidate CouchDB replicator with XDCR code (commit 2)

This is the second commit of CBD-315 that would migrate functions
in module couch_replication_manager used by XDCR to a new module
xdc_rep_manager_helper. The entry functions are 1) change_feed_loop;
2) db_update_notifier; 3) update_rep_doc; 4) maybe_tag_rep_doc.

A few things can be simplified, as there's Apache CouchDB specific functionality we don't care about. Looks good anyway.

Line:109, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> This comment seems wrong.
Why is a rep_db_created message sent when a replication doc is updated?

And btw, detecting _replicator database recreates/changes is not supported in Couchbase Server (neither is it supposed to I think). Legacy stuff from Apache CouchDB, you can remove all code that deals with replicator database recreation.

Line:129, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> function name is already more than obvious about what it does :)

Line:139, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> With our new file format/update logic. I don't think we throw conflicts anymore.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Some comments, can be addressed later.

Line:109, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> Agree, this _should_ be dead code.

Line:129, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> agree

Line:139, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> Agree, but we want to change as little about the structure of the code for now. We want to migrate and verify all still works, then do more significant refactoring once done.

Line:109, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> Right, when I wrote this comment in code refactoring, I also felt  confused about the behavior of this function. I tNathalie Landryed to Damien that there is some room to improve the code quality. I think we need another small commit to polish all XDCR code and address your comment. I will create a task for that. Thanks.

Line:139, src/xdc_rep_manager_helper.erl -> Yes, at this time, I think the most important thing is to make sure we do not break anything in ns_server and XDCR works as before. 

After we stablize the code, we will further polish the code.
