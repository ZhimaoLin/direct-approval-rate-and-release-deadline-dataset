Patch Set 3: No score

tried this. Because server stats are updated with poolDetails updates they can be pretty out-of-date. Even clicking 'Server Nodes' link again doesn't refresh them.

Looks like we really need separate URL for bulk server stats, that'll be auto-refreshed reasonably often when user is looking at monitor servers page.
