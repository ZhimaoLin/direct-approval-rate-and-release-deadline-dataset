Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Comments inline.

Line:103, priv/public/index.html -> Class needs to be "node_name" as it's used in the link disabling code in monitor-servers.js. Alter whichever piece of code you feel is best to change (keep in mind there might be other links down the road).

Also, if you change monitor-servers.js, you may also want to drop the empty class="" as it's just extra bytes on the wire. :)
