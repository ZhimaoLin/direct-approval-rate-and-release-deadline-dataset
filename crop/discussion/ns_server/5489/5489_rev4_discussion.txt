Patch Set 4:

I set the monitor_server screen to update quicker

I really dont think an extra http request is worth it here, its a small amount of extra information and our data model in the client is already complicated enough.

we should be looking to move to a publish / subscribe model over comet asap, in the meantime the simpler the change the better.
