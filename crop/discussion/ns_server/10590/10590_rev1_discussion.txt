DESCRIPTION

Do not allow couchdb to change its log level.

We want to control all the log levels in one place (currently this is
done via static_config) so we don't let couchdb to override it by its
own value.

Not sure I understand the purpose. What's wrong with being able to control couch log level with it's own config magic ?

Patch Set 1:

Currently we set certain log level for a couch logger. But then it gets overwritten by couchdb. This can be tackled in other way. But it would require treating couch logger in a special way (I mean that we would need to read and set required log level somewhere in cb_config_couch_sync).

Patch Set 1:

How about just setting required log level via couch ini file ? Like in capi.ini in case we want to override default?
