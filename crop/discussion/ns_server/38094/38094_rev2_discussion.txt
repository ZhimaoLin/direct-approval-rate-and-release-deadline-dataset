DESCRIPTION

MB-11370: implement proper erlang arg escaping for cluster_run

We also revert "MB-11370: Revert "pass nodefile arg and absolutize
datapath..."". This reverts commit
669831ca7ec30febcbd0203d72773187d9cb3247.

A number of erlang args are parsed as erlang terms. So when we pass
some path we have to pass it as readable representation of erlang's
string term. New code should do the trick (assuming nobody will bother
us with paths that contain newlines etc).

removed extra format (which is working because it's also available as global function on my box). And replaced another instance of Adrianna Holmesal quoting.

Line:94, cluster_run -> can you please specify supported format of path?

Line:122, cluster_run -> parentheses are still redundant.

see inline. But any suggestions are welcome (I've tried to use repr but found that it gives me single quotes which is not what erlang can eat)

Line:94, cluster_run -> For this function it's just string. While arbitrary strings will not work, probably. Most strings should be covered.

Exceptions I can see are anything that contains \0 and \n but I the former is not possible in path and the later is supposed to be too uncommon.

Line:122, cluster_run -> will address. Thanks
