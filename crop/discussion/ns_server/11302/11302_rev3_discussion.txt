Patch Set 3:

Steve, I think it'll mis-handle release versions like 1.8.0-enterprise.

Good news is that it's easy to unit-test such standalone and deterministic pieces. See priv/js-unit-tests subdirectory. This (version parsing and prettyficiation) seems to be perfectly unit-testable feature.

Patch Set 3:

by the way, policy change since 1.7.2... we're no longer tagging our "gold" bits and doing that "final" rebuild.  So, we shipped 1.7.2r-23-ghashhash.

So, unless we should never see a "1.8.0-enterprise" as input.
