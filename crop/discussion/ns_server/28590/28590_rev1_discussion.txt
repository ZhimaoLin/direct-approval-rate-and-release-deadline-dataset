DESCRIPTION

MB-6108 change aggregate method for view ops stats

from sum to max.
Reason: Each view query hits all nodes.
Thus adding view hits from all nodes multiplies
query rate by times number of nodes if sum is
used to aggregate values between nodes.

Performance impact:

I measured performance of menelaus_stats:merge_all_samples_normally for 100 nodes (faked). Collected average of last 100 calls after ListOfLists stabilized on 60 samples.

I see approximately 8% performance degradation on this method from ~10200 to ~11000 microseconds.

Line:771, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> lets discuss this on monday but I think we can definitely make this hot-path piece more efficient.
