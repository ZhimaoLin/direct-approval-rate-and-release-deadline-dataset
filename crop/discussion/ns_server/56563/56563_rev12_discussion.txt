Patch Set 12:

I thought that we are going to use selenium for e2e tests and to catch style regressions via screenshots comparison. If you want to use casperJS + resembleJS for comparison only, then I have to make revision of existing tests.

There are couple of tools for selenium like https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith and imagemagick.

Patch Set 12:

I think better to use one tool for e2e and for css regression tests. So we should decide, we want to use selenium or phantomJS?
