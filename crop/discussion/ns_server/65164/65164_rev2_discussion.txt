DESCRIPTION

Change nodes used in is_deleted_on_all_nodes

Use ns_cluster_membership:get_service_map instead of the
servers list in the bucket config. If the delete takes a
long time on one node, and a node is removed from the cluster
during the server list is not updated by the rebalance since
the bucket is marked as deleted. So is_deleted_on_all_nodes
would wait forever for the deleted node.
