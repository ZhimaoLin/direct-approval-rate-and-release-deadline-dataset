DESCRIPTION

Restart mnesia if we detect a rejoined partitioned network.

This works as long as inconsistency-causing changes haven't been made
on the nodes. There seem to be some cases where Mnesia can be up and
running on two nodes without my getting an event, which warrants
further investigation.
