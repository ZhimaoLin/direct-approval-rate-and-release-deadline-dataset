Patch Set 1:

But then how would it work with 'tree' implementation ?

Your previous implementation was fold (order indepent) now it's foldl.

Patch Set 1:

l/r will only be in effect at the leaf nodes, when the accumulator is actually used, otherwise the caller should not rely on the computation further up the tree happening in any particular order;
But yes, right now, passing a node up from the leaf would be F(Acc, Val), I'm not sure its important to offer the reverse.

The caller should use the version with no initial value if possible, it'll be easier to reason about/follow.
