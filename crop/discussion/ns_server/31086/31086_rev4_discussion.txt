DESCRIPTION

MB-9663: consume src_db_update msg when rep is in init

Due to an earlier change, a vb replicator may receive a src_db
_update msg when it is still in initialization. But vb replicator
does not know handle it, leading to vb replicator crashing at the
function_clause error. This commit adds the handle function, which
basically does nothing but consuming the msg, because replicator
will send itself a src_db_update msg after init is over to check
if any update to replicate.
