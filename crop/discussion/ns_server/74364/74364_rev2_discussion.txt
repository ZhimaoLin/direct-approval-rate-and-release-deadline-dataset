DESCRIPTION

Invalidate dead lock holders.

We don't expect that to happen, but it's possible if a process get
killed in an unfortunate moment.

Otherwise, if such thing happens, the tables end up in unknown but
consistent state.

A note on testing. It proved to be harder than I expected to write an
automated test for this without deliberately introducing delays in the
code. For that reason there are no automated tests as of now, but I
did test it locally with those delays. I might revisit this later.
