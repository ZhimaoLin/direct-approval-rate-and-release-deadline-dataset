Line:416, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> XDCR cares (CAS, exptime, flag) as well as SeqNo. The second part is used to break the tie when SeqNos are equal. The comments here need to be fixed.

Line:416, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> Can you point me to _any_ evidence XDCR (erlang part) cares about way RevId is formed from CAS, expiration and flags. My information is based on thorough examination of code, git history and memory of both me and Aliaksey (how authored xxx-with-meta in ns_server). And my information XDCR does not care.

Line:416, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> We use tuple (Seqno, CAS, exptime, flags) to pick up the winner. Is that the right? Seqno itself is certainly not enough. What do you mean "XDCR does not care about (CAS, exptime, flag)"?

Apparently we're speaking different language here.

Line:416, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> I agree with what is stated in the comment. It states that xdcr should not care about the meaning of revision id (cas, exptime and flags in our case). And as far as I know this is true.

Line:416, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> Caring about the meaning of (CAS, exptime, flags) and caring about them are totally different. These comment basically means you do not need them at all. which is wrong. 

Yes, we do not care about the meaning  (CAS, exptime, flags). Please do not forget we do not care about the meaning of Seqno either. They are treated similarly.

Patch Set 4:

What I'm trying to say is that couch deals with {RevNum, RevId}. RevId is just 128 bit binary. All existing capi code is treating them as opaque. They are not ignored, but what constitutes RevId is irrelevant (as of now) for CAPI code.

The only place in ns_server that needs to understand that RevId is concatenation of cas, expiration and flags is implementation of update_with_rev.

If we account for our entire stack only other place that knows what RevId is, is seemingly couchstore integration code in ep-engine.

If my comment doesn't express this clearly, please suggest different wording.

Patch Set 4: No score

IMHO, you comment is totally fine before "But note that". 

After "But note that", my feeling is it is misleading and bit too personal.
