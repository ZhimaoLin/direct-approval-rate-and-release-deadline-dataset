Patch Set 4:

Looks pretty good. One issue: when I ran the following curl on one of my nodes I didn't see the node go red or orange once it was down. I did see the "don't have desired # of replicas" warning though so there is some update coming through to the page. 

I'm going to submit this as I think it's minor enough that you can fix post submission.
