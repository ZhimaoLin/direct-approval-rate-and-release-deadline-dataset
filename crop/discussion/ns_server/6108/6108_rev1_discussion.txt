DESCRIPTION

implemented robust misc:parallel_map

Next commit will replace misc:pmap with that new function. The problem
with pmap is that it leaves intermediate process alive if timeout
hits.

Another aspect of misc:parallel_map is that it carefully handles case
of calling processes being killed. And as pmap it makes sure no
messages are left in calling process mailbox.

Line:65, src/misc.erl -> Could the erlang:monitor() call fail?  Under race conditions?

Do we need to call demonitor() to cleanup?  Or (please please) do we get cleanup for free from erlang?

Line:65, src/misc.erl -> docs say that it's possible to monitor dead process. And it should be one shot. After DOWN messages is sent, it should be GC'able. Also I believe it should be cleaned up automagically if intermediate process dies.
