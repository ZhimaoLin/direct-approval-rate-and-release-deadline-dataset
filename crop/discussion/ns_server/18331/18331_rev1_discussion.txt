DESCRIPTION

MB-5877 Don't leave hanging ns_port_server processes.

ns_port_server traps exits and it's cushioned by
supervisor_cushion. This means that if ns_port_server hangs somewhere
in terminate function, it won't be killed by supervisor even after
timeout specified in the child spec exceeded. Only EXIT message from
supervisor_cushion will be delivered to it but it won't be handled. To
avoid such situations from now supervisor_cushion processes must be
started with timeout of infinity. But supervisor_cushion:start_link
now has additional parameter specifying how long to wait for sane
termination of the cushioned process.
