Line:1, deps/gocode/src/gosecrets/gosecrets.go -> Would be nice to have cli mode for simpler testing.

Line:114, deps/ns_babysitter/src/encryption_service.erl -> What is the purpose of intermediate process?

Line:119, deps/ns_babysitter/src/encryption_service.erl -> You don't use exit_status anywhere.

Line:120, deps/ns_babysitter/src/encryption_service.erl -> Better to use proc_lib:start_link and proc_lib:init_ack.

Line:168, deps/ns_babysitter/src/encryption_service.erl -> I'd much rather prefer something human readable, like json-rpc.
