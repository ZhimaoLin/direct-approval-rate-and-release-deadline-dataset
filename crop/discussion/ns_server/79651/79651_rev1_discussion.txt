DESCRIPTION

Fail CRUD API if value is not specified.

Currently if the document value is not passed in we update the
document contents as empty in memcached. The fix is to fail the
request if 'value' field is not set.

Can you explain why do we need this change?

With the initial change, it's possible for the user to unknowingly erase the contents of a document if he/she forgets to specify the 'value' parameter. The current patch is to error out the API if the 'value' parameter is not specified.

Maybe I should change the error message to indicate that the 'value' is a required parameter?

Line:224, src/menelaus_web_crud.erl -> OK. Will change!
