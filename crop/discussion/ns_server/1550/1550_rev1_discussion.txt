DESCRIPTION

Don't use RPC for ns_tick.

I'd wanted a function that would do the notifications in parallel, but
then I realized that gen_event:notify is asynchronous anyway, so
they're always essentially parallel.

Line:70, src/ns_tick.erl -> most likely needs to be {tick, Now} instead of just tick.

It breaks stats right now
