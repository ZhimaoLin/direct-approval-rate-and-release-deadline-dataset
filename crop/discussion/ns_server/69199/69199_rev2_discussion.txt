DESCRIPTION

REST API for resetting admin password

doesn't require auth, but works only from local machine

this api is going to be wrapped into the CLI command which will
be a replacement for cbreset_password script

examples:

password supplied:
curl -v -d "password=asdasd" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9000/controller/resetAdminPassword

password randomly generated:
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9000/controller/resetAdminPassword?generate=1

if succesfull the api returns:
{"password":"asdasd"}

Patch Set 2:

One thing about this change (and the one that allowed getting memcached password for cbcollect_info purposes). It used to be the case, that one either had to be root or in couchbase group either to run cbcollect_info or to reset admin password. Now, anybody who has any account on the machine can do both things. I'm not sure if this is desirable.

Patch Set 2:

I'm actually quite confident that it's undesirable. We probably will need to hide the api for the memcached password behind the admin auth. And we'll have to ask for the password in cbcollect_info.

With the cbreset_password, it's not that easy though. And if we don't find an easy and simple (because of 4.6 schedule) way of dealing with this, we might have to keep cookie unencrypted for now.

Patch Set 2:

We can use master password for authenticating local api's. What do you think?

But most people won't even be using it. And it needs to work in community edition too.

Patch Set 2:

True. We can generate temporary auth token and add it to dump_guts. Then use this token to authenticate local api's. Token either one time use or with short expiration time.

Patch Set 2:

Yeah, that would work. It doesn't even have to be one-time. But it's up to you.
