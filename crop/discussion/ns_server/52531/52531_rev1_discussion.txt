Patch Set 1:

Unfortunately the fix for moxi is going to be more complicated. In 3.x moxi spec is taken from ns_config (see ns_config_default). So it needs to be changed there. And in addition, care should be taken to upgrade config during offline upgrade. I can do this change myself, but only after we get permission to have it in 3.1.0.

OK, didn't realise it involved config changes, sorry.  Probably not worth the effort/hassle if it's going to be complicated.
