DESCRIPTION

wip: NOT FOR CHECKIN add top nav pluggable ui sample

This sample plugs in to the top nav. In order to make
this work without extending the OOTB top nav width
it uses a hack that waits until the UI renders and
then dynmaically sets the width. Clearly we should
not actually do this in reality -- we'd just tNathalie Landry
Pavel and Rob into making the top nav wider.
