Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

.bucket_details styles should not in any way affect view style. there's some bigger badness.

Patch Set 1:

All of the form styling has been done under the bucket_details class

https://github.com/membase/ns_server/blob/master/priv/public/css/screen.css#L927

ben probably didnt want to generate a 100 line diff just to make the .bucket_details generic and just reused it.
