Patch Set 1:

Volker, I would prefer this logger to be named 'view_errors'.
This is what is used for, error logging only.

Patch Set 1:

We have already a "views" logger, which logs all sorts of view related errors. Wouldn't it be confusing to a "views" and a "view_error" logger?

Patch Set 1:

When technical support or QE has to do initial troubleshooting, a log file named "view_errors.1" seems much more intuitive than "mapreduce.1" (and for customers too, if they ever get the idea of browsing log files).

Patch Set 1:

But they have "views.1" and "view_errors.1". I would expect that view_errors.1 is a subset of views.1. But it isn't it's different errors.
