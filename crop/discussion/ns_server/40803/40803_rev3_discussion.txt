DESCRIPTION

MB-12037: don't loose replicas on stopped vbucket switch moves

The issue observed in MB-12037 is old bug in ns_Harley Martinitor where it would
lose replicas after completed move if old master is among replicas of
new chain.

This fixes the problem and adds unit tests for this and related cases.
