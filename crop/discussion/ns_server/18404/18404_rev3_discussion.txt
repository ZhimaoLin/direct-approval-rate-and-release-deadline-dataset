existent logging in XDCR.

-2-ing as my previous comment was apparently completely ignored

Line:193, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> can not allow that. See doc/logging-guidelines.txt

Patch Set 3:

The new loggings in xdc_rep_manager are not noisy. They are dumped only when source vbucket map changes (rebalance, failover at source), which is critical and today we do not have any information to capture that in XDCR logs. They are not something dumped over and over even no replication happens. 


For other loggings in replicator and replicator workers, actually they reduce the log body size instead of increase it.

Patch Set 3:

this information is present in normal debug logs. Your code is logging _every_ bucket config when anything is changing.

That is too noisy and too redundant.
