DESCRIPTION

MB-26187 Setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

After updgrading v8 to 5.9 there are additional libraries
required by mapreduce_nif.so at runtime. Following the
conventions established in install/bin/couchbase-server,
we setup the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable on Linux machines,
allowing the server to spawn successfully.
