DESCRIPTION

MB-5323: increased ebucketmigrator connection timeout

Because I see no good reason why it needs to be as low as 5 seconds
(even though it's huge by machine's terms). We've seen some
virtualization environments causing even greater latencies. Plus under
heavy IO load page faults can sometimes cause comparable latencies
even under "proper" hardware.
