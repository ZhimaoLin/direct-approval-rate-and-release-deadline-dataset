DESCRIPTION

explicitly consume poor man's alerts. MB-5275

There's now separate POST url to clean currently visible alerts (with
cas-like token, so that no alert messages can be lost). That url is
advertised via alertsSilenceURL attribute of pool details.

This also makes few obvious cleanups in alerts service. Like getting
rid of default handle_call implementation.
