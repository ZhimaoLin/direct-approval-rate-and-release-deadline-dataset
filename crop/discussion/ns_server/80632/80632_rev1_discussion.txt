DESCRIPTION

MB-25088: Auto-failover to not interrupt rebalance...

...when delta recovery is in progress.

With the "auto-failover aborting rebalance" change, we ran into a
problem wherein when a node is being rebalanced in with delta
recovery, the bucket warm-up on the node being delta-recovered can
take a long time. So if the auto-failover timeout is set to a low
value then the auto-failover logic will decide to failover the very
node that is being delta-recovered leading to the rebalance to be
aborted.

The fix is to disallow auto-failover to abort rebalance operation
when delta recovery is in progress.
