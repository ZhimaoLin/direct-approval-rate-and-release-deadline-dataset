DESCRIPTION

MB-25088: Auto-failover to not interrupt rebalance...

...when delta recovery is in progress.

With the "auto-failover aborting rebalance" change, we ran into a
problem wherein when a node is being rebalanced in with delta
recovery, the bucket warm-up on the node being delta-recovered can
take a long time. So if the auto-failover timeout is set to a low
value then the auto-failover logic will decide to failover the very
node that is being delta-recovered leading to the rebalance to be
aborted.

The fix is to disallow auto-failover to abort rebalance operation
when delta recovery is in progress.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

The fact that delta recovery triggers auto-failover logic is purely implementation detail. I don't see why the user should be bothered by this. I believe that the right way to approach this would be to somehow prevent auto failover from being triggered in the first place. I don't know how feasible it is given the time constraints. In that case I'd say we should revert the original patch that changed autofailover behavior with respect to rebalance.
