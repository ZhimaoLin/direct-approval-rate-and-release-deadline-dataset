DESCRIPTION

fixed 404 handling on pool details

Previous implementation was creating fake value with special marker
and then reacting on it in observer-function. But fake value did not
work with replications section (that's expecting links to
replication-related URLs). So I decided to just produce undefined in
missingValueProducer while triggering application reloading.

This fixes UI crashes in replications when cluster is reinitialized
and pools details request returns 404.
