Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I find general idea of this commit and following servers.js commit good. But implementation is faulty.

Line:1298, priv/public/js/app.js -> processLink is event handler as can be seen here

Line:1284, priv/public/js/app.js -> enable will be event when called as event handler. So won't work.
