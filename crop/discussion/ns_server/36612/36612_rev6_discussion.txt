DESCRIPTION

Adapt xdcr to UPR protocol changes.

Protocol changes in a nutshell:

 - snapshot marker is sent at the beginning of a snapshot (not at the
   end) and carries sequence numbers of the snapshot's start and end

 - stream request command takes snapshot start and snapshot end
   sequence numbers and doesn't require high sequence number
