Patch Set 1:

The Mac-specific installation process copies the original static_config.in into the installer, and then has a script which runs on the user's machine to replace paths in there. This script depends on having separate DATA_PREFIX and BIN_PREFIX tokens, because the data is installed separately to the user's Library directory.

So, this change restores separate @BIN_PREFIX@ xxx@xxx.xxx tokens to static_config.in, and modifies the CMakeLists.txt to replace them both with the same value (for the normal non-Mac builds).

Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+1

I have verified that the installed etc/static_config on a Linux build is the same as it is without this change, so this should only affect the Mac build process.
