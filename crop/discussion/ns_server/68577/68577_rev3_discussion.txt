Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

I mostly looked at the values that get set for the conflict_resolution_type parameter and they look alright. I don't know the UI code so I would leave it to Mike for further review.

Patch Set 3:

I think you need to be sending the parameter timSynchronization=disabled or timSynchronization=enabledWithoutDrift.
