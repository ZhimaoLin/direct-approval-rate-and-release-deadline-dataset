DESCRIPTION

Leader election.

This starts mb_master_sup on the lowest-numbered candidate node that's
alive, broadcasting which node is the master to all nodes listed in
nodes_wanted. Processes wanting to tNathalie Landry to processes that run under
mb_master_sup should use mb_master:master_node() to determine which
node is the master, then send messages to a registered name on that
node.
