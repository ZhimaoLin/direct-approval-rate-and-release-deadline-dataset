DESCRIPTION

use gen_udp instead of gen_tcp for address changed alert testing

Hopefully it'll fix our rare false positives from this code caused by
some system limits.

gen_tcp:listen is doing full bind + listen and apperently is not
passing SO_REUSE_ADDR. That's our theory at least.

With UDP this is not needed and is much lighter. I.e. it's not
creating those TIME_WAIT tcp sockets.
