Patch Set 8:

why did you remove minFTSMemorySize property from just one place out of four:

./priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_memory_quota/mn_memory_quota_service.js:30:        minFTSMemorySize: 256,
./priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/step1/mn_wizard_step1_service.js:51:      minFTSMemorySize: 256,
./priv/public/ui/app.min.js:7612:      minFTSMemorySize: 256,
./priv/public/ui/app.min.js:11575:        minFTSMemorySize: 256,

Patch Set 8:

and if you do code cleanup that is unrelated to the commit, please do it in separate commit. otherwise it is quite difficult to review such commits
