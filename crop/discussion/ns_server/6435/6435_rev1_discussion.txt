DESCRIPTION

Rename sendStats config setting to send_stats.

For a more consistent code base, I renamed the settings->stats->sendStats
config key to send_stats. I think we should follow the rule:
Within the Erlang world, use underscores as separator, for the
outside world (JSON and POST parameters) use CamelCase.
