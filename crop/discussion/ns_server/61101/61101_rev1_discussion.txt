Patch Set 1:

Not sure we should do this. This is a very low-level knob. So people using it are supposed to know what they are doing. Besides, nobody will look for messages buried somewhere deep in our logs. On the other hand, if ssl endpoints just don't work, the problem will be noticed much sooner.

Patch Set 1:

no errors, ssl works. looks like "versions" parameter is ignored

Patch Set 1:

Yes it allows even SSLv3 in this case. Which silently weakens the security. So either this behavior or crash is needed.

Patch Set 1:

That's the corresponding snippet from ssl.erl:

    Versions = case handle_option(versions, Opts, []) of
		   [] ->
		       tls_record:supported_protocol_versions();
		   Vsns  ->
		       [tls_record:protocol_version(Vsn) || Vsn <- Vsns]
	       end,


I think that crash is better. But if you disagree, this change is also fine with me.

Patch Set 1:

crash kills ns_server completely making it difficult to correct the mistake. So I guess the warning is better. I assume that they will test ssl port after changing this parameter. So they will be aware that it didn't work.
