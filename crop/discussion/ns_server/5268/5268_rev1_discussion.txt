DESCRIPTION

implemented make install with new directory layout

We now have very simple configure script that accepts prefix. And we
expect membase binaries (memcached, moxi) in that prefix.

We also install ns_server into that prefix. Directory layout is
similar to couchdb. .beams go to
$(prefix)/lib/ns_server/erlang/lib/ns_server. Data goes to
$(prefix)/var/lib/membase. Static config files (like "init.sql") go to
$(prefix)/etc/membase
