DESCRIPTION

Check for passwords on REST bucket access

This uses menelaus_auth to determine if the REST request
has valid credentials.

I have tested with basic auth, not yet tested with cookies.
I'll wait for initial code review to see that the approach
seems reasonable, before I do more testing.
