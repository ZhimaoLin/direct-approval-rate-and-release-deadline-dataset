DESCRIPTION

Hide normal port terminations from user visible log correctly.

Since ale:info is not actually a function, but something that gets
transformed to an actual function call by ale_transform parse
transform, it's as smart as a parse transform is, which is not. So
it actually doesn't understand when logger name is passed through a
variable. ale:log is used instead which is smarter in this respect.

Also instead of using different logger, now I'm just adjusting
message's log level.
