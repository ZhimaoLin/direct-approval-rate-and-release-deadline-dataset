DESCRIPTION

MB-6284: bumped set_vbucket_state_timeout to infinity

Because we're using this call as part of rebalance which is explicitly
started and explicitly stopped. There's no need to have any timeouts.

Especially given that as part of this call we're doing state changes
for potentially lots and lots of indexes.
