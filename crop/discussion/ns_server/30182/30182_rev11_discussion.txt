DESCRIPTION

for toybuild, no review

-  aggressive erlang garbage collection: we will enforce erlang
garbage collection at two levels: global and within XDCR module;
-  avoid creation of new short-life process: today xmem_woker would create
a short-life process to send all docs to remote for each batch of docs. The
short life process will be killed right after all docs are sent. This commit
will send all docs in the same xmem worker process, thus sending and receiving
will be in the same process.
-  reduce message passing: today rep_worker process need to send docs
to xmem_server first and the xmem_server will pass all docs to xmem_worker.
There are two big messag passing which may cause some inefficiiency. This
commit will make rep_worker process send docs directly to xmem_worker
to flush to remote. Only one message passing.
-  dump memory usage traces

Patch Set 11:

1) I strongly suggest extracting get_worker stuff to separate commit. It's likely that part if change that improved throughput and is right thing to do.

2) What's your plan with that? Clearly, code in it's current form is not production ready. Please, share your opinion on what's next

Patch Set 11:

This commit is just for toybuild for verification purpose. 

Originally I plan to put all the stuff in one commit. Now given your feedback, here is the plan to separate it into multiple commits.

commit 1: enforce garbage collection to remove the increasing beam memory usage. only global gc will be enforced. 

commit 2: reduce message passing. make rep_worker tNathalie Landry to xmem_worker directly, (probably the "get_worker") stuff

May possible have commit 3: add some diagnosis traces

How does that sound to you, please comment since I will work that today.
