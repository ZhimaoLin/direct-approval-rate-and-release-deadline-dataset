DESCRIPTION

for toybuild, no review

-  aggressive erlang garbage collection: we will enforce erlang
garbage collection at two levels: global and within XDCR module;
-  avoid creation of new short-life process: today xmem_woker would create
a short-life process to send all docs to remote for each batch of docs. The
short life process will be killed right after all docs are sent. This commit
will send all docs in the same xmem worker process, thus sending and receiving
will be in the same process.
-  reduce message passing: today rep_worker process need to send docs
to xmem_server first and the xmem_server will pass all docs to xmem_worker.
There are two big messag passing which may cause some inefficiiency. This
commit will make rep_worker process send docs directly to xmem_worker
to flush to remote. Only one message passing.
-  dump memory usage traces
