DESCRIPTION

wait for babysitter node to become accessible during bringup

to prevent the following race:
  engage_cluster causes rename of the node
  net_kernel get's restarted
  bringup exits and engageCluster2 returns 200
  cluster calls completeJoin
  completeJoin handler calls babysitter node before its accessible

see MB-15088

Patch Set 1:

Unfortunately I still don't understand why we need something like that.

Regarding the patch. monitor_nodes is not one-shot. dist_manager will continue receiving spurious nodeup and nodedown messages.
