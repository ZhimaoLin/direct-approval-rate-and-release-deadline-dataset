Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2

I'm not going to merge this one. 

Reason is that we're not shipping CE in DP (DP will be a EE build) so CE issues don't need to be temporarily worked-around.

Separately, the rootCertificate page needs to show in both CE and in EE. In CE you won't ever see the CA cert stuff but you will need to be able to see your self-signed cert. I'll file a ticket on it and get Don on it, but I think it needs to be this way.

Patch Set 5:

I'm going to hold off merging this one for a bit. We need to branch for DP and then we can merge.
