DESCRIPTION

MB-22682 REST API to validate password against password policy

example:
curl -v -X POST --data "password=Asdasd1" http://127.0.0.1:9000/controller/validatePassword

it was made a separate API vs just using just_validate flag in
POST /controller/changePassword because changePassword requires auth
and validatePassword does not

UI will use it in setup wizard before cluster is initialized
