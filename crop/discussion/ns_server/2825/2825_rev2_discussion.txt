DESCRIPTION

bug 1998 - specify default bucket to gateway moxi cmd-line

This is so the gateway moxi behaves differently than the per-bucket
moxi's and can handle deletion of the "default" bucket correctly by
assigning connections to the NULL bucket.

This fix should go in conjunction with moxi fixes for bug 1998.
