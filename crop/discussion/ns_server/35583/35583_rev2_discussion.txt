DESCRIPTION

Disable deprecated type warnings.

Example of such a warning spewed by Erlang/OTP 17:

Warning: type queue/0 is deprecated and will be removed in OTP 18.0; use use queue:queue/0 or preferably queue:queue/1

And we can't just start using new types because this breaks
compilation on r14b04.
