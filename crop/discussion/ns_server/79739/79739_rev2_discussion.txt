DESCRIPTION

MB-24648: Fail node add when its already part of cluster.

Currently if a node is present in the nodes_wanted list and for some
reason its config gets deleted we allow the node to be re-added to
the cluster without doing a failover first. This causes data loss.
With this changeset we check first if the node is present in
nodes_wanted and add only if it doesn't already exist.

Patch Set 2:

the bug affects both master and 4.6.3. I wasn't sure what the procedure was to submit a change in this situation so I submitted it here. 
Could you please tell me the correct procedure to follow in this case?

Patch Set 2:

HI Amit - generally, we like to submit in the oldest branch first and then merge forward. I know you have issues on Sierra on 4.6.x. I suggest proposing the change on 4.6.2 and ask Ajit to verify for you (I think this has already happened actually.) Then folks can +2 and you can submit and merge forward to master.
