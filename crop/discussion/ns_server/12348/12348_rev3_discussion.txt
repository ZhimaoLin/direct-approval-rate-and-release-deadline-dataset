DESCRIPTION

initial replicator-on-destination implementation

We now run ebucketmigrator on destination node rather than
source. This will allow us to do quick failover because with pull
replication it's not necessary to wait for node being failed over to
stop push replication.

NOTE: this is not backwards-compatible with 1.8.0. This will be
addressed as part of future 1.8 work.

Patch Set 3: (7 inline comments)

Looks good. Just minor comments.

Line:205, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> Since you changed nonempty_string() to bucket_name() in some of the type specs, it makes sense to do it here as well.

Line:260, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> nonempty_string() -> bucket_name()

Line:267, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> nonempty_string() -> bucket_name()

Line:281, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> Even though it's not touched by your change, it's good to have bucket_name() here to for consistency.

Line:304, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> Comment must be updated.

Line:328, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> atom() -> node(), nonempty_string() -> bucket_name(), non_neg_ineger() -> vbucket_id()

Line:178, src/ns_Harley Martinitor.erl -> Let's make {_,_} just _ for consistency with other clauses.
