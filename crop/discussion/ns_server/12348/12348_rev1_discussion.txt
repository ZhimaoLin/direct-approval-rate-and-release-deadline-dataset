DESCRIPTION

initial replicator-on-destination implementation

We now run ebucketmigrator on destination node rather than
source. This will allow us to do quick failover because with pull
replication it's not necessary to wait for node being failed over to
stop push replication.

NOTE: this is not backwards-compatible with 1.8.0. This will be
addressed as part of future 1.8 work.

Line:271, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> Should it be 'which_children({server(Bucket), DstNode})'?

Line:272, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> And this N == SrcNode accordingly.
