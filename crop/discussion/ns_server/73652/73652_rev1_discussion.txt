Patch Set 1:

Since you make multiple updates to the dets table, the whole thing is clearly non-atomic. Are you planning to do anything about it, or did you chose to ignore this?

Patch Set 1:

I was trying to avoid a situation when administrator deletes somebody's account, and at the same time user changes his password and undoes the delete. Therefore I keep user info and auth under different keys. That can result in orphan auth records. Expectation is that the system should handle it gracefully. I expect that memcached will authenticate such user but will not grant any permissions. I will add check to ns_server, so that kind of user won't be able to authenticate.

Sorry, no need to add anything. This is already handled in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/73653/1/src/menelaus_users.erl
