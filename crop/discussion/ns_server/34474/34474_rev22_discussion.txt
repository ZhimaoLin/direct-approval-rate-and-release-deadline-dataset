Patch Set 22: Verified-1

tried to use on a server started by ./cluster_run -n 1
(not suppose to work)

After clicking "Collect" button I see the infinitely spinning spinner and the following stuff in logs:
Usage: cbcollect_info [options] output_file.zip

- Linux/Windows/OSX:
    cbcollect_info output_file.zip
    cbcollect_info -v output_file.zip

cbcollect_info: error: no such option: --script
xxx@xxx.xxx [{<<"status">>,<<"failed">>},
                      {<<"details">>,
                       <<"cbcollect_info exited without outputting a status. Exit value 2">>}]} from <0.1112.0>


Expect to see some kind of error message instead.

One more complain:

When I stop memcached on the node the health indicator eventually turns yellow (Pend) in "Server Nodes" tab. But in "Collect Information" tab it stays green until you leave the tab and enter again.

Patch Set 22:

Looks like if the first node in the list is unreachable, then we will see infinite spinner instead of the error message
