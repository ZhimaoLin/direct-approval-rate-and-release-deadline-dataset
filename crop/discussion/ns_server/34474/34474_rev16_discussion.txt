Patch Set 16:

- "Cancel Collection" button - I think this should be red (in line with other "serious" actions in the UI, and/or have a confirmation dialog - it would be frustrating for a user to accidentally hit this if they had been waiting for 30 mins to collect on a large cluster

- "Show / Hide Result" - Now I've seen this in action, considering that "collect logs" has it's own section in the UI I'm not convinced that we even need this - I'd be tempted to just always show the details and keep the UI simple.

- General: Don’t know if you can do anything about this, but when i press “Collect” and I have errors (e.g. customer missing) the UI “flashes” with “Loading…” for a split second before showing the error, under Safari 7.0.2; OS X 10.9.2

Patch Set 16:

This is really looking good - I think it'll be a huge boost for the performance team.  Some tweaks I think need making:

(i) (Major) +1 to DaveR's comment for the "Hide / Show Details". I would remove the button and always show details. Hiding it doesn't provide any live indication stuff is happening. I think you always want to see the details.

(ii) (Major) The upload URL should be defaulted in the UI. Forcing customers to do a separate look-up of the upload URL is counter-productive to this whole piece of work.

(iii) (Minor) The error message (e.g. if you select an incorrect host) is overly verbose. The portion containing the simple "Could not connect, please check server credentials" is sufficient.

(iv) (Very Minor) When I first clicked "upload" it would be nice to somewhere present the credentials I provided. Otherwise there is no way to check the scenario where I say "crap, I think I made a typo in the URL" until at least one log is attempted to be uploaded. Comment (ii) would help here however.

Cheers,
DH
