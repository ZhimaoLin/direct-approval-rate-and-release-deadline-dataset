Patch Set 4:

All looks good so far. If you haven't already it should be possible to test out the REST API calls from http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/34474/- they currently should accept and validate the POST request to start a collection (but not yet do anything with the request), and the GET will return some dummy data in the right format.
