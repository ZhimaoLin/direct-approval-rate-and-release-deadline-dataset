Patch Set 14:

Hi Pavel,

Looks good - I think in general your new layout is better than the popup. Few comments:

1. "Collect" button - I think that should be disabled as soon as the user clicks it, as there is a short (~1s) delay before it changes to the in progress screen, and users might be tempted to double-click if there isn't immediate responsiveness.

2.  Perhaps rename the "Start New" button to "Start New Collection", to be a bit more explicit about what it does.

3. "Details" button on results - I think having this button in the same place as the "Log/Collect Information" radio implies that it's some other screen. I think it would be better and more obvious that it's expanding the details on by my using a "twizzle" icon similar to the one on the server / bucket panes - e.g. http://localhost:9000/index.html#sec=servers&logsTabs=1&openedServers=n_0%40127.0.0.1

4. Collect (no upload) mode: The working for the result is missing the node name the logs reside on. Also the description is misleading - they are not URLs, they are paths:

<quote>
Collection in progres...
Logs were successfully collected to the following URLs:
xxx@xxx.xxx
</quote>

5. Upload failures - similar to (4), when the upload fails the name of the node the file file is from needs to be shown - currently it isn't:

<quote>
Warning: The following logs were successfully collected but failed to upload. Please Adrianna Holmesally upload from the following locations:
xxx@xxx.xxx
xxx@xxx.xxx
xxx@xxx.xxx
</quote>

6.  In progress message - spelling mistake in "progres" - should be "progress" (double S).

7. As mentioned before, we should validate the user's parameters and highlight which fields are incorrect - currently for example if the upload host is missing there's no indication of why the logs don't collect.

Style: 
- Initial collect window: Maybe increase the width of the input boxes, particularly the host one - they seem a bit short.
- Status window: need some additional padding between the "Logs were successfully uploaded to the following URLs:" heading and the actual list.
- Status window: "Positive" results (Collected, Uploaded) should be green or similar, failures should be red.
