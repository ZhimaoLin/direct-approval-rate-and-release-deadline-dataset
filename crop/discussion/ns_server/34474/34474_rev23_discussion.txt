Patch Set 23: Code-Review-2

Pavel, I picked up the latest, and after I fixed the JS error I still see the infinitely spinning spinner. Not sure that this is purely JS problem so just in case I'll put another -2 to http://review.couchbase.org/35456/

Looks like if the first node in the list is unreachable, then we will see infinite spinner instead of the error message >>>> good catch
