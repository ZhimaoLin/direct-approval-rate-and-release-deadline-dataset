actual it's doesn't fails tests. Well, recent commits do fail tests anyway. But this commit when rebased into older master works.

Patch Set 1: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please get the tests working before we put this in the code base, or at least explain why you can't.

Line:25, src/dist_manager.erl -> Is it possible to start after ns_config, or perhaps just move this functionality into ns_config without relying on ns_config to have started.

Patch Set 1:

It seems I was misunderstood again. northscale/ns_server at github fails tests since yesterday. This commit doesn't introduce any failures.

Patch Set 1:

Regarding your comment.

cluster join procedure depends on dist_manager to be available during ns_cluster restarts. So we cannot simply move this functionality into ns_config.

It seems possible to pull ns_config out of ns_cluster and place it under top level supervisor. It doesn't seem to depend on anything ns_. And it only needs node's misc:node_name_short() which doesn't change during cluster joins.

But this is quite significant change and I need a 'go ahead' before doing it.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Let's just use this as-is for now; we can revisit the configuration issues later.
