DESCRIPTION

MB-8665: avoid computing bucket details twice for streaming case

We were already sending "stable" (i.e. without all crap and volatile
stats) output to streaming bucket details. But higher-level logic was
still to compute first stable version then "normal" (even though code
was ignoring it). We're now using special form of replying from
streaming function that makes handle_streaming facility just send back
stable output.
