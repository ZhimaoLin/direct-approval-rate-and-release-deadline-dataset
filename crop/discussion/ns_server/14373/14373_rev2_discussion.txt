DESCRIPTION

Handle noproc while monitoring couch replications

There is a small delay between when we spawn a new Couch replication
and when we start monitoring it. If there is nothing to replicate,
the Couch replication process may finish before we even start
monitoring it and we will get the noproc error. This change set adds
explicit handling for this case by considering such a replication as
"completed".

Patch Set 2:

If there's really no way monitor replicator right at the time of creation it really looks like design issue. Assumption that something is successful is quite bold.

+2-ing because to merge is better than not to merge

Why is it a design problem? When you start a gen_server, is there a way for it to return the PID and a monitor reference?
Afaik, you have to explicitly monitor the PID return by gen_server:start_link/3,4.

Also, there's an event used to signal termination of replications as well. Events have the form:

{finished, RepId, CheckpointHistory}
{error, RepId, Reason}
