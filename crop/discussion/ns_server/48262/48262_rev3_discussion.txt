DESCRIPTION

fix race in cluster_compat_mode:is_goxdcr_enabled

It's not possible to atomically update several keys in ets table.
So even though stop_xdcr and cluster_compat_version are updated
in a single transaction, they it's possible to see the state where
one is updated but not the other one.

This fix makes sure that goxdcr won't start if such race condition occur.
