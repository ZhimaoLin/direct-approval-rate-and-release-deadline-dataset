see couple of comments inline

Line:1, priv/public/angular/app/mn_wizard/step5/mn_wizard_step5_controller.js -> why did you add $state and mnPools here if they are not used anywhere in the code?

Line:1, priv/public/angular/app/mn_auth/mn_auth_controller.js -> mnPools and $state are also not used. what's the point to have them here?

Line:1, priv/public/angular/app/mn_auth/mn_auth_controller.js -> it will be used in future commit, Looks like I leave it here mistakenly during rebase.
