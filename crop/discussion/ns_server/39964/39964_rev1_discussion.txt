DESCRIPTION

[cells] distiguish null and undefined in cell's default equality

Otherwise transition from null to undefined or vice versa will not be
signalled to subscribers. In a number of places where we use null
we're defining special equality that deals with nulls. But with this
change there's no need for that anymore.
