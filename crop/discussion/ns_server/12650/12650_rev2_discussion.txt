Patch Set 2:

Where did you see that we want to compact an empty database? it might be an outcome but not the goal.
We want to keep compacting, optimizing to a heavily loaded systam rather then mostly idle one.
On heavily loaded system, every min we don't compact the disk size will grow. on idle one, it doesn't matter that we keep trying. having minimum of 1% will prevent that if it is so important.

Patch Set 2:

min file size is just wrong setting. It's minimal file size when compaction kicks in. And has nothing to do with ticket.

Patch Set 2:

yeh the second patch takes out the min_file_size, misunderstood the ticket (and the ticket seems to misunderstand the feature)

Patch Set 2:

So to make sure we are on the same page
The feature requires the ability to constantly compact an active system. if the system is ideal or very mildly used, meaning, very slow file growth, it will be fine to slow down compaction, but this is not what we are optimizing a high throughput system..

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

looking forward seeing other part. Namely making sure we don't sleep 60 seconds when we don't have to. And lowering lower bound to 0.
