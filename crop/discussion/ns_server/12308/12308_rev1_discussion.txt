DESCRIPTION

even better markup/styling for design doc name field

CSS spec says by overconstraining table width and width of columns,
width of columns will be corrected. In this case we ask too wide
second column, which desired effect of filling all space that's left
after label. Works consistently across Chrome 16, Firefox 9 and IE8.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I like this overall, but I'd prefer you un-line the styles and put them back into classes. Anytime we have a group of repeated inline styles, we should make classes. Inline-ing's fine for "one off" edge case tweaks, but when there's a clear repetition, having classes helps a bunch.

Thanks, Alk.

Patch Set 1:

please, uninline yourself. But please, please, _carefully_. And, please, with good enough class names (altoros CSS folks were bad here).
