DESCRIPTION

MB-9826: use new connection for remote cluster/bucket check

I.e. so that we can detect certificate mismatch.

Note that it does not prevent us from reusing previously established
connections for data traffic. But that's relatively fine and a
different problem anyways (i.e. solving it requires making sure _all
cluster nodes_ stopped using connections established using old
certificate).
