DESCRIPTION

Rename the node from the ns_cluster gen_fsm

On join, for some reason we're calling ns_cluster:change_my_address
twice simultaneously, which unsurprisingly causes problems. Made it so
the rename happens in the gen_fsm, and we ignore any subsequent
attempts to rename the node to the same address.
