MB-5307: disallow "after" remote master events to overtake local

I've see that some remote events that happen strictly after some local
event (i.e. stop replication on remote node versus start vbucket mover
on master) are observed before that local event, breaking causality
and making some analyzes harder.

This seemingly happens because any master event (even local) needs to
pass through it's node's "master event submitting" work queue before
getting into master events ingress queue on master node. And
apparently because master events are more frequent on master node,
some of them need more time to get to ingress queue. Allowing "after"
but "faster" remote events to overtake them.

The fix is to have ingress queue listener to double as master events
submitter. It'll check if it's node is master node and if it is it
will bypass extra queuing step (which will be to it's own queue
anyways). If it's not, it'll pass event to ingress queue on remote
master node.

So for any master event that will cause some remote event, it's now
seemingly impossible for remote event to overtake master node's event
that produced it. I.e. because master node's event is strictly prior
to remote event it will be queued before to it's ingress queue before
remote event. And thus will be fully processed before remote event.
