DESCRIPTION

Rename stable info level to streaming in menelaus_web_buckets.

The intention of the stable info level was not to include volatile
stuff like memory usage or stats into response. In
menelaus_web_buckets specifically it's actually used differently: some
of the things that are omitted are perfectly stable. So I renamed it
to match the use better.
