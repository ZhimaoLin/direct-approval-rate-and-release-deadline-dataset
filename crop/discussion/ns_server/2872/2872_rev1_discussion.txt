DESCRIPTION

Revert "made ns_config:get responsive by delegating it to replica process"

This reverts commit f48e77841afbac9307989b1ed1950220c82c0fe5.

This causes needless complexity and is a potential source of bugs. I'd
far rather reduce calls to ns_config and start moving stuff out.

Patch Set 1:

+2. The bug was that we (synchronously) replicate config _after_ we send ns_config_event notifications.
