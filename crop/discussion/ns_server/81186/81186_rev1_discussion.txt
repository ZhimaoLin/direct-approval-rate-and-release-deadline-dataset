DESCRIPTION

MB-24751: Consider active ephemeral buckets while...

...deleting unused db files.

ns_server tries to delete the unused (deleted) DB files by getting
a list of active buckets from the config and comparing that against
the list of bucktes found on disk. The buckets that are present on
disk but that are not active are deleted.

The problem here is that ephemeral buckets are not picked up as part
of the active bucket list and this makes DB files deletion logic to
think that ephemeral buckets are unused even though they are active.

The fix is to pick up the ephemeral buckets as part of the active
list.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

node_bucket_names_of_type() API is confusing. Since its says "name of type", it should technically take only "type" (membase/memcache) as the parameter and return all buckets of that type. The Mode should not be needed.

There should be another API say node_bucket_names_of_mode() which accepts the storage mode and returns buckets of particular mode.

In any case, this change looks good so +2.
