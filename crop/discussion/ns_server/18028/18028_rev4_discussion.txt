DESCRIPTION

WIP Update UI for new document and metadata separation.

Now the user edits only the document body, the metadata is
elsewhere, so there are no longer "special fields" like _id
and _rev in the document body.

This UI change also includes a new boilerplate map function
illustrating best practices.

Depends on this change to CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17590
