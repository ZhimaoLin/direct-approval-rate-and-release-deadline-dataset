DESCRIPTION

WIP Update UI for new document and metadata separation.

Now the user edits only the document body, the metadata is
elsewhere, so there are no longer "special fields" like _id
and _rev in the document body.

This UI change also includes a new boilerplate map function
illustrating best practices.

Depends on this change to CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17590

Line:1410, priv/public/js/views.js -> parseInt will turn 011 to 9 because of octal autodetection. Not sure we need it

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding but there seems to be issue with id encodings.

Line:1409, priv/public/js/views.js -> this seems to imply that json docs have utf8 keys and non-json do not. But code in couchdb commit tells me this is independent things. I'm confused

I think there is not an issue with id encodings -- your inline comment indicates values, not keys. I think the implementation is correct.

There are still rough edged in the UI I am working through, I'll remove WIP when that is done.

Line:1409, priv/public/js/views.js -> This is the document body, not the key. So if the doc body is a blob (say the user was storing ascii strings as values) we can use JavaScript built-in functions to decode it from the raw byte array.

In future releases we can use node.js Buffer engine to add native encoding handling for many popular encodings.

Line:1410, priv/public/js/views.js -> That's ok, you'll never have 011 as the result of an INCR or DECR. The point of this code is to illustrate to the end user how Couchbase map reduce can do powerful things with INCR and DECR.

To help debug issues like this, I've emitted the argument to parseInt as the row value. In this way, your case of "011" as the value would be visible to the user, and the difference between it and 9 would be detectable.
