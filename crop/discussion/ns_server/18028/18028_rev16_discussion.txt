DESCRIPTION

CBD-456 Update UI for new document and metadata separation.

Now the user edits only the document body, the metadata is
elsewhere, so there are no longer "special fields" like _id
and _rev in the document body.

Document REST PUT and GET expects just the JSON body as the HTTP body, so
all meta information (id, rev, etc) must be in path, query and
headers. However _bulk_docs POST uses the

    {"meta":{"id":"foo"},"json":{...}}

format.

This change also includes a new boilerplate map function
illustrating best practices. It is expected that the docs team
will review and potentially update this soon.

Depends on this change to CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17590

Also this change to GeoCouch: http://review.couchbase.org/18412

And these changes to testrunner: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17768
