Trond, our side is (near) ready too.

We'll definitely need some way to refresh certificate/pkey without restarting memcached. I.e. when node is renamed while actively serving clients.

Great. Let's add a command you can send that'll cause it to reload the certificates. I'll create such a command (right now they are read every time anyway so it'll just work out of the box ;-) )

Patch Set 1:

I updated the commit with a command you may send to memcached to force it to reread the certificate files. Currently it just returns since the certificates are read every time anyway, but at least you guys can start fixing that part internally and it'll just work once I fix the internals on my side.
