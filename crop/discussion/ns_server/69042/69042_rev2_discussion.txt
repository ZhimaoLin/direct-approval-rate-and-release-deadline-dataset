DESCRIPTION

[cbcollect_info] Spawn processes in new sessions on Unix systems.

Otherwise, if the spawned process spawns more processes, those
wouldn't get killed. And this, in turn, might break timeout logic if
any of these child processes keeps stdout open.

The windows behavior is unchanged, though I'm not sure if it's correct
or not.
