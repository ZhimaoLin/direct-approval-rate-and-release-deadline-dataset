DESCRIPTION

MB-25682 garbage collect rpc server on each node the diag was retrieved from

...so the big binary that is referenced by rpc server gets cleaned up.

apparently garbage collection is not automatically done to long lived
processes with a small heap, so if not explicetely garbage collected,
the rpc server process might keep the binary referenced for unlimited
amount of time.
