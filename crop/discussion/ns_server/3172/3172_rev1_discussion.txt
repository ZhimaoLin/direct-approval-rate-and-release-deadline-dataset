DESCRIPTION

don't block bucket_sup on ns_config_events subscription. Bug 2737

Diag for bug 2737 suggests that ns_bucket_sup has reached max restart
frequency on some of ns_memcached childs and during it's resurrection
by parent supervisor we're having ns_config_events doing update_childs
call which in turn calls supervisor process at the same time as init
function in that supervisor does call to ns_config_events making it a
classic deadlock. The fix is not to block on ns_config_events call.

it doesn't work because pubsub:subscribe call links with calling process which in this case is not correct process
