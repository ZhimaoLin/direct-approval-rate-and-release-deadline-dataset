DESCRIPTION

testing Makefile

to make working with a gen_cluster_scripts cluster easier,
so you can join and unjoin nodes faster than ever

  cd test && make prep
  ./cluster_run.sh

In another terminal...

  cd ns_server/test && make usual

That will initialze a brand new cluster with a default bucket,
with 4 nodes joined and rebalanced.
