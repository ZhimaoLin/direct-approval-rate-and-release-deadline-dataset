Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

Just a few minor issues...

Line:2334, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> lost the h() call here

Line:2335, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> need to go to MBytes

Line:2337, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> Need to swap out the 200GB with the total memory too.  I can do that in a separate commit.  Just remove it or comment it out for now.

Line:2363, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> same, need to go to MBytes
