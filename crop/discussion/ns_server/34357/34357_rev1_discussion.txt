see inline

Line:236, src/replication_manager.erl -> reverse is normally done inside loop function, not in caller.

I also tend to avoid extra GC pressure due to artificial packing/unpacking. In this case Tap and Upr are just two different args. And there's no need to always pack them in tuple

Line:231, src/replication_manager.erl -> Is this even reachable code ?
