DESCRIPTION

MB-22962: FTS: defaultMaxPartitionsPerPIndex now 171, so 6 pindexes

The default for the maxPartitionsPerPIndex will now be 171 instead of
32, which means the default number of FTS index partitions (pindexes),
if the user leaves it unspecified in their index definitions, will be
CEIL(num_vbuckets / 171).  With 1024 vbuckets, that's 6 pindexes.

From single node linux cluster perf experiments from Juliette Heath, 6
pindexes seems to provide the best performance tradeoffs
w.r.t. indexing performance versus query performance.

Users can still provide override behavior by specifying the
maxPartitionsPerPIndex explicitly on an per-index-definition level,
which could be useful to handle large cluster sizes.
