Line:62, src/query_settings_manager.erl -> I'm assuming you're asking me to refactor build_settings_json/1 and build_settings_json/2 into src/json_settings_manager.erl here?

I thought it was cleaner this way.
Since src/index_settings_manager.erl calls out to both build_settings_json/3 and build_settings_json/1 directly I kept build_settings_json/1 and build_Settings_json/2 local so that the difference between the calls was more obvious.
