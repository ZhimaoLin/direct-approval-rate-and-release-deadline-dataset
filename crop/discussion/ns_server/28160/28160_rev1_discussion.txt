DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Get rid of checkpointing mode.

What was discussed is just always using CAPI checkpointing. I believe
that having a code-path that will very likely never be used and tested
is not a good idea.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

It is better to keep both mode of checkpoint, by default we will use capi mode. In the case where capi checkpoint does not perform well, we still have an alternative to go back to.

We can probably remove the code after current checkpoint is replaced by UPR, but now we should not remove it.
