DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Get rid of checkpointing mode.

What was discussed is just always using CAPI checkpointing. I believe
that having a code-path that will very likely never be used and tested
is not a good idea.

Patch Set 2:

Let me remind you that you submitted the code that introduced this mode without giving anyone a chance to review it. And yes, in a mythical "CAPI checkpoints do not perform well" case we'll be able to revert to untested code-path. Not sure it's a good option. Or we can ask QE team to double their test matrix. Not sure it's a good option too.

Patch Set 2:

I strongly support Aliaksey here.

This "xmem checkpointing mode" is:

*) broken (will stop working soon)

*) slow (requires more than one wan round-trip)

It's of no use
