DESCRIPTION

Start couchdb from our root supervisor.

Previously, in case couchdb had failed for some reason server shutdown
would have taken infinite amount of time since memcached would have
waited for the possibility to sync bucket to disk before exiting. Now
couchdb will be restarted by root supervisor if it fails.
