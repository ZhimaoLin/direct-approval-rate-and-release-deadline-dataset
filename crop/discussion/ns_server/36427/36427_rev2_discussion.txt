Line:46, src/menelaus_sup.erl -> It's not necessarily actual software version. We're free to keep mb_master_advertised_version intact if new release doesn't require to take over mastership over old nodes. And if as far as I remember, we've already done that. I think you should use ns_info:version(ns_server) here.
