DESCRIPTION

Sync with ale upstream.

Highlights:

 - code compilation is synchronous (no need to call sync_changes)
 - no poor man's lazy evaluation
 - no check of sink's mailbox length; since currently sinks are
   synchronous there's no real need for this; and besides, this area
   is going change significantly
 - resurrected Makefile and rebar since I want to be able to build
   this outside couchbase-server
