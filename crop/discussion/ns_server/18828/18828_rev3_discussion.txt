DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Check bucket UUID when handling per-vbucket replications.

This is needed to prevent races when remote replication manager has
not yet retrieved updated vbucket map and tries to replicate (say) to
the bucket with the same name on a different cluster.

Bucket UUID is encoded in the URL as in the following example:

  xxx@xxx.xxx
