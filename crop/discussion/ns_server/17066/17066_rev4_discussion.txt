Patch Set 4: (4 inline comments)

promising.

In addition to inline comments, lets also consider making filter options configurable. I.e. spatial filter is going to have very different filter options.

Line:9, priv/public/js/filter.js -> no need for var Filter. We don't put space after function name and args list

Line:23, priv/public/js/filter.js -> lets just make a proper class for that instead of this hack

Or perhaps just go ahead and fix StringHashFragmentCell behavior

Line:199, priv/public/js/filter.js -> this needs to be parameterized. I.e. different filters should use different localStorage key.

Also we currently have bug where different buckets are using each other's filter history.

And on top of that filter history right now is a bit confusing for users. I.e. I create some design document with some name that I used in past and bams filter parameters are not default. Without any explanation that it's because of history.

So perhaps we can just drop this piece at least for now

Line:240, priv/public/js/filter.js -> please put new line here
