dir_size wouldn't work properly because it expects to find godu in ns_server priv directory.

Can you suggest how to fix this? I don't really understand Erlang, but I thought I had modified dir_size.erl to match the way similar other files worked. I guess mb_map.erl will have a similar problem with the vbmap executable?

godu will be compiled into ns_server/deps/gocode/bin, and then installed into <install_dir>/bin/priv. All the other go binaries will be compiled into ns_server/deps/gocode/bin as well, and installed into <install_dir>/bin. How should the various .erl files which depend on those executables be changed?

Patch Set 1:

Basically the way it works right now is as follows. When you use cluster_run godu should be in ns_server/priv/. When you use the package it should be in $PREFIX/lib/ns_server/erlang/lib/ns_server/priv.

And it's not actually the case for vbmap. It's always picked from $PREFIX/bin.

I guess you wouldn't want to replicate the same logic with godu? If it's the case, we can move it to $PREFIX/bin. But since it's not actually a binary that customers are supposed to run, I'd rather have these binaries in some other directory.

Does that mean you need to run "make install" for that Erlang code to work? I'm not sure if $PREFIX means "install directory" here.

It's currently being installed to (installdir)/priv/bin - would it be OK for the Erlang code to always expect to find it there too?
