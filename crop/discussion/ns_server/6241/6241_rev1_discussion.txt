DESCRIPTION

use #clear instead of #html('') to avoid $.data leaks

jquery 'data' facility is using central 'cache' with ids stored on
elements. When element is GC'ed nothing prevents jquery from keeping
it's data in $.cache.

In order to avoid leak we need to use empty() method that cleans data
of removed elements.
