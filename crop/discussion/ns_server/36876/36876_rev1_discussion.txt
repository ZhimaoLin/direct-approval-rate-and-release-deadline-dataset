DESCRIPTION

adjusted nofile rlimit message to stop mentioning limits.conf

Because we're settings limits as part of initscript and we don't
really need pam to set limits for us.

Line:55, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Might be out of scope for this change, but there are times when we increase the max number of open files allowed. It would be good if 10240 was set in a environment variable and that was used to set and check.

Line:63, couchbase-server.sh.in -> I would be tempted to remove the last sentence as it adds no benefit to the user.

Line:55, couchbase-server.sh.in -> No need IMO. It's "at least 10k" not "at least as much as you wanted".

Line:63, couchbase-server.sh.in -> It does add given that only real chance to see this message is to mess with the way our server is started
