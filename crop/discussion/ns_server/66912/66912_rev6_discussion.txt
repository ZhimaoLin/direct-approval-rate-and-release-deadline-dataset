Patch Set 6: Code-Review+2

Pavel: The error dialog looks pretty bad, can you fix up? (I.e. create a group that already exists.) You can do this in a subsequent checkin.

I don't really like the new groups page. Maybe the old one wasn't so great, but this doesn't seem to be any better. (This is a comment on the design, not on the implementation, which looks fine -- except for the error dialog.) Mike tells me we are planning to come back to this page and perhaps fold it into the main servers page. So let's track it and plan to come back to it. If we never do fold it into the main servers page, then we should revisit this page and see what we can do to improve it.
