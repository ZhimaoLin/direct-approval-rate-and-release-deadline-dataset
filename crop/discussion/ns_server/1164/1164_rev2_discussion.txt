Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

7200 seconds (two hours) is a bit too much. Isn't it ?

Patch Set 2:

The ep engine can take an arbitrary amount of time to flush data to disk, so any amount of time is potentially too *short*, not too long. Really, we should probably never send kill -9 to memcached; memcached just needs to not hang.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

two hours still looks a bit large, but ok.
