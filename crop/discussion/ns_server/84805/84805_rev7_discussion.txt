menelaus_web_... modules should be REST API implementation only.
I suggest to move get_failover_on_disk_issues, disable_extras and all other methods that are responsible for persisting new settings to config and getting them from config to auto_failover module. That will somewhat simplify "disable" call as well.

Line:104, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> It's a nitpick but I think this looks better:
menelaus_web_auto_failover:config_upgrade_to_vulcan(Config) ++
query_settings_manager:config_upgrade_to_vulcan().
