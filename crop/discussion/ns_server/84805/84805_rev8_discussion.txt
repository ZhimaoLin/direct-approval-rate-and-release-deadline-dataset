As part of changes for the server group failover, I  plan to add a new module called auto_failover_settings and move any non-REST API stuff from the menelaus-web-auto-failover to that new module. auto_failover module will also be revamped for server group failover. Your comments will get automatically handled as part of that.

I have updated the code with rest of your comments.
