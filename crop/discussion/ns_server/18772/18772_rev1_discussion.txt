DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: compare only RevNums in XDCR's missing_revs

As pointed out in comment below we can only compare RevNums
there.

Previously by using RevIds too it was possible to incorrectly return
false ("I don't need this revision") when in fact it was needed.

For example, lets assume remote 'meta' is {10, non-deleted,
SomethingSmall} and local 'meta' is {10, deleted, SomethingBig}. So we
want to prefer remote. But get_missing_revs can't be sure about that
due to missing deletedness. Correct answer is return true ("Please
send remote value and revision to me"), but previous implementation
would look at RevId and incorrectly conclude it's not needed.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hm. I guess we don't want this when rev is completely same, where we can assume value and deletedness is same too
