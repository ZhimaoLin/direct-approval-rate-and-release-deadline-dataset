DESCRIPTION

MB-19427: erl: changed the terminology for index storage mode

In this change:

1. changed the terminology in UI for index storage mode
   and index write mode
2. storageMode labels are displayed in a column
3. moved storageMode error container on top of labels.
   In fact we show the error only in cluster settings page
   therefore it looks better there.
4. circular Write Mode by default runs every night

I also reviewed the change since Dave asked me to take a look yesterday.

Will leave to Dave to review some of the ui files. Rest looks ok.

Line:2, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_storage_mode/mn_storage_mode.html -> Do not understand the purpose of "err-indexMemoryQuota" here.

Will leave it to Dave to review this file.

Line:120, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_auto_compaction_form/mn_auto_compaction_form.html -> Please add back the period at the end of the sentence.

UI code is good. No need for the period at the end of those sentences (actually they might look a little funny.)

Line:2, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_storage_mode/mn_storage_mode.html -> see point 3 in description to the change

Line:120, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_auto_compaction_form/mn_auto_compaction_form.html -> Are you sure that they should be here? For example Time Interval section doesn't have period.
