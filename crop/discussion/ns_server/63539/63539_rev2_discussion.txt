DESCRIPTION

MB-19427: erl: changed the terminology for index storage mode

In this change:

1. changed the terminology in UI for index storage mode
   and index write mode
2. storageMode labels are displayed in a column
3. moved storageMode error container on top of labels.
   In fact we show the error only in cluster settings page
   therefore it looks better there.
4. circular Write Mode by default runs every night
