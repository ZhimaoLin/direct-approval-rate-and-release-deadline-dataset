DESCRIPTION

MB-19706 Shutdown replica builders at the end of TAP moves.

Particularly, before on_move_done is called, because the latter
creates permanent replications. So if replica builders are still
running, there will be two connections replicating the same vbucket
into each replica: replica builder and regular replication.

Note, this doesn't ensure that TAP connection is gone on the
consumer (since there's no explicit close request in TAP world), but
it does ensure that all the mutations are acknowledged by the
consumer. Hopefully this is enough.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

I am not as familiar with TAP as I am with DCP. 
Also, going by David H's comment that the assert is caused by replica receiving "unexpected" mutations. In other words, there can still be more than one TAP connection to the replica, but as long as there are no new mutations coming from the replica builder, it should be OK. Is that correct?

Marking +2 based on my limited knowledge of TAP.  If Artem understands this code better then feel free to get his +2.
