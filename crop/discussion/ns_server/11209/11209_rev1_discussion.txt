Patch Set 1:

I don't understand why you're uploading new commits to gerrit instead of fixing your existing nack-ed commits. Nobody is really interested in that aspect of history. Don't bother with git wizardry this time. But next time, please don't do that.

If something is merged, we don't rewrite history. While stuff is in gerrit it's natural to rewrite/amend it.

I'm tired of arguing so if it works I'll merge and fix afterwards.

But generally _very_ very much against your formatting 'fixes'. Don't do it, please.

Also I see no good reason to build REST the way you're doing it. Rebalance alone is relatively occasional operation, but all sorts of tasks we run happen much more often. With autocompaction we'll have compaction going on quite often, apparently.

And finally, we need to stop doing things like build list of tasks only to check that it's empty or not. It's very inefficient. There are few performance critical areas in our software now and we need to be more performance-aware. Bad practices should be stopped.
