DESCRIPTION

validate services on the node that joins the cluster

...so when the validation logic changes with the version of the node
everything still works correctly

note: logic that won't allow to set services on pre sherlock node
is already in place. see menelaus_web:parse_join_cluster_params

I don't see how menelaus_web:parse_join_cluster_params prevents from setting services on old nodes.

1. you cannot add pre sherlock nodes to the sherlock cluster
2. on pre sherlock cluster only [kv] is allowed. Error message: "services parameter is not supported in this cluster compatibility mode"

Line:555, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Consider following scenario:

1. 3.0 cluster with multiple nodes.
2. Some nodes upgraded to 4.0. Some still running 3.0.
3. A 3.0 node, say XYZ, is removed from the cluster and re-added as 3.0.
4. 4.0 node sends engageCluster2 API to the node XYZ. It will have extra payload in Struct for requestedServices which is not expected by a 3.0 node.

Any issues as a result of this unexpected extra payload in engageCluster2?
