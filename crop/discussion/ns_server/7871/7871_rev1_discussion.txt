DESCRIPTION

WIP - erlang load testing tool.

Some parameters...

* number of items to create.
* ratio between SET's versus GET's.
* during SET's, ratio between new item creation versus existing
  item updates.
* for item updates, percent of items that should be a hot subset of
  heavily-mutated items, and how often to mutate that hot subset
  versus mutating a non-hot item.
* during a GET, similar access ratios for accesing a hot item
  subset versus a non-hot item.

The design uses simple key and item generation functions to so that
each client-side resource usage does not grow over time.
