DESCRIPTION

MB-6042: avoid retries and excessive work in vbucket_map_mirror

When lots of clients spot lack of cached nodes->vbuckets dictionary
they will all call into vbucket_map_mirror worker. Previous version
would recompute map for each such call. Clearly, not perfect approach,
given that worker has full access to up-to-date cached version.

So new code is just reusing already cached version if it's there at
the time worker call is processed. This changes top-level logic a bit,
as call_compute_map now returns dict. So there's no need to retry.

As a side effect we're now correctly handling a case when bucket
disappeared right before call into node_vbuckets_dict which is I think
what actually happened in MB-6042.
