DESCRIPTION

MB-13615 Always attempt to restart ns_server after join.

The logic with markers relies on the fact that if something goes wrong,
then ns_cluster just crashes. But perform_actual_join can actually fail
to start ns_server back and not crash at the same time. That's because
it returns an error describing the situation to the caller. So we need
to explicitly handle this specific error.
