DESCRIPTION

Implement development view logic

Development views will run on all items in a bucket until
the total bucket size reached ?DEV_MULTIPLE * Count of vbuckets
at which point it will run on the first local vbucket.

The race condition between choosing a vbucket and
opening the view results will be implemented in a
succeeding commit along with not_my_vbucket logic.
