Bob - can you squash (or otherwise rebase) so that this patch is not built on top of the "wip" patch?

Patch Set 2:

Bob just pointed out that it's not based on the wip patch - I just got confused by the gerrit UI. Please ignore my most recent comment.

Line:29, src/menelaus_util.erl -> I don't believe this is required. You don't need the test/0 function. Eunit will find the response_headers_test no problem.

Line:95, src/menelaus_util.erl -> what are the semantics of this parameter? Why not just fold it into the proplist that's getting passed to the function? Also: suggest actually using a proplist i.e. [{key, value},...] (google "erlang proplist") instead of separate controls for allow_cache and disallow_cache

Line:104, src/menelaus_util.erl -> I would write this tail recursively (using an accumulator). The stack won't get too deep but it's a better way to write it.

Line:114, src/menelaus_util.erl -> should be moved inside the EUNIT ifdef and placed toward the end of the file.

Line:128, src/menelaus_util.erl -> appears to be duplicate of previous test

Line:621, src/menelaus_util.erl -> this can be removed
