Line:121, src/menelaus_util.erl -> This looks way better. However, better yet would be to use multiple function clauses in the anonymous function rather than the case statement.

I do think we should define macros for the the commonly used HTTP header names. But this can be done in a separate checkin.

Line:121, src/menelaus_util.erl -> Done

I defined CACHE_CONTROL since the string is used multiple times.  It can be moved to a hrl in a later change.
