DESCRIPTION

MB-9612: avoid scheduling new replicator if too many errors

This commit extends concurrency throttle to include a table
in which each row is a pair (node A, # of errors hit during
replication to A). When scheduling a replicator to node A,
the throttle will check if we have hit too many errors. If
so, throttle will skip scheduling replicators to node A.

The table is refreshed every fixed time period. The default
is 120 seconds. The default threshold to avoid scheduling
new replicator is 8. E.g.,if > 8 replicators crashed to a
node during replication within a window of 120 secs, the
throttle will not schedule any new replicators to that node,
until the table is refreshed.

The refresh window is parameterized in xdc_setting.
