Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

I think I was going to have (catch ...) around that ets lookup . And AFAIK it was done in order to detach us from quite dirty dependency on couchdb guts.

But I think that's fine especially given that all those stats are going to be fetched via ep-engine as part of UPR plan.
