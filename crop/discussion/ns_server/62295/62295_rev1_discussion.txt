DESCRIPTION

MB-18623 - change implementation of avg_queries_latency

Previously we computed the average in cbft and it represented
a server lifetime average.  This was inconsistent with the other
similar stats shown by other services.

Now we return query time and query count as counters, and let
ns_server compute the avg across the most recent sample.  This is
consistent with how the query and index service show similar
stats.
