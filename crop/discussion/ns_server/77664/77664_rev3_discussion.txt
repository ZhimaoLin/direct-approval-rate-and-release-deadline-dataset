Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I'm getting an error when I apply this change and it causes the UI to fail to load.

TypeError: Cannot set property 'details' of undefined at http://127.0.0.1:9000/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/mn_buckets_service.js:45:41 at processQueue (http://127.0.0.1:9000/ui/libs/angular-1.6.4.js:16832:37)
