Patch Set 2:

We've had a long-standing issue with handling of isasl.pw refresh. Basically, if we fail to tell memcached to refresh after we write the file, we won't ever be able to do this (the only way is to restart memcached) because ns_memcached:connect_and_send_isasl_refresh uses the user/password that are stored in the config. Long time ago, we didn't have to tell memcached anything, it would just monitor the file for updates. But then Trond took the matters in hist own hands...

Since we are touching this area, I'd like us to solve this issue too.
