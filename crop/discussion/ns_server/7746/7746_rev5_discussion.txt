Patch Set 5: (5 inline comments)

Looks good Dale.
I left only a few comments inlined, minor details only.

Line:79, src/capi_ddoc_replication_srv.erl -> Minor detail, no need to reconstruct the argument (#state{})

Line:84, src/capi_ddoc_replication_srv.erl -> Rather then ignoring any unexpected message (or call, or cast), I tend to prefer to let it stop with a reason other than normal and log the message, or simple remove such a clause and get a stack trace. This helps find all sort of weird bugs from the gen_server and other processes that tNathalie Landry to it.

Line:136, src/capi_ddoc_replication_srv.erl -> You're being highly biased by the HTTP interface :)
Just call couch_replicator:cancel_replication(Rep#rep.id).

Line:158, src/capi_ddoc_replication_srv.erl -> Same as before, use couch_replicator:cancel_replication/1

Line:185, src/capi_ddoc_replication_srv.erl -> 1 worker process is more than enough.
We will not be replicating huge amount of documents all the time, are we?
