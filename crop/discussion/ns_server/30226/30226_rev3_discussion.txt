DESCRIPTION

CBD-485 vbucket compaction via ep-engine

ns_server issues a memcached api call of CMD_COMPACT_DB
This command starts a CompactorTask in Ep-Engine and returs
without blocking.

Then ns_server listens to the new mccouch notification
indicating completion of compaction by ep-engine.

after the notification is received ns_server adjusts
the file version in couchdb

master vbucket is still compacted the old way by
couchdb compactor
