DESCRIPTION

CBD-485 vbucket compaction via ep-engine

NS-Server issues a memcached api call of CMD_COMPACT_DB
This command starts a CompactorTask in Ep-Engine and returs
without blocking.

Then NS-Server listens to the new mccouch notification
indicating completion of compaction by ep-engine.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

There are following open issues in this code:

1. This code doesn't compact master.couch.X because the ep-engine api
    doesn't support non numeric vbuckets
2. I'm not sure how to supply value for DropDeletes parameter of the api.
    Set it to false for now.
3. I suspect that I have to do something extra after the vbucket is compacted.
    For now I skip couch_db:update_header_pos because it was returning
    update_file_ahead_of_couchdb since the ep-engine changes the version of
    the file.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Artem, indeed I failed to mention that we'll need to adjust couchdb code to be able to accept those new file revisions. Let's discuss this tomorrow.
