DESCRIPTION

CBD-485 vbucket compaction via ep-engine

ns_server issues a memcached api call of CMD_COMPACT_DB
This command starts a CompactorTask in Ep-Engine and returs
without blocking.

Then ns_server listens to the new mccouch notification
indicating completion of compaction by ep-engine.

after the notification is received ns_server adjusts
the file version in couchdb

master vbucket is still compacted the old way by
couchdb compactor

Patch Set 4: Verified+1

tested with 20-50K of randomly generated documents on 1024 vbuckets
found file descriptors leak which is fixed here:
http://review.couchbase.org/31123/

after the fix works correctly
- the data size is being reduced
- the fragmentation % is being reduced to 0
- the content of the docs is preserved after compaction
- the subsequent adding of new documents doesn't cause any errors

Hi, Just wondering when this is planned to be merged? I am still waiting on these changes before I remove all the retry logic on temporary failures during compaction.

thanks

See inline.

Plus we need to figure out what exactly happens with persistence for a vbucket while it's being compacted.

Line:925, src/compaction_daemon.erl -> Since several compaction can run in parallel, this is not enough.

Line:1155, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I don't think we need Node parameter here since we always make this call locally.

Line:96, src/mc_connection.erl -> Bad indentation here.
