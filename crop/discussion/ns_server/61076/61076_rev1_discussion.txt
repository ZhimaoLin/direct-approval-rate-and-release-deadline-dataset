DESCRIPTION

MB-18379 Return etag that corresponds to info level used.

Previously etag would get calculated based on stable info level. But
the response would include some additional UI-only fields. So UI
wouldn't get notified if any of those fields changed.

To achieve this I separated info level into actual info level (normal,
for_ui) and "stability level" (stable and unstable). That way I can
tell build_pool_info function that I want non-volatile version of
for_ui information. And that's what now is used to calculate the etag.
