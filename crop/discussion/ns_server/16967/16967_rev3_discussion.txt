DESCRIPTION

CBD-185 Check for passwords on REST bucket access

Use menelaus_auth to determine if the REST request has
valid credentials. This works for basic auth via curl
as well as in the admin console. It is also vbucket
aware and will require passwords for direct vbucket
access by XDCR client for sasl protected buckets.

Patch Set 3:

This version no longer modifies the menaleaus auth module, instead it changes the javascript to send the basic auth headers for /couchBase/ requests

Patch Set 3:

Looks good.

However let me point out another things. Not sure if it's premature optimization but changed code is checking for bucket twice instead of once.

Because we already fetch bucket config we can optimize couchbase_bucket_exists. Perhaps this can be implemented as a separate patch.
