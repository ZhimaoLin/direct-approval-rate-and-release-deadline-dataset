DESCRIPTION

CBD-185 Check for passwords on REST bucket access

Use menelaus_auth to determine if the REST request has
valid credentials. This works for basic auth via curl
as well as in the admin console. It is also vbucket
aware and will require passwords for direct vbucket
access by XDCR client for sasl protected buckets.

Patch Set 2:

perhaps good enough for now. But note that _replicator access will need to be changed to require Admin credentials before 2.0

Patch Set 2:

May I ask for some explanation of "auth" cookie being used? I would be best imho if we put this explanation either in code as a comment, and/or as part of commit message

Patch Set 2:

I have no idea what the auth cookie is. I'm just using the functions available in menaleaus auth.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

auth_cookie is used just allow users to open certain things in browser. Like diags. Everything that UI sends is imho cleaner if UI adds auth headers instead of relying on cookies.

Anyway if we do this change, we need to get rid of apply_auth_cookie because otherwise it's just code duplication and confusion

Patch Set 2:

The problem is, I don't know which systems use auth_cookie or what is the difference between a dialog vs other requests...

As far as I can tell, using the cookie that is already set, works. To do the thing with special headers would require altering the client side JavaScript to set these headers, increasing the scope of the patch and introducing more code on the client.

I'm not sure I understand the reasoning not wanting to use cookies, since they are already set when you login to the console.

Patch Set 2:

From the very beginning our approach was just basic auth.

But client was using cookie in order to store currently authenticated credentials so that it can send them with Authenticate headers.

For some special cases however we've decided to allow server to authenticate based on this 'internal' auth cookie. That's for example very important for /diag. Because it does have sensitive info so we cannot allow everybody to get it. But we also wanted very straightforward experience on UI where user just follows 'Grabs diag' link that simply points to /diag and things work.

So auth cookie is a bit of hack. At least as of now. I don't think it will be hard to our UI to add basic auth header for couch requests as well.

Our another option is 'official' promotion of auth cookie to  somewhat supported status. In which case it should work for all requests. And code should be cleaned up for that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:69, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> this is stolen from later in the file (apply_auth_cookie)

I tried to keep the behavior the same as other places that are accessed via the web console. So I think if the new code needs changing, the old code (apply_auth_cookie) will also need the same change.

But in my testing, the Cookie was containing an auth token, which this parses. If I remove this code (as an earlier patchset had) then sasl buckets are no longer browseable via the web UI.
