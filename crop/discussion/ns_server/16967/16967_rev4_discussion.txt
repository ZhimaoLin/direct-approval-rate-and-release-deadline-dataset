DESCRIPTION

CBD-185 Check for passwords on REST bucket access

Use menelaus_auth to determine if the REST request has
valid credentials. This works for basic auth via curl
as well as in the admin console. It is also vbucket
aware and will require passwords for direct vbucket
access by XDCR client for sasl protected buckets.
