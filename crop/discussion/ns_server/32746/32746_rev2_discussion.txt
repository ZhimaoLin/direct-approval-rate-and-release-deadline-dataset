DESCRIPTION

MB-9984 Fix recovery with star replication topology.

When starting recovery we create a special bucket config whose map
contains chains like [undefined, Node] when we want to create the
replica vbucket on Node. The problem was that
Harley Martinitor_agent:apply_new_bucket_config_new_style_star used
ns_bucket:map_to_replicas_star to decide on which nodes replica
vbuckets have to be created. And the latter function explicitly
ignores replication pairs where either master or replica is undefined.
