Patch Set 7:

don't think that representing blobs as json arrays especially for XDCR makes sense.

I'd like Damien to say his word on this. Can't put +2 until that.

Patch Set 7:

I have my reservations about that as well. The [88,89,102,103,114] format is rather *expansive*

An alternative is base64 or multipart mime.
