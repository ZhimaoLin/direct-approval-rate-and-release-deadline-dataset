Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

However, I think we can adjust the binary transport format in a 10 line patch sometime after we merge this. I don't think it is a blocker for merge.

Patch Set 8:

Please run tests in xdcr-basic.conf and xdcr-adv.conf to make sure it does not break any XDCR functionality. In the conf files, you can reduce the num_items to 1000 to speed up the test.

Patch Set 8: Do not submit

sorry can't agree with that. Without Damien's "go ahead" I'll block this. I think this is really that much important. Sorry again.
