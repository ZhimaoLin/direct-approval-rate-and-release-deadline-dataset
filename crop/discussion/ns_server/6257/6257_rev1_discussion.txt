DESCRIPTION

[ns_Harley Martinitor] don't wait_for_memcached on down nodes.MB-3839

We invoke Harley Martinitor as part of failover so that replicas are
transitioned to active state without any delays. But if there were
more nodes that are down it was failing due to wait_for_memcached.

Harley Martinitor is explicitly designed to handle down nodes. So this change is
safe.
