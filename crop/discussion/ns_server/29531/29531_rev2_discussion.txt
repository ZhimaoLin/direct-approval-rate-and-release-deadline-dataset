DESCRIPTION

MB-100: undo unintended consequences of preceding merge

It was clearly not intented to move master back to pre-3.0 compat mode
etc. Preceding merge + this commit = nothing. So we're back to
pre-merge source, yet git will record merge as done. So that next
merges will only consider changes after last merge point.
