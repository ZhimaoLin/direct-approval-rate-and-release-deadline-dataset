Patch Set 3:

@Anders - actually I had considered factoring it out along the lines you suggested in your email but I thought the function(s) would have lengthy argument lists and would be a bit unfriendly to use (and wouldn't get much reuse). But I went ahead anyway as your suggestion looked good in the mail. 

To get around my distaste for complex formal arguments with no types I added some type specifications but if you think that's overkill for these 2 little helper functions I'm happy to remove them.
