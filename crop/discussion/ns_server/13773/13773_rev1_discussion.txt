DESCRIPTION

Connection pooling of ns_memcached instances

Currently there's only one ns_memcached data process per bucket.
However, with xdcr, there will likely be many concurrent replication
streams coming into a given node, where they'll end up getting
serialized due to only one ns_memcached process serving their
requests. This change set makes it so that there can be multiple
processes for serving data requests. Their number is configurable by
means of an environment variable.
