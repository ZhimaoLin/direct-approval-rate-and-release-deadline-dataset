Please put bug # to the commit message
And link to the goxdcr code review this commit depends on. The one that introduces new stats: docs_failed_cr_source and rate_received_from_dcp

I also see that this commit addresses 2 issues, One with these 2 new stats and another with using docs_processed instead of docs_checked. We prefer not to mix 2 fixes in one commit. The purpose of it is better code documentation and convenience when using git blame.
