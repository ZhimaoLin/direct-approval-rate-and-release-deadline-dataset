Line:1025, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> these stats that are being removed are internal stats of goxdcr. it may not be necessary or beneficial for end users to see them.

Line:526, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> we are adding a new stats, docs_processed, which is closer to the "docs_checked" in erlang xdcr than our own "docs_checked"

Line:989, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> docs_filtered and docs_failed_cr_source are two new stats added by goxdcr. The former is for the new filtering feature in goxdcr. The latter is to provide better diagnostic capabilities.

Line:1020, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> new stats showing the rate that goxdcr receives docs from source cluster, e.g, through dcp.

may need to look for a better title. "doc arrival rate"?
