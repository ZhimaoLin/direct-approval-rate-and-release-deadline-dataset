DESCRIPTION

[cells] prevent cells to start futures twice

In some situations (Cells.recalcCount == 0) it was possible that
future is started right from setValue (via _markForCompletion). But
then dependent cells increment recalcCount and cell value change
notification is performed via delayedBroadcast. Which in turn would
call completeCellDelay, which would invoke future.start second time.
