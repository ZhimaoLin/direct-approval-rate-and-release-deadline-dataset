DESCRIPTION

MB-15866 prevent max restart intencity if the ssl port is temporary busy

we've seen the condition when restart of ns_capi_ssl_service fails with
eaddrinuse. in few seconds port becomes available again but it's enough
to cause max_restart_intencity and reboot the whole ns_couchdb node and
therefore the rabalance failure.
