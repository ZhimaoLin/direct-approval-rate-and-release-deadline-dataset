DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Handle URL construction.

For IPv6 configured hosts the respective URLs need to be constructed
with the IP address enclosed within '[' and ']' brackets.

In ns_server, we construct a lot of URLs using the localhost address.
This change makes use of the abstraction APIs deifned to construct
the URLs appropriately.

Patch Set 8:

I would suggest to create a helper for constructing local URL, like misc:local_url(Port, Path)
