DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Handle URL construction.

For IPv6 configured hosts the respective URLs need to be constructed
with the IP address enclosed within '[' and ']' brackets.

In ns_server, we construct a lot of URLs using the localhost address.
This change makes use of the abstraction APIs defined to construct
the URLs appropriately.
