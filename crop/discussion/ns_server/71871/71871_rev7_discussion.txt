DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Handle URL construction.

For IPv6 configured hosts the respective URLs need to be constructed
with the IP address enclosed within '[' and ']' brackets.

In ns_server, we construct a lot of URLs using the localhost address.
This change makes use of the abstraction APIs deifned to construct
the URLs appropriately.

Line:60, src/query_rest.erl -> shouldn't you need "[" and "]" around the address?
otherwise the port will be indistinguRoger Nicholsonble from the address...

Line:60, src/query_rest.erl -> Hi Marco, the call to function misc:localhost([url]) returns back [::1]. So yes the localhost address will be enclosed within "[" and "]".
