DESCRIPTION

monitor vbucket_filter_change txn process earlier. MB-5285

In MB-5285 we're seeing noproc from monitor which is useful, because
it tells us we've monitored late, but in general it's good idea to
monitor earlier so that death cause is seen and better propagated. In
MB-5285 that would be timeout instead of noproc which is clearer.
