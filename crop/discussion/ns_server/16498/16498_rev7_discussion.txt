DESCRIPTION

MB-5264: Use correct ep_engine stats to check if XDCR items persisted

This change-set removes using ep_engine checkpoint stat in CAPI before
updating the document, which is unnecessary and has caused slow XDCR
rate. Instead, it is using write queue size and number of completed
flushes stats to make sure XDCR items have been persisted.

Patch Set 7:

ps7: 

1. poll_for_condition returns to the caller either 1) timeout 2) whatever returned by condition()

2. The condition function returns either 1) false 2) {ok, EpStartupTime} to poll_for_condition()

3. ensure_full_commit() will compare the startup time returned by the wait_for_flusher_stats() with stored time stamp, if not equal, timeout will be returned to caller. There could be better msg to notify caller that engine has restarted.

4. A few minor comments from Damien.

Patch Set 7:

imho it would make more sense to extract change of misc:poll_for_condition into separate commit. I think returning false if timeout hits makes much more sense. Essentially poll_for_condition is massive conjunction and returning false on success is in line with that.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

cannot see how it would work with WaitResult being pair in most cases
