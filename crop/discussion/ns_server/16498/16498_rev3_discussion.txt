DESCRIPTION

MB-5264: Use correct ep_engine stats to check if XDCR items persisted

This change-set removes using ep_engine checkpoint stat in CAPI before
updating the document, which is unnecessary and has caused slow XDCR
rate. Instead, it is using write queue size and number of completed
flushes stats to make sure XDCR items have been persisted.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

some progress

Line:148, src/capi_frontend.erl -> no need to assign PollResult and then just return it.

Line:175, src/capi_frontend.erl -> that's looks like step in right direction. Now you just need to assign result of case expression to WaitResult variable once.

Line:190, src/capi_frontend.erl -> are you sure returning timeout is correct here?
