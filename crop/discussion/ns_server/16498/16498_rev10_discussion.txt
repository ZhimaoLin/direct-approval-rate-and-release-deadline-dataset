DESCRIPTION

MB-5264: Use correct ep_engine stats to check if XDCR items persisted

This change-set removes using ep_engine checkpoint stat in CAPI before
updating the document, which is unnecessary and has caused slow XDCR
rate. Instead, it is using write queue size and number of completed
flushes stats to make sure XDCR items have been persisted. It also
allows XCR to use ep_startup_time to ensure no engine crash and
restart during XCDR.

may I ask for:

a) separate commit for adding support for force-create of checkpoint ?

b) updated commit message?

Line:376, src/ns_memcached.erl -> this is not needed

Alk: sorry for confusion. This is WIP, not ready for review yet. We will create a separate commit to enable ns_server to issue "create_checkpoint" to ep engine
