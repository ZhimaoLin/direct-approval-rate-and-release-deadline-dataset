DESCRIPTION

MB-5264: Use correct ep_engine stats to check if XDCR items persisted

This change-set removes using ep_engine checkpoint stat in CAPI before
updating the document, which is unnecessary and has caused slow XDCR
rate. Instead, it is using write queue size and number of completed
flushes stats to make sure XDCR items have been persisted.

Did first pass of review. Please address some comments.

On larger scale I wanted this polling for stats to be centralized. Otherwise a bunch of concurrent ensure_full_commit requests will do same polling for same bucket independently.

Line:158, src/capi_frontend.erl -> I want this path to be covered as well.

Line:145, src/capi_frontend.erl -> You need to handle > condition as well

Line:152, src/capi_frontend.erl -> just return ok & timeout instead of integers

Line:181, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Please don't do this. Also "exporting" variables from inside case is discouraged in ns_server.

Line:182, src/capi_frontend.erl -> no need to check for >0 as those stats cannot be negative

Line:201, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Are you sure returning {timeout, 0} is correct here?

Line:203, src/capi_frontend.erl -> please don't do this
