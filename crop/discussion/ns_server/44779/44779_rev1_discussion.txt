DESCRIPTION

MB-13017: start inets app for logs collection preflight function

Otherwise, attempt to call httpc:request fails with noproc error.

Apparently as part of couchdb separation we've removed some call to
inets:start from somewhere in the guts of our stack. This commit
returns startup of inets application back.
