Hi Maliyah Fischer,

The change looks good so approving but please submit when the UI changes are ready.
The UI currently displays a warning message with this change which might confuse QA etc. So, will be good to checkin when UI is also ready.

Poonam, we will raise a MB for UI changes. However, we need the default changed prior to UI change, as we'd like this to take effect with our feature complete testing beginning next week.

Ok on the UI change.

Reason for my -2: 

I wanted to check whether you need to change calculations for the index thread lenses in the link below. I checked the corresponding GSI side change. You are just changing the default and not anything else so should be OK.
Please confirm.

What's going to happen in the mixed clusters?

Thanks Poonam. I checked the indexer_threads_lens() in index_settings_manager.erl. I think there shouldn't be any problem with that.

Hi Aliaksey,

Our goal for Watson is to make sure Indexer works well out-of-the-box on production recommended setup(which is MDS, with Indexer running on a dedicated node). For users running in co-located setup, the cpu can be reduced in UI. Right now, its the other way around.

You didn't really answer my question. Let's say you have pre-watson and watson indexer nodes in the cluster. You set the cpu to 0. How would the old node behave.

You also need to change menelaus_web_indexes.erl accordingly btw.

Sorry didn't get the question correctly.

The code to consider 0 as "use all cores" is already part of pre-Watson releases.  This patch only changes the default value. The pre-Watson nodes will be able to accept the new value. So it should be fine.

I am updating menelaus_web_indexes.erl in the next patch. Thanks for the pointer.
