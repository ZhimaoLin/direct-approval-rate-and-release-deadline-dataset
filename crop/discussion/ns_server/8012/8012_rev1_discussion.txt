DESCRIPTION

Added configuration for autocompaction.

Since there's no good default value for all cases, this is at least a
safety-net value that will prevent us from consuming all disk space
with updates of existing values and do so without heavily beating on
smaller databases that don't really benefit from compaction.

Patch Set 1:

It felt a bit strange to put autocompaction config into this file, but it's kind of special cased and looks like it has a bit more than just http endpoints in it already.  If we'd like to have a more generic couch configuration deployment thing, tell me where this should go instead.
