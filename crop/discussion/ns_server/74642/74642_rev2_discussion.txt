Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

Manik - this can't be merged - it will break offline upgrade. I mentioned this in my last review comments.

The memcached_defaults key is not migrated between 4.5.1 and spock and thus won't be present causing the creation of the memcached config to fail.

You'll need to copy the logic from when we upgraded from 4.1.1 -> 4.5 here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl#564. The migration logic should be copied into the 4.6.0 -> spock upgrade step which is here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl#581. And we usually add a test for these upgrades - that's here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl#730.

You can run the tests to verify they pass by running `make test` in ns_server. And you should test that this actually works before marking +V.
