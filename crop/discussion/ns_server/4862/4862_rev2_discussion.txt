Line:341, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> Small thing: could we drop the CacheStatInfos/PersistenStatInfos and just pu the object directly under byName and reference from there in the code below?

I think it'd reduce potential confusion between the difference of the "All" versions, as well as lower the number of variables--which make things more readable usually.

Thoughts?
