DESCRIPTION

MB-20102 Filter out dev ddocs correctly in get_safe_purge_seqs.

As of before, the code would just filter out desgin documents with one
character after _design/dev_ prefix.

The consequence of this is that in case there's only development
design documents for some bucket, those won't get auto-updated. So the
compaction daemon would be passing ever more out of date purge seqno
to ep-engine, preventing it from reclaiming disk space.
