Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

Better, and probably OK.

It's still somewhat imperfect that this async reset might in principle happen at arbitrary time without user knowing about it. But IMHO that's minor enough to not require larger changes that would otherwise seem to be needed.

Aliaksey, feel free to disagree. Especially if you find my assumptions wrong. In which case we'll revert and seek for different solution.
