DESCRIPTION

MB-13437: added unit of measure for numbers in audit errors

We have unclear error message in case of lack of
necessary amount of minutes. User can see something like:
[4] [minutes] - The value of rotator_interval must be in
range from 900 to 604800.
Obviously that such message can cause confusion.

bytes and seconds definitely should not be atoms. As to the confusion, I tend to think that if the user enters a value in minutes, then the error should refer an interval in minutes too.
