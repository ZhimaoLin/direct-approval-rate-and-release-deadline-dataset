DESCRIPTION

MB-5911 Unbreak XDC replication history.

The change that introduced deterministic ids for replication documents
also incidentally broke replication history. Here's why. We track the
history of replication by info documents. Ids of these documents were
formed by adding _info_{node_uuid} to id of replication document. But
since replication document id was now always the same for the same
replication, replication info documents would also have the same
ids. Thus no history at all. To fix this we introduce replication
document UUID that is stored in its body. It is generated every time
replication document is created. So replication document describing
the same replication as some already deleted replication document will
have the same id but different UUID. And we will use replication
document UUID instead of its id when creating info document. So the
history will be preserved.

Massively (but mostly mechanically) changes xdc_rep_manager. So waiting for Damien's work.

And btw, I ran xdcr-basic and xdcr-adv test with the entire chain of changes. Everything seems to work.

Patch Set 1:

btw AFAIK we made decision to get rid of replications history at least for 2.0. Perhaps can be abandoned.

Sorry for lost time
