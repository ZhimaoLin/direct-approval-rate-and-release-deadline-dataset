DESCRIPTION

POC: User defined alerts

Users can set alerts on any stat they want to monitor and
on as many stats as they want.

add_user_alert(Type, Stat, Threshold):
    - Type can be of any type: "@system", BucketName, xxx@xxx.xxx
                                xxx@xxx.xxx ++ BucketName,
                                xxx@xxx.xxx ++ BucketName,
                                "@xdcr-" ++ BucketName, "@index", xxx@xxx.xxx
    - Stat is the stat to be monitored

Alert is generated when the Stat value crosses the user specified Threshold.

Examples: xxx@xxx.xxx cpu_utilization_rate, 80)
          will generalte an alert when cpu_utilization crosses 80%.

          add_user_alert("test", ops, 1000000)
          will generate an alert when ops on the test bucket cross 1million
