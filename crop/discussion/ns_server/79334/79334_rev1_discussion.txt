DESCRIPTION

MB-24543 return empty sasl_password to default moxi for "default"

...bucket
This is needed so authless client can continue to work against
"default" bucket via default moxi after 4.x -> Spock upgrade

the code doesn't explicitely check for passwordless "default"
user presence, because default moxi will be started only if such
user exists
