DESCRIPTION

MB-24242: Stop rebalance when auto-failover...

...is initiated.

Currently, while rebalance is in progress if an auto-failover
request is sent (because a node went down) then it'll be simply
ignored. The fix is to terminate the rebalance operation and
process the auto-failover message.
