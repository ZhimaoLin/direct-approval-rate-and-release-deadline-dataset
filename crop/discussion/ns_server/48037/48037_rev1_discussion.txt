DESCRIPTION

Untangle ddoc replication from capi_set_view_manager again.

Initially they were melded together to avoid races of the following
kind:

  - ddoc_replicator deletes a document and sends an asynchronous
    notification to the capi_set_view_manager

  - meanwhile capi_set_view_manager serves some call involving the
    deleted document

So the capi_set_view_manager would have to expect that ddoc can be
changed concurrently. Which complicated the code significantly.

Now I need to have the replicator separated to be able to run it on
non-kv node. So I capi_set_view_manager and newly introduced
capi_ddoc_manager are synchronized via dedicated gen_event. When
capi_ddoc_manager is about to update a ddoc, it sends a synchronous
notification via the gen_event that tells capi_set_view_manager to
suspend until the document is saved. Then after it's saved, an
asynchronous notification is sent for capi_set_view_manager to
continue its operations. On non-kv node there still be a
capi_ddoc_manager and a corresponding gen_event. But there will be no
capi_set_view_manager listening on the latter.
