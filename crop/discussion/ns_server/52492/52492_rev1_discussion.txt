Patch Set 1:

If you want it in 3.1.0, please upload against rel-3.0.0++ branch. Also, curl is used for cbcollect_info uploads. Do you need to pass the --proxy flag there too?

OK, I will upload it to rel-3.0.0++ branch too.

The curl used for uploads *does* need to be able to use a proxy, as quite often customers have their nodes behind firewalls.
