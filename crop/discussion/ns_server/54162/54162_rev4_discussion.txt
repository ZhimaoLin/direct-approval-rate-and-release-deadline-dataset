DESCRIPTION

MB-15926 Expect KEY_ENOENT errors when closing streams.

It's possible that the stream is already closed in the following
cases:

  - on the producer and consumer sides, if the vbucket has been moved
  to a different node from the producer node

  - on the consumer side, if the close stream request that we sent to
  the producer was processed first by the producer, it sent a
  notification to the consumer and the consumer processed the
  notification before handling our close stream request
