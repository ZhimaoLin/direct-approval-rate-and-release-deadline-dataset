DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: analytics section

The section almost done, list of todos:
 - better performance during opening stats group. We can be faster in case each
   stats groups will be realized as separate state. angular-ui-router allows us
   to do this now but there is no way to remove unnecessary state, but it's on
   the roadmap (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/1095)
 - TOP KEYS section is not added due to reworking of memcached
 - improve getStats error handler. will be improved after resolving
   this bug (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-15294)
