Patch Set 40:

Loaded gamesim-sample. I do see hotkeys populated, but Ops/Sec for all of them is NaN. The old UI shows 0.01.

Patch Set 40:

Also on gamesim-sample clicking on any small graph under "MAPREDUCE VIEW STATS: _DESIGN/PLAYERS" causes reloading of the whole UI and throws you to the front page.

Patch Set 40:

And one more complain:

Analytics screen is accessible via "Server Nodes" tab, but not via "Data Buckets" tab. When you click on bucket name on "Data Buckets" page you get "URIError: URI malformed" error.
