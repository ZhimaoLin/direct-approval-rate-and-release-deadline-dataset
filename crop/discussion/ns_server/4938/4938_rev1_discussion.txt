DESCRIPTION

use #visitSec in places where gotoSection invocation is needed

The difference with plain #sec is that if we're already in target
section, #sec will do nothing. #visitSec however will invoke
gotoSection which will invoke #navClick or #onEnter on section.

This is necessary to refresh buckets list on clicks to
{manage,monitor} buckets section link.
