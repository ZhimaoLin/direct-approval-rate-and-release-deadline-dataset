Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

this is quite doubtful practice. Acceptable, but very doubtful. We're losing ability to log client-side unexpected failures.

Patch Set 1:

no we arent, the caller is the only one who has enough information to know whether particular errors are acceptable / expected, and it can still dispatch the unexpected error
