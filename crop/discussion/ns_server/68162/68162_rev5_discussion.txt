DESCRIPTION

spock-ui: MB-20824: remove unnecessary <base> tag

since we no longer need to override a default URL
and a default target for all links on a page. Better
to keep it as default in order to not confuse developers.

All uib's templates were moved to appropriate index files
because there is no other options to replace default path to
the uib's template folder.

Patch Set 5:

so now if we will want to change tha base for the UI we will need to do massive search and replace in the code. I don't like it, but if you'll insist I'll submit it.

Are you sure that there's no other way to fix this "Cancel" button?
