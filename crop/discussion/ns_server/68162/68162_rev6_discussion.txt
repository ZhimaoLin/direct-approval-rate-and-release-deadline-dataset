DESCRIPTION

spock-ui: MB-20824: remove unnecessary <base> tag

since we no longer need to override a default URL
and a default target for all links on a page. Better
to keep it as default in order to not confuse developers.

All uib's templates were moved to appropriate index files
because there is no other options to replace default path to
the uib's template folder.

Patch Set 6: Verified+1

I don't think that we will want to change the base ever. It was introduced as a fast way to deal with templateUrl in js files in order to have one js file and two different templates. Finally, we decide to clone all js files that contain templateUrl but I forget to remove the base.

In any case, if we will want to change the base for the UI we will need to do massive search and replace in the code.
