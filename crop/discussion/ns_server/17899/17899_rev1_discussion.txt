DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: refactoring checkpoint code in replicator

Today the replicator module consists of mixed code for replication
management and checkpointing, which is not neat and make replicator
module unnecessarily bloated. For better code style and easier future
debug and developement, this change-set creates a new module, namely
xdc_replicator_ckpt, and removes all checkpoint realated code to the
new module.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Don't see much in a suffix of ckpt instead of checkpoint. But that's just personal preference.
