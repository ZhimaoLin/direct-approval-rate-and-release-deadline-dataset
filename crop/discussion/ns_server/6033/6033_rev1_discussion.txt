DESCRIPTION

'link' event handlers to supervisors

Our original event_handler installation logic was able to install same
event handler multiple times if supervisors are restarted. Which
happens every time node is removed from cluster. In certain tests that
happens lots of times.

New approach links intermediate process with supervisor and 'links'
event_handler with intermediate process. Intermediate process will die
after getting any message (typically from gen_event process about
event_handler removal).
