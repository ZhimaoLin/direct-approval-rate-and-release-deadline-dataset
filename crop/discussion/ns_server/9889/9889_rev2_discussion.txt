DESCRIPTION

set autocompaction settings checkboxes early

Because otherwise when we set fields and afterwards enable form
validation, we may send invalid fields. E.g. if timer period is
disabled we could still have period text inputs enabled and thus
sent. Causing unpleasant 'red blink of validation errors'.
