DESCRIPTION

Rebalance for topology aware services.

There are still some missing pieces. For example, not all information
that is returned by the service is used. And more importantly, currently
it's possible to add a node with a topology aware service even when
cluster is not fully 4.5. I plan to address it in subsequent commits.

Line:1038, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> In short, ns_rebalancer process currently doesn't trap exits and instead expects stop message when user presses stop on the UI. If ns_rebalance process terminates normally or abnormally, service_rebalancer will notice it and eventually terminate. Normal stop should indeed make sure that everything is stopped properly. I planned to address it in a separate change. Chances of anybody noticing it are quite low.
