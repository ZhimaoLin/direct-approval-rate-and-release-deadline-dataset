1. enter some invalid regex like *&^%*%%%<<<b. You see the error but "Replicate" button is enabled

2. Create replication with some filter. You will see that the replication is filtered by the checked "filtered" check box. But there's no way to find out what the filter is.

Patch Set 15:

>>> 1. enter some invalid regex like *&^%*%%%<<<b. You see the error but "Replicate" button is enabled
- Replicate button is always Enabled and was enabled before
>>> But there's no way to find out what the filter is.
- Checkbox tooltip contains regex. But I agree with you it is causes confusion.

No, sorry I do see it. Though it requires some precise aiming.

Ok. I'm checking this in, so PM can take a look. But the situation with enabled "Replicate" button should be fixed. This button shouldn't be enabled if just_validate call returns error.
