Patch Set 11:

Tried it out. If your filter doesn't match any of the example keys, there's no indication whatsoever that something is wrong. Should we highlight non-matching keys too?

I also noticed that if after creating the replication you click "Edit", filter is not shown there.

Patch Set 11:

Aliaksey, we not suppose to be able to edit filter on a replication.

I found the following confusing behavior:
1. Click "Create Replication"
2. Open "Filtering" tab
3. Enter some keys and regex
4. Click "Cancel"
5. Click "Create Replication"
6. Specify cluster ref and buckets
7. Without even opening "Filtering" do "Submit"
8. The filtered replication is created

This should not be the case.

Me and Dave came up with the following fix: we should do check box "Enable Filtering" and send the regex to the server only if the checkbox is checked. If it's unchecked the regex and keys should be disabled

Patch Set 11:

And we need to be able to see the filter for the filtered repl. I'll add the filter to the task, but I'm not sure what's the best option where to show it in UI.
