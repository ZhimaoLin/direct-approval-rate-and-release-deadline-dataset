DESCRIPTION

MB-24355: Set trap_exit to false while running...

...Harley Martinitor cleanup for buckets.

[1] The trap_exit is set to true for the cleanup process only while
    performing a cleanup on 'services'. Reset the trap_exit after
    it's done.

[2] Also make sure that an 'EXIT' message is not sent while the
    trap_exit is set to true for the cleanup process. If it's
    sent then exit immediately.
