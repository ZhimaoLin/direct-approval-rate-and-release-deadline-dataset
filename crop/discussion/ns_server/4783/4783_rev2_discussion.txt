much simpler route. Committing it for
the curious and for posterity.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

jQuery UI is overkill for this problem. Going to use HTML5 datalist plus a JS fallback instead.

Patch Set 2: Restored

jQuery UI's got what we need after all. Other than Dojo, every other implementation of a combobox is a "one man" thing that seem abandoned or idle.

HTML5's datalist isn't what we want for this either, sadly.
