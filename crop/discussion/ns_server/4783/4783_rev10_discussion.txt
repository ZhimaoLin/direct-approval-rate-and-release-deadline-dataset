Patch Set 10:

Added some usability improvements:

if tab or enter are selected with a partial search (ex: "d")
 and the list has a single entry left
  then that item will be selected
 or if there are no entries left
  then the list search will be removed and the input emptied
 or if there are multiple entries left
  then the default action of tab/enter will be prevented (to encourage additional input or a selection)
