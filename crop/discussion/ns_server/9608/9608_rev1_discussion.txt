DESCRIPTION

Revert "abort stats computation when request is aborted"

This reverts commit 914f364bd02c56ee66912559f2d8abdaca3772da.

Unfortunately, tcp_closed is sent when read side of socket is
closed. But valid http clients are allowed to close write side of
socket after sending request, which would cause issues with our
approach here.

Sadly, there seems to be no way to correctly implement desired
behavior. So we just revert.
