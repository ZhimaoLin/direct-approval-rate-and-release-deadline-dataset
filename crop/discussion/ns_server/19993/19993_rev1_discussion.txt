Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I see no good use case for separate API here

Patch Set 1:

Should this be folded into something else? I believe we want to expose the progress of each individual replication job so they can be displayed on the Replications page.

Patch Set 1:

The vbs_replicating item is unnecessary, and could be stripped out, but the changes_left and docs_checked items can be used to show replication progress. docs_checked is the total count of items that would be replicated to the remote, and changes_left is how many of those aren't -on- the remote cluster yet.

This would be for the replication page that shows each individual replication job, so that you could see the progress of each job.
