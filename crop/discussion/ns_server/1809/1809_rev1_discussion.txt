DESCRIPTION

New 2 step, more RESTful wizard.

This change no longer relies upon initStatus from the REST
interface.  The design is such that not being able to get
pool information from the authenticated section means you
must have not yet 'provisioned' this system.

If you have not yet provisioned the system, you will always start
with the welcome screen, though loss of your connection won't
cause you to lose configuration you've already entered.
