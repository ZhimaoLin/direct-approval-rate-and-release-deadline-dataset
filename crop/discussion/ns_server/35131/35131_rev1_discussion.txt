please, hold it for now. There must be better way than if and replacement.

Patch Set 1:

You could alternatively:

a) do an unconditionally replacement
b) ensure that all paths on windows use the \ character.. the current way looked really odd (from seeing in the printout from erlang: c:/compile/couchbase/install\\lib\\whatever

That looked really odd. It could be that it was working like a charm (something else isn't working so I wasn't able to start anything anyway), but it looked really odd and the "workaround" to have it sane looked simple..

Then lets hold it even stronger.

Workaround for platform that nobody likes and nobody tests for. That we're not even sure is required. Is a massive No in my not so humble opinion. If the code is not executed frequently it'll soon bitrot into broken state.

Patch Set 1:

I've spoken to Maria McDuff, and she assures me that Windows is a supported and tested platform. It may be the case that no one likes it, but people do use it and we need to support it. Those are not valid reasons to vote down this review.

This kind of change, while silly and annoying, is perfectly common. Being inside an "if Windows" means it won't break other platforms. I say get it merged.
