Patch Set 3: (8 inline comments)

Not bad, but requires some work

Line:532, priv/public/index.html -> see my comments about bucket name being part of id. Also I'd start html-escaping this things even though bucket names apparently cannot have problematic chars

Line:1256, priv/public/js/app-misc.js -> as can be seen in bucket.js comment this is not really needed IMHO

Line:630, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> you can move this code to bottom of aroundRendering. Around is generalization of pre-, & post-.

Line:734, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> thats ok thing. But note it's much harder to debug private variables like that. Recently I've started to avoid doing this

Line:740, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> length comparison is not really needed here. Even if previous names length is same or less you still should do this _.difference thing

Line:742, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> bucket name may contain . (dot). Thus it won't work. Perhaps $i (which is alias for getElementById) is what we need.

Also please double check you actually can have . in id attribute.
If it is permitted, I'd like bucket to be suffix of rather than prefix. I.e. "bucket_progress_container_" + bucketName

Line:780, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> +many. That was causing bug I was seeing.

Deserves separate commit I can quickly merge

Line:787, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> Loading can be changed to Starting...
