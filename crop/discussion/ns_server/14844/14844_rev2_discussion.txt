DESCRIPTION

Special case buckets key when logging config changes.

Since a value corresponding to 'buckets' key can be changed very often
during rebalance (which generates huge log files), we won't print full
vbucket map and fast forward map to the log. Instead, only diffs of
those will be printed.
