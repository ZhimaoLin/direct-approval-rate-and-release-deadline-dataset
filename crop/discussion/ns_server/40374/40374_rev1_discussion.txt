Line:700, priv/public/index.html -> incorrect here. On valueOnly policy it will say that Cache Metadata is Enabled, while in default eviction policy it will say "Cache Metadata: Disable".

IMHO it's bad name (CC-ed Anil), but in any case we saying that cache metadata is disabled for eviction policy that keeps all metadata in ram is wrong.
