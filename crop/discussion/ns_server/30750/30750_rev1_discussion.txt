NOTE: currently deleting a replication causes crash of xdc_vbucket_rep with badmatch

this problem existed before this change and should be addressed separately

see inline

Line:307, src/xdc_rdoc_replication_srv.erl -> no need to match for ok IMHO. There's possibility of race between grabbing list of docs and deleting them. So not_found is ok response

Line:87, src/menelaus_web_xdc_replications.erl -> user-visible log message here is important. I've seen you replaced it with plain info message. But that's not enough.
