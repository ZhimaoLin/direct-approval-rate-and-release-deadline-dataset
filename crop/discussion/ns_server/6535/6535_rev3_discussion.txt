Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

see comments, but most seriously lacks error handling

Line:9, priv/public/js/auto-failover.js -> this subscribe will make autoFailoverEnabled cell to be loaded at page load. This is bug. We commonly use DAL.cells.mode to detect if some particular cell needs to be loaded.

Line:28, priv/public/js/auto-failover.js -> errors need to be handled

Line:62, priv/public/js/auto-failover.js -> AFAIK this is unnecessary
