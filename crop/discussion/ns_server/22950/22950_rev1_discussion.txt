DESCRIPTION

MB-6726: avoid doing obviously duplicate set view config changes

capi_set_view_manager used to be completely statless doing all those
set views configuration change calls all the time.

I've found that by avoiding trivial duplication of calls we can
improve empty rebalance time significantly.

Approach is to keep last succeeded calls and their args in process
dictionary. Updating them after full pass over all ddocs and being
careful to reset them when any call produces exception.
