DESCRIPTION

bp:MB-9422 Fix recovery map generation.

Here's what recovery map generation code supposed to do:

 1. Figure out which nodes have more vbuckets than they would have
 if vbuckets were equally distributed.

 2. Distribute missing vbuckets among the underutilized nodes so that
 these nodes have more or less equal number of vbuckets.

Unfortunately the code was flawed. It assumed that it's never possible
to "run out" of missing vbuckets and that, basically, every node will
get at least some subset of them. Which is of course not true.

I removed the part that determined under/overutilized nodes and just
assume that since rebalance will be needed anyway, it's enough to just
not put on each node more vbuckets than it would have if the vbucket
map was balanced. I also replaced the call to lists:split to similar
function misc:safe_split. The difference is that the latter doesn't
crash if the list to split is larger than the split index.

I also added a test to verify for different input parameters recovery
map can be generated and that it assign every of the missing vbuckets
to some node.
