DESCRIPTION

set net_ticktime to 10 seconds. MB-2387

When node stops receiving any packets there's no way (other then
timeout) for TCP stack to know that it's stack. 'Hang' connections
cause problems in Erlang VM because erlang process trying to send
messages on such hang connection will block.

Erlang has it's own timeout which we lower to 10 seconds. So node will
be marked as down erlang cannot send anything to it for 10 seconds.
