DESCRIPTION

don't eject failed over nodes twice

This is unnecessary. May cause data loss on node being failed over (if
some automated system tries doing anything on it right after it being
failed over). And currently triggers memcached init/shutdown race (see
memcached commit c8f5e90ff432d2f3b4db1991c403b8fa9824d284).
