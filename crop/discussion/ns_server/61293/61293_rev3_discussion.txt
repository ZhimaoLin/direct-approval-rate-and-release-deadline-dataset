Line:161, src/ns_bucket.erl -> I meant a different thing when I tNathalie Landryed about disabling this in mixed clusters. It's totally fine to pass this all the time to the ep-engine. What I meant was that rest api should error out if somebody is trying to set timeSynchronization when the cluster is not fully watson. And btw, the latter change can be done separately. Just to give goxdcr folks something to work with.

Line:975, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> I understand why no default value works here. But I think it's better to provide out just for simplicity: once you look at the bucket config, you immediately know what the value is.

Also you need to add timeSynchronization to build_bucket_info output.
