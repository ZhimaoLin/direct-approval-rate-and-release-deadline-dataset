Thanks Artem, the config file looks good.  We should hopefully get my patch in later today.  So hopefully yours can go in shortly afterwards.

My erlang is not great :) so can I just confirm that with this patch you no longer require access to /etc/security/audit.json (In my patch I have left the file there because currently you make use of the file - I assume you copy it as a basis for your own version of the config file).

Once your change has gone in I will raise another patch which removes the generation of audit.json in /etc/security.

looks ok. For more future-compat I'd remove uneditable things such as version field from ns_config. It should be responsibility of us to convert whatever we have in ns_config to whatever is expected by memcached, which includes adding such artifacts as version field.

Line:212, src/ns_config_default.erl -> no need to put version here.
