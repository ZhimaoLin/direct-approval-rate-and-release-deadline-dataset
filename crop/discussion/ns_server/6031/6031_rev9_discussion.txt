Patch Set 9: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Here's my comments:

a) naming cells as done in analytics.js is a nice debugging tool

b) fetching buckets list again doesn't seem to make sense here. You can and should massage bucketListCell value

c) you should set _.isEqual trick I mentioned on IRC

d) the trickiest part is ordering between rendering template from bucketListCell value and your sparkline stuff. If you want to separate this (like to avoid excessive templates rendering) then you need to carefully order stuff, because cells doesn't provide you any guarantees here. You don't want e.g. to draw sparklines and have it erased by following template rendering, which will leave html without sparklines at all.

See GraphsWidget#renderAll for one of the ways to do order cells reactions. We can abstract that and do it much more cleaner, but that's some work. Ping me if you think abstraction is a very nice to have. I think I can do it quite easily.
