DESCRIPTION

MB-9154 wait for ns_stats_event from the correct node

- in case if stats are requested from the specific node
  (other than current node) menelaus_stats was waiting for
  ns_stats_event from the current node and then was retrieving
  samples from the node for which stats were requested.
  this doesn't guarantee that at least one sample that
  is later than ClientTStamp will be retrieved

- in this particular bug this led to different number of samples
  being retrieved for regular stats and for system stats.
  the conversion to JSON picks up one timestamp array out of the two
  (the one for regular stats, because it comes first)
  so for 2 timestamps we had just one entry for each system stat.
  since the client simply concatenates stat arrays the system stat
  samples were sliding against timestamps which caused
  visible graph sliding against the time grid

- also we don't have to drop the last sample if we retrieve
  stats just for one node

- this change effectively fixes the bug, but still there's
  theoretical possibility that extra sample for system stats
  will be archieved while we wait for the sample for regular
  stats. I will submit the safeguard agains such situation
  in the next commit

Patch Set 1:

It looks like it'll implicitly pass closure to remote node. I.e. as part of gen_event:add_sup_handler call

That's not backwards and forwards compatible. And apparently we'll have to find some other solution.
