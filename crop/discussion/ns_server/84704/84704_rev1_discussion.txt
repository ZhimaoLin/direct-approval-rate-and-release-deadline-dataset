DESCRIPTION

[async] Add an option to monitor started async.

It's not very useful with regular asyncs, since if there's any error,
it will get propagated once async:wait is called. If an async is used
only for its side-effect though and the caller doesn't intend to call
async:wait, it becomes useful.
