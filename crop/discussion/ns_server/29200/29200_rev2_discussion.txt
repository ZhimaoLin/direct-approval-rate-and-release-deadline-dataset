DESCRIPTION

MB-9154 ensure that stats rest api returns the same number of samples

... for system and for bucket stats

- this safeguard is needed since the sample retrieveing code
  does not guarantee that the same number of samples will be
  retrieved. so in the rare occasion when bucket or system stats
  will have extra sample, this extra sample will be discarded
