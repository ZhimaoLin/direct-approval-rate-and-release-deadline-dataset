DESCRIPTION

fixed js problem in concatenated all.js

Usual problem here:

var some = function () {}

gets concatenated with:

(function ($){})(jQuery)

and is interpreted as:

var some = (function (){})(function ($) {})(jQuery);

i.e. first function is invoked with second function as argument and
result is invoked with jQuery as argument
