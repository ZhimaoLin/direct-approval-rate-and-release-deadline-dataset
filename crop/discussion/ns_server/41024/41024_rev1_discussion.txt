DESCRIPTION

MB-12092: Display spatial view results

In 3.0 the spatial views return the `key` instead of the `bbox` as they
are now multidimensional and may contain more than two dimensions.

Skip and limit is supported and a bounding box doesn't need to be set,
this makes paging possible.

Alk, please add for review whoever makes sense. Once it's +2'ed I'll try to get an exception for 3.0.

Patch Set 1:

You have +2 in principle. But I strongly prefer not to backport anything. If it's 3.0 then it'll have to be merged for 3.0 first (and I'll be creating rel-3.0.0 branch shortly)
