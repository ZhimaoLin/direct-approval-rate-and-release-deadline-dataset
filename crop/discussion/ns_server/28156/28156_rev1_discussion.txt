Patch Set 1:

I'm quite concerned by increased round-trip latency dependency of this new code. We're going to ask for remote node's advertised version quite often.

We could relatively easily remove that by putting version into hearbeats so that we can get it from local ns_doctor.

I'm going to measure that issue.

Here's what I've got (run_in_ns.rb empty rebalance 1 -> 2).

rebalance with patch:
---------------------

15:31:40 - 15:34:12 = 2:32

15:45:34 - 15:48:09 = 2:35


rebalance without patch:
------------------------

15:50:32 - 15:52:58 = 2:26

15:57:30 - 16:00:01 = 2:31

So difference is visible but not that big

works. Lets not forget to make it work without remote calls if compat mode is 3.0 (which is the case for master already).
