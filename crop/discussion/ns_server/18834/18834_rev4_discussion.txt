DESCRIPTION

CBD-378 Basic integration of XDCR code and remote_clusters_info.

I just made it work in the most straightforward way. Currently XDCR
code doesn't use remote_cluster_info ability of caching vbucket maps
and just always fetches vbucket map from remote cluster. Additionally,
vbucket map can contain 'undefined' values which are not handled by
XDCR code.
