DESCRIPTION

mechanism to stop old xdcr replications after upgrade

- upgrade should set {node, node(), stop_xdcr} = true
- when this key is set to true the goxdcr replication is not allowed
- xdc_rep_manager will stop all reps and delete this key, when it
  will detect that this key is set to true
- this way goxdcr will be started only after xdcr reps are properly
  shut down
