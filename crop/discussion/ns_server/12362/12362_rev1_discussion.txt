DESCRIPTION

Use state announced via set_vbucket event.

With explicit sync right before some vbucket goes dead it's no need
anymore to re-read the state from vbucket. And actually this sync
before going dead used to work incorrectly because the state stored in
vbucket was always something different than 'dead'.
