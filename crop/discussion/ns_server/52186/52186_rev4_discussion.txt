Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

This patch has a lot of issues. I have uploaded my own version of such functionality, comparing these changes you will see the issues.
The most significant of them are:
1. template should be in separate html file
2. your implementation shows nested array as json string instead of nested table eg.
[{"address": ["Laurierstraat 230", {"aaa": "aaaaaaaaaaaaa"}]}]
3. collapsible text should be realized as a module
4. code style
My change still has some issues with "track by" therefor I marked it as wip, but it works and you can try it. Also development of new functionality better start from spec in order to allow other folks review it.
