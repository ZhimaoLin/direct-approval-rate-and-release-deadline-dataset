DESCRIPTION

CBD-378 A service to access remote clusters information.

Provides several functions to fetch information about remote clusters
and remote clusters' buckets. Whenever this information is inquired
it's cached locally. So that next queries could be served from this
cache. In case the client finds out the provided information to be
inconsistent it can force remote_cluster_info to go to the remote
cluster to get up-to-date data.

Patch Set 1:

Overall, that's brilliant work as usual. Great job.

Few comments:

* config upgrade service commit is good, but vbucket map history thing needs to be fixed when we're just adding 2.0 node to 1.8.0 cluster. Can be part of next commit(s)

* when determining 'live' design docs and replication target references you're matching on _info_ regexp. That's not quite correct. Because we don't intend to delete info docs for quite long time. Perhaps replication docs itself should be scanned. And finding them is possible via type: "xdc" attribute.

* remote json "parsing" code is brilliant use of continuation passing style. However, more "classical" exceptions handling seemingly fits this problem better. I don't think you need to bother fixing it however. It's not broken.

* there's small typo: is_cluster_config_udpate_required

* most important thing is some API documentation

my understanding is Through argument needs to be set to true when XDCR manager thinks previous replication failed because of potentially stale information right? This should be explicitly documented.

It also makes lots of sense to add single line comment for some key internal functions too. Particularly helpers for json parsing.
