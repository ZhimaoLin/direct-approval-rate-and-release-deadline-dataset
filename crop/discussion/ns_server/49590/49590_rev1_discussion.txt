DESCRIPTION

better way to show up spinner

JQ returns 0 for height and width of container
in case of container parent uses display none.
With this change spinner only rely on relative
position of parent. Also in this case js can not calculate
line-height of the spinner container therefore
message 'Loading...' is removed from container.
