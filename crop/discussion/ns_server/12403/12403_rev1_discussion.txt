Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

400 is a bad status code for node being down. 5xx is for such cases.

Also doesn't handle nodedown everywhere. Particularly I'm getting 'you specified invalid id' when I'm looking up document on down node. And document editing doesn't show me anything. At all.

Also there's related issue of handling node that's not down but is warming up.

Patch Set 1:

agreed that 400 isnt a good return, I had planned to use 502, but since the request object isnt in scope it requires patching couchdb to be able to throw a relevant error, will do that
