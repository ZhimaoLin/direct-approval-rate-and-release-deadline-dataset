This handles defined and arbitrary errors in the views document editing ui and the document editing ui, it does not distinguish between arbitrary and warmup errors (follow up commit)

Patch Set 2:

also I'm getting multiple node down messages. When node is SIGSTOP-ped and it's memcached is murdered. Those multiple messages are due to lack of any progress indication and due to multiple outstanding doc loading requests
