DESCRIPTION

Use stricter balancedness test when building vbucket map history.

In some circumstances ns_rebalancer:unbalanced treats vbucket map with
some undefined active nodes (including master) as balanced. We don't
want such a map be in a history because mb_map:vbucket_movements will
fail on it.

Patch Set 1:

unfortunately for some cases our own generated map will not "pass" this test.

So for this cases swap rebalance and failover/add-back won't work efficiently.

We may want to fix ns_rebalancer:unbalanced instead
