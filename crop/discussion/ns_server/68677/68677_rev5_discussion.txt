DESCRIPTION

MB-21147: Support conflict_resolution_type bucket parameter.

[1] Added a new bucket parameter called conflict_resolution_type to
    the REST APIs. By default this parameter will set to 'seqno'.

[2] The other value that this parameter would accept is 'lww'. This
    value will only be accepted if the cluster is running enterprise
    edition or else the bucket creation API would fail.

[3] Once set the conflict_resolution_type bucket parameter cannot
    be altered and the bucket update API would fail if an attempt
    is made.

Patch Set 5:

All the tests pass in simple-test except the XDCR ones. They fail with the following error:

"Failed to add node 127.0.0.1:9001 to cluster. This node cannot add another node xxx@xxx.xxx because of cluster version compatibility mismatch (1 =/= 262149)"

I quickly tried running the same tests without my changes and I still get the same error.

PS: I am not able to build correctly after my OS upgrade.

Patch Set 5: Verified+1

I rolled back to El-Capitan version. After a clean build the simple-test now fails with "Replication between buckets with different TimeSynchronization setting is not allowed". goxdcr code is using TimeSync parameter. I spoke to Yu about it and he said that they'll be working on it.

So, I think it's ok commit this.

But we'll immediately get a report about broken commit validation. We need to wait until goxdcr adjusts their code to understand new parameter.
