DESCRIPTION

MB-21147: Support conflict_resolution_type bucket parameter.

[1] Added a new bucket parameter called conflict_resolution_type to
    the REST APIs. By default this parameter will set to 'seqno'.

[2] The other value that this parameter would accept is 'lww'. This
    value will only be accepted if the cluster is running enterprise
    edition or else the bucket creation API would fail.

[3] Once set the conflict_resolution_type bucket parameter cannot
    be altered and the bucket update API would fail if an attempt
    is made.

Patch Set 1:

When the user upgrades to 4.6 from 4.5 for all the existing buckets we would drop the "time_synchronization" parameter and pass the default value for the "conflict_resolution_type" parameter (which is seqno) in the bucket config string. In ns_config however the "time_synchronization" parameter remains and the "conflict_resoluton_type" parameter will not be added. For all the newly created buckets only "conflict_resolution_type" parameter will be present in ns_config. Is this behavior alright?

Line:193, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> This pattern is repeated in at least two places. So would be nice to have a convenience function in ns_bucket to return the conflict resolution type.

Line:195, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> You don't really need to do this. The json library we use handles atoms just fine.

Line:1000, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> I thought we were going to support updates too.
