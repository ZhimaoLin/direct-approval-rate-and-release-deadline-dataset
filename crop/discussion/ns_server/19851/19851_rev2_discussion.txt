DESCRIPTION

MB-6308: try defining index after getting view_undefined error

Because we're now iterating all indexes that ddoc replication service
knows it's possible to try to do something on index that we haven't
defined yet.

Proposed fix is after getting view_undefined error, to try to define
view and then retry.
