DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Clear reprovision count after rebalance.

We allow auto-reprovisioning to be done on 'max_nodes' #
of nodes & we track the actual number of nodes that have
been auto-reprovisioned in ns_config. If we have reached
the 'max_nodes' limit then we don't perform any more
auto-reprovisioning. This count needs to be cleared after
the buckets are rebalanced.
