DESCRIPTION

Disable delayed_commits

This tremendously aids in DB LRU functionality and given our usage
shouldn't be a huge burden on write performance.  Still working on
getting delayed_commits *and* the LRU to play nicely together.

Patch Set 2: Fails

Ok, trying it on the latest build with a stat fix and the behavior I see:

•	Loading 1M items, drain rate is 0 until the load is done – no memory change on beam.smp (basically nothing happens)
•	As soon as the load is done, disk drain rate increase to about 5K until about half of the items are drained
•	During that time memory usage increased to ~500m

•	After that drain rate goes to 0 with burst of 1K exactly every 15 seconds
•	Machine is 10.2.1.13

Patch Set 2:

This sounds like a reasonable fail.  delayed_commits seems pretty important for operation of the service.

Patch Set 2:

Many hours later, queue is still not drained and drain rate is actually 0 for hours. mem usage:

Patch Set 2:

delayed_commits=false seems particularly terrible in our app.  I wouldn't expect it to cause so many problems.  I wonder if there was some other failure occurring, perhaps due to timeouts.
