Line:46, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> I think this is not the right place for this code. Lets move it to menelaus_web.

Patch Set 7:

Well... I cannot find any comment about it on gerrit so I don't know Aliakseys reasoning.

My reasoning is: 
1. set_credentials should do what it's name says it does
2. ns_config_auth deals with credentials in the config, not with uuids
3. ns_config_auth:set_credentials is used 5 times in the code, and only in 1 of these 5 situations uuid will be generated

So basically somebody who reads the code would not expect uuid set in set_credentials call.

Patch Set 7:

Well, I didn't ask to move it to ns_config_auth, I just said that I believe that it would be better to generate the uuid when the credentials are set and not lazily how it was before. But at the same time I'm not dead against the lazy version.
