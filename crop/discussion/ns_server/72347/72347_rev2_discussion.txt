Patch Set 2:

Fixed everything except for

> tap type in mc_client_binary:set_engine_param/4. It looks like we actually use only vbucket type.

We also use flush. To me it seems more intuitive to leave the types that we don't use, than to have "skips" in the type codes. But it's of course a matter of taste.
