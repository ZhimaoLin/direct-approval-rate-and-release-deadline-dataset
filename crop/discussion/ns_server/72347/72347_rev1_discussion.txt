There's also some tap related stuff left after this commit:
log_tap_stats and TAP_STATS_LOGGING_INTERVAL in ns_vbucket_mover
tap_noop_interval, tap_keepalive in ns_bucket. Do we still need to supply these parameters to memcached?
ep_tap_keepalive stat
tap type in mc_client_binary:set_engine_param/4. It looks like we actually use only vbucket type.
