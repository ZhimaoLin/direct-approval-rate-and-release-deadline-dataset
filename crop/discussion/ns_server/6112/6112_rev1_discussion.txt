DESCRIPTION

made ns_config:merge_remote asynchronous

We don't consume it's results. So making ns_config_rep wait on it's
result makes little sense.

Line:116, src/ns_config.erl -> Not sure I like this pattern of changing gen_server:call() to !

Stylistically, the former, with it's 16 or so more characters, brutally reminds me that there's gen_server machinery involved.

Like static typing, it gives a theatrical, imaginary feeling of safety.
