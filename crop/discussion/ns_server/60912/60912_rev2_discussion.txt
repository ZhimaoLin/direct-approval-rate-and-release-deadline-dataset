DESCRIPTION

MB-18448 Allow changing memcached parameters globally.

This changes ns_ports_setup:memcached_config logic to look more like
the one that we have in 4.*. Specifically, memcached parameters
can be changed both on a per node level ({node, node(), memcached}
key) and globally (memcached key). In addition, our default values go
into {node, node(), memcached_defaults}. This allows us to upgrade
defaults without overriding user-set values.

The change requires introducing new config version. Which means that
offline upgrading to 4.0 and 4.1.0 is not possible. Online upgrade
will work, but the changes will be lost.
