Patch Set 5:

great stuff. I think we may want to have some naive code that attempts to minimize difference with current map. I think we can simply reuse existing code for now

Patch Set 5:

I decided not to do this since eventually vbmap is supposed to handle this. But if we cannot make it before 3.0 then we can always fallback to current approach. Besides, it's not clear how much current approach helps and if it helps at all given that it considers only two randomized maps.

Patch Set 5:

I'm nearly ready to agree.

However, here's my thinking.

We want to merge this stuff so that people can start testing star earlier. And I don't think we can afford major rebalance time regressions, which could penalize work in other areas.

So I think some naive code to minimize movements makes sense. Just copy of what mb_map does I think should be fine.
