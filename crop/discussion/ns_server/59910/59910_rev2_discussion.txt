DESCRIPTION

MB-18093: make forestdb the default storage type

This change makes forestdb the default storage type during cluster
initialization and when index nodes are being added to the cluster
for the first time. This is a UI only change -- the only effect is
that the user doesn't have to select the appropriate radio button
if she wishes to pick up the default.

I left the cluster settings page alone for now and we can discuss
withPM and Rob on what to do there.
