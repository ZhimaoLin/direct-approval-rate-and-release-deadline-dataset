Line:44, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> How is this related to the mnPoll?
If this fixes some issue in the existing code, it should be a separate commit.

Line:16, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/mn_buckets_controller.js -> Why is it here? How it is related to this commit?
If you put TODO in the code, please make it detailed enough, so anyone can understand what should be done.
