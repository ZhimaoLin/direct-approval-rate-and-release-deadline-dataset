DESCRIPTION

Generate revids on CAPI side for CRUD.

In order to avoid calling sync for every CRUD operation to get the
revision we now generate revisions in CAPI and use
{add,set,delete}_with_meta commands to set this revision to
ep-engine.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved

Line:58, src/capi_crud.erl -> indeed. It's using RAND_pseudo_bytes so not too strongly secure and thus hopefully fast enough.
