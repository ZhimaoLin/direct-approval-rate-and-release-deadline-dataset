DESCRIPTION

Generate revids on CAPI side for CRUD.

In order to avoid calling sync for every CRUD operation to get the
revision we now generate revisions in CAPI and use
{add,set,delete}_with_meta commands to set this revision to
ep-engine.

Line:57, src/capi_crud.erl -> ok to merge, but I'm nearly 100% it'll slow us down. crypto rnd is known to be slow in general. Not sure if that applies to erlang crypto-rng

Line:61, src/capi_crud.erl -> Quite confusing name IMHO. It does more than just encoding revid and in non-deterministic way.

Line:57, src/capi_crud.erl -> On my not so fast laptop I can generate 500k CASs per second.

Line:61, src/capi_crud.erl -> Made encode_revid pure. And just pass cas() as an argument.
