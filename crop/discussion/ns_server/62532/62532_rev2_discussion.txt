See inline.

Line:322, cbcollect_info -> You should either add this to the dump-guts script (harder), or just use ns_server rest api to get the list of design documents.

Line:335, cbcollect_info -> No /diag/eval-s here please. Change dump-guts to return the port.

Line:344, cbcollect_info -> If you actually want to log something, use log().

Line:322, cbcollect_info -> Curious, why do you think current implementation is a problem? Is it because it isn't a good idea to rely on master.couch.* file (because sometimes cbcollects have entries missing from ddocs.log)?

Line:344, cbcollect_info -> Should have taken it out, added for debug
