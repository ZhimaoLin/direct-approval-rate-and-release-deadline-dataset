Line:322, cbcollect_info -> No need to change it, but I think it's always good to get ideas from different coding styles. I would have written something like that:

    buckets = correct_split(buckets, ",")
    memcached_buckets = correct_split(memcached_buckets, ",")
    couchbase_buckets = set(buckets) - set(memcached_buckets)
    for bucket in couchbase_buckets:

Line:333, cbcollect_info -> I would rename it to `make_task`, that's esier to grep and less general.

Line:334, cbcollect_info -> Are the ports in cbcollect_info always hard-coded? This means you can't collect infos from a ./cluster_run cluster (I really don't know if that's supported at all).

Please keep lines < 80 characters.

Line:335, cbcollect_info -> Are the escapes of the single quotes (`'`) needed?

Line:338, cbcollect_info -> Please keep it <80 characters.

Although I like list comprehension, I think a nested one is way harder to parse than a normal loop. I would write it as:

    tasks = []
    for bucket in bucket_ddoc_map:
        for ddoc_name in bucket_ddoc_map[bucket]:
           tasks.append(make_task(bucket, ddoc_name))
    return tasks

Line:747, cbcollect_info -> Please keep lines < 80 characters.

Thanks Volker for review

Line:333, cbcollect_info -> Done

Line:334, cbcollect_info -> memcached/moxi/rest/projector ports need not to be hardcoded because dict obtained from initargs captures them. But unfortunately to get capi_port, I *think* it would require nested list of tuples within ns_config or fire a diag eval call like below:

% curl --data "erlang:element(2, ns_config:search({node, hd(erlang:element(2, ns_config:search(nodes_wanted))), capi_port}))." -u Administrator:asdasd http://localhost:9000/diag/eval
9500
%

Would use this diag call for now(unless ns_server folks think there is an easier way)

I wanted to follow < 80 chars limit but then I saw many preexisting offending entries :) I will follow <80 limit

Line:335, cbcollect_info -> Added the so that nutshell could easily use it as delimiter while parsing the log message. Looks like its redundant.

Line:338, cbcollect_info -> Done

Line:747, cbcollect_info -> Done
