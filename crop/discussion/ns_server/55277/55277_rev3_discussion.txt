Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

See how angular.js team writes tests. Your change has several issues
- Style. We use indentation equal to double space. Variable name should looks like variableName instead of variable_name.
- I'm not sure what is better mn_http_test or mn_http_spec
- You shouldn't cover angular stuff. It's already covered there https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/test/ng/timeoutSpec.js
- Your tests do not cover all functionality.

For example list of tests for mnHttp:
- it should be properly initialized (where we check that module has all necessary methods and properties)

then you should check all logic in mnHttp function like
 - it should be able to cancel previous post
 - it should be able to send application/x-www-form-urlencoded (where you check this fuction with isNotForm flag and without it)
 - it should be canceled by timeout
 - it should be put in pendingQueryKeeper
 - it should be properly cleared

then you should check how pendingQueryKeeper works
- it should be able to attach pending queries to scope
- it should be able to mark query as independent of scope
- it should be able to cancel query on scope destroy

Patch Set 3:

- it shouldn't cancel query if it marked as independent of scope

Patch Set 3:

- it should be put in pendingQueryKeeper
Actually it's impossible to check this one directly but it's possible indirectly using attachPendingQueriesToScope. So therefore it's not required.

- it should be properly cleared
This one also can be checked indirectly. For example we can check that timeout was cancelled once but not twice. And probably we can mock q.defer in order to spy on it.

I can try to do it tomorrow.
