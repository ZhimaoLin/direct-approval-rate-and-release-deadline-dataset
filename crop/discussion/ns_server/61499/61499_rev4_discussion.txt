DESCRIPTION

reduce amount of requests: mnPoller superseded by mnPoolDefault events

Taking into consideration the fact that the mnPoolDefault
and mnTasksDetails are always relevant we can use cached
value of those services throughout the application. All we need
to know when the change is happened and then recalculate new value,
that is why we use broadcast in mnAdminController.

It reminds how Cell based application works but instead of reactive
values we use angular events. I would like to mention that we could use
scope.$watch instead of scope.broadcast/scope.on like
scope.$watch("poolDefault.serverGroupsUri", function () {
   //do something when serverGroupsUri changed
});
but I don't think that we should because:
1) it dependents on data in scope
2) we already use promiseHelper.broadcast in some places

benefits:
1) reduced amount of requests to the server
2) we know exactly when to fetch new data form the server instead of dumb periodic polling
3) now all tabs are sync, because mnPoolDefault is sync.

There is new guy called debounceAndSubscribeOnRootScopeEvents. It's using
lodash debounce because events can be triggered almost at the same time
in case when subscriber subscribed on couple of events, so debounce
allows only one event during some period, e.g. 1 sec in our case.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Hi Pavel. From an approach standpoint I like what you're trying to do in terms of replacing pollers with debounced subscriptions to root scope events. Obviously there's some risk to doing this as this is a pretty huge change. Noticed a couple of UI problems:
(1) if you bounce a node and log in after it comes up and stay on the overview page, the "servers down" never goes to zero by itself as the nodes warm up (this was the bug you recently fixed, of course)
(2) if you remain on the indexes tab and you add a GSI index the screen never updates either -- you need to click away and come back. 

Can you take a look at these 2 issues? Also: can you look at the other areas where the updates may not be happening automatically? (E.g. views, XDCR, buckets, server nodes, security ...)
