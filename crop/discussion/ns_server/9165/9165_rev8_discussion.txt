Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

I would strongly prefer cleaner implementation. There's no need to update url when somebody visits analytics. See inline comment for right place.

Also I'm not sure how this logic is not confusing when we remember some stat name and then visit bucket where that stat name is absent.

Line:528, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> the right place to do "default selected graph" logic would be here
