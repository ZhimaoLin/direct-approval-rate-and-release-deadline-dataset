I think this API should require login and some sort of a permission check. cluster.pools!read at least.

Patch Set 1:

Why do we need a separate endpoint? Can't we just make already existent property in pool info non-ui-only.

Patch Set 1:

I thought that if there is ever a need to provide verbose info about the balanced states (at a level per bucket/service level) then it can be built on top of it.

But I guess the same can be added to the existing stats output too.
