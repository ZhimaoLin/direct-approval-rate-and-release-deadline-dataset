DESCRIPTION

spock-ui:MB-20870: remove max/min attrs from number inputs

max/min attrs are only useful during validation on UI side because
angular removes the value if it goes beyond borders. In that case
the error can be inconsistent since user can input any value in number
field avoiding arrows controls.
