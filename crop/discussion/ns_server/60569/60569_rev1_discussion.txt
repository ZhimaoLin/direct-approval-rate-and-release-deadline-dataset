See inline. Also, like I said before, warming_up (as returned by ns_memcached:local_connected_and_list_vbuckets) is another condition that we do expect and should retry on.

I'm getting a little concerned that this change might be to risky for a minor release like 4.1.1.

A simple and safer change that I'd be more comfortable with in a minor release is making sure that wait_for_bucket handles "stop rebalance" button properly. That way even if it ends up in an infinite loop, it can always be interrupted.

This particular I still find valuable, but we probably should do it for watson to have enough time to find potential regressions.

Line:109, src/Harley Martinitor_agent.erl -> Typo in noproc.

Patch Set 1:

With warming_up, I thought You meant the one returned by query_buckets_loop when Type=up.

I wasn't aware that query_bucket_states could return warming_up, (coming from ns_memcached:local_connected.....

I fail to see how query_vbucket_states can return false, so why is query_bucket_states_loop checking for false?

So in that case warming_up was previously mistaken for an exception. Is that a bug or is it supposed to work that way?

There are two retry loops, Harley Martinitor_agent:query_bucket_states_loop and ns_rebalancer:do_wait_for_bucket.
So for which cases should either loop retry?
