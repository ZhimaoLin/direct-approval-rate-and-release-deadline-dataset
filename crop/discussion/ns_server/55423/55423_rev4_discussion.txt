DESCRIPTION

Add support for Karma/Jasmine unit tests & tests for mn_http.js

Tests added covering much of the functionality in mn_http.js
Also: Karma/Jasmine unit test config file and README
Also: CMake and Makefile targets for angular unit tests

New CMake target ns_ui_test running the test of the same name.
New GNUMakefile ui_test target that runs the cmake target ns_ui_test,
which is done in the same manner as make test runs the cmake target
ns_test.

please take a look on how I see it http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/55431/1/priv/public/angular/spec/mn_http_spec.js. Some comments inline.

Line:5, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> It's not our business. Angular takes care of that.

Line:6, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> function sleep(milliseconds) or if it's unnamed - function (milliseconds).  This function should not be here.

Line:18, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> We can check it once in "should have the right methods" like:
expect(mnHttp).toEqual(jasmine.any(Function));

Line:19, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> I'm not agree that we should change current API in order to satisfy unit tests.

Line:25, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> better to use angular.forEach because it reduces the number of dependencies.

Line:41, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> We shouldn't check how angular $httpBackend works.

Line:139, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> should be expectPOST

do you think that we should keep spec file in folder with application? I think better to have them all in one place like folder /spec

Line:34, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> you should use $httpBackend.expect and verify that it was made using
verifyNoOutstandingExpectation not using mnHttp.getPendingQueryCount()

Line:58, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> expectGET because we should be sure that it was called once

Line:65, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> better check that error handler was called with status 0

Line:72, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> it will always be succeed because you are using $httpBackend.whenGET instead of $httpBackend.expectGET

Line:91, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> We shouldn't test how $timeout behaves and how time behaves in jasmine.

Line:130, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> did you saw this http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Mocking_the_JavaScript_Timeout_Functions ?

Line:143, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> you should check it once  and not toBeDefined() but expect(mnHttp.get().then).toEqual(jasmine.any(Function))

Line:145, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> you shouldn't check how promise works. you should just check that it should post form-urlencoded

Line:102, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> What is the purpose of wrapping timeout into response of http?

Line:130, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_http_spec.js -> and this one http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Asynchronous_Support
