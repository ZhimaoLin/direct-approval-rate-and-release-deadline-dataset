DESCRIPTION

actually delete buckets when node is failed over

Not just shutdown ns_memcached. Right now we shutdown ns_memcached,
delete bucket without force option but leave data files. Those files
are deleted when node is finally ejected, but if user does add-back
instead it leads to lengthy warmup of those data files. Essentially
not allowing rebalance without good reason.
