See inline comment on how you don't need extra functions exported from couch_upr.

Line:43, src/xdc_upr_server.erl -> As you connect right after the init, you could just call `couch_upr:init(<<"connection-name">>, list_to_binary(Bucket))` here as you need the Pid of it later anyway (I don't really know how you got it working without that pid).

This way the open_connection and auth_sasl doesn't need to be exported from couch_upr as it is dealt within the couch_upr:init/2 function.

Line:43, src/xdc_upr_server.erl -> The thing is there isn't any logging within that init function. XDCR prefer call sasl_auth and open_connection seperately in case something wrong happens, we have something in log.

Line:43, src/xdc_upr_server.erl -> There's indeed a lack of logging in couch_upr. Just add it there. For debug logs use `?LOG_DEBUG("the message: ~p", [SomeVar])`. You don't need a trailing `~n` for the message.
