DESCRIPTION

Let sinks use raw logging call information if they need it.

To achieve this we introduce two sink types. Namely 'preformatted' and
'raw'. A sink of 'preformatted' type just gets fully formatted message
(formatted by logger formatter). On the contrary, sinks of 'raw' type
get formatted user message and additional information about the
logging call (see #log_info{} in ale.hrl). Thus such a sink can use
this information to format the message in the way it likes.
