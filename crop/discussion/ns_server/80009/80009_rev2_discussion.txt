Patch Set 2:

Ollie - we'll support Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2 and Windows 10 Anniversary. I would imagine these support the -t flag -- but did you get a chance to check?

Patch Set 2: -Verified

Good point - I've checked 2012 R2. I've also got a Windows 10 Anniversary machine at home I can test on. However I don't currently have a 2016 machine to test on, is there one on the VPN that I can RDP in to?

Patch Set 2:

Well, I gotta believe if 2012 R2 supports the flag, 2016 must have it. The docs on this are pretty bad. This page from Microsoft that looks pretty authoritative doesn't mention the -t flag: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat. 

This MS blog article shows usage screen shots from 2012 R2 and Windows 10 indicating that it is supported on these OSes: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rmilne/2016/12/05/new-netstat-options/. 

So, I think we should be fine. 

Follow-up question is whether we should also add the -b flag so we can grab the executable name as we do on unix systems. Looks to also work on each of the 5.0 OSes.

Patch Set 2:

I tested -t on my Windows 10 system at home and it works, so it looks like we're good.

-b works on my 2012 R2 VM as well, so I'll update the patch with that flag
