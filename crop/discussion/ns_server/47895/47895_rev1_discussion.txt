Patch Set 1:

still see couple of error traces from ns_heart when goxdcr is getting restarted due to race between goxdcr and babysitter

Patch Set 1:

I'd like to avoid an extra rpc call to the babysitter. Why not just check that clusterMembership is active and that kv service is present on the node (and the latter can actually be cached)? And we can ignore all the other possibilities like goxdcr being restarted because they are not common and don't last long.

Patch Set 1:

goxdcr is actually running on non kv nodes. I guess it's needed because we want XDCR UI to work on non kv nodes
