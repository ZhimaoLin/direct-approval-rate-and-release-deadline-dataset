Looks good. But see inline.

Line:398, src/ns_cluster.erl -> This looks a little bit like a duplication of what ns_node_disco does already. Maybe it would make sense to do away with this case whatsoever and let ns_node_disco do the job. I believe it would work without any changes in ns_node_disco itself. Let me know what you think.
