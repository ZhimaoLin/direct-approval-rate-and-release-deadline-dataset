DESCRIPTION

[bp] fixed long polling timeouts during rebalance

2.0 rebalance performs incremental vbucket map updates this is causing
constant stream of menelaus_event notifications. Old
handle_pool_info_wait could delay long polling reply infinitely when
this happens. This was visible as "Lost connection to..." thing on UI
due to long polling request timing out.
