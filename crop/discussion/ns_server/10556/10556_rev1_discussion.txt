DESCRIPTION

don't overload replication manager with irrelevant config events

Now subscribe handler only sends {buckets, _} config updates to
replication manager. Which is the only config change event that's
handled by it.

Another change is consuming of all outstanding {buckets, _} events, so
that sequence of rapid buckets config changes do not cause unneeded
and unnecessary CPU load.
