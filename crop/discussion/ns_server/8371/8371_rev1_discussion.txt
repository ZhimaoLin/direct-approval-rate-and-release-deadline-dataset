Patch Set 1: Fails

Known issue: currently a sample doc is auto-loaded with the page by the "#preview_sampe_doc" button being trigger('click')'ed. For some reason, CodeMirror isn't getting displayed when that happens. In Firefox, you can click on another open tab (if you have one) and click back to the one with Couchbase in it, and the editors display fine. In Chrome you have to click "Edit" then "Save" and the the editor (for sample docs) appears. For the map/reduce views you can use the drop-down to pick a different design doc, and the editors for the map/reduce will work fine.

There's likely a better way (or time) to trigger these editors that would avoid that problem.
