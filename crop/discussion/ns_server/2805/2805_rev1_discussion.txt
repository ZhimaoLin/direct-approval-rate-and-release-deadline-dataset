DESCRIPTION

Bug 2537: Make stats_archiver not hang on mnesia problems

Transaction retries and multi_call timeout default to
infinity. Limited retries to 10 and set a timeout of five seconds.

We already have mnesia's max_wait_for_decision set to ten seconds, so
transactions themselves should never hang for longer than that.
