Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

May I request reason for that commit in commit message?

I see some explanation in CBD but that's not public.

Also I'm not sure such cheating is what we really need.

Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)

Also see inline.

And let me add a bit more on topic itself. How about considering not sending ensure_full_commit in replicator code instead ? That can be somewhat useful in production as well.

Line:165, src/capi_frontend.erl -> info is too high log level here. Debug feels more correct

Patch Set 4:

The reason is to speed up some test by turning off ensure_full_commit.  We do not need the checkpointing stuff in most test cases. 

By default, ensure_full_commit is on in production system.

I'd like this to be mentioned in commit message. Also how big is the difference. I can't believe it's big enough to risk reduced test coverage.

Patch Set 4:

As of "not sending ensure_full_commit code", I am not sure what the difference it is going to make. You may want to create another commit to do that if necessary.

Patch Set 4: Do not submit

Discussed with Junyi. We have quite significant disagreement on this and I don't see good enough reason for this commit.

Damien, I still feel it would be nice to have such control parameter as we discussed yesterday. 

Please clarify with Alk when you get chance. Thanks.

Patch Set 4:

These reasoning behind this is speed up basic replication tests, where waiting for the ep-engine checkpointing code will slow down the tests significantly. Speeding up the basic smoke test is a valuable thing, it allows more tests to be run and encourages them to be run more frequently. And since we check the target and source for the same documents, we'll detect crashes that this code is also supposed to also be durable against.

I agree with Alk, we should similar comments to the commit message.

>> we'll detect crashes that this code is also supposed to also be durable against.

disagree with that. Checkpointing replication without actually commiting anything to disk is not going to be durable.

If we want more speed:

a) find out why ensure_full_commit is a performance problem, there's nothing fundamentally slow about it

b) make checkpointing interval more configurable. Checkpointing less often _is_ going to be both durable and faster. And can be _very_ helpful in the field.

perhaps it's time to consider abandoning it?

We have a bit too much unreviewed stuff in gerrit
