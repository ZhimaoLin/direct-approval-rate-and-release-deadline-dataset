thats api change. It would be wiser to keep old REST endpoint while advertising new

Patch Set 1:

What is the concern to fix this incorrect API name?

If the old API is incorrectly named as  "XCDR", IMHO we should fix it as early as possible.

Patch Set 1:

This typo is our mistake, we need to fix it.  People should not keep using the incorrect API forever, at some point they need to dump the old and get the correct one. For me, the earlier we fix it, the better because less scope of impact. 

I am afraid that if you keep this incorrect name in 2.0.2, more and more people will use that incorrect API, and it would even harder to fix it in future.

Patch Set 1:

my point is not keeping old api forever but introduce correct api today and kill old in a year or two
