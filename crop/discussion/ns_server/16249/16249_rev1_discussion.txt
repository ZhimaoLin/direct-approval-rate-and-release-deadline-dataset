Patch Set 1:

ideally this could should handle missing buckets & design docs by returning 404 instead of crashing

Also we have 'tradition' (caused by REST principles) of "advertising" our links so that client code doesn't have to build urls. That can be added later though. Especially for design doc compaction request url.
