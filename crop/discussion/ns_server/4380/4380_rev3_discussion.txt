DESCRIPTION

make sure erlang VMs get SIGHUP when cluster_run script dies

This is same approach as was used by ruby script. We're creating
process that's member of our process group and that's stopped. When
our process group become orphaned, i.e. either script parent or script
itself dies, the whole group is sent SIGCONT & SIGHUP.

This is according to POSIX. See
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/exit.html

This makes script more robust by 'handling' SIGKILL and other
unexpected causes of script death.
