DESCRIPTION

Bug 1639: Allow failover if you have more than one node

This doesn't make it so we don't lose data if you have replica count =
2 and lose two nodes, though. I'll have to fix that in another change.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I was going to nak this because it runs Harley Martinitor, but in my testing it appears that janitor runs are very quick now. So it's not a problem.
