DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: prevent vbucket filter change socket to be used twice

It's not normally possible, but just in case lets prevent it.

If for some reason get_downstream is requested by multiple processes,
previous implementation would give that same(!) downstream to all of
them. Potentially causing even more confusing bug.
