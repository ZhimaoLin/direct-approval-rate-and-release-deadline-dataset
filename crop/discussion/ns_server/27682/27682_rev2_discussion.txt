Patch Set 2: Verified+1

my thinking is we can ignore non-gnu systems in this place. At least for now

Patch Set 2:

Actually, it seems that "tail -n +10" can be used instead of head. And it's in POSIX. So no need to depend on GNU.

One other small concern is what will happen if someone already has more than 10 crash dumps. They will all be lexicographically smaller than the ones with new naming (current date %+s is 1374861650). So we won't delete them.

Meanwhile, I realized that even date %+s won't work on non-GNU systems. So I guess you're right that it's easier to ignore this at least for now.

Patch Set 2:

not sure if I'm right, but tail can only show stuff we want to _keep_.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

You're right. I misinterpreted head -n -10. It means that there's no issue with old crash dumps. And btw, to achieve the same behaviour with tail one can just reverse the order of sort.
