see inline

Line:107, couchbase-server.sh.in -> I'm not sure if we want to be POSIX compliant here. But if we do, then we should devise some other way of doing this. Because POSIX sort doesn't have -g flag, head's -n accepts only positive numbers, xargs doesn't have -r flag.

Besides, according to sort's info for -g:

Lines that do not start with numbers (all considered to be equal)

So it seems that it doesn't do what you want.

Patch Set 1:

good point. Particularly bsd's head doesn't support feature we  need. Other issues are easily addressable.
