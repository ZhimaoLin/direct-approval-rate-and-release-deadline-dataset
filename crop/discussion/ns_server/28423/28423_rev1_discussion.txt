I think that it would be very helpful if you described the reasoning behind this change in the commit message.

Line:194, src/xdc_rdoc_replication_srv.erl -> Since xdc_rep_manager starts before this process and it always ensures that _replicator db exists in its init function, the create part can just be omitted here.

Looks ok to me. Just have a minor comment.

Please address Aliaskey A. comment in next patch set.  Thanks.

Line:227, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Since you open the db successfully, is there any chance you will see not_found here?
