DESCRIPTION

MB-12866: Include breakpad minidumps in cbcollect_info

Expand dump_guts to return the directory that Breakpad saves minidumps
to, then use this in cbcollect_info to add any .dmp files in that
directory to cbcollect_info.

Note that the collection explicitly doesn't use the existing Task
mechanism, mainly as we just need the raw files so there's no point in
copying them; plus it is useful to preserve the creation date of the
dump files.

looks ok with some possible improvement mentioned inline.

Will take a closer look later.

Line:596, scripts/dump-guts -> this can be implemented slightly easier by passing default value as "default" to search_config into global and then it's result to per-node search_config's default.

Line:596, scripts/dump-guts -> Thanks - I knew they'd be a nicer way to do this. Need to try and get my brain back into functional mode ;)
