Patch Set 2:

Why is this needed? And actually, I don't see any evidence that the binary will be picked up from the installation root.

Patch Set 2:

Well, I take it back. I do see that CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is being set to install prefix. But my question still remains. You use dialyzer when you build from source and typically you don't have the server installed then.

Patch Set 2:

What I meant, you typically don't have erlang installed in the install prefix then.

Patch Set 2:

In my build environment dialyzer is in install/bin directory. We would like to use this dialyzer but not the one installed globally, because it guarantees that the correct version of dialyzer is used. basically the same what we do with erl.

As Artem mentioned i've used the same logic as $ERL_EXECUTABLE for $DIALYZER_EXECUTABLE in ns_server/CMakeLists.txt
