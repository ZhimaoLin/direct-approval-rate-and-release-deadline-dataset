DESCRIPTION

spock-ui: fixed behaviour in mnFocus directive

- make focus once in case mn-foucs is defined but has no value
- make focus each time when expression becomes true
- reset value onblur in case expression is assignable
 (for example form on wizard's step6)
- unbind blur event on scope destroy in order to avoid memory leak.
