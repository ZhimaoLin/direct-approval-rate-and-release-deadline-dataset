DESCRIPTION

MB-23718: Support metadata_purge_age config param.

[1] For ephemeral buckets the purging of metadata is done by
    ep-engine. User can set the purging age via the REST API.
    The ns_server passes the accepted purgeInterval parameter
    as "ephemeral_metadata_purge_age" config parameter to memcached.
[2] The "ephemeral_metadata_purge_age" can also be altered dynamically
    and ns_server relies on the set_param command to do the same.

Patch Set 2:

(1 comment)

Line:1416, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I don't like this going back to the bucket to refetch the config. Can we use the same technique we used for the ephemeral full policy? I.e. that if the bucket is not ephemeral, the purge age is undefined and we never set the purge age to undefined. 

This code is asking to be re-worked. A simple thing might be to pass down the bucket config instead of passing down each of the bucket settings. Or perhaps we come up with a new record. And then we should divide up changes into things that can be done dynamically and those that require a reconfig. But this is for later.

Also couldn't verify your change. On a completely clean build with your change I hit ns_memcached crashes:

=========================CRASH REPORT=========================

                          [{file,"src/ns_memcached.erl"},{line,1225}]},

Can you double check?
