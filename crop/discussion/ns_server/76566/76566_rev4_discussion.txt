DESCRIPTION

MB-23718: Support metadata_purge_age config param.

[1] For ephemeral buckets the purging of metadata is done by
    ep-engine. User can set the purging age via the REST API.
    The ns_server passes the accepted purgeInterval parameter
    as "ephemeral_metadata_purge_age" config parameter to memcached.
[2] The "ephemeral_metadata_purge_age" can also be altered dynamically
    and ns_server relies on the set_param command to do the same.
