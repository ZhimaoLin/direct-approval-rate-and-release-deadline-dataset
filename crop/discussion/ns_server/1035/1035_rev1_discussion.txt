DESCRIPTION

Add stats_collector and ns_stats.hrl

The include file has the record format for stats. Stats_collector is
the good ol' stats collector module, new and improved for the second
decade of the twenty-first century.

There should now be a stats collector per node per bucket, and once a
second the stats collector will get the stats for that node for that
bucket and generate an ns_stats_event event with the stats record.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

needs a bit of improvement

and should be swapped with next commit as it mentions ns_stats_event which is not present at this stage.

Line:32, src/stats_collector.erl -> this macro is unused

Line:46, src/stats_collector.erl -> {global, ?MODULE} prevents several processes of this kind per node

Line:64, src/stats_collector.erl -> should probably be Bucket instead of "default"
