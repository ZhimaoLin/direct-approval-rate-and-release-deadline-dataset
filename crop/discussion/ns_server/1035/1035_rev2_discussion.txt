DESCRIPTION

Add stats_collector and ns_stats.hrl

The include file has the record format for stats. Stats_collector is
the good ol' stats collector module, new and improved for the second
decade of the twenty-first century.

There should now be a stats collector per node per bucket, and once a
second the stats collector will get the stats for that node for that
bucket and generate an ns_stats_event event with the stats record.
