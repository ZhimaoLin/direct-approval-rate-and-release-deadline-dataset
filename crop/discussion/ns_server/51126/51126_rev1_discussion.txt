Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Couple of comments:

Earlier, there was no comma after timestamp in diag.log. Now, there is one. I think, that should be OK.
Before this change "2015-05-15 12:42:05.897 ns_cookie_manager…”. 
After this change: "2015-05-15T12:42:05.897-07:00, ns_cookie_manager”

Timestamp displayed for some [goport] messages in diag.log is not ISO 8601 compliant. But, it is part of text in ns_log and not a separate timestamp. I think, that will get automatically fixed when goport logs are made ISO 8601 compliant.
