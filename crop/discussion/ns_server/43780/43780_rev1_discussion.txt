DESCRIPTION

Add gometa node service

Added gometa as a node service type. Atleast one gometa
process should be available for secondary indexing to work.

gometa currently does not handle dynamic node membership change.
Hence ns_server babysitter starts up a gometa watchdog process
which monitors node membership change and restarts gometa process
with required configuration file.
