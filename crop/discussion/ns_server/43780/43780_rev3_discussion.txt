DESCRIPTION

Add gometa node service

Added gometa as a node service type. Atleast one gometa
process should be available for 2i to work.

gometa currently does not handle dynamic node membership change.
Hence ns_server babysitter starts up a gometa watchdog process
which monitors node membership change and restarts gometa process
with required configuration file.

Each gometa instance uses three ports (8500, 8501, 8502).
The nodeServices API will list only first port 8500.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Imperfect.

First, we don't intend to make gometa optional service.

Second, there's much better way of handling gometa restart.

Third, we have some work in progress for initial gometa integration.

Patch Set 3:

Alk, I thought of making this workaround since dynamic gometa service won't be available soon.
Can we expect that gometa initial integration will be available soon ?
