DESCRIPTION

MB-10465 eliminate races between producer and consumer sockets

... during takeover

1. obtain stream opaque from stream_req because it for sure will
   come earlier than set_vbucket_state
2. change set_vbucket_state from cast to call to guarantee that
   set_vbucket_state won't be proxied on producer before the consumer
   changed its state
