DESCRIPTION

MB-10465 eliminate races between producer and consumer sockets

... during takeover

1. obtain stream opaque from stream_req because it for sure will
   come earlier than set_vbucket_state
2. change set_vbucket_state from cast to call to guarantee that
   set_vbucket_state won't be proxied on producer before the consumer
   changed its state

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

I don't think call is needed. Things will be ordered sufficiently even without. I.e. cast will be processed before response from set_vbucket_state is seen.

Still merging in order to move things forward.
