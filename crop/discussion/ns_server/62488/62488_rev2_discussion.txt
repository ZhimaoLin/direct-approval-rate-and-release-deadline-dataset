One comment inline.

For big docs that are < 256 KiB, it's pretty slow to build the prettyJson. How about above 25 KiB we don't bother colorizing it and just show it grayscale with carriage returns and indenting?

Also: binary docs don't show any notice, rather just show a blank text area.

Line:114, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_indexes/mn_views/editing/mn_views_editing_service.js -> misspelled, should be largeDocument
