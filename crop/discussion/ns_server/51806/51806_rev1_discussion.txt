DESCRIPTION

MB-15177 Wait for dist_manager to complete node rename.

To avoid the following:

  - dist_manager changes the name successfully but takes more than 5
    seconds

  - ns_cluster:maybe_rename fails because of the timeout on
    dist_manager:adjust_my_address

  - the result is that the node is in half renamed state: it has not
    updated config in accordance to the new node name
