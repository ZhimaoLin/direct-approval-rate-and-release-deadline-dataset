DESCRIPTION

reimplemented named tap fix for branch-18. MB-4366

Original fix is commit: 61bf78355e64fff2e807939fea385862ca6919d5
Reviewed on: http://review.couchbase.org/14555

The approach is to have change_vbucket_filter operation in policy
module. Old version have to continue sending erl_eval "lambda" in
order to check if vbucket filter change is supported and call it. New
version doesn't need it.

The core of actual local vbucket filter change has moved to
cb_gen_vbm_sup with arguments massaged slightly in order to allow
a bit different uses from two policy modules.
