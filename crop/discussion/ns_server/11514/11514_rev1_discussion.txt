DESCRIPTION

unbreak clean shutdown

Recent change to restart everything when data path is changed, made
ns_server application shutdown net_kernel too. This broke
ns_bootstap:remote_stop which, obviously, relies on net_kernel to be
functional.

The fix is to not shutdown net_kernel on ns_server stop/restart. This
also requires ns_server:restart change to avoid restarting
dist_manager. So that it doesn't attempt to start net_kernel again.
