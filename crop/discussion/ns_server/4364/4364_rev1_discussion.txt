DESCRIPTION

Add command line options for ports.

These are application environment variables for ns_server, so they
must be added after -ns_server on the command line. The variables are
rest_port, memcached_port, and moxi_port.

Unfortunately, these will only override these on a fresh instance,
since it's entirely implemented in ns_config_default. Making them
always overridable would require major changes to ns_config.
