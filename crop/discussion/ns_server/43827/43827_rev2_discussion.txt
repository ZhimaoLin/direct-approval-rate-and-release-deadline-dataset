Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Jim, I'm sorry, but it looks like my previous explanation wasn't clear enough.

The title of your commit is still wrong. Let me try again.

It says "XXX is broken". Now imagine somebody couple years from now looking at list of commit titles. Your commit could be understood as changing couchdb beam process to not start dir_size.

We always use title to say briefly _what was done_. Not was was wrong. As your commit appears to be doing.

Then in body of commit message it makes sense to explain what was broken, why, and why (and how) your change is fixing it.
