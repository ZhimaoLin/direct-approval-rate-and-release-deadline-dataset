DESCRIPTION

prevent attempts to open vbuckets in couchdb

As part of investigating MB-11751 I saw a bunch of vbuckets being open
in couchdb. For no apparent reason (specifically, no signs of geocouch
ever used). And I was unable to reproduce this condition.

So in order to catch and remaining offenders I want to merge this
change which will refuse any attempts to open vbuckets.

By mistake, I commented trigger tests thinking it is in couchdb repository. We Adrianna Holmesally trigger tests in couchdb repo by doing +1 :)

merging it now in and only in ns_server is safe. I.e. we're merely adding hook here and nothing more.
