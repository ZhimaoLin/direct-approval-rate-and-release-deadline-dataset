DESCRIPTION

prevent attempts to open vbuckets in couchdb

As part of investigating MB-11751 I saw a bunch of vbuckets being open
in couchdb. For no apparent reason (specifically, no signs of geocouch
ever used). And I was unable to reproduce this condition.

So in order to catch and remaining offenders I want to merge this
change which will refuse any attempts to open vbuckets.
