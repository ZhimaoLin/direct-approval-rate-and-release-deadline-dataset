DESCRIPTION

This swaps in new CSS for all the tabs. Some dialogs are unfinished (or I just haven't found them yet). Some functionality appears odd -- as is to be expected. TBD is mainly the Document and View editing pages; the last dialogs; and all the graphs/meters/gauges which I broke :) Some of this markup structure is experimental and should not be taken as the final product or intent.
