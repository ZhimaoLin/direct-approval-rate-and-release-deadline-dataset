Not all sample buckets require index/query nodes, don't they? If that's the case, then for those buckets we'll be showing a misleading error message.

Sorry for the delayed response!

It seems like all the sample buckets need index & query services. I had tested creating sample buckets once on a cluster without index service and another time on a cluster without query service. In both the cases, all the sample bucket creation failed because either of the index/query service was not running.

But yes there is an assumption that all sample buckets need both index/query services, if we create a new sample bucket which doesn't need index/query service then it'll be a mis-leading message. I had noticed that the UI also does the check unconditionally (attentions.noIndexOrQuery).

Since it's a cosmetic change, should we just abandon this change?
