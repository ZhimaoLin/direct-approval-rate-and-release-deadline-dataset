Line:1144, priv/public/ui/app/css/cbui-components.css -> re-formating of the code like here and below should be better done in separate commit. it distracts the reviewer from the actual changes.

Line:133, priv/public/ui/app/css/cbui-base.css -> is there a good reason why do you need this commented out code here?

Line:1144, priv/public/ui/app/css/cbui-components.css -> I agree with you, the change was made not by me and I didn't want to spend time on that, so I decided to leave it as it is.

Line:133, priv/public/ui/app/css/cbui-base.css -> there is no a good reason, it should be removed.
