Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This is not correct unless you are using an in-source build (which is strongly deprecated). In particular this is not where the ebin directory will be located when using the top-level Makefile. It will be eg. <topleveldir>/build/couchdb/src/couch_index_merger/ebin .

Or maybe there's misunderstanding about what "in-source" means. Can you please elaborate on that ?

Patch Set 1:

It does look like we'll need both path to couchdb headers and couchdb beams. The former is need to compile our code. And the later is needed for dialyzer.
