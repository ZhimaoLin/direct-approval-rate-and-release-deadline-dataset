DESCRIPTION

MB-9081: use right get_indexed_seqs and fix index-aware purging

As part of merging index-aware puring support API from 2.2.0 branch to
master Filipe introduced additional parameters to that call. And
somehow I've missed his message informing me about this change.

Similarly to 2.2.0 we're ignoring index-ness of spatial and dev views
and only considering just production non-spatial views.
