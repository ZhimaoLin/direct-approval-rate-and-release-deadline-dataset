DESCRIPTION

Allow configuration of extra EP engine parameters.

There are two new config keys: static_config_string and
extra_config_string. These can be set in the config for the engine
under engines under the node-specific memcached config, or they can be
set in any bucket config. The dynamic parts of the config string are
still hardcoded.

If you wish to override any default parts of the static part of the
config string, just replace static_config_string; you need to make
sure to include everything that's in the default that you don't want
to override. To just append extra parameters, use extra_config_string.
