DESCRIPTION

Pretend that _local/* documents can be created and updated.

We pretend that any update operation for a document starting with
?LOCAL_DOC_PREFIX succeeds. But we do not actually store the
document. And when this document is requested we just say that it's
missing.

This change is needed to convince couch replicator that its
checkpoints are created successfully.
