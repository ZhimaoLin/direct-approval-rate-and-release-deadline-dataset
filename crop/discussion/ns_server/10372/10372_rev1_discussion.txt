DESCRIPTION

Pretend that _local/* documents can be created and updated.

We pretend that any update operation for a document starting with
?LOCAL_DOC_PREFIX succeeds. But we do not actually store the
document. And when this document is requested we just say that it's
missing.

This change is needed to convince couch replicator that its
checkpoints are created successfully.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Not sure that this patch does what we want. Just for testing right now.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

We need this patch until we decide what to do about xdc replication checkpointing.

I've verified that this works. If people are fine with it, too, then I suggest we merge it.
