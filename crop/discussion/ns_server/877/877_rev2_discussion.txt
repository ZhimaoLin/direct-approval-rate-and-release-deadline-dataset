Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This blew up when I tried to join 2 nodes (dev gen_test_cluster_scripts.rb).

It looks like _vclocks are getting _vclocks on them.

Patch Set 2:

correction, looks like the nodes_wanted key (there might be others) is getting tons of _vclock entries in it, and old entries are not deleted.
