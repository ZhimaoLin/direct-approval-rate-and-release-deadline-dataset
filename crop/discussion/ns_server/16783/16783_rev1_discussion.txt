DESCRIPTION

MB-5434: don't added ejected nodes back to bucket's nodes

It's possible that ejected node is not part of bucket's node list. One
possibility is if it was already rebalanced out for this bucket.

If that is the case we should not add it back to server's list, which
would cause unnecessary waiting for bucket startup on this node.

Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)

See inline. Otherwise looks perfectly good.

Line:222, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I'd name this variable ThisEjectNodes instead. Current name is misleading. It took me a bit of time to grasp what it really means.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> should be "don't add ejected nodes..."
