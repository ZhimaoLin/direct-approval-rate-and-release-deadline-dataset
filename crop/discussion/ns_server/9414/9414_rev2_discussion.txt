Patch Set 2:

We can certainly flip the order, but from my tests it wasn't really being sorted at all (at least not with IP addresses and port numbers). They seemed to show in the order they were added. I added 9002 last, and it showed last, while 9001, 9005, 9007 showed before it.

If you want them flipped, that's an easy fix. The current approach matches the drop-down list and server nodes table sorting. Not sure we want it to be reversed in one place and not in the others.
