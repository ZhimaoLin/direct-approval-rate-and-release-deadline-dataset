DESCRIPTION

MB-9951: make xdcr working with new datatype field in metadata

Today the rev field in #doc{} structure is expected to return
a 16 bytes binary after SeqNo, e.g.

{SeqNo, <<CASPart:64, Exp:32, Flg:32>>}

after the new datatype field change, we expect two more bytes
at the end, totally 18 bytes of metadata after SeqNo.

{SeqNo, <<CASPart:64, Exp:32, Flg:32, _MetaVer:8, _DataType:8>>}

whether this will be xdcr-replicated is still unclear. But if it will, it'll not be replicated as part of revid
