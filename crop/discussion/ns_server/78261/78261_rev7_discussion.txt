DESCRIPTION

MB-23075 cache authentication info on ns_couchdb node

this is also a revert of http://review.couchbase.org/73673

now the following auth operations require roundtrip to ns_server:
1. UI token authentication
2. LDAP authentication
3. Retrieving authentication info for the local user (cached)
4. Permission check (to be cached)

Line:116, src/menelaus_users.erl -> From what I can see in gen_event code, the ns_pubsub will get killed on rename anyway. So I don't see how it's useful to delay computations here.

Patch Set 7:

The problem is that when it restarts, ns_couchdb node still thinks that ns_server node is 127.0.0.1 for a while (until ns_couchdb_config_rep:update_ns_server_node_name is called). This causes multiple crashes during ns_couchdb node startup which races with update_ns_server_node_name that is called after ns_couchdb node is started.

Patch Set 7:

But there's still a possibility that the cache will restart three times and will cause ns_couchdb_sup to reach max restart intensity. So it doesn't seem to be solving the problem, unless I'm missing something.

Patch Set 7:

It will wait till the new address is properly propagated in wait_for_node and then successfully subscribe to the events. Why it should restart 3 times in this case?
