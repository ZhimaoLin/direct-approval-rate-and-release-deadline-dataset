DESCRIPTION

MB-3726 enable aggregated server stats for all nodes

if "All Server Nodes" is selected the UI will show aggregated
server stats. aggregation method is SUM for all stats except
CPU utilization % for which it is MAX

I also fixed unrelated problem of server stats not being
available in "show by server" view
