Pavel, please next time explain -1.

Agree with Pavel. It's done in too unclean fashion. We can do much better.

Patch Set 1:

Better way to fix it might be tweak of formatQuantity. Particularly 1.04k is longer than 1024 and doesn't really need any abbreviation.

I agree that this is not the cleanest way, we should check the length of the number if it is 4 digits just print it if is 5 to 6 then round and use the K.

If you looks at the prepareQuantity, truncateTo3Digits and formatQuantity in app-misc.js. You will see how we are doing it.

By doing it this way we will get 0-9999 on all graphs and not just the vbucket ones, which will be more useful on a cluster with low operations.
