DESCRIPTION

MB-5259: ask memcached to reread isasl.pw when we update the file

Recent memcached change now requires us to send refresh-isasl command
for memcached to re-read this file. This is simplest possible change
to make new isasl work.

NOTE: new command allows us to be aware when memcached is done
re-reading isasl. Which will allow us to make bucket creation
synchronous more easily. But for now this is not a goal.
