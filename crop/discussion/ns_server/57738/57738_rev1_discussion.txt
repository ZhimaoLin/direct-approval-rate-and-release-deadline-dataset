DESCRIPTION

Convert binary doc root to list before sending to mochiweb

The pluggable UI doc root is stored as a list which causes the
filename that's passed to mochiweb when serving the file to
also be binary. In terms of opening the file this is fine;
in terms of guessing the MIME type from the file extension
not so much. This causes a problem in that CSS files returned
from the pluggable UI code don't have the content type set upon
them and are not processed by browsers.

Solve the problem by converting to list.
