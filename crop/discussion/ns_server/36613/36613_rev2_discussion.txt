DESCRIPTION

MB-11020 Deal with raceful epmd differently.

There's a known node register/deregister race in epmd caused by the
fact that there's no explicit command to deregister a
nodename. Nodename gets deregistered only when epmd realizes that
socket that registered the name gets closed.

We addressed this problem in
50a7857d2f159d1d7ceee2f1b567e57bd0db7e1c. But it seems that current
erlang versions stopped returning duplicate_name error from
net_kernel:start/1 function. So we need to handle this situation
differently.
