Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)

Line:67, src/menelaus_util.erl -> I did not verify but many functions from this file are already exported. If these are the only ones remaining then might be better to do "-compile(export_all)", assuming the purpose of this file is same as misc.erl but for menelaus.
