Patch Set 1:

I think this is fine, but one thing that is still confusing is that the message in the documents list says there are no documents in the bucket, but it should probably say something like "The document list is unavailable for ephemeral bucket. You may however lookup keys by id". I remember you mentioning something about not having access to the bucket type on the documents list page. Is this something you need Pavel to take a look at?
