DESCRIPTION

MB-18289: concatenate UI app javascripts

This change generates a new file, index.min.html, at build time
that will be vended to users in place of index.html at runtime.
index.min.html is a "minified" version of index.html (at least
partly so) allowing the app to load and refresh more
quickly.

More kinds of minifications will or may follow but in this
change we do the following: all ns_server "application" javascript
files (those that reside under the "app" directory in
priv/public/ui) are concatenated into one file which. This saves
approx 160 separate browser requests and about. In tests
using the Developer Tools in Chrome this demonstrated a 3-4 second
saving in page load time (down from 4-5 seconds to 1-2 seconds)
on a network with 100ms round trip time, which was quite
noticeable.

We may want to introduce a real minifier. I've experimented with
https://github.com/tdewolff/minify and it looks to be simple to
integrate with our build toolchain and it has support for
whitespace minification of Javascript (which we could use),
plus minification of other web mimetypes (HTML, CSS, etc)

menelaus_web changes to vend index.min.html by default when
index.html is asked for, though index.html can be vended if
the use_minified Erlang application env var is set to false.
This is supported for cluster_run automatically, though if one
is not doing UI work one can run cluster_run with a minified UI
by using the new --minified cluster_run option.

Other changes we should make:
1) change to use minified versions of our library code in
   index.min.html
2) add longer cache controls to our library code
3) support a head.frag.min.html for pluggable components so
   they too can do their part for UI performance.

Line:89, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> I don't think there is a point. Reading too much javascript perhaps is the cause? :-) Will remove.
