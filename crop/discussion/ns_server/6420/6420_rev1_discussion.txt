DESCRIPTION

made ns_heart broadcast local buckets' readiness. MB-3692

This also fixes gathering of ns_heart-broadcasted stats. Instead of
bothering memcached with stats requests we're getting them from
stats_reader.

NOTE: this also changes our REST API a bit. It fixes confusing
renaming of curr_items stat to total_items and also fixes
non-camelCase-d naming of REST response fields.
