DESCRIPTION

bp: MB-7415: fast doc lookups using doc ptr instead of id

This commit is a performance optimization to speed up fetching docs.

Today XDCR uses {key, rev} pair to fetch document from storage layer,
which may incur an index lookup followed by disk lookup. However, the
location to document body is already stored in the doc_info and there
is no need to look up the index first. This commit will allow XDCR to
fetch the document directly from the pointers stored in doc_info.
