DESCRIPTION

Avoid using underscore in http headers.

To not confuse go 1.5 http request parser.

Http headers are case insensitive. To implement this semantics, go
http routines canonicalize the headers (e.g. content-length becomes
Content-Length). Even though header names can contain underscores, go
1.5 has the following comment about them:

  // validHeaderFieldByte reports whether b is a valid byte in a header
  // field key. This is actually stricter than RFC 7230, which says:
  //   tchar = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" / "." /
  //           "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~" / DIGIT / ALPHA
  //   token = 1*tchar
  // TODO: revisit in Go 1.6+ and possibly expand this. But note that many
  // servers have historically dropped '_' to prevent ambiguities when mapping
  // to CGI environment variables.

This prevents go 1.5 from canonicalizing our headers like ns_server-ui
and breaks cbauth with token authentication.
