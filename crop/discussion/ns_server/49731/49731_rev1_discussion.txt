The patch needs to be rebased. One more question, are the corresponding indexer changes in unstable or master branch?

Sorry. Dependent change: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/49730/
We will be merging changes in unstable branch first. But, merging this ns_server change doesn't break anything since we are not checking for async parameter in indexer.
