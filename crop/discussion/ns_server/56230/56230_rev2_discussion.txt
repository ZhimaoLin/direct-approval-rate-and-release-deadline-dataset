DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: ability to set min-height for mn-spinner

While initialization of section we dont know
final height of parent element because sometimes directives
rendered only after applying data from async call, this
causes unwanted jitter of parent element, but we supposedly
know the minimum height of the section.
