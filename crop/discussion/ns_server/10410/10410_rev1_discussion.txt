DESCRIPTION

implemented REST support for x-cluster replication creation

1. We advertise new URLs via controllers field of pool details

2. We have /controller/createReplication that verifies replication
parameters (by connecting another cluster, inferring bucket url and
verifying that vbucket map is there) and returns couch replication
document and url to post it in order to actually create that
replication.
