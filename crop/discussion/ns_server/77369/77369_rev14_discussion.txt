DESCRIPTION

set default bucket name with respect to permissions

- this change is intended to replace setDefaultBucketName implementation.
  I suggest use uiState instead of redirectTo. We can read the bucket
  names right from $scope since we always have relevant buckets
  distributed on the scope. uiState is a directive that very similar to
  uiSref, but it $observes and $watches/evaluates all its inputs, so the
  href of the links will always have right bucket parameter value.

Also

 - correctly cache getBucketsByType method
 - do not reloadPermissions when buckets.uri has been changed. The
   behaviour was fixed on the server.
