DESCRIPTION

set default bucket name with respect to permissions

- this change is intended to replace setDefaultBucketName implementation.
  I suggest use uiState instead of redirectTo. We can read the bucket
  names right from $scope since we always have relevant buckets
  distributed on the scope. uiState is a directive that very similar to
  uiSref, but it $observes and $watches/evaluates all its inputs, so the
  href of the links will always have right bucket parameter value.
  However, we do not take into considerations bucket type during organization of data since MB-24282.

Also

 - correctly cache getBucketsByType method
 - do not reloadPermissions when buckets.uri has been changed. The
   behaviour was fixed on the server.
