DESCRIPTION

Simplify capi_crud for the UI to use non-CAS APIs and ignore _revs

This makes the user experience more like the memcache semantics
we offer in the developer APIs. Ideally we'd make a CAS operation
option available in the UI, but first we will simplify, then we
can add those advanced features.
