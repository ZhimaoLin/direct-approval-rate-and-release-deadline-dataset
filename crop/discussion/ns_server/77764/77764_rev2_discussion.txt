DESCRIPTION

MB-24240: Failover non-kv nodes correctly.

This bug is induced as a regression by the following commit:
http://review.couchbase.org/77508

The following is the behavior of this change:
[1] Allows failover of non-kv nodes as earlier.
[2] Allows the graceful failover to occur when there are no buckets
    present and the node being failed over has kv service running.
