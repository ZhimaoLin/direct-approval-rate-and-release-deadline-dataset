DESCRIPTION

MB-24240: Failover non-kv nodes correctly.

This bug is induced as a regression by the following commit:
http://review.couchbase.org/77508

The following is the behavior of this change:
[1] Allows failover of non-kv nodes as earlier.
[2] Allows the graceful failover to occur when there are no buckets
    present and the node being failed over has kv service running.

Line:1335, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Thought of handling the "no bucket" case separately. But what you suggested is probably better. Will change.

Line:1335, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I think I misread your comment. The older implementation used to return false for non-kv-nodes because the function "check_graceful_failover_possible_rec" would return an empty list. The recent bug fix that I had made changed the behavior and hence this new bug.

So, I thought of keeping the old implementation as is and handling the "bucket empty" case separately.

Line:1335, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I think it's much clearer to explicitly check for non-kv and return false (yes, the list of buckets will always be empty in such a case). Right now you have the kv-node case spread over two clauses which makes it harder to read, at least for me.
