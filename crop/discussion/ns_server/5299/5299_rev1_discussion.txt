DESCRIPTION

Unbreak jquery support of IE{7,8}. MB-3565

Returned sourceIndex support to Sizzle. We haven't yet hit any
sourceIndex bugs and code looks reasonably safe and clean.

I considered speeding up generic code path, which looks reasonably
possible. Effect of that speedup is unknown though. And I don't have
any desire to contribute to ninja's projects. So simply returning
sourceIndex is good enough.
