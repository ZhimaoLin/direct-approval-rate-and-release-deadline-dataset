DESCRIPTION

MB-100 do not crash ebucketmigrator_srv child after Ctrl-C

- removes unnecessary crash report. in this case all we might
  need to know is that the socket is closed

- the current behavior depends on a race. if memcached
  shuts down before gen_tcp:send, there will be crash report.
  if a moment later, then there will be just a warning.
