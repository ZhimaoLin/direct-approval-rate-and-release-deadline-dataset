Line:74, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> When this is logged, the message at

https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/blob/master/src/xdc_replicator.erl#L189

Was already logged, which tells you the replication was started, its pid, parameters, etc.

Line:100, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Still don't understand why you're logging default value rather than actually used value

Line:127, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> you don't need those spaces here between : ~n and ~p

Line:100, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> This the actually used value. Of course we know it is 5 sec. But we should be more considerate for future testing and developer. We are not writing code for ourselves even we currently own these code.

Line:127, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> will fix in next ps.
