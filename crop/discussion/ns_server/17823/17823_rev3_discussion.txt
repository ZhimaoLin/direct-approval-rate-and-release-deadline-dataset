Line:232, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> I still don't see what's the point for this.

The settings are all logged in the init function of the replicator.

You mentioned this helps detect hardcoded settings like we had before in xdcr manager, but I don't see how. I detected that a week or 2 ago by looking at the log message logged by the init function of the replicator.
