info to logs to make future debug and testing easier.

see inline

Line:237, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Those arguments are numbers not strings right?

Line:100, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> SchedulingInterval not name of variable right?

Line:127, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> New line before large struct would make things more readable. Also there's no point in trailing new line

Line:321, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> no trailing new line please

Line:237, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Dude, that information is already logged, at info level, by the replicator...

Line:74, src/xdc_replicator.erl -> You have this information with info log level already (includes settings, source and target uris, etc).

Line:237, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Yes, but probably it is better to be logged here since it is in this function we create all these options.

Line:237, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Looks like they are strings.  Look at list_to_integer(...)  in next several lines.

Line:100, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> It is a constant defined in code, I just want to dumped to log if it ok with you.

Line:237, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> Don't see what's the point, specially at info level.
Also, it would be nice to be consistent, e.g. always a space after a collon.

This is like stripped down version of https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/blob/master/src/xdc_replicator.erl#L189

Line:237, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> The point is to dump info when they is created. Some duplicate loggers in replicator is OK.  Recall previously these options were Adrianna Holmesally overridden in code, so we did not know where these options come from by just looking at loggers in replicator. I think it is more appropriate to dump them in make_option().
