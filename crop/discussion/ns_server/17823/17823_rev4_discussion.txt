info to logs to make future debug and testing easier.

Line:232, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> I still don't see how useful this is, given that all of this, and more, is logged in the init callback of the replicator.
Info level doesn't make sense either.
Could use more consistent style as well, some lines have space after the full-collon, others don't.

Line:232, src/xdc_rep_utils.erl -> I still think it is more appropriate to add log here :-).
I fixed the formatting and made it a debug level log.
