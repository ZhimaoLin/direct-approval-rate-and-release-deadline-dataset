DESCRIPTION

MB-19339: Add support for privilege_debug for memcached

Memcached supports privilege_debug mode to have the system
approve a request when the RBAC system would deny access.
The motivation for this mode is to be able to run an
application so that one may figure out which privileges
it need.

This mode should _NEVER_ be enabled in production!

To enable privilege debug mode the following command
may be used:

curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
           -X POST \
           http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
           --data privilege_debug=true

Patch Set 1:

Sorry for the delay, Trond. The change is fine, except that it breaks offline upgrade. The memcached_defaults key isn't migrated for you as it was conveniently last time when you submitted a similar patch for the SSL cipher list.

It would be cool if you could add the config migration piece. You'll need to copy the logic from when we upgraded from 4.1.1 -> 4.5 here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl#564. The migration logic should be copied into the 4.6.0 -> spock upgrade step which is here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl#581. And we usually add a test for these upgrades - that's here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl#730.

You can run the tests to verify they pass by running `make test` in ns_server.
