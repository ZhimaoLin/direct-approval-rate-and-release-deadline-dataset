Line:167, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_buckets_form/mn_buckets_form.html -> This needs to be able to take a floating point error.

Line:178, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_buckets_form/mn_buckets_form.html -> Can we keep the message look and feel similar to the current way we display error messages?
