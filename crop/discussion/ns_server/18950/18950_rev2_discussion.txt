DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Look up replication documents by type=xdc.

Previous code was trying to find suitable fields in the document. And
in case of success the document would be considered replication
document. But all of that is not needed because all the replication
documents have 'type' field which value is equal to 'xdc'.
