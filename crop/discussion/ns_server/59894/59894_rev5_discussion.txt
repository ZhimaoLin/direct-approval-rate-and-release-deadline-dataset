Patch Set 5:

one typo in the comment. otherwise looks good.

Note: I would rename extra_known_settings to watson_extra_known_settings and extra_default_settings to watson_extra_default_settings.

Line:384, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> I think that instead of mocking cluster_compat_mode:is_cluster_*** we can make known_settings(), default_settings() and compaction_lens_props() fully functional by passing IsWatson parameter into these functions.
