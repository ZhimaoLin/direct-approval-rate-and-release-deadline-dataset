Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

Line:112, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_views/editing/mn_views_editing_controller.js -> The idea of stringifying and parsing a doc worries me as sometimes customers have very complicated view definitions and I'd prefer a simpler solution like copying and iterating over the reduce attributed and removing them / setting them to undefined if they are empty or blank strings.
