Thats correct. My earlier plan was to leverage that - move parts of it to misc.erl, but Aliaksey mentioned that we want to keep ale independent. Hence, these helper functions. 

Also, menelau_access_log_formatter:get_datetime is not completely ISO 8601 compliant.
Currently, not planning to touch menelau_access_log_formatter:get_datetime but in future we can update it to use these new ale helper functions.
