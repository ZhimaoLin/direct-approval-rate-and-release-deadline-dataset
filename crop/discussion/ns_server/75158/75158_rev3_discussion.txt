Patch Set 3:

(6 comments)

Line:204, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> This function is good and in the right place. Can you replace the client_cert_auth config key lookup in memcached_config_mgr with a call to this function? Also, remove the client_cert_auth() function in menelaus_web_cert and have callers call this function instead.

Line:264, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> should be indented as follows:

ssl_auth_options() ->
    case client_cert_auth() of
        disable ->
            [];
        enable ->
            [{verify, verify_peer}];
        mandatory ->
            [{fail_if_no_peer_cert, true},
             {verify, verify_peer}]
    end.

(we use the indent-region macro in emacs Erlang mode)

Line:274, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> should be indented as follows:

ssl_server_opts() ->
    Path = ssl_cert_key_path(),
    ssl_auth_options() ++
        [{keyfile, Path},
         {certfile, Path},
         {versions, supported_versions(ssl_minimum_protocol())},
         {cacertfile, ssl_cacert_key_path()},
         {dh, dh_params_der()},
         {ciphers, supported_ciphers()}].

Line:394, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> you are missing the initialization of the client_cert_auth part of the gen_server state here

Line:467, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> Need to flush client_cert_auth_changed

Line:476, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> you are not actually changing the client_cert_auth element of the gen_server state here. 

Obviously this code also fails the test of "don't repeat yourself" but we can refactor this later separately.
