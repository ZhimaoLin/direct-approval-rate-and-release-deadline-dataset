DESCRIPTION

fix handling of start rebalance from old node

Old code doesn't pass list of delta-recovery buckets, and in initial
code we handle it by converting it to false. But latest code doesn't
understand false as value of DeltaRecoveryBuckets. So we change it to
[] which has similar meaning to false in old code.
