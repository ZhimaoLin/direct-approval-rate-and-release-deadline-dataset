Patch Set 3:

Patch 3 Details:
1. The remote vbucket map is now read only once per the set of vbuckets being replicated.
2. The ids generated for _info docs now also contain the node name for uniqueness.

Also verified that httpc:request() accepts URLs with userid and password. So, for the purposes of authentication, it's enough that the remote Bucket URI contain the user id and password.

Patch Set 3:

unfortunately simply appending node name is not enough.

We may rename node name when we grow cluster from 1 node to more.

So we either need to find other prefix/suffix for info documents or rename them as well when node name is renamed. See ns_cluster:do_change_address.

retry_couch_replication still grabs remote vbucket map per invocation.

Patch Set 3:

maybe batching retry_couch_replication actions somehow will help with grabbing remote vbucket map many times
