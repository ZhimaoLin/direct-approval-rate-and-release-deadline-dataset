Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, approved

looks good but I couldn't verify if it works even single node to single node. Even with the following simple integration patch attempt:

Patch Set 7:

Aliaksey: Was there some error when you tried the verification? I'll be doing integration testing today. Will fix the issues that I find (I'm sure there will be a few) and also write up some unit tests.

Filipe: I know you're busy but if you approve of the overall design, I'd like to merge this change. As I mentioned I'm going to be testing this over the next few days, so I will have the opportunity to fix any bugs. But I just want to make sure that at a high level the design makes sense.

Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Srini, on my side you can go ahead.
I remember the overall high level idea, and it seems ok.
Once it's merged and tested, all necessary fixes and improvements can be done later.

As a small note, you don't need that helper function with the replication defaults for worker_processes and connections. They can be set in the .ini config. You might also ponder why those specific defaults? The default for Couch is 4 and 20. Push replications only use N + 1 connections (where N = number of workers).

Good work
