Patch Set 11:

I don't see why you'd need the same uuid for running rebalance and the final status.

Patch Set 11:

UI should know when new rebalance task is started. Currently, there is no such possibility. e.g. two rebalance tasks fail before they started, how to distinguish them?
They will be completely identical, however, they are different tasks.

the logic on the ui should be like:
incomingTask.errorMessage && savedTasks.id != incomingTask.id && savedTasks.errorMessage !=  incomingTask.errorMessage
 //show error

Patch Set 11:

They won't be identical if you use rebalance_status_uuid.

Patch Set 11:

if I use rebalance_status_uuid the same task will have a couple of different ids, depends on its status. How to handle a situation when the task changes status but has the same errorMessage? In that case, the errorMessage will be shown twice.

I'm pretty sure that it's a normal practice to have one unique id for the task during its life cycle. There is another incoming use case when UI will need to track tasks in order to show  progress bar only for newly added tasks.
