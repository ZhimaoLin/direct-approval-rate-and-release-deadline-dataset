Line:731, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> There's already rebalance_status_uuid, just use it.

Line:781, src/ns_doctor.erl -> This doesn't seem to be properly indented. That might be not the best way to structure this.

Line:731, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> rebalance_status_uuid is changed when rebalance is finished or fails but I want to change uuid only when rebalance is started in order to have the same id in case when rebalance fails.

I'm not sure that I should update uuid in the last two places (move_vbuckets and maybe_start_upgrade_to_dcp)

Line:781, src/ns_doctor.erl -> I'm using emacs, so indentation should be correct. I will try to improve this part.
