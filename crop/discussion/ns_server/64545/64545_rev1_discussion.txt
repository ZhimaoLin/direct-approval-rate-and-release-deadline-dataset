DESCRIPTION

[rebuild_replicas] Sleep for 10 seconds after the rebalances.

This is to prevent mb_master from restarting if the server doesn't have
this fix:: http://review.couchbase.org/64083.

mb_master_sup's restart policy is {one_for_one, 3, 10}, so just sleeping
for 10 seconds after two ns_orchestrator crashes should prevent
mb_master_sup from propagating the crash up to mb_master itself.
