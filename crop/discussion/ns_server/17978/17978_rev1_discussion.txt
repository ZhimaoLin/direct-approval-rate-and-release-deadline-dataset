couldn't understand this. We'll have to take another look later. Some explanation (russian is ok) would help

Patch Set 1:

1. We show document page. (Get)
2. We show doc pending state. (Wait)
3. We show error/success. (Done)

It is a mirror of XHR behavior.

For example:
1. Create any doc
2. Remove it
3. Enter same id into lookup field then submit form.

Probably it is a bug, but who knows what can happens else. In case without pending state we will see previous opened document until XHR success/error/canceled.
