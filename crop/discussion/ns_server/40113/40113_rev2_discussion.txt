DESCRIPTION

Include libstdc++ memory env vars in cluster_run

We set a couple of env vars to force the use of new/delete by libstdc++
in the standard startup script. Add these to cluster_run to
match behavior on development builds.

Patch Set 2:

Have you _actually_ saw any effect of this?

My response was based on research I did in the past. Specifically, AFAIK mt_allocator _is not_ default since 4.<something small>.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

@Alk:

I think we are ratholing here. This (very simple) patch was raised to make the devel method of starting Couchbase (more) closely match the production method. Regarding the validity of the env var across our supported platforms there's basically two possibilities:

1. At least one of the platforms we support (RHEL5, RHEL6, Ubuntu 10.04 & Ubuntu 12.04) still requires this env var to use the new/delete allocator - in which case the env vars *should* be present in couchbase-server.sh (and hence also in cluster run).

2. None of the platforms now require it - in which case the env vars do nothing (but are harmless).

To actually validate which of the above is the case would require examining four different OS installations libstdc++ code, and either Adrianna Holmesally inspecting the code to check which is the default, or researching and constructing some test case to check which allocator is in use. I estimate this is at least a few hours work. 

Unless you actually want to verify this yourself, I propose we just commit this patch and move on with more pressing matters.

Patch Set 2:

We should have the same variables set by default by starting the system through cluster run or the init script we're using. Our automatic test suite and people trying to reproduce stuff use cluster_run to start the system and they should compare apples with apples... I don't have any opinion if this means removing it from the init script, adding it to cluster_run (or have ns_server set all variables before starting processes).

Patch Set 2:

I have verified again that even rhel5 is using new_allocator as default. There is no need for this setting at all.
