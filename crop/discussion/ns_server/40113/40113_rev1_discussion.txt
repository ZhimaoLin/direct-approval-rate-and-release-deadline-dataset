DESCRIPTION

Include glibc memory env vars in cluster_run

We set a couple of env vars to force the use of new/delete inside
memcached in the standard startup script. Add these to cluster_run to
match behavior on development builds.

Verified that these env vars are set in the resulting memcached process.

Patch Set 1:

few things:

1) those environment variables affect not glibc but gcc's c++ library.

2) AFAIK they are not effective as of gcc 4.<something small>. Are you sure those have any effect on any of relevant OSes ?

3) tcmalloc actually sets this variable anyways (in case it's running with older gcc).

Fair point - I'll update the commit message.

2) AFAIK they are not effective as of gcc 4.<something small>. Are you sure those have any effect on any of relevant OSes ?

According to the libstdc++ docs [1] it's still valid, and checking the code [2] I see it's still used.

3) tcmalloc actually sets this variable anyways (in case it's running with older gcc).

Yes, but other allocators (such as jemalloc) don't.

Having said all that, even if it wasn't valid anymore we should in that case remove it from the main couchbase-server.sh script to keep them consistent. Or even better just have one startup script for both dev and production to ensure we don't have these kinds of differences (but I digress...)
