DESCRIPTION

MB-20497: Clear out the HTTP proxy environment variable.

If the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables are set
then the golang modules used by Couchbase would honor them and
this can lead to unexpected behavior. Hence clear these variables
in ns_server so that none of the child processes spawned will see
them.
