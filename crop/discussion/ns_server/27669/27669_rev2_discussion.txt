DESCRIPTION

MB-8533 make statistics work on node that is pending rebalance

if the node is in pending rebalance stage, then it is
not mapped to the bucket yet and all the servers that
provide statistical info are not started

so in this case we need to call other nodes to get
the statistics

since the views signatures cannot be obtained from
the 2.0 nodes and at this time there's no compat mode
between 2.2 and 2.0 I decided that we can scrifice
"View Stats" for the added and non rebalanced nodes.

so in the currect solution View Stats will be hidden
for all the nodes that do not have the bucket yet.

alternative to this will be trying to obtain the info
from the other nodes in the cluster crashing
capi_set_view_manager on the older nodes.

another alternative is to create a separate gen_server
for obtaining the signatures. in this case the older
nodes will return noproc, and if the cluster contains
at least one 2.2 node that has the bucket we will
be able to populate Views Stats. But I decided that it
will be an overkill for such unimportant corner case.

see inline

Line:429, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Why not just pick one node here and call invoke_archiver on that node. If node() is a member of ns_bucket:live_bucket_nodes() then pick node(), else just pick one of the nodes returned by live_bucket_nodes(). With this approach the code that you added in stats_archiver and ns_bucket is not needed at all. In any case, the node that you pick in this way is supposed to run all the stats services so there's no need to retry anything.

Line:847, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I don't think this message is very useful. And it will be repeated many times wasting precious space in the log.

Line:429, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I thought about it. But relying on nodes() result can cause a race condition and the node we pick can accidentally be down at the moment of the call. So there is a slight chance that the stats screen will be showing "communication error" though some nodes are alive.

Line:847, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Agree. I'll delete it.

Line:429, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I believe it's tolerable to get one or two "communication error". There may be tons of other reasons that can lead to this outcome. I'd prefer simpler code over this.

i agree with aliaksey. nodes race is rare and generally harmless
