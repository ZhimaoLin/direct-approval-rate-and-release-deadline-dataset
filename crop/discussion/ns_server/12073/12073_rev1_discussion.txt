DESCRIPTION

use cheaper rebalance running check in tasks version hashing

For version we only need to know if rebalance is running. I.e. to
detect only structural changes in list of tasks.

ns_cluster_membership:is_rebalance_running avoids calling
ns_orchestrator that can be remote thus saving potential network trip.
