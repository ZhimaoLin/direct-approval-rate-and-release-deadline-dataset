Line:342, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> It is not recommended to use now() just to get a timestamp. now() guarantees to return a unique value so it involves expensive locking on multicore systems. os:timestamp() is better.

Line:56, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> I haven't checked for other usage, but is there any good reason that menelaus_util:format_server_time does not return a binary?
