Line:358, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> Unless I am completely confused today this is an assert that ClusterCA exists. And this line will cause a bad_match crash if it does not.

So shouldn't that error be logged in a more informative way?

Line:358, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> This can happen in 2 cases: 1. error in the code 2. somebody tweaked the config Adrianna Holmesally. I think this assert is good enough for these 2 cases.
