DESCRIPTION

Revised Server Groups - Pending Msg., etc.

Changed markup & style for displaying pending move messages, layout of dropdown menu, cancel link, delete group link.
Changed language of pending msg., delete group link.
Auto-focused Add Group input field.
AFFECTED:  The logged-in username dropdown in the header is even more screwed up, but not dangerously so…I’ll fix that next.
