DESCRIPTION

Add a possibility to save server's node name to a file.

An environment variable 'nodefile' can be set to ns_server. In that case
whenever server's node name is changed it will be saved to the path specified
by the variable. This is needed to shutdown the server in a graceful way from
outside.
