DESCRIPTION

MB-24420: Perform check_config in a separate process.

The check_config ends up calling the memcached stats API
which occassionally takes a very long time to complete.
This will result in blocking up the ns_memcached process
which can ultimately lead to failover. The fix is to perform
the check_config operation in a separate process using a
socket from the ns_memcached_sockets_pool.

Line:620, src/ns_memcached.erl -> this doesn't belong to this commit

Line:713, src/ns_memcached.erl -> you can do proc_lib:start_link(erlang, apply, [fun run_check_config/1, [.....params...]]) so you won't need to export run_check_config

Line:718, src/ns_memcached.erl -> and you don't need this case, really. just do: handle_info({'EXIT', Pid, normal}, #state{check_config_pid = Pid} = State) ->

and reasons other than normal will fall back to the handle_info({'EXIT', _, Reason}

Line:725, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Actually, the Msg itself contains the PID as well. So, it'll be redundant to print the PID again.
