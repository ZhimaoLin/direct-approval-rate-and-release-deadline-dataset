DESCRIPTION

MB-24420: Perform check_config in a separate process.

The check_config ends up calling the memcached stats API
which occassionally takes a very long time to complete.
This will result in blocking up the ns_memcached process
which can ultimately lead to failover. The fix is to perform
the check_config operation in a separate process using a
socket from the ns_memcached_sockets_pool.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1

Artem suggested to rely on the EXIT message received by the ns_memcached process to restart instead of passing in the Parent pid. I have updated with the changes.
