DESCRIPTION

MB-24291 Delete pidfile on graceful shutdown

Due to the requirements of the System V init scripts on Centos 6 and other
allied platforms  we write the pid of the couchbbase server to the
couchbase-server.pid file. This file is not deleted on graceful shutdown on
the couchbase server.
In order to fix this we spawn a new process during init of the ns_server_sup
which is tasked only with waiting for an exit signal when the parent is in
the process of terminating and deleting the pidfile when it receives
the signal. We do this only on the affected platforms.

Patch Set 1:

The pidfile creation code is sitting in ns_server mainly for historical reasons. In fact, it's probably not entirely correct to store the pid of ns_server vm. The pid file is used by the init script to check the status of the server. So if ns_server vm is in the middle of restart, init script might incorrectly believe that the server is not running.

So we should probably move all of this to the babysitter. You can put the pid file creation into ns_babysitter_bootstrap:start/0 and the deletion into ns_babysitter_bootstrap:stop/0.

I was looking into implementing this and I had one issue with this. Please correct me if I've understood this wrong.
ns_babysitter_bootstrap is called from within the encryption_service and the encryption_service is called from within ns_babysitter_sup conditionally.
In ns_babysitter_sup.erl:34 the encryption_service is called only when is_init_enterprise is true.
Following that code into ns_server/src/ns_config_default.erl there are some cases when this returns false. My assumption is that ns_server_bootstrap is not called in this case.
I was unable to surmise from the code what category of systems would return false.
My question is do those systems on which is_init_enterprise would return false come under the subset of systems affected by this bug?

Patch Set 1:

No, ns_babysitter_bootstrap is called before anything else. ns_babysitter_bootstrap:start is called when the server starts, ns_babysitter_boostrap:stop is called when the server is terminated gracefully.

See also couchbase-server.sh.in script.

Patch Set 1:

I couldn't find a way to pass an env to bootstrap from couchbase-server.sh.in. So I had to write a bit of code to check for the presence of the pidfile in ns_bootstrap.
I'm compulsively checking for the pidfile because I'm assuming the presence of that env implies this is a system affected by this bug. Is that correct?
Also if this approach is ok would it make sense to have this inside ns_babysitter instead of ns_babysitter_bootstrap?

In couchbase-server.in.sh, line 166-171, the environment variables of cookiefile etc are being set only for ns_server and for ns_babysitter and not for ns_babysitter_bootstrap.
Since the code to add and delete the pidfile is in ns_babysitter_bootstrap I was wondering if there was a way to set a pidfile environment variable for ns_babysitter_bootstrap directly?
The way I've done it now is to set pidfile for ns_babysitter and from ns_babysitter_bootstrap check for this using application:get_env/2.
