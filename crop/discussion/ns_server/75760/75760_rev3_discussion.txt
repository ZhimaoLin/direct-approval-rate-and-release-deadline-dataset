DESCRIPTION

MB-23541: redirect 'ui' to 'ui/index.html'

If we don't redirect in menelaus_web it gets served by mochiweb
and two things happen:
(1) the request bypasses our check on serving UI requests in
    perform_action
(2) the ui/index.html file is served bu the the insertion of
    pluggable components is bypassed (i.e. no query or FTS tabs)
