DESCRIPTION

Make ns_cluster_membership:supported_services pure again.

That is, it doesn't depend on cluster compatibility version. So it
always returns a list of services supported by the node it's being run
on.

For version-dependent service list, supported_services_for_version and
cluster_supported_services were introduced.
