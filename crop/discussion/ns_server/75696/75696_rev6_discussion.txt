DESCRIPTION

MB-22918: Eviction Policy handling for ephemeral buckets.

[1] We will be using the evictionPolicy parameter in the REST API to
    accept the policy values for ephemeral buckets (this is consistent
    with the UI).
[2] ep-engine accepts a different param/value pair for ephemeral
    buckets and ns_server handles the mapping while constructing
    the memcached config string.
[3] Once the eviction policy is set for an ephemeral bucket during
    creation it cannot be updated later using the REST API. However,
    one can use diag/eval to update the eviction_policy parameter in
    the bucket config to change the policy.
[4] The approach used to update the ep-engine with the new eviction
    policy value is different for ephemeral and couchbase buckets.
    For couchbase buckets, we continue to use the existing method
    of restarting the memcached process and for ephemeral buckets,
    we will use the set_param command.
