DESCRIPTION

MB-22918: Eviction Policy handling for ephemeral buckets.

[1] We will be using the evictionPolicy parameter in the REST API to
    accept the policy values for ephemeral buckets (this is consistent
    with the UI).
[2] ep-engine accepts a different param/value pair for ephemeral
    buckets and ns_server handles the mapping while constructing
    the memcached config string.
[3] Once the eviction policy is set for an ephemeral bucket during
    creation it cannot be updated later using the REST API. However,
    one can use diag/eval to update the eviction_policy parameter in
    the bucket config to change the policy.

Line:120, src/ns_bucket.erl -> I would just get rid of this line

Line:274, src/ns_bucket.erl -> I would just get rid of this function and roll it into eviction_policy_cfg_string().

Line:1331, src/ns_memcached.erl -> You should track the changes to eviction policy and ephemeral full policy separately. Eviction policy changes require a bucket reconfig; ephemeral full policy changes can be made via a set-param call (just like the drift thresholds.)

Line:120, src/ns_bucket.erl -> The reason for this is that we cache the EvictionPolicy value here and pass it as part of 'ExtraParams' in the return value (a tuple). And EvictionPolicy contains the actual value that we pass to ep-engine.

Line:1331, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Ok, will change.
