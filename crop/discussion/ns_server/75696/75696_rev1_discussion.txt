DESCRIPTION

MB-22918: Eviction Policy handling for ephemeral buckets.

[1] We will be using the evictionPolicy parameter in the REST API to
    accept the policy values for ephemeral buckets (this is consistent
    with the UI).
[2] ep-engine accepts a different param/value pair for ephemeral
    buckets and ns_server handles the mapping change while constructing
    the memcached config string.
[3] Once the eviction policy is set for an ephemeral bucket during
    creation it cannot be updated later.

Line:256, src/ns_bucket.erl -> This is to handle the memcached case, correct? I guess we've been emitting eviction_policy as value_only for memcached buckets for years - but it seems a little weird. If anything it's closer to full eviction than it is to value eviction. But overall, it seems that undefined for eviction policy on memcached buckets captures it best. But this is just a comment. No need to change anything.

Line:1325, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Given what we tNathalie Landryed about this morning - that the memcached guys would like eviction policy to by dynamically changeable and support it in code - let's let the eviction policy change for ephemeral buckets even if it's not supported in the REST API.

Line:1322, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> This errors out if a user sets it to the same value. Seems like we should allow that form post as it's not a change.

Line:256, src/ns_bucket.erl -> I saw the bucket info output for memcached and retained what was returned. But yes you are right that full_eviction makes more sense :)

Line:1325, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Sure!

Line:1322, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Will correct it.

Line:256, src/ns_bucket.erl -> It's already the case that memcached buckets return valueOnly for the eviction policy in the REST API and it's been this way for 3 years. It might've been accidental - but it was done by Aliaksey, so I doubt it. (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/33584/). So you might want to leave it as is. Aliaksey, thoughts?

No need to idealize me, I make mistakes too :) It probably wasn't intentional. But if you pay attention, there's whole lot of other stuff that we return for all bucket types when it only makes sense for membase buckets. We've never been very strict about these things, because memcached buckets have always been some sort of orphan child. To summarize, we should do whatever makes our live easier.

lol :)

I'll just leave as it's.
