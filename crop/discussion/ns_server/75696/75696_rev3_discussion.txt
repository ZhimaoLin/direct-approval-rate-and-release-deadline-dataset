DESCRIPTION

MB-22918: Eviction Policy handling for ephemeral buckets.

[1] We will be using the evictionPolicy parameter in the REST API to
    accept the policy values for ephemeral buckets (this is consistent
    with the UI).
[2] ep-engine accepts a different param/value pair for ephemeral
    buckets. For ephemeral buckets the eviction policy is set using
    the set_param command and for couchbase buckets it's set via the
    memcached config string.
[3] Once the eviction policy is set for an ephemeral bucket during
    creation it cannot be updated later using the REST API. However,
    one can use diag/eval to update the eviction_policy parameter in
    the bucket config to change the policy.
