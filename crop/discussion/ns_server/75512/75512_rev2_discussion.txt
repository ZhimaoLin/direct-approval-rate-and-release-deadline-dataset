DESCRIPTION

Assert that values are the same when revisions are.

In long poll workers in service_agent. That helps to catch misbehaving
services. Recently I spent a considerable amount of time trying to
figure out an issue that turned out to be the service not updating the
revisions returned by GetCurrentTopology and GetTaskList.
