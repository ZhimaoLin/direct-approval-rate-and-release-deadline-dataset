DESCRIPTION

subtract grace period when configuring autofailover.MB-4830

Autofailover needs 2 extra hearbeat intervals during which it
double-checks that we have only one down node. If it is we
auto-failover it.

This 10 seconds needs to be subtracted. So that UI setting of 30
seconds means ~30 seconds to autofailover.
