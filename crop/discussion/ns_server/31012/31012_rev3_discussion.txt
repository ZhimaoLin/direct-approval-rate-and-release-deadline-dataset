Patch Set 3: Verified+1

Alk, I just found the commit merged this afternoon contains incorrect variable name. The enoent and eexist used wrong variables. This will lead to incorrect XDCR test.  Perry and QE is waiting for the new build

The fix is here. Please approve it ASAP.

Patch Set 3:

Hi Alk, Aruna told me you have left office at the time of writing.  
Since QE need the new build this evening, and this fix is really trivial.  I merged it for now to generate a build so QE can start test. Apologize for it. 

You could revert it tomorrow if you have any question. Thanks.
