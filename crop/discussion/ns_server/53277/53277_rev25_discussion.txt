Doesn't work. No matter which services I select in AddNode dialog, the node with Data service is added.

Plus see one comment inline.

Line:6, priv/public/angular/app/mn_wizard/step1/mn_wizard_step1.html -> This shouldn't be part of this commit. If you wan't to fix formatting in some unrelated files, you need to create separate commit for it.
