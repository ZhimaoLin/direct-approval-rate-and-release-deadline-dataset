Patch Set 2: Do not submit

Config strings need to be deterministic: the same config needs to produce the same command lines every time. I'm actually going to revert the change for the custom formatters.

This needs to be fixed differently; a *static* max_size number needs to go under the memcached config key, and the format string should use a plain number.

Patch Set 2:

It's quite deterministic. 0.8 of memory size is reasonably constant.
