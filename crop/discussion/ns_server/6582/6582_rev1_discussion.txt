Line:649, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Question: what is the replication field?

Is it ever larger than 1.0?

If so, the lists:min will never return larger than 1.0 and that feels worrisome.

Patch Set 1:

replication field is from 0 to 1. And we're minimizing. So if any bucket has replication of 0, result will be 0.
