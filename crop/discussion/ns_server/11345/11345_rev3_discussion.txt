DESCRIPTION

Make port_servers key to be per-node.

Several things has been changed to achieve this.

  1. port_servers are now per-node in the default config.

  2. 1.6->1.7 upgrade function changed to not set port_servers at
  all. This is needed because we used to set them globally to the
  default value. Thus this value could overwrite port_servers value on
  other (possibly not yet updated) nodes. But we still need to allow
  1.6 to 1.8 upgrade. Thus we need to set port_servers somewhere
  later. It's done during 1.7.2->1.8 upgrade.

  3. 1.7.2->1.8 upgrade function changed to always set per-node
  port_servers to default value.

  Several cases are possible here:

    a. port_server is not in the old config. This means that either
    this is a brand new node, or it's the node being upgraded from
    1.6 version.

    b. There's a global port_servers value in the old config. This
    means that node is being upgraded from 1.7 version.

  But since port_servers value does not contain anything customizable
  by user, it's safe to always apply the default value here.
