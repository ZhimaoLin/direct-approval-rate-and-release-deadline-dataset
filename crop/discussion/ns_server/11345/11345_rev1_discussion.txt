DESCRIPTION

Make port_servers key to be per-node.

Several things has been changed to achieve this.

  1. port_servers are now per-node in the default config.

  2. 1.6->1.7 upgrade function changed to not set port_servers at
  all. This is needed because we used to set them globally to the
  default value. Thus this value could overwrite port_servers value on
  other (possibly not yet updated) nodes. But we still need to allow
  1.6 to 1.8 upgrade. Thus we need to set port_servers somewhere
  later. It's done during 1.7.2->1.8 upgrade.

  3. 1.7.2->1.8 upgrade function changed to handle two cases as
    follows.

    a. port_servers is not in the old config. This means that either
    this is a brand new node, or it's the node being upgraded from
    1.6 version. It's enough to set per-node port_servers here to the
    default value.

    b. There's a global port_servers value in the old config. This
    means that node is being upgraded from 1.7 version. In this case
    global value is kept intact and per-node value is set to the old
    one with all the prefixes replaced.

Patch Set 1: Fails

almost looks good. I think it would be 100% simplest to just set port_servers from default config.
