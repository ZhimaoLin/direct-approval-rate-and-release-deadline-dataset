DESCRIPTION

MB-17102: Put all pluggable UI resources under the prefix _p

To avoid name clashes with the official ns_server REST API all
pluggable UI resources are now under the prefix _p.
Pluggable REST APIs are like this
/_p/<service_1>
/_p/<service_2>
And static files used by the pluggable UIs are like this
/_p/ui/<service_1>
/_p/ui/<service_2>

Line:400, src/menelaus_web.erl -> The plan is that each of the pluggable UIs in Watson will require Full Admin creds. They are both problematic since they both mix admin and data permissions, so we figured it was easier to bail out and require full admin for now, knowing that we can always weaken the required permissions later. However, if you think there are permissions we can associate with Query and FTS that exist within what RBAC will look like -- then that's cool and we should tNathalie Landry about how to integrate it nicely.

Line:400, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I think that we the permissions should be checked at the real backend, not on ns_server side. Let's tNathalie Landry about it sometime in Jan.

Line:400, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Yes, I think you are right. Let's change this to auth_any_bucket and have the pluggable services implement correct security checks in their REST APIs. (I prefer auth_any_bucket to done, hope you don't mind that.)

@Anders: can you change this?
