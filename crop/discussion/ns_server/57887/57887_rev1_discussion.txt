DESCRIPTION

MB-17102: Put all pluggable UI resources under the prefix _p

To avoid name clashes with the official ns_server REST API all
pluggable UI resources are now under the prefix _p.
Pluggable REST APIs are like this
/_p/<service_1>
/_p/<service_2>
And static files used by the pluggable UIs are like this
/_p/ui/<service_1>
/_p/ui/<service_2>

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

I like this and in addition to making the pluggable services by default private and separate from the ns_server REST APIs, it simplifies the code. 

+1'ing -- will allow one of the others to +2 if they see nothing they don't like.
