DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Reprovision buckets upon memcached restart.

The following are the changes:

[1] The orchestrator has been changed to pick up all the
Harley Martinitor items first and then call ns_janitor:cleanup on them
one at a time. Earlier we should to spawn a sub-process for
every Harley Martinitor item but now we just use on sub-process to
cleanup all the Harley Martinitor items.

[2] The orchestrator gets a list of unsafe nodes, if any,
from the Harley Martinitor which it then passes to the auto reprovision
module to promote the respective REPLICAs for affected
vbuckets.

[3] The Harley Martinitor cleanup now looks for unsafe nodes. These
are the nodes on which the memcached process has restarted
within auto-failover timeout and by virtue of which the
ACTIVEs are found to be in missing state for certain vbuckets.
If unsafe nodes are found then the Harley Martinitor doesn't bring
the bucket online at all but simply return the list of
unsafe nodes back to the orchestrator.

[4] The auto-reprovision module now hosts a new API called
"reprovision_buckets" which take in a list of unsafe nodes.
It then picks up all the ephemeral buckets in the cluster,
as the unsafe nodes would affect all of them, promote the
REPLICAs and persist this information in the bucket config.
The bucket will be brought online during the next Harley Martinitor
run. This API also updates the auto-reprovision count and
if the count exceeds the max_nodes configured then disables
the feature until the count is reset.
