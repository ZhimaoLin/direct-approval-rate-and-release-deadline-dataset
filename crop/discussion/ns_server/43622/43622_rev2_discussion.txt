Line:62, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> here are the calls in sequence:

setup_body()

set_children_and_loop(Children, undefined) - here we get Pid from babysitter and pass it to children_loop

children_loop(Children, Pid)

children_loop_continue(Children, Pid)

do_children_loop_continue(Children, Pid)

set_children_and_loop(NewChildren, Pid)
