DESCRIPTION

validate return value of ns_cluster:do_change_address

We should not assume that "everything that's not
{address_save_failed,_} is success". Because in this case any change
of do_change_address return values risks causing condition when we
will interpret error as success.

Line:481, src/ns_cluster.erl -> It doesn't handle not_self_started. But maybe we should just drop special handling of such case.
