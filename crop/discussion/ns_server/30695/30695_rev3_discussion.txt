Patch Set 3:

looks like there's still some misunderstanding.

I'd like to have casperjs and whatever else "js" to be "vendored" to our source repository.

Vendoring also means it shouldn't touch /usr/local or any global directory. And that it shouldn't need root or any setup or installation step.

But given that phantomjs itself is quite a big binary and is not cross platform. And also given it's relatively easy to install, I think there's no need to upload phantomjs itself to our repository.

Any new developer should be able to run our tests after installing phantomjs, ruby and few required gems. Rest (casper, resemble, ... whatever) we should carry in our source.

At least that's what makes most sense to me.
