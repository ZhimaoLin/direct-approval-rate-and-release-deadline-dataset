DESCRIPTION

MB-5110: shutdown config merger when shutting down disco_sup

Because config merger was merely linked to ns_config_rep, shutdown of
ns_config_rep during cluster leave would only send exit signal to
config merger. So there seems to be small amount of time when config
merger still can cause troubles by sending newly merged config to
ns_config after ns_config is cleared right after main services is shut
down.
