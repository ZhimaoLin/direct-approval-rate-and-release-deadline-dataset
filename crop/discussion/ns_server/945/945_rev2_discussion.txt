DESCRIPTION

Distributed, replicated logs.

Instead of having ns_log run in the global singleton, ns_log,
ns_log_events, ns_mail_sup, and ns_mail now run on each node. Log
messages are deduplicated locally and broadcast to the entire cluster,
and each log server gossips with the others periodically to make sure
it didn't miss any.

This is for beta2, not for beta1.1, so hold off on approving it until
after beta 1.1 goes out.
