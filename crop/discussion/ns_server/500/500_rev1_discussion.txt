Patch Set 1: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Minor typo on the part of the specification.  

Already verified with only-web.rb.

Line:279, deps/menelaus/priv/public/index.html -> This should be "This server is now reachable."  The word 'is' is missing.  I just double checked and saw it was missing from the specification too.  Sorry about that.
