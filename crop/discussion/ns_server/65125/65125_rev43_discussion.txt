Patch Set 43:

I think this looks fine in terms of the code. I do have some usability feedback that I'm asking Mike to track. Namely:

[ ] Rebalance jitter
[ ] Use of red font after in status message after a node fails over (looks like an error but isn't an error)
[ ] Use of red font in server memory usage bar (also looks like an error)
[ ] Make server node red/orange indicator bigger (not prominent enough)
[ ] Indent server details information so it’s easier to see the visual hierarchy (right now, problem is that when expanded it’s hard to see where one server ends and the next begins)

Mike is tracking the feedback.
