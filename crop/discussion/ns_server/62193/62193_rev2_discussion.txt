Patch Set 2:

I have tested this, but only with the related patch in cbft which removes the same fields from the stats JSON.

http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/62194/

With both changes, things appeared to work OK.  I know ns_server did not like it when I first only removed them from cbft, I do not know how it will behave it sees additional fields its not expecting.

Patch Set 2:

Good enough. I'm going to deem this "verified". ns_server shouldn't choke if there's more stuff in the index status than is referenced by the mapping and Marty vouches for the correctness when both sides had it removed. What's the worst that could happen? :-)
