CBD-315: Consolidate CouchDB replicator with ns_server XDCR replicator

This is the first commit to consolidate couchdb replicator with the
XDCR replicator in ns_server. In this change-set we migrate two helper
functions used by XDCR as well as all functions being called by them
from couchdb to ns_server. The entry functions are  1) parse_rep_doc()
and 2) is_valid_xdc_rep_doc().
