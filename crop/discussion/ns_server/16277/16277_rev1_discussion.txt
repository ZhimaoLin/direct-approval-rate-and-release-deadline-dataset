DESCRIPTION

MB-5346: correcly handle failures to change vbucket filter

Previous logic was bad in few places. First {badrpc, ...} was just
passed up to perform_vbucket_filter_change. And
set_node_replicas just assumed that any return that's not
not_supported is success. Which is clearly wrong.

This commit tightens typespec of policy's change_vbucket_filter
implementation. And changes "new-style" implementation to throw
badmatch if vbucket filter change fails. Also set_node_replicas now
explicitly expects {ok, ...} instead of anything. And lastly, logging
in this area was improved.
