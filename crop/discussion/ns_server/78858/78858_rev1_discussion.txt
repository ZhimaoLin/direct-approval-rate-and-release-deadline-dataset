Patch Set 1:

Bob - here's the bit of code I was working on in terms of how we might get good cache control headers in place. Key idea was to divide up requests into "data / content" requests (requests that might contain data or system metadata) that should not be cached and web resources (basically always from files) that we should allow the browser to cache.

As you see, I hadn't gotten too far.
