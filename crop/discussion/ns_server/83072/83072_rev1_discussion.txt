DESCRIPTION

MB-25894: Allow topkeys to be enabled/disabled

There is a lock contention within the implementation of topkeys
in memcached, and the current implementation within ns_server (only
providing a snapshot view and no historical data) makes it more
eye-candy in the UI than a tool a user may actually use.

Make the setting dynamic in memcached, so that people who don't
care about top-keys can disable the support and get better
performance at the same time.

To disable topkeys support the following command may be used:

  curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
       -X POST \
       http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
       --data topkeys_enabled=false

To enable, simply execute:

  curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
       -X POST \
       http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
       --data topkeys_enabled=true
