DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Remove dump_parameters.

Parameters can be changed dynamically so it doesn't make sense to dump
them only once on xdc_rep_manager start.

Besides, all the #rep records are going to have a complete list of
parameters for the replication. And whenever replication gets
started, this record will be logged by standard erlang mechanisms.

Junyi, since dump_parameters didn't log anything that is not per replication, please remove your -2 per agreement with Ravi.

Patch Set 4: -Code-Review

Now I do not have time to go through all your commits to figure out the node parameters to dump. 

I remove my -2 here to unblock you and later I will create a new commit to add node-wide parameter dump when replicator starts up. Hope it is Ok with you.
