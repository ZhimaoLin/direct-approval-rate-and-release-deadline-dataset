DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Remove dump_parameters.

Parameters can be changed dynamically so it doesn't make sense to dump
them only once on xdc_rep_manager start.

Besides, all the #rep records are going to have a complete list of
parameters for the replication. And whenever replication gets
started, this record will be logged by standard erlang mechanisms.

Patch Set 3:

The piece of code here is definitely necessary, which is now used by QE , support team, and myself to verify XDCR parameters. It is really no impact to your ns_server performance since it is once-time cost.

If you relocate XDCR parameters elsewhere, please modify the dump function to dump them, instead of eliminating it
