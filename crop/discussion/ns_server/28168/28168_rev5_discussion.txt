DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Remove dump_parameters.

Parameters can be changed dynamically so it doesn't make sense to dump
them only once on xdc_rep_manager start.

Besides, all the #rep records are going to have a complete list of
parameters for the replication. And whenever replication gets
started, this record will be logged by standard erlang mechanisms.
