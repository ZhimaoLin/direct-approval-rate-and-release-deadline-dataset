DESCRIPTION

MB-21541: Create REST API to accept 'flags' param.

The current problem is that when a document is created or modified from
the UI the flags field gets set/reset to 0. This makes the SDKs not able
to retrieve the documents. The fix is the following:

[1] Extend the create document REST API to accept a 'flags' parameter
    which is a positive integer.
[2] If 'flags' parameter is not specified a default value of 0x02000006
    is set. The default value enables both the new and the legacy SDKs
    to interpret the document in JSON format.
[3] In the edit case, it's expected that the UI sends back the 'flags'
    that it would have first fetched when the document is read.
