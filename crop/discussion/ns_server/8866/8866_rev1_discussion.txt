DESCRIPTION

Ask user for both db path and indices path in configuration wizard.

Provided paths are stored as a proplist under {node, node(), couchdb}
key.
E.g.:
  {{node, node(), couchdb},
      [{database_dir, "/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data"},
       {view_index_dir, "/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data"}]}.
NB: In this commit these settings are not set to couchdb config yet.
