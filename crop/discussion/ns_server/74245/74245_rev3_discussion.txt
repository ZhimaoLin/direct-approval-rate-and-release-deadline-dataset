DESCRIPTION

MB-22877: Add --tmp-dir as a cbcollect_info argument

The --tmp-dir argument will override any TMPDIR environment variable
set. Unlike the environment variable, --tmp-dir will cause
cbcollect_info to fail if it's not a suitable directory.

Patch Set 3: Verified-1

When I use ~ in the path on OS X it fails, as os.path.expanduser() needs to be used. We should support this. 

 This also shows that the  error handling around mkdtemp is not great. We should have a try except around mkdtemp and throw a useful massage.

$ ./cbcollect_info --tmp-dir=~/tmp Darian Blanchard.zip

Line:1142, cbcollect_info -> (Nitpicking) Should this be a capital?  I know the rest of the output is a little in consistent but it seem wrong to have "Overrides" as a capital and not "Set".

Line:1142, cbcollect_info -> First time I read this I find it confusing, as it kind of suggests the .zip is going to be in the temp dir set. I would suggest just removing the "output" or changing it to "Set the temp dir used to collect debug data before building the zip"

Patch Set 3:

The correct way to handle Patrick's case is to set the tmpdir to be 'os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser(tmpdir))'. This will handle any expansion such as home directories, as well as relative paths from home directories

James - this would be nice to get in, if you have time. Any plans to push a new patch taking into account Paddy and Matt's comments?
