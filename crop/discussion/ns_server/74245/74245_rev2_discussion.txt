DESCRIPTION

MB-22877: Add --tmp-dir as a cbcollect_info argument

The --tmp-dir argument will override any TMPDIR environment variable
set. Unlike the environment variable, --tmp-dir will cause
cbcollect_info to fail if it's not a suitable directory.

Line:253, cbcollect_info -> mkdtemp() will try a number of locations in order: https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir

In the case that the the ENV variable TMPDIR (or any of the others on that list) is set, but not usable, mkdtemp() will quietly try others, most likely settling on /tmp. If the user has specified TMPDIR=/foo/bar, it's unexpected that we'd use /tmp. The log line on 255 would make it clear that we are using /tmp, but without this one it would be pretty unclear *why*.

Given that we see a lot of confusion from users over what dirs are being used, more feedback is probably better here.

If tmp_dir is set, self.tmpdir is obviously going to be different from the ENV variable, so we don't care.

Line:251, cbcollect_info -> Embarrassingly, this appears to have been an issue with one of the test cases I ran and not Windows, making this harmless, but also useless as far as I can tell.

Will double check and consider removing.
