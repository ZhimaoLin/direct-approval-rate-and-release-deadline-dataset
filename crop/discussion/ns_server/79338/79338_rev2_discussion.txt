The latest jquery version appears to be 3.2.1. Is there a reason why can't use that version?

No, not really, let me make sure things work fine with the current version of jQuery and the old version of angular that we use.

Patch Set 2:

There are few other AngularJS Library for Drag and Drop that supports Sortable and Draggable where no JQuery/JQuery UI used.

We are trying to avoid using of jQuery where it is possible. Also, take a look at Server Groups section. It has a good alternative to Drag and Drop functionality.
