Patch Set 3:

I tried using ng-sortable, and the drag-drop-sort utility seemed quite flaky - with items constantly becoming transparent upon selection and even vanishing from the list sometimes.

What's the rationale behind avoiding jQuery?

Patch Set 3:

I do not see any issues within their example http://a5hik.github.io/ng-sortable/#/kanban. We don't want use jQuery because we use Angular. What do you think about server groups page?

Thanks mike!

The server/groups page has the move to capability. What I want here is the mouse:drag-drop and sort feature.
