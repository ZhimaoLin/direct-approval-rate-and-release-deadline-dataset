Line:74, common_tests/config_restore_test_SUITE.erl -> i2l should be a macro and not a function.

Line:74, common_tests/config_restore_test_SUITE.erl -> Macros get replaced with the actual code at compile time. This save a function call. This of course doesn't matter for a test suite that much, but I think it makes sense to apply it to all cases.
