DESCRIPTION

MB-23937 Fix user menu dropdown layout

This simplifies the header <nav> html &
fixes the positioning of the link and menu for logged-in users.
Also fixes the alignment of the links in the server groups menu
(they were right-aligned inherited from their container table row);
and tightened some details of the tasks progress menu.
