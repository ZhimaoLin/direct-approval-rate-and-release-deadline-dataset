Patch Set 4:

This should be ready for review. The "WIP" label is still in place because this commit does not make the new UI stuff the "default"--it lives at /new.html

I can update this commit to make it the default (and remove all the old code), but I found it useful to be able to compare them side-by-side.

I figured a follow-up commit could remove the old stuff. Happy to do it whichever way works best.

Thanks.
