Line:1416, src/misc.erl -> This function allows ipv4 addresses, but disallow ipv6 addresses. This will prevent engaging cluster using ipv6 address. It might be OK considering that raw ipv6 addresses are not supported, but the error message ("short names are not allowed" part) is not exactly correct anymore
