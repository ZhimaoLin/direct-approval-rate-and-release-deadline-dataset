Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Double-checking -- does the spec say an empty email is still ok and acceptable -- for community and/or for enterprise editions?

If so, my quick reading of this commit makes me think email is validated no matter what (although I could be quickly reading wrongly).

-1 to make this double-checking question visible.

Patch Set 1: (2 inline comments)

It does. But in correct way. Empty email is ok. But if plant tree is checked it requires all fields (including email) to be non-empty.

See inline for details

Line:686, priv/public/js/app.js -> We allow empty email here

Line:701, priv/public/js/app.js -> but if plant tree is checked we require all fields (including email) to be non-empty
