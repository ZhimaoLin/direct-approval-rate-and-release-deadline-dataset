DESCRIPTION

fixed number field widths in webkit browsers

The spinner buttons are calculated as part of the widgets
total width. Giving supporting browsers a bit more space fixes
the problem.

Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

better. But honestly I don't get why it needs to be very different from firefox. And my taste tells me "ugly" in both browsers, BTW.

Anyway, we can only move forward here I guess.
