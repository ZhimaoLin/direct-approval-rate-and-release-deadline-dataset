Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

My -1s for this and previous commits are not strictly -1s. I put them just to make my comments more visible.

Line:165, src/ns_config_rep.erl -> Since we read values from actual config (ns_config) here we lose an order of changes upon replication. Suppose we have the following chain of updates happened: (k1, vk1_1), (k2, vk2_1), (k1, vk1_2). Then if replication happens in between of first k1 and k2 updates, we will replicate vk1_2 as a value for k1. But we won't replicate k2 at all. I'm not sure if we rely anywhere on this order. But it seems like a good property to have.

Line:780, src/ns_config.erl -> I don't quite understand this line cause seemingly return value is just ignored. I think if there's some important side-effect of this call then there should be comment describing this side-effect.
