DESCRIPTION

Explicit LD_LIBRARY_PATH for relocatability [backport]

Some packagers/installers, like rpm post-install scripts, implement
install-time relocatability by searching+replacing "/opt/couchbase"
with "/some/user/chosen/path".  An explicit LD_LIBRARY_PATH allows it
to be automatically fixed at install-time.
