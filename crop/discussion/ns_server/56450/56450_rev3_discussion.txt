DESCRIPTION

MB-16435: OS X: Remove any overrides of DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

As of OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) it is no longer possible to set /
override DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. As such we need to move to embedding
runtime linker search paths in all required binaries.

Given we can't rely on this env var anymore, remove setting it in the
startup scripts to (1) ensure we don't incorrectly rely on it and (2)
help in validating that all uses are identified and fixed.

Patch Set 3:

This change was my goof. I should've rebased Dave's original change on top of sherlock and then merged forward to master. So now the master history looks wonky with tip of master having two preceding commits that look the same but are in fact the same change made on the two branches, master and sherlock. 

If you were confused I hope you managed to get to this comment (and my apologies).
