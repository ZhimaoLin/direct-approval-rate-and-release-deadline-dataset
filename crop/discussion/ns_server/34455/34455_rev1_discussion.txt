DESCRIPTION

MB-10057: implemented basic get_local_vbuuid/2 for 3.0

Not that it's not kind of checkpointing we ultimately want in 3.0. But
in order to merge 2.5.1 stuff it's best to start simple.

This implementation is taking vbucket uuid from failover id using stat
request. And notably, unlike 2.5.1 it will not tolerate crashes due to
3.0's failover id change on unclean shutdown.
