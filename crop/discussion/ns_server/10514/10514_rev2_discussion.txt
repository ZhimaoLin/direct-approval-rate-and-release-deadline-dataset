DESCRIPTION

Add Undescrore to Replication State Attribute

The XDC replication info doc attribute replication_state must have an
underscore character at the front in order to allow also storing the
_replication_state_time attribute. For consistency, the vbucket state
attributes replication_state_vb_* also have an underscrore at the
front now.
