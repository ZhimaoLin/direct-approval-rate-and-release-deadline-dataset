Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We cant have the input field cut off before its visible range, either need to align the prefix to the right or center with a fixed with that allows for the size differences

The only alternative that has both the prefix and input sized correctly is tables, I dont thing whitespace around prefix is bad though, just not all to the right like mine was
