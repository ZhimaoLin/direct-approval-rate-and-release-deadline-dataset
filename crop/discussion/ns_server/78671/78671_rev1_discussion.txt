Hi Abhinav,
Should double-check on the implications of this change... for example, if a user is just an fts-searcher only, or just an fts-admin only... will he be able to see additional parts of the UI (like the bucket-related screens) because of this proposed change?

And, if so, is that okay by the PM's (especially Don).  If they say all-good there, then it's good.

hey Steve, yes, so with this change the fts_admin/searcher will be able to see the bucket tab, but only the list of buckets that the user has access to will be displayed.
