Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

there's much more elegant way to achieve that. But I'm not sure we really need that for _all_ usages of this helper.

Patch Set 1:

Well, the function says truncateTo3Digits, so it needs to only return 3. This code does that. If you want to make it more elegant, feel free...but I'd recommend doing it later (post 1.7.1) so we can kill this bug now.

Patch Set 1:

It means 3 _signigicant_ digits and there's leastScale parameter for things like we need here.

See http://review.couchbase.org/7740 for my fix for that bug.
