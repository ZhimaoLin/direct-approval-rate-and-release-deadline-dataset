DESCRIPTION

A function to sleep until initial backfill is finished.

To understand when backfill is finished we monitor TAP connection for
CHECKPOINT_START messages. Once this message is encountered we can be
sure that either initial backfill has been performed or it has not
been required at all. But in some cases (e.g. TAP connection resumed)
we will not be able to see CHECKPOINT_START message for a considerable
amount of time. So our strategy here is to report that backfill has
finished if we have seen no mutations transferred for a certain amount
of time.
