DESCRIPTION

A function to sleep until backfill is finished.

We monitor tap connection for certain packages and send a notification
to a caller either when the actual backfill just finished or when
we're pretty sure that there will not be a backfill phase at all.

see inline.

And in-general do we handle named tap connections resumptions here ? We won't have some part of state. Particularly, it's possible that we won't see backfill start. If backfill was started, then something happened. Then we restarted named tap stream, it'll continue old stream internally. Not sending backfill again.

Line:464, src/ebucketmigrator_srv.erl -> cannot get this. Can this be commented?

Looks unlogical. Why we auto-close backfill on first mutation?

Line:474, src/ebucketmigrator_srv.erl -> shouldn't we notify everybody?

Line:464, src/ebucketmigrator_srv.erl -> But this is done only for vbuckets for which we have not seen backfill start/close (these are elements of backfill_vbuckets set).

Line:474, src/ebucketmigrator_srv.erl -> We should. My bad.

Patch Set 1:

Yes, resumptions are not handled by this approach. I was not aware of such a possibility.
