DESCRIPTION

MB-6160: apply index config changes on ddoc replication process

So that we can stop worrying if some ddoc becomes deleted concurrently
with us trying to do something with it.

Notable side effects are:

* cb_generic_replication_srv keeps full #doc-s in it's state

* capi_set_view_manager does not keep track of all ddocs anymore,
  relying on capi_ddoc_replication_srv
