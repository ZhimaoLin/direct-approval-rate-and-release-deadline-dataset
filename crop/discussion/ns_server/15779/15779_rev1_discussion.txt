DESCRIPTION

added IOCenter.pauseAjax for disabling UI updates

This was done in addition to simulateDisconnect which has
the side effect of marking the UI as stale which causes
rendering to change significantly--thereby making it a
pain to actually work on the HTML/CSS which keeps getting
updated when AJAX requests are happening or set to stale.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

it seems to drop XHR requests on the floor instead of actually pausing that. But OK as a kludge & useful for development.

Putting +V without really testing because it looks obviously correct
