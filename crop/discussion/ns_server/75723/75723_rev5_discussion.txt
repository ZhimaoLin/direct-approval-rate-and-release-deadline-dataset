DESCRIPTION

generate sasl_password on bucket creation and do not allow to

...overwrite it on bucket update. the REST API's will simply
ignore autType and saslPassword parameters without erroring out.
Strict rejection of these parameters might be implemented later
but for now bucket api's do not error out on extra parameters

auth_type field in BucketConfig is always sasl. moxi_port is allowed
on all buckets now.

the generated passwords are needed to support XDC replications
from pre Spock clusters. Also these passwords are passed to moxi

I'm thinking about dropping auth_type field, but that requires
more work
