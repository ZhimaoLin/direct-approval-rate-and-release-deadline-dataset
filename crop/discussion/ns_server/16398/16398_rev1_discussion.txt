DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: track internal config merger stats

We track index merger queue size, run time per second, sleep time per
second & runs per second. We also keep 10 seconds, 1 minute and 5
minutes exponential averages so that some hint about recent changes of
this values can be seen.

I.e.:

[{avg_10s_config_merger_queue_len,0.0}, ;
 {avg_10s_config_merger_run_time,1494.0458464975236},
 {avg_10s_config_merger_runs_rate,1.7052382877679426},
 {avg_10s_config_merger_sleep_time,70803.63560998277},
 {avg_1m_config_merger_queue_len,0.0},
 {avg_1m_config_merger_run_time,6084.076291615677},
 {avg_1m_config_merger_runs_rate,6.787356786667585},
 {avg_1m_config_merger_sleep_time,274813.7836538573},
 {avg_5m_config_merger_queue_len,0.0},
 {avg_5m_config_merger_run_time,2266.6671746311986},
 {avg_5m_config_merger_runs_rate,2.5713753460900906},
 {avg_5m_config_merger_sleep_time,106212.69140423223},
 {config_merger_queue_len,0}....
