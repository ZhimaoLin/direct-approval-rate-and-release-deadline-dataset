Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(5 inline comments)

nacked because of non-equivalent changes around == versus ===.

Line:203, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> this is slight semantical change

Line:396, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> this is semantical change

Line:428, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> semantic change here

Line:678, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> let me know if jQuery has similar facility. Otherwise I disagree.

Line:1074, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> I don't understand this.

added more comments

Line:154, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> disagree with trailing empty return and most importantly with 'reversing' natural control flow here.

Line:843, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> it's not useless. early break affects value of 'i' variable that's checked in next statement

Line:203, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> Done

Line:154, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> The "trailing empty return" was there before I got there, I just added the semicolon. :)

As far as reversing the "natural" control flow, I moved the function to the top as it seems more natural to find a function definition and then its point of execution. When you read the code you can hold "ah, the ajaxCallback, probably need that later" and then find it used vs. finding the finalAjaxOptions with references to a possibly new (or possibly global) variable name which we later find out is a function defined after the control flow. It's more helpful to know what's coming and know where to find things in the code. If we mix the location of things the code runs, but is far less readable.

Line:428, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> Done

Line:678, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> jQuery itself doesn't, but making this more jQuery-like or using a popular/actively-developed plugin for this would make the app code feel more consistent.

Line:843, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> Done

Line:1074, deps/menelaus/priv/js/app-misc.js -> Done
