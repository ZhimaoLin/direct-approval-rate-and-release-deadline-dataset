DESCRIPTION

Spatial views don't need a bounding box anymore. If none is defined the
full data set is returned. Additionally spatial views support skip and
limit to page through the results.

Patch Set 1:

btw some sample dataset/view would be very useful to have. I.e. previously we had some spatial stuff in beers, but not anymore. Maybe if you can share spatial view useful for beers that will surely be helpful for us to verify if spatial view still work
