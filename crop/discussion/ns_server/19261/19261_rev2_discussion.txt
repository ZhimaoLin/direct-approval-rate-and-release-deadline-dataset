DESCRIPTION

CBD-423 Don't trigger updates for development indexes.

If certain signature corresponds the only development document then we
won't try to trigger index update. Note that now we ought to read all
the design documents from database because seemingly there's no way to
obtain a list of ids of all design documents with a certain
signature (or corresponding to a certain set view group).
