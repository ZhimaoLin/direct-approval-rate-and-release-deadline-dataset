Patch Set 6:

The reason I don't like custom format, because one is bound to miss corner cases. For example, . (dot) can be part of the bucket name, your code doesn't seem to handle it.

Patch Set 6:

Just to make it clear, I'm not insisting on any other format. Just pointing out that there are problems with the current implementation. I'm fine to merge this as long as they are fixed.
