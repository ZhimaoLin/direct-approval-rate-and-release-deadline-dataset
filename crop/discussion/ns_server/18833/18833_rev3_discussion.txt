DESCRIPTION

CBD-378 Update replication creation code.

Most of the code removed since similar functionality's now available
through remote_clusters_info. Structure of replication document has
been changed slightly. "target" is just an abstract reference to
remote cluster's bucket instead of url
(e.g. /remoteCluster/remote/buckets/default). "targetUUID" field
containing UUID of remote cluster added.
