do we expect our users to run this thing in such a way ? I've somewhere we're going to create symlinks in /usr/bin right ?

Patch Set 1:

I get the same error as Farshid.

On Mac at least, the tools are symlinked into /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin or ~/bin). This creates the problem that `dirname $0` won't correctly find the Couchbase bin directory. 

In C one would call realpath(argv[0]) to resolve the symlink, but I can't find a bash equivalent of this. (I admit to being really lame at shell scripting though.)
