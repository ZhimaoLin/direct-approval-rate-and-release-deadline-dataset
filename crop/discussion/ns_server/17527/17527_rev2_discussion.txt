DESCRIPTION

MB-5645: cbbrowse_logs uses .., not double dirname

OSX needs absolute path, and its logs live in a different place.

Line:5, cbbrowse_logs -> I not got this trick. But I have some doubts about embedded double quotes. I believe you've tested it works, but it was likely bash right? Which is quite advanced shell. I think it makes sense to test if simpler shells are not get confused by those inner quotes

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

This fixes the problem reported in the bug, so go for it.

It does still suffer from the problem of failing if the script itself is symlinked, as will happen in OS X installations once my tool-installer patch gets reviewed <http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17294>.

Line:5, cbbrowse_logs -> yes, i tested it on centos.

my only explanation/guess is parentheses looks like they take higher parsing precedence than double-quotes.

oh, and i found it on the internet, so it must be true.
