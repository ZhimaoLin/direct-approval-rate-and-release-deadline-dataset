DESCRIPTION

MB-10220 Always allow generate_map_chain use chain maps.

Since we started using generate_map_chain for generation of star maps
for the case when num_replicas is 1 and no tags are defined, the code
there should be adapted to accept past maps with 'chain'
replication_topology even when current replication_topology (and hence
replication_topology in options passed to the function) is 'star'.
