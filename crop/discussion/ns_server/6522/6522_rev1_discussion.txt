DESCRIPTION

simplified and fixed hostname port cutting logic

New logic is to strip port _only_ if all hostnames have default port
(8091).

So that if you have only single host with non-default port it's not
hidden from you. This was especially problematic with single active
host with port 9000 and single pending-add host with port 9001, in
which case old logic was stripping port confusing you.

Line:445, priv/public/js/app-misc.js -> This idiom of using declaring this var inside the block is legally correct JS.

However, it still bugs my fallible human eyes, meaning I have to think about it :-)
