DESCRIPTION

simplified and fixed hostname port cutting logic

New logic is to strip port _only_ if all hostnames have default port
(8091).

So that if you have only single host with non-default port it's not
hidden from you. This was especially problematic with single active
host with port 9000 and single pending-add host with port 9001, in
which case old logic was stripping port confusing you.
