DESCRIPTION

Shutdown ns_server gracefully from within cluster_run.

SIGINT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals cause shutdown procedure. Unfortunately in
case script has been run with -i flag it's not possible (at least impossible
to do it easily) to prevent erl shell from terminating when terminal is gone
(SIGHUP).
