Patch Set 1:

Probably it would be a little bit more convenient to have one log file that has only non-internal requests and the other one that has all the requests (both internal and external). This way you don't need to merge the files if you want to see both.

You could also a single logger for both types of requests. And differentiate them by log level (let's say internal requests could have debug log level).
