Patch Set 3:

just to make things clear. I'm not going to remove wip from that. I cannot say doing what I did is always correct. This patch was merely a demonstration that current XDCR code is clearly suboptimal in this particular place

Hi Damien, 

My knowledge about ns_server is still not enough to judge the merit of this change-set. It would be nice if you could take a look and if it is fine, I think we should merge it since it will improve xdcr replication. Thanks.
