does this need to be done now?  this needs to be coordinated with the client libraries

Happy to punt on this until post-CouchConf, but let's not forget about it.

Patch Set 2:

Some misunderstanding grows apparently. What client libraries?

This is _purely_ internal to UI thing.

Client libraries are supposed to take CAPI url from bucket details. UI is doing same, but that's another domain. And in order to reach that domain it's using that _internal_ and _not documented_ prefix
