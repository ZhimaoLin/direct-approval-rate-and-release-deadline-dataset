DESCRIPTION

MB-8341 Use binary names for all lazily computed stats.

Previously we assumed these stats' names to be atoms. That prevented
XDCR stats from being displayed correctly in 'by server' mode. This
happened because XDCR stats used binary names. From now all the lazily
computed stats must use binary names.
