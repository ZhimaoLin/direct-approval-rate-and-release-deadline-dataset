Mike, I'm not seeing any traces of ep_max_size in ep-engine source (well, stats.org is the only one).

Are you sure that's still relevant ?

Yes, ep_max_size comes from the configuration. I have tested this change already and will do so again before I merge it in order to make sure everything works properly.

Patch Set 1:

a) just Adrianna Holmesal test

b) can you point me to ep-engine commit and/or source where ep_max_size is used. I can only find one occurrence in docs but not in code.
