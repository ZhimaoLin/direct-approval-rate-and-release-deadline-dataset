Patch Set 1:

Not entirely sure this is the right fix, the problem is that given < 30 samples briefInterval is set too low which breaks the

condition and generates the data as a list of completely different series each with one point as opposed to one series with multiple points, its pretty much impossible to figure out the original intention from the code by itself

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

good catch.

Original intention was to interpret large sample gaps as 'holes'. So right fix would be dividing by min(samples.length, 30).

Patch Set 1:

or min(sample.length/2, 30). We want to render hole when seeing gap of more then 2 samples
