going to try that

Line:438, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> don't need this. Data is value right?

With that change do we need separate opcode for XXX-with-meta at all ?

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I failed to make sense of protocol change here. Thus cannot review. -1 for now

Right - my erlang is rusty.  Will update.

The protocol has separate opcodes.  I bet you probably want to change the protocol, which isn't in the scope of this change to make the code match the protocol.

Line:397, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> I don't get this

Line:428, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> And I don't get that. Why expiration and flags needs to be here at all?

Line:397, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> I was following the original code, which I didn't fully get.

But, it handles the growth in SeqNo from 32-bits to 64-bits.

The RevId in the original code was also not actually a RevId.  Instead, it was the encoded CAS+Expiration+Flag bits.  I changed the variable name to make that obvious.

Line:428, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> I don't think they need to be there, and in fact it just gets thrown away here; but my rationale is I was trying to be conservative in trying not to change the semantics of the decode_meta() function.... much.

Perhaps others who understand the code more can be more brave (especially those with a working system).
