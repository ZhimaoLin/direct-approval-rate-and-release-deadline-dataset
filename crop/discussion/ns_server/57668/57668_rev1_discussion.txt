DESCRIPTION

Collect extended socket stats (ss --info --processes).

Which gives lots of low-level information about sockets, like how much
time passed since the last send/recv, some congestion control
info. But unfortunately not last acked byte which I hoped I'd get with
this change.

Also get the information about process owning the socket (and which
file descriptor the socket corresponds to).
