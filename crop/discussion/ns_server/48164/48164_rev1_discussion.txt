Patch Set 1:

Question. You removed postClientErrorReport in this commit: http://review.couchbase.org/38144. It mentions replacing it with bugsnag. And now you basically resurrecting it. Can you explain how come bugsnag is not helping us here?

Patch Set 1:

Errors comes to bugsnag in case we don't try to catch them. Specifically in this case, we are trying to catch the error and using synchronous ajax that has a bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14683

Patch Set 1:

I think it would be a good idea to double-check all 'try catch' operators. But this should be separate task. Should I do this?

Patch Set 1:

So if we want to send all caught errors then we need to do this separately for each case using bugsnag's api.
