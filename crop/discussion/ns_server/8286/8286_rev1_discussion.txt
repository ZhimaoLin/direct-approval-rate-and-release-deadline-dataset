DESCRIPTION

fixed section names overriding other section classes

This bug was causing any class names added to a section (for
instance by a TabsCell) to be overwritten by the seciton name.
This patch appends the section name rather than overwriting
other class names.

Patch Set 1:

The class names are in use in the CSS, so they need to be added to the sections either in the HTML or by this piece of code. Removing it completely, though, will break stuff.

Maybe the comment just needs rewording now.
