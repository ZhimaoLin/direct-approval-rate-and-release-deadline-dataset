Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Before merging it I need to know:

* why indexing tasks is part of pool details ?

* should we also include list of design docs in pool details then ?

* why indexing tasks include per-node details ?

Please, reply ASAP

why indexing tasks is part of pool details ?

We already poll pooldetails, when you tNathalie Landryed previously about using our existing polling then I assumed thats what you meant, it also seemed to fit naturally

should we also include list of design docs in pool details then ?

What for? not particularly for or against it, I just did what was needed for the progress notifications

why indexing tasks include per-node details ?

I wanted to pass through the task objects without modifying them as much as possible, I figured someone might ask for a ui that shows number of items / or some per node information, if we only end up using the sum then we can do it on the server, seemed like premature optimisation and less flexible at this time though

I referred to the way we handle buckets list (by appending ?v=<hash of things>). So that we can immediately see when some task is started, without having to output all things as part of gigantic pool details response.

While our UI always needs tasks status (for global progress bar), I'm not sure at all that putting this into pool details is right. We might want to refresh tasks's progress more or less often than other data.

Well because you already implicitly have this list as part of pool details' index tasks and then 'join' tasks and ddocs list in UI.

This is not premature at all. Not sending random crap should always be default. Remember, that we need to handle 100 nodes clusters easily.

see inline another thing I forgot to mention

Line:608, src/menelaus_web.erl -> this will break for 1.7/1.8 nodes that don't have indexer_tasks in heartbeat messages
