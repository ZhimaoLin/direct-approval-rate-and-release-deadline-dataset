Patch Set 2: (5 inline comments)

Some minor comments once again.

Line:69, src/failover_safeness_level.erl -> string() can be bucket_name()

Line:315, src/ns_bucket.erl -> Imperative name (replicate_in_chain) sounds weird in this context. Likely you meant replicated_in_chain. And by the way it can be as simple as lists:member({SrcNode, DstNode}, misc:pairs(Chain)).

Line:282, src/ns_vbm_sup.erl -> use vbucket_id() instead of non_neg_integer()

Line:338, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> No need to pass [] here.

Line:340, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> And here.

thanks for comments. Will update soon.

Line:315, src/ns_bucket.erl -> will fix name. I'm doing it this way because I'd like this code to avoid any extra 'cons'-ing and thus GC pressure. Maybe I'm just a bit too performance oriented at this point.
