DESCRIPTION

Refactor capi_ddoc_replication_srv into a behaviour.

To avoid fixing the same bug in capi_ddoc_replication_srv and
xdc_rdoc_replication (which are very similar) we introduce a
cb_generic_replication_srv behavior. So that most of the replication
logic is abstracted in this behavior.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I like idea. But looks like there's issue in implementation.

Line:88, src/cb_generic_replication_srv.erl -> I think we'll start duplicate replications here.
