Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

* ++ -ing ns_config internal settings and goxdcr settings might be a correctness problem occasionally (i.e. due to duplicate keys). IMHO that's not big enough problem to block merging this

* [ns_config:set(K, V) || {K, V} <- <somecode>] can actually be replaced with single code. There is KVList version of ns_config:set. Consider adjusting it in subsequent commits.
