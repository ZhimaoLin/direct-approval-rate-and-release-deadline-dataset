DESCRIPTION

Don't crash when ssl services are not running.

It's possible that ns_ssl_services_setup tries to restart capi and
rest ssl services before then even were started by their correspondent
supervisors. Since by that time time ns_ssl_services_setup had already
saved new certificate and private key to disk, it's safe to just let
the supervisors start the services.
