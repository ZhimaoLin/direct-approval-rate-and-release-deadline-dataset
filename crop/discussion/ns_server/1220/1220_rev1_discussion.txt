DESCRIPTION

force re-fetching of pool details when rebalance completes

Our comet pool details stream doesn't notice rebalance completion
('cause there is no rebalance completion event to subscribe to) so we
just force-reload it after rebalance is done.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Moxi needs to be aware of the rebalance, and it too is a comet pool client.  This needs to be fixed at the server side.
