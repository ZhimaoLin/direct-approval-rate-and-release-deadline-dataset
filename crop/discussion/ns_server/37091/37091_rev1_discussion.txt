DESCRIPTION

make 3.0 node in cluster with Adrianna Holmesally lowered cluster compat version

... to tolerate new style credentials

if we force compat mode from 3.0 to 2.5 or lower the admin credentials
will stop working. to fix this one needs to run cbreset_password script
to reset the admin password

the purpose of this fix is to unbreak cbreset_password for forced compat
mode and make sure that before the admin password is reset the auth
simply rejects the credentials without crashes

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I believe this is too complicated. Ideally, our normal code path shouldn't be changed at all. Downgrading is an extraordinary event and it's ok to require some extra steps for user to perform. I'd prefer just a simple exported function that resets the credentials to something that pre 3.0 cluster can comprehend.
