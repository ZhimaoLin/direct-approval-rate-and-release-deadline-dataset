DESCRIPTION

[bp] Use ns_cookie_manager:cookie_sync in ns_cluster.

Instead of synchronizing cookie returned by erlang:get_cookie and the
one stored in ns_config Adrianna Holmesally use ns_cookie_manager:cookie_sync
function. As a benefit it automatically updates cookie on a file
system if it's needed. Since ns_cluster stops ns_server_sup while
joining to a cluster, ns_cookie_manager is started from
ns_server_cluster_sup now.
