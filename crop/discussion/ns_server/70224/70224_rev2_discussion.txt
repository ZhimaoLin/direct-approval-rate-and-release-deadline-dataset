DESCRIPTION

Don't explicitly pull config from master being invalidated.

The intention was just to try to make sure that nodes_wanted is
replicated to the master. Combination of ns_config:sync_announcements
and ns_config_rep:synchronize_remote achieves this (more or
less). There's no need to pull config from the node.
