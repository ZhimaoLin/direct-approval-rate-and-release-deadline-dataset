See inline.

In addition to that, there are lots of "formatting only" changes. Please separate them into a separate commit.

Line:195, src/ns_node_disco.erl -> We don't need this one. It's one of the alerts you can't even enable.

Line:203, src/ns_node_disco.erl -> Same here.

Line:2, src/ns_email_alert.erl -> Wrong year.

Line:35, src/ns_email_alert.erl -> This is already checked inside ns_mail:send_alert_async. So you either need to remove it from there or from here.
