Patch Set 3:

(3 comments)

Couple of comments inline.

More comments:

- we should really get rid of the 'all' alert, it's impossible to even enable it using the UI, so should be safe;
- would be good to hide the combination of logging and sending an alert behind macro or something of the sort, that would help avoid a lot of repitition

Line:35, src/menelaus_alert.erl -> Lots of commented out code in this module.

Line:1, src/ns_email_alert.erl -> Proper license header is missing.

Line:11, src/ns_email_alert.erl -> You could use work_queue, since the only thing you're using is handle_cast. The code would be a little more succinct.
