Looks good Dale,

Just one detail,
Don't go through the external HTTP API to pick a random. Instead do something like this:

Also, why that set_value function instead of lists:keystore for e.g.?

Also picking vbucket through vbucket map is racy. DB might be not created yet or not active anymore (the later needs to be handled in CRUD as well, so separate work, apparently).

And because randomly picking vbucket is easy and skipping lots  of docs is hard, we should limit skip amount and pick random local vbucket.
