DESCRIPTION

Implement _random API to pick a random key from CouchDB

Picks a random key from either the cluster or a local vbucket
depending on the number of items in the cluster, ignoring
design documents

There is a race between picking a vbucket and it being deleted
which will be handled in upcoming commit
