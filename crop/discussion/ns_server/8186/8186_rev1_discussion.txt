Patch Set 1: Verified

skip is recommended against generally because it currently does a full traversal of the btree, however is "generally" fast enough for our needs (500ms delay on 150k items)

and https://github.com/tilgovi/couchdb/commits/skiptree will likely be hitting trunk soon which make skip very efficient (2ms on 150k items)
