DESCRIPTION

avoid serialization in menelaus_stats_gatherer

This is particularly important when dealing with real-time stats where
response is typically delayed up to 1 seconds. Then when we change
view (say from cluster-wide to node stats) we cancel in-flight request
and issue new request. Old code would cause new request to wait until
cancelled request is unblocked.

Of course it is also important when there are multiple UI tabs looking
at stats.
