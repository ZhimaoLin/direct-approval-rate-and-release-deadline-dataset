DESCRIPTION

CBD-378 Update remote cluster reference creation code.

Now it uses newly introduced remote_clusters_info service to fetch the
information about remote cluster right away. Thus more errors might be
detected early. Additionally UUID of remote cluster is added to the
remote cluster config so that replication will be performed only into
correct cluster identified by that UUID.
