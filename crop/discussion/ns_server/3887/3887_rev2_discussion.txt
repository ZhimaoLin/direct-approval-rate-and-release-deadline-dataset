Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

How would this behave on a system without iostat?  This is not installed by default on RHEL 5, one platform we must support.

Patch Set 2: No score

Looking more closely, we have other cross-distro things in there, so it must behave okay.  Should we have two different Task types, one Fedora dialect and one Debian dialect?
