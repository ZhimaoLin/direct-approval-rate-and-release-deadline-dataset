DESCRIPTION

add bucket name xxx@xxx.xxx stats section name in ui stats response

the section name being just xxx@xxx.xxx caused the rest api to return
60 samples regardless of lastTStamp parameter. this happened because
the key for last TS was "@xdcr" but not xxx@xxx.xxx as was expected
by grab_ui_stats function
