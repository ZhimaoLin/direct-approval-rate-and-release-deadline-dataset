Patch Set 4: Verified+1

Artem,

Clearing the recovery_type before the delta recovery is complete can be a problem only if the node membership is still inactive when the next rebalance starts. In that case, the node will again be considered as NewNode and will cleanup the indexes because the recovery type was reset to none in previous rebalance.
But, we activate the node membership almost right away. So, if the membership of the node is inactive during next rebalance then it was either because it was either removed or failed over after the previous rebalance.  In either case, the code will do the right thing.

In any case, I have tweaked the code a little to remove the window between clearing of recovery_type and activating the membership of non-KV nodes.

Please take a look at the latest patch,
