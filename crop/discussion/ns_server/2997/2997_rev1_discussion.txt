DESCRIPTION

Bug 2470: Don't allow creation of buckets on in-use ports.

Right now we only check for other buckets, but this is a big
improvement!

REST creation will also error out.

Patch Set 1:

ns_bucket:create_bucket looks racy. In particular we validate ports before actually entering ns_config.

Patch Set 1:

ns_bucket:create_bucket is only called from the orchestrator. If someone else changes the settings at the same time a new bucket is created, it could cause problems, but as we don't currently deal with the error response properly anyway, this is kind of the least of our worries.
