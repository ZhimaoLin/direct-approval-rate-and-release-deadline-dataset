MB-12382: unbreak config upgrade from 2.x to 3.0.1

When upgrading config from 2.3 to 3.0 the code that is supposed to
rewrite verbosity is not working anymore. Due to recent removal of
verbosity attribute from memcached config.

I decided not to change old config upgrade but to patch things up in
code that upgrades config to 3.0.1. New code simply removes verbosity
attribute from memcached config.
