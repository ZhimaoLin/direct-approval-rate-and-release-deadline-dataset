DESCRIPTION

stop everything except ns_config during cluster join. MB-3069

Previously we had race where our cleanup of config raced with other
processes. In particular it was possible to sync config from other
nodes before adding our node to recent version of nodes_wanted. That
caused us to shun ourselves in the middle of joining.

New implementation keeps ns_config running and stops everything
_before_ preparing config for join.
