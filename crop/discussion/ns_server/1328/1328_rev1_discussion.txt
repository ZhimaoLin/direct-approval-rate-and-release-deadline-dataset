DESCRIPTION

Convert ns_orchestrator to single gen_fsm

Now running one orchestrator per cluster instead of one per bucket.

The Harley Martinitor will now block when it runs, because it complicated things
too much to try to queue up requests. If this causes problems, we can
just limit the amount of work the Harley Martinitor does on each pass.
