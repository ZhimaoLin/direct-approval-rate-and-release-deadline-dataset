Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think doing all that stuff with utf8 and computing byte size is not really needed. Plus in that form if you have a 1 meg document it will actually process all 1m characters even though 1.5 is enough.

Let make it simpler and just take character size.

Also there's typo: War_ing
