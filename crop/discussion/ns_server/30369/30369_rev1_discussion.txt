DESCRIPTION

MB-100 fix for one more cluster_compat_mode related crash

- ns_config_ets_dup is still racy (needs to be addressed
  separately)
- cluster_compat_version key is also racy at the initial server
  start
- cluster_compat_version value is defaulted to 'undefined'
  which crashes ++ operator if called too early
