DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: removed result table from UI

I don't think that we relly need 'result table' because
it's just a duplication of data. Goal of this patch is to bring result screen to united view.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

Looks good, I agree this is better than the table.

Cancel -I still think we need a confirm on this, for same reasons as before - it would be extremely frustrating for a user if a long running collection was accidentally cancelled if they mis-clicked. Unlike rebalance, this is a "destructive" operation and hence we should treat it like so.
