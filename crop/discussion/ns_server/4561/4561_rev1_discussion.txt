Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I get 9 copies of my one test key on my ten node cluster. I'm not sure exactly what's going on, but it's possible that the top keys are getting broadcast to the keepers on all the nodes, so instead of aggregating just local keys you're aggregating all of them from all the nodes.

Also see inline comment.

Line:154, deps/menelaus/src/hot_keys_keeper.erl -> I think you may be able to do this a lot more cleanly using lists:ukeysort; I don't think you need the proplists module at all.

Line:154, deps/menelaus/src/hot_keys_keeper.erl -> It's now:
merge_list_proplists(PL1, PL2) ->
    RL1 = case PL1 of undefined -> []; _ -> PL1 end,
    RL2 = case PL2 of undefined -> []; _ -> PL2 end,
    Sorted = lists:ukeysort(1,lists:append(RL1,RL2)),
    [{K, lists:append(V, proplists:get_value(K, RL2, []))}
     || {K, V} <- Sorted].

better way to handle the last remaining proplists usage?

Line:154, deps/menelaus/src/hot_keys_keeper.erl -> Check out misc:ukeymergewith - it should be much faster (N vs N^2).

Line:154, deps/menelaus/src/hot_keys_keeper.erl -> Much nicer;


merge_list_proplists(PL1, PL2) ->
    RL1 = case PL1 of undefined -> []; _ -> PL1 end,
    RL2 = case PL2 of undefined -> []; _ -> PL2 end,
    misc:ukeymergewith(fun ({K, V1}, {_, V2}) -> {K, lists:append(V1,V2)} end, 1, RL1, RL2).
