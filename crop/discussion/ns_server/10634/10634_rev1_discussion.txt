DESCRIPTION

handle localhost when building replicator db link

When node's name is still xxx@xxx.xxx we cannot use hostname part
of node name to advertise it's address. Our usual approach is to use
address of the socket that's serving this request. So that
multi-interface host will advertise 'right' address depending on what
interface is reached.

This fixes XHR error when trying to create replication via UI.
