Patch Set 7: (3 inline comments)

in general looks ok, but because this is change of API you need to notify doc folks

Line:727, src/menelaus_web.erl -> pivotal mentions we want GBs and you need some rounding here maybe.

Line:154, src/cb_config_couch_sync.erl -> this is not needed anymore

Line:65, src/ns_config_default.erl -> I think size default should be nil as it's a special purpose setting
