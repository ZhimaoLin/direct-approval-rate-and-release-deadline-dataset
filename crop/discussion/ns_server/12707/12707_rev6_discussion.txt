Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Sorry the last commit was based off an old branch, should have checked better

Obviously this will break the UI for configuring autocompaction, I will update the UI commit and this commit shouldnt go in without it, I just wanted to get this part reviewed

Patch Set 6:

looks good, but fails dialyzer. And my understanding is that it needs to be either percentage or garbage size, not both at same time.
