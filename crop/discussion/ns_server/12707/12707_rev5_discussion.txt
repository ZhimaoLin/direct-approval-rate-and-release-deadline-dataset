DESCRIPTION

Add fragmentation file size limit to auto compaction

Added db_fragmentation_size and view_fragmentation size fields to the
auto compaction deamon, both values expect a value in bytes, when
the file size of the fragmentation within the database (or view) is above
this value, auto compaction will be triggered

Line:42, etc/capi.ini.in -> what's the point of having such defaults? And they will get overwritten by couch config sync code. right?

Also the names I think are confusing

Line:221, src/couchbase_compaction_daemon.erl -> what's the point of having this? There's seemingly no need to parameterize vbuckets_need_compaction code.

Line:442, src/couchbase_compaction_daemon.erl -> wtf is going on here? ActualFrag from what I can see in code is fragmentation in percent. MinFrag is bytes. WTF this formula does?

Line:67, src/ns_config_default.erl -> this is not what we want. Check pivotal ticket. It's either or. Not both.
