DESCRIPTION

Bug 1799: Reduce borkage on returning failed node.

We delete *all* table copies from any node we wish to remove, and in
the case where the backup portion of the rename fails, we just don't
try to rename rather than crashing: this should only ever happen when
the node has already been part of a cluster.

Patch Set 1: Verified

Fixes that particular bug. But there are still some issues with failing over multiple nodes and returning them back.
