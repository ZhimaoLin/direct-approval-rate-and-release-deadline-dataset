DESCRIPTION

avoid max_restart_intensity_reached by ddoc replication issues

Due to some races (at least between ep-engine setting vbucket state
and mccouch create vbucket db) ddoc replication might fail
sometimes. This leads to immediate restart of this server by
supervisor and it may fail again and again. Which may lead to
max_restart_intensity_reached and restart of entire per-bucket
supervisor. This was observed in practice.

It's possible to fix above mentioned race (and other yet unknown races
too), but because we'll change local ddocs replication implementation
quite soon it makes more sense to implement simple workaround.

This workaround is delaying process termination when death reason is
not normal or shutdown.
