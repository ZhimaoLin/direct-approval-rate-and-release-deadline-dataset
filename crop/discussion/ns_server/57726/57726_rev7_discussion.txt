Patch Set 7:

(1 comment)

Line:29, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poor_mans_alerts.js -> Seems like your intent here is if the alert modal is already popped, dismiss it and put a fresh alert modal up.

I'm not sure if this is working as I notice the following in the UI if I change the alerts to get sent every 10 seconds. 
1) screen flickers
2) I have to click "OK" twice to get back to the UI.

Basically it looks like the dismiss isn't firing. 

Will merge this but please look into it.
