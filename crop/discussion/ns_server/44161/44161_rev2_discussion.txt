Patch Set 2:

I'm not sure I like idea of reading config to decide list of supervisor childs.

Also I don't think we need to stop _everything_. We only really need to stop all outgoing xdcrs (or alternatively we can simply delete rdocs as part of upgrade) and start proxying xdcr requests to goxdcr.
