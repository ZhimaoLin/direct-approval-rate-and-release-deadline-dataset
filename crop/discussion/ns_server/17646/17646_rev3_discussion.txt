Only 1 small comment, can be addressed in a separate change if you want.
Otherwise looks good :)

Line:127, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Don't know if this was unintentionally left or not.

If intentional, it seems like it could log more useful information, such as the document's ID for example.

Line:127, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> It is intentional, We need to dump more logs to make our life easier. :-) Today not much info about XDCR can be derived from log files when something wrong happens. 

Today we still use couch_db logs in XDCR and  probably it is better to change to ns_server logs after refactoring. 

Need another commit to polish all logs.  Will add XDOC id in that commit.
