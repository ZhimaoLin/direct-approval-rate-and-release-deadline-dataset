DESCRIPTION

MB-14841: don't setValue for rawStatsCell in case response 4xx

This bug occurs in case of onLoopData called with mark404 (which
is actually not only 404 but any 4xx). onLoopData is protected
from next call in case of async was canceled (this code doing
it !dataCallback.continuing(value)) but this issue is caused
by the same protective logic. In case async was not canceled
and _uistats returned with 4xx, dataCallback.continuing will
set empty object for rawStatsCell because mark404 is empty
object.
