Line:9, cmake_modules/string_replace.py -> Nit: These are over 80 columns wide - please wrap them.

Nicely done. Works as it is, but could be simplified - see file comment on string-replace.cmake.

Line:1, cmake_modules/string-replace.cmake -> This file really isn't necessary - you could directly call python from ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET(). Alternately you could implement the string search/replace behaviour here entirely in CMake to avoid the python dependency.

Patch Set 1:

I tried to put EXECUTE_PROCESS directly to ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET

got : "/bin/sh: EXECUTE_PROCESS: command not found"

Chris, if you know how to do it correctly, can you please modify my commit accordingly, I'm not exactly very proficient with cmake language.
