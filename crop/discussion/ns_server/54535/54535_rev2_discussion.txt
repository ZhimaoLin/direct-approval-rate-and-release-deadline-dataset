Patch Set 2:

Yet another reminder how cmake is big piece of crap.

It actually supposed to work: https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=13582 and http://www.cmake.org/Khloe Norman?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=ad502502

And it does work if you move configure_file directives to the top level cmakelists.txt

Regarding the patch itself, instead of custom python script you could just use cmake -D VAR=value -P script.cmake where script.cmake would do the configure_file.

Patch Set 2:

Another minor comment. To avoid redundant regeneration you could use add_custom_command with output and depends parameters.

Frankly I don't see any difference between calling another cmake script or python script. Both ways are ugly enough. But I'm fine with whatever will get this annoying issue closed as soon as possible.

Same feelings for redundant files regeneration :)
I'll try to address these comments today.

Patch Set 2:

There's not much difference between calling a python script and calling a CMake script... but in this case, you're doing both, which seems excessive.

If you want to call the python script directly from ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET() in CMakeLists.txt, just use COMMAND python [args...] rather than COMMAND "${CMAKE_COMMAND}" [args..]. ${CMAKE_COMMAND} is just a variable which expands to the full path to the CMake executable itself.

But, Aliaksey's right - it probably should be done with ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND() so that it doesn't regenerate all the time. Like I said in email originally, this is unfortunately trickier to get right than it should be. CMake is about 85% a very good product, but it has some rough edges, and they're *really* rough.
