DESCRIPTION

MB-18639 Fix service quota validation in mixed clusters.

Specifically, previsouly we'd try to get current value for a service
quota even before the cluster is upgraded to the compat mode that
supports the service. And that would fail because the default value
are not added before the cluster is upgraded.
