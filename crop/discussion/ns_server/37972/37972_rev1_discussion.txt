DESCRIPTION

Handle more http versions in access.log formatter.

If version is omitted in the request it is assumed to be 0.9 which
would crash the formatter. So I added a case for this. I also added a
default case, in case someone by mistake or on purpose sends other
version to us. We used to be permissive about such requests, this
allows us to continue handling them.
