DESCRIPTION

use past vbucket maps to optimize vbucket movements

New code picks closest of past but matching vbucket maps and newly
generated vbucket map.

Unit tests particularly ensure that failover/add-back case is handled
with minimal movements. Also simultaneous removal of N nodes and
addition of N other nodes performs minimal movements as well (transfer
of vbuckets between this nodes).

Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

See inline.

Some additional notes:

1. There're several places where you're using "_ ->" to match just true of just false in case statements. Sometimes it looks a bit confusing.

2. As far as I understand, comment in the beginning of mb_map file (about purity of the code) is not valid any more. That's because mb_map:generate_map now can choose random map.

Line:629, src/ns_bucket.erl -> We can lose here recent maps just because they compare greater to those that are currently in the history. Not sure if this is bad. But is this intended?
