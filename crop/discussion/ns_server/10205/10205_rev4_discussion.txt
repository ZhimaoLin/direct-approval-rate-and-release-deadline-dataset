Patch Set 4:

Apologize for the large number of changes. I needed these to make it work. From now on, I'll make sure that small and manageable changes are posted for ease of reviewing.

Also, because of more work needed in CAPI, XDC replication does not entirely work. I've a local patch to circumvent the CAPI problem, using which I've verified that XDC replication is indeed working.

Aliaksey: this patch should be good enough for you to test your UI changes.

Patch Set 4: Verified

Verified as follows:

curl -X PUT http://10.1.6.190:5984/_replicator/r2 -d '{"source":"default", "target":"http://10.1.6.191:8091/pools/default/buckets/default", "type":"xdc"}'

1024 items in 10.1.6.190 were correctly replicated to 10.1.6.191.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Left some comments inline.
Also the commit message is extremely vague.
Can you specify which fixes were done?
If there are several they should go as separate commits as well.

Line:149, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> This will fail if Error is not a string or binary. Use ~p instead

Line:231, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> I strongly discourage silently ignoring unexpected messages. This can hide bugs and unexpected behaviour.
I rather let it crash or at the very least log the message received and tell it was unexpected.

Patch Set 4:

Agree with Filipe. But still wanted to merge, because it new area that doesn't affect existing features.

But was unable to verify lack of influence on existing features. It fails to start on clean config. See http://review.couchbase.org/10239 for fix.

Patch Set 4:

Filipe: I had put this up in order to unblock Aliaksey with his UI testing. Will refactor the change set into smaller patches and post again. I'll also address your comments then.

Aliaksey: Let me know if it works after your own changes in http://review.couchbase.org/10239.

Patch Set 4:

Another thing I forgot to mention:

Couch replicator makes callbacks into couch replication manager when a replication task is started, it completes or if there's an error. What this means is that if the async_replicate() and cancel_replication() APIs are used with the xdc replication manager, the callbacks will cause a runtime error.

We don't have this problem with design doc replication inside CAPI because the couch replication manager is still running. It just continues to receive callbacks for non-existing replication tasks.

Right now, for the purposes of testing, I'm running couch replicator with the callback code commented out. But we need to find a good software engineering solution to remove the tight coupling between couch replicator and couch replication manager.

Any ideas?

Filipe: I've added a detailed commit message but want to pass up on refactoring the change set into smaller patches. In the future, I'll make sure that smaller patches are posted. Let me know if you still have any questions. Apologize for the inconvenience this time!
