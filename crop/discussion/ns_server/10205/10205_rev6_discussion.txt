DESCRIPTION

XDC Replication Fixes From Integration Testing

Changes to xdc_rep_manager.erl:
-------------------------------
1. Logging Improvements: Wherever possible, the logging of a xdc
   operation specifies the replication doc id. This will make it
   simpler for users or support to search for all messages pertaining
   to a given doc id.
2. Error Reporting: Before triggering an xdc replication, we now do
   basic sanity checks such as verifying that the source and
   destination buckets do exist. If either or both don't exist, we
   throw an appropriate error message.
3. Moved the handling for deleted xdc rep documents from method
   process_xdc_update() to process_update(). Since deleted
   docs only have metadata we will not be able to query the value of
   the "type" attribute and thus will never end up in
   process_xdc_update().
4. Miscellaneous fixes:
   a. Pertaining to type related errors that werent't detected by the
      dialyzer during compilation.
   b. Pertaining to the semantics of some of the ETS methods such as
      ets:match() and ets:element_lookup(). I had made some wrong
      assumptions about these during development.

Changes to xdc_rep_utils.erl:
-----------------------------
1. Error handling in remote_vbucketmap_nodelist() method to handle
   the case where the specified remote BucketURI does not exist.
2. Had got the math wrong in computing the active vbuckets in the
   my_active_vbuckets() method.

Patch Set 6:

Added code to create the couch_rep_id_to_rep_state ets table in xdc_replication_manager. The table is looked up indirectly by couch replicator by means of a callback in couch replication manager.
