DESCRIPTION

XDC Replication Fixes From Integration Testing

Changes to xdc_rep_manager.erl:
-------------------------------
1. Logging Improvements: Wherever possible, the logging of a xdc
   operation specifies the replication doc id. This will make it
   simpler for users or support to search for all messages pertaining
   to a given doc id.
2. Error Reporting: Before triggering an xdc replication, we now do
   basic sanity checks such as verifying that the source and
   destination buckets do exist. If either or both don't exist, we
   throw an appropriate error message.
3. Moved the handling for deleted xdc rep documents from method
   process_xdc_update() to process_update(). Since deleted
   docs only have metadata we will not be able to query the value of
   the "type" attribute and thus will never end up in
   process_xdc_update().
4. Miscellaneous fixes:
   a. Pertaining to type related errors that werent't detected by the
      dialyzer during compilation.
   b. Pertaining to the semantics of some of the ETS methods such as
      ets:match() and ets:element_lookup(). I had made some wrong
      assumptions about these during development.

Changes to xdc_rep_utils.erl:
-----------------------------
1. Error handling in remote_vbucketmap_nodelist() method to handle
   the case where the specified remote BucketURI does not exist.
2. Had got the math wrong in computing the active vbuckets in the
   my_active_vbuckets() method.

Are these related to the starting of the xdc_rep_manager by ns_config_sup? If you just want to test your UI changes, I've a cluster running code that works.

Patch Set 5:

I just realized that we would need both the couch and the xdc replication managers to be running. The former will be required for _intra_ cluster replication of design docs and xdc replication docs.

This means that couch replication manager needs to ignore xdc and _info_ docs. Will make this change and post to gerrit over the weekend.

For the current change set, the changes to capi.ini.in file will have to be reverted back. Will update this, too, over the weekend.

Aliaksey: Would your config sync changes be still required or would they need to be reverted back as well?
