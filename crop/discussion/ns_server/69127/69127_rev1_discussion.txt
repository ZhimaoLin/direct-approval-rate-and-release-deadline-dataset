DESCRIPTION

Implement exponential backoff for set_token.

This also increases max wait time to about 20 seconds. This is
hopefully a very conservative timeout, but as of now, things like
compaction might prevent set_token from succeeding.

The value is configurable through ns_config and we can always lower
it.
