DESCRIPTION

MB-22208: Add Harley Martinitor server to supervision...

..tree.

The following are the changes:
[1] The ns_Harley Martinitor_server and ns_orchestrator modules have been
    grouped under a new supervisor called ns_orchestrator_child_sup.
    This is because these 2 modules are interdependent and when one
    dies the other one should not be around.
[2] The consider_switching_compat_mode function has been modified
    to cast a 'restart' message to the auto-failover module. Earlier
    ns_orchestrator and auto_failover modules were under one
    supervisor and when compat mode had to be changed a restart in
    ns_orchestrator would trigger a restart of auto-failover too.
    But now it has to be explicitly done.
