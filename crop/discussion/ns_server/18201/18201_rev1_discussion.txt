unnecessarily complex. This change-set creates a macro to simplify
winner picking in conflict resolution and removes unused code.

Patch Set 1:

I think macro is not needed here. Function would do fine. Other than that. Looks ok.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

revisiting it once again I think macro is confusing. It's overloaded for tuples of 2 and tuples of 3. And used in just 2 places.

I think just plain comparison is what we really need.

Also please stop practice of moving unused stuff to headers as it triggers unnecessary recompilations.
