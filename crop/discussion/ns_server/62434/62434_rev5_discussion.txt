Patch Set 5:

I haven't looked at the code yet as it doesn't look right to me in the UI.

When I log into a CE build I see:
* as Full Admin I do not see the Certificates tab
* as Read-Only Admin I see the Security tab but when I click on it nothing happens.

I guess this is the same issue (that the Certificates tab isn't showing.) I'll take a look at the code when you respond on this.
