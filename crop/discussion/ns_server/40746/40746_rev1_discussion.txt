DESCRIPTION

Add license to erlwsh

In order to be able to package Couchbase properly for Debian, all
components must have proper license information. The upstream erlwsh
added the Apache License.

In order to make things as easy as possible in regards to licensing,
it makes sense to update to the latest upstream version. This commit
does exactly that. The only difference between the upstream version
and our's after this commit is merged will be a single line change in
`src/erlwsh_web` where we use a different path.

Patch Set 1:

Alk, there's an outside contributor that would like to package Couchbase properly for Debian. He goes through all the components and found that erlwsh doesn't have a proper license. He askes the upstream author to add one, which he did.

I also submitted one change we had upstream. This commit basically updates erlwsh to the most recent upstream version.

It would be cool if this could be merged, so that it's easier/possible to package for Debian.
