Patch Set 1:

I don't really expect this to get merged as-is. This is basically the same set of changes that Steve and Till hacked together some weeks ago, just updated and rebased. We need to get something like this in, and the longer we wait the harder it gets to keep even this much up-to-date. So to start the discussion rolling, I'm proposing this in its current form. Ideally I would like to have someone from the ns_server team take this over and move it completion, as I really don't understand any of the code changes here and can't respond to review comments.

Johan Savage - this can get merged to master until we branch for Spock - which is likely some time away. I don't want to branch just for the purposes of checking it in early. You guys could use a fork of ns_server for that. You ok waiting (for several months)?

Of course I meant "can't get merged to master"

Patch Set 1:

I haven't looked at any of the changes -- but the changes to the UI and to the server should be split apart. The changes to cluster_run / cluster_connect should also be in a separate patch. There might be further splitting that we'll ask you to do, but we should start with these.

Patch Set 1:

Dave - I actually did create a fork of ns_server a few months ago which is where I've been keeping this code. I have a job automatically merging from ns_server master, but handling the merge conflicts is getting increasingly challenging which is why I hoped to get it merged up.

As for splitting up the proposal into separate parts - I certainly can't do that, as I really don't understand any of the code or components in this proposal. I don't think anyone on the Analytics team does.

Perhaps the best thing to do would be to raise a ticket for spock.next against ns_server saying that this integration will need to be done. However it would really be great for us if the work could be done much earlier, perhaps in a conditionally-compiled way so that it wouldn't affect Spock builds. We need to get to more serious work on integration with Server and it would make sense for us to do so against the "real" ns_server code.

Abandoned

Dropping this review in favor of https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-23699 . I've added all people here to the Watchers list for that ticket. Conversation to continue over there.
