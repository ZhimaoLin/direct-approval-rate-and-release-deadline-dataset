DESCRIPTION

MB-23457 automatically create entries for default bucket

...in isasl.pw and memcached.rbac. this is needed because
legacy users do not support SCRAM-SHA (even if ns_server
will provide SCRAM-SHA hashes for such user to memcached), but
we want clients to be able to connect to default bucket via
SCRAM-SHA without creating a user

make sure that those entries are not created if user "default"
exists
