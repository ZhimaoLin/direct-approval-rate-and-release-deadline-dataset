DESCRIPTION

MB-23060 tuning of data related roles

Per Trond's request:

Data Reader
   Remove Simple Stat (users should get the Data Monitor role if they need it)
Data Reader Writer
   (One may consider renaming this to Data Writer, as the UI allows you to
   assign Data Reader in addition to Data Reader Writer.... )
   Remove Simple Stat
   Remove MetaWrite - this command is potential dangerous and should not
   be available to everyone
Dcp Reader
   Remove Simple Stat
   Add Read and Meta Read
Data backup:
   Remove Simple Stat
   should include Data Reader and Data Writer and allow for system xattr
   Should probably also include DCP reader (and non-existing Dcp Writer
   which includes the DCP Producer privilege).

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Looks correct to me (I tried to create one role at the time and looked at the generated output)
