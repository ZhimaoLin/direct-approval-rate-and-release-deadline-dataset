DESCRIPTION

MB-21147: Support conflict_resolution_type bucket parameter.

[1] Added a new bucket parameter called conflict_resolution_type to
    the REST APIs. By default this parameter will set to 'seqno'.

[2] The other value that this parameter would accept is 'lww'. This
    value will only be accepted if the cluster is running enterprise
    edition or else the bucket creation API would fail.

[3] Once set the conflict_resolution_type bucket parameter cannot
    be altered and the bucket update API would fail if an attempt
    is made.
