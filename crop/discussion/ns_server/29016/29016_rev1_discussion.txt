DESCRIPTION

MB-4345 ns_isasl_config_sync handles admin_{user,pass} updates.

We will need to be able to change admin_user and admin_pass in the
next commit. So we need ns_config_isasl_sync to be able to react on
such change.

Note that by itself this commit is not completely functional:
ns_config_isasl_sync will be able to store new user/password in
isasl.pw file, but won't be able to notify memcached about this change
because new admin credentials will be used for this.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

After some thinking I decided to make another iteration on this because I'm completely satisfied the way ns_ports_setup and ns_isasl_config_sync interact with each other.
