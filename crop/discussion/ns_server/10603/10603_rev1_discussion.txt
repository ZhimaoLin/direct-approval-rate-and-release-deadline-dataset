Line:150, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Type here can only be interactive_edit, right? If so, let's change the function signature to reflect that.

Line:29, src/capi_replication.erl -> This version of get_missing_revs and the one below could perhaps share even more code than they do now. Need to think a bit more about it.

Line:80, src/capi_replication.erl -> We should never get here, right? I mean calling update_replicated_docs() with filepath as undefined.

Unless replication is between stock Couch and Couchbase Server, I guess.

Line:150, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Makes sense.

Line:29, src/capi_replication.erl -> These two functions are different in the way they get vbucket id. One of them has to do it for every document. The other does it for whole bunch of documents. I could have generalized it to some function which takes another function to get vbucket id for a doc. But I wanted to avoid excessive function calls (though inlining could be a help here).

Line:80, src/capi_replication.erl -> Yes, right now this code path is not used. But let's keep it for the completeness of API implementation.
