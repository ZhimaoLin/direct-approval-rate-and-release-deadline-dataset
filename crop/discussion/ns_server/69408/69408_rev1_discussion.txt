Patch Set 1:

This allows anybody on the machine to perform denial of service attack by regenerating the token in a loop.

Also, it's hard, but not entirely impossible to spoof the ip address.

Patch Set 1:

I'd suggest just generating the token periodically in a well-known place (or you can have an API to return the path) and dropping ensure_local entirely.

"Also, it's hard, but not entirely impossible to spoof the ip address" - how can one do it?

Patch Set 1:

You can put any address you want into your ip packet. Then of course, the response will be sent to the ip address you're spoofing. Then you have at least two options. If there's no switch between you and the machine you're attacking, you actually can see all the traffic, so you can receive the response and continue crafting tcp packets based on it. Another option, is to guess the initial sequence number that the server uses (it's not necessarily easy, at least linux kernel implements https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6528.txt). But if you guessed the sequence number, you can craft a tcp packet that the server will accept. You won't get the response, but the server will process it.

Patch Set 1:

How can you receive a response on another machine if the response is sent to loopback ip?

Patch Set 1:

You can't, but you don't always need to. If you have an api "reset password to this value", you don't care about the response.
