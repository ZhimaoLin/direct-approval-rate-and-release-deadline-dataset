DESCRIPTION

MB-5000 Eject master as late as possible.

Since ns_orchestrator is responsible for setting rebalance_status
after rebalance is completed (due to any reason), it's not completely
correct to eject master in ns_rebalancer. Because in this case these
final config changes can be left unreplicated. To prevent this master
is ejected now only after all the other final work is done by
ns_orchestrator.
