Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

This code is fine, technically, but I feel our level of "indirection" continues to climb to new heights.

I'm +2'ing this, but would like us to look for a better way to handle AJAX/Cell updating going forward--maybe jQuery 1.5's deferred object (promises) system would be simpler.
