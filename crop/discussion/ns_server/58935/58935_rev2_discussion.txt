DESCRIPTION

cbcollect_info: Gather couchstore local documents

Include the Couchstore local documents for all vBuckets in
cbcollect_info. These are helpful in debugging issues with CAS, and
with the new draft_counter for LWW XDCR.

Note that each vBucket has just one local document, of
the form:

    {"state": "active",
     "checkpoint_id": "0",
     "max_deleted_seqno": "0",
     "failover_table": [{"id":96619749169680,"seq":0}],
     "snap_start": "0",
     "snap_end": "0",
     "max_cas": "0",
     "drift_counter": "-140737488355328"}

Therefore I don't believe there's any space concern with adding these.
