See inline.

Line:738, src/remote_clusters_info.erl -> Context was meant to contain some kind of pointer to the location where error happens. Which is needed to distinguish between the errors of the same kind that just happen to occur at different places. So I think that you don't need it in this particular case. Simply put your error message in the return value of this function.

Line:760, src/remote_clusters_info.erl -> I don't think this log message is needed.

Line:841, src/remote_clusters_info.erl -> See my comment above.
