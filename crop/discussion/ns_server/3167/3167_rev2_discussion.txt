DESCRIPTION

collect node's /proc/meminfo if it's available

Once per minute we'll fetch /proc/meminfo if it's available and send
it to ns_doctor. That information is periodically logged and is
available in /diag. /proc/meminfo contains useful high-level overview
of memory situation on the system.

This also makes ns_heart:expensive_checks/0 exported, so that it's
accessible from erlang shell.
