DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: support simple way to adjust some timeouts at runtime

Particularly timeouts affecting our communication with memcached.

This also makes few timeouts larger. Particularly memcached protocol
level timeouts (timeouts speaking to usually local memcached) are
increased.

As well as ns_memcached "outer" level (i.e. including potential queing
delay) timeouts of heavy operations.

Timeouts can be adjusted by settings node's config. Efficently reading
those timeout values is achieved by maintaining public named ets table
with all key-value pairs.

Example key is {node, node(), {timeout, ebucketmigrtor_connect}}.
