Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

sorry for delay.

Mod that's passed around and which is killed in many places in next commit makes little sense to me.

Patch Set 3:

Originally I had two commits to make it clearer where things come from.

Should I update that commit, or would it also be OK to just squash this commit with the next one?

Patch Set 3:

there were more commits. And tiny preparatory commits made full sense. Then you created two commits where separation didn't make any sense and I'm still seeing two commits which separate is not helpful IMO.

So if you're fine with melding them together I'm ok with that too

Patch Set 3:

One of the commits where the separation didn't make sense was abandoned.

I'll merge the two that are left though, this sounds easier for me.
