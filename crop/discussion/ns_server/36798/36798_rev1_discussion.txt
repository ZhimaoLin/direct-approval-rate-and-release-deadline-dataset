DESCRIPTION

MB-11063 Explicitly specify loopback address when querying names.

In the referred ticket erl_epmd failed to connect to epmd on the
address that it got from inet:gethostname +
inet:gethostbyname. Alleged error was ehostunreach. I'm not sure why
and how it exactly happened, but hopefully just going to 127.0.0.1
directly will avoid the problem.
