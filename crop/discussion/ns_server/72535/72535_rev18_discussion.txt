Fixed analytics. Left the wizard step 4 in place as it will be fixed in next updates.

Line:35, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_analytics/mn_analytics_list.html -> Fixed this indent so Pavel doesn't yell at me.

Line:49, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_analytics/mn_analytics_list.html -> added tooltip-append-to-body="true" to fix squashing of tooltip body
