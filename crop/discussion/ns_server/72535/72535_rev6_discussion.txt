Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

One more important thing.
<a
            href=""
            class="info-popup"
            uib-tooltip="The maximum number of committed rollback points.">
            <span class="icon fa-info-circle orange-3"></span>
          </a>

should look like

<span class="icon fa-info-circle orange-3" uib-tooltip="The maximum number of committed rollback points."></span>

we don't need tag <a> completely
