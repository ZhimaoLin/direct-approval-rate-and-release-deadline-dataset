There are some minor things that still need to be addressed and we need to look into the tool tips on the statistics page.

Line:41, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/notifications/mn_settings_notifications.html -> Need to ensure the tool tip and text are on the same line.

Line:285, priv/public/ui/index.html -> Pavel, can you let me know what this is used for? Should it be removed?

Line:23, priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/step4/mn_wizard_step4.html -> Need to ensure the tooltip and text are on the same line.
