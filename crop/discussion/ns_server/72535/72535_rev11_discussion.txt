Added the tooltips for the statistics page based on the email from Rob. One other thing we need to figure out is if the ldap page is still in use. If so we missed a tooltip on that page.

Line:40, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/notifications/mn_settings_notifications.html -> Need to make sure tool tip and text are on the same line

Line:285, priv/public/ui/index.html -> Is this still needed or can it be removed?

Line:24, priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/step4/mn_wizard_step4.html -> Need to make sure tool tip and text are on the same line

Line:21, priv/public/ui/libs/angular-uib-tooltip.js -> We shouldn't change any file in this folder ever.  The correct place is app_config.js

$uibTooltipProvider.options({
      appendToBody: true,
      placement: "auto right"
    });

Line:29, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_analytics/mn_analytics_list.html -> class="relative"

Line:285, priv/public/ui/index.html -> We do NOT need this anymore. 'tooltip-arrow' was the old version of the "arrow". 'tooltip-inner' is the common wrapper.

Line:40, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/notifications/mn_settings_notifications.html -> I can add a hack here that I'll have to remove tomorrow. Or we let a few things look crappy for a few hours before the next push. You know my preference.

Line:21, priv/public/ui/libs/angular-uib-tooltip.js -> OK. Will do.

BTW, we will also need (maybe) a custom trigger "onScroll" to hide tooltips in modal dialogs when the user scrolls (currently the tooltip stays fixed in one spot as dialog moves.
