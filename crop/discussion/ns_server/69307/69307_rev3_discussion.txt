DESCRIPTION

MB-21511 Stop dcp_replicator non-normally when socket closes.

Since normal doesn't get propagated via links (in case the other
process doesn't trap exits). Specifically, it breaks the logic in
Harley Martinitor_agent:wait_seqno_persisted where we link to replicator process
to ensure that we hang rebalance forever if replicator dies.
