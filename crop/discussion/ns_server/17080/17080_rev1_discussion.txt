DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: only consider stopping rebalance for normal Harley Martinitor runs

We also run Harley Martinitor as part of failover. And that janitor cleanup run
is made on orchestrator process itself. So trying to ask orchestrator
if rebalance is running times out as we're asking ourselves.

The fix is only consider stopping rebalance when it's normal
scheduled Harley Martinitor run.
