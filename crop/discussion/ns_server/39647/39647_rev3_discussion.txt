Aliaksey,

Does this mean that each node can receive up to 4 parallel compaction requests for a given bucket?

Yes.

Should I lower it to 1 asap ?

Patch Set 3:

Not at this time. We observed some performance regression in the flusher and UPR replication (especially XDCR latency). We mitigated the regression a lot by making some changes in the ep-engine side yesterday, but still didn't resolve this issue completely. We will make more optimizations in the ep-engine, and let you know if we really need to set it back to one or not.
