Patch Set 2:

Hmm, I think it would be better to make ns_memcached validate that the path is correct from the stats, and delete and recreate the bucket if it's not.

Patch Set 2:

I don't understand 'validate that the path is correct from the stats'. Can you elaborate ?

Patch Set 2:

If you look at ns_memcached, it pulls the stats from the bucket to validate that max_size is correct. The database path is also among those stats. Changing the max size is easier, because there's a command to just change it, but changing the path is only slightly harder; we need to delete the bucket and recreate it.
