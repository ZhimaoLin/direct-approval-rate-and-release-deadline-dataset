DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Set session token during init of token server.

[1] Set the session token in memcached in the init callback of the
token server.

[2] Change the token server to start after memcached has been started.

[3] Rename the maybe_invalidate_token API to set_new_token API as a
new session token will be set when a control command fails with a
KEY_EEXISTS error message.

[4] The get_token API has been modified only to return the currently
cached token in the token server.

[5] Attempt to set a new token when a monitored process dies.

Line:29, src/ns_memcached_token.erl -> I think the old name was better.

Line:126, src/ns_memcached_token.erl -> I know that it's not directly related to this change, but there's no need to go to memcached every time. If RequestToken is different from Token, you know that it will probably be enough to return it to the caller. Only if Token and RequestToken are the same and the caller still got key_eexists, you need to get the token from memcached and generate a new one.

Line:127, src/ns_memcached_token.erl -> Also I don't really understand the value of this check. And, obviously, it's subject to races, since the memcached token could have been changed between the moment when the caller got an error and this point.

Line:306, src/ns_memcached_token.erl -> I think there's no point in handling this error. If it fails, it fails. Let the token manager restart.
