DESCRIPTION

MB-11401: Set session token during init of token server.

[1] Set the session token in memcached in the init callback of the
token server.

[2] Change the token server to start after memcached has been started.

[3] Rename the maybe_invalidate_token API to set_new_token API as a
new session token will be set when a control command fails with a
KEY_EEXISTS error message.

[4] The get_token API has been modified only to return the currently
cached token in the token server.

[5] Attempt to set a new token when a monitored process dies.
