DESCRIPTION

wait for old bucket's shutdowns on nodes rebalanced in. MB-5118

Prior to actually starting rebalance and prior to deleting database
files we're now waiting for all pending bucket shutdowns to
complete. So that we don't try to reuse old bucket and if we have
problems shutting down some old buckets, we'll report it correctly
rather than wait_for_memcached failed

Line:158, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> It probably makes sense to log it to user visible log.
