Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Hi Mike,

I looked at http://review.couchbase.org/27406 and I don't see couple of pieces of functionality there that should be implemented by ep_engine prior to removing couch notifier

1. It needs to delete .couch file on vbucket delete
2. It needs to delete .couch file for the old version of vbucket after the compaction is successfully done

Currently this logic is implemented via couch notification (see mc_connection.erl) and will stop working if the notifications will never come.

Artem,

I don't plan on merging the change you referenced in your comments. Please see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/40195/ which is the change that should be merged together with this one.
