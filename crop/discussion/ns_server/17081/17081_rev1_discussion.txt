DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: fixed getting of not ready to replicate from vbuckets

Implementation of get_open_checkpoint_ids/2 was returning dict with
stat names as keys instead of vbucket numbers. That was causing us to
never detect any vbuckets as not ready to replicate from.

I decided to optimize things a bit further by asking specifically for
vbuckets with open checkpoint 0 and by trying to minimize produced
garbage that was typical for previous implementation that was building
dict.
