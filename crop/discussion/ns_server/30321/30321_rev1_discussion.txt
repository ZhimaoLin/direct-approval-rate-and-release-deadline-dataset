DESCRIPTION

MB-9552: reduce message passing in XMem

Today in XMem XDCR, the vb replicator rep_worker process need to
send all docs to replicate to xmem_server process first, and the
xmem_server process will pass all these docs to its child xmem_worker
process. Consequently there are two big message passing among Erlang
processes which may cause some inefficiency.

This commit will make rep_worker process send all docs to replicate
directly to xmem_worker process and flush to remote. Therefore it
removes the first message passing above and initial XDCR test on
toybuild shows more than 15% throughput improvement.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

My understanding is that main benefit of this commit is in allowing multiple xmem workers to be used. Previously due to synchronous calls from xmem srv down to worker it was impossible. With this commit xmem srv is not going to block anywhere in "data path".

Junyi, I don't have bandwidth to +v this. But code-wise it looks like improvement.

And please consider testing >1 xmem worker count, I expect throughput improvement.
