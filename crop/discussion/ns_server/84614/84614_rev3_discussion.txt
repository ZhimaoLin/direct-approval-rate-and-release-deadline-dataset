Line:24, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> we usually keep callbacks in separate -export statement. Because they are not suppose to be called by the consumer of the module.

Line:26, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> formatting - tab.

Line:43, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> This statement makes code completely unreadable. Please remove it and prepend module name to functions where it is necessary.

Line:16, src/settings_manager_helper.erl -> I suggest to rename it to json_settings_manager

Line:48, src/settings_manager_helper.erl -> formatting - tabs
