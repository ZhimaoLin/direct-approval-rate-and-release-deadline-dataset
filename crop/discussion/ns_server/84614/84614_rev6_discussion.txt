More or less fine now, see inline some naming suggestions.

Line:25, src/json_settings_manager.erl -> you don't need to export this one

Line:46, src/json_settings_manager.erl -> rename to get_from_config. plus I would suggest to make Module first parameter here and everywhere else, like you already have in populate_ets_table.

Line:51, src/json_settings_manager.erl -> rename to cfg_key, to be in line with other 2 callbacks

Line:81, src/json_settings_manager.erl -> please rename to get_from_json, do_ is kind of unnecessary here

Line:138, src/json_settings_manager.erl -> the correct self explanatory name will be required_compat_mode or something like it

And it should return compat mode itself like ?VERSION_40
