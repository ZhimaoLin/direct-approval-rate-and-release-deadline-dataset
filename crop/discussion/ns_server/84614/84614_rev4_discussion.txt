Line:77, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> init() doesn't need to be in a child module.

start_link() ->
   json_settings_manager:start_link(?MODULE).

The rest can be under the hood.

Line:77, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> I didn't understand what you mean.
index_settings_manager:start_link invokes the work_queue which won't take a function with an argument
i.e. work_queue:start_link(?MODULE, json_settings_manager:start_link/1)
won't work..

Are you saying that we don't need the work queue at all and start_link can directly call json_settings_manager:start_link/1 which would perform the init functionality?
