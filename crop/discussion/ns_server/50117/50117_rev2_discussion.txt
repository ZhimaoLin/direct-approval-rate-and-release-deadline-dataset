Patch Set 2:

(1 comment)

Line:24, couchbase-server.sh.in -> And I suppose I should have mentioned this in the last comment, but... BUILD_ENTERPRISE is always set to a non-empty string in the production builds. On Unix it's set to either TRUE or FALSE (on Windows for some reason it appears to be True or False). CMake treats those values as booleans as you would expect, but used the way you do here, it is always going to say it's EE.

I think to do what you want here, you're going to need to set a new variable in CMakeLists.txt based on the truth of BUILD_ENTERPRISE. I will point out that ns_server's CMakeLists.txt is already setting the variable NS_SERVER_VERSION which will be eg. 4.0.0-1879-rel-enterprise or 4.0.0-1879-rel-community in production builds (it'll do something wacky with "git describe" in a local build). So you could just use that as-is. Otherwise, set a new variable to either "" or "TRUE" at line 29 of CMakeLists.txt, and use that variable here in couchbase-server.sh.in.
