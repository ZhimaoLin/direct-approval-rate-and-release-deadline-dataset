DESCRIPTION

Don't throw exceptions in stats_archiver.

misc:pmap catches the exceptions and turns them into tuples, so
instead we return {ok, Result} on success and {error, Error} on error
in every case.

Note that this changes the API we're presenting to menelaus, so it
will require menelaus changes to work.
