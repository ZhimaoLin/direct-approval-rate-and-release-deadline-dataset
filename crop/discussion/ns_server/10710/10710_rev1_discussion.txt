DESCRIPTION

Add xdc_rep.hrl Header File For XDCR Manager

This file will contain any common definitions that need to be shared
across all XDC Replication related files. A subsequent changeset will
leverage this refactoring to simplify updating the replication info
doc when the replication state of a group of vbuckets must be updated
together.
