DESCRIPTION

MB-19484: MB-19485: improved validation behaviour in creation account form

- enable live validation only after first submit action
- do not clean form fields in case form is invalid because
  we don't know what exactly wrong with the fields
- added custom validators mn-minlength and mn-maxlength.
  We need them because angular ng-minlength and ng-maxlength
  remove ng-model value when ng-model doesn't pass validation.
- added custom mn-equal in order to enable live validation for
  password confirmation
