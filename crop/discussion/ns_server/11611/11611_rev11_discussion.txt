DESCRIPTION

Add spatial index cleanup

The spatial indexes are now automatically cleaned-up,
just as MapReduce ones.

The CAPI is used, else changes to GeoCouch itself
would have been needed.

Patch Set 11:

This is almost what I had in mind, except a lot more code.
I was thinking about only 1 or 2 line additions to couchbase_compaction_daemon.erl only. All the stuff added to capi_spatial.erl seems like a copy paste (with very small modifications) from geocouch's  couch_spatial.erl module (https://github.com/couchbase/geocouch/blob/master/src/geocouch/couch_spatial.erl#L123).

Why can't the compaction dameon just call couch_spatial:cleanup_index_files(VBucketDb) ?

@Filipe:

The problem is the group handling. When I pass in only the Database, I would need to change the code to be aware of the way Couchbase is handling groups.

Even if we fork CouchDB, I also want to support GeoCouch+CouchDB, hence I need to make sure it works with both.

The solution I use now seems to be a good tradeoff.

Filipe, doing it your way won't cleanup indexes of no more active vbuckets.

Ok, let the copy-paste rule everywhere.

Patch Set 11:

@Filipe: As Alk mentions, it does more than the other cleanup. I needs information that GeoCouch doesn't have, but ns_server has. It's not a plain copy&paste.

Though I get what you mean :)
