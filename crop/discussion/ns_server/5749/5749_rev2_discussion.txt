I think .log is not best name. And I plan to add much superior Cells debugging facility soon..

Patch Set 2:

.log() is based on the fact that all this does is call console.log() on changes Cell changes--seems like an accurate enough name.

I'm fine if you want to redo this work as well...completely up to you.
