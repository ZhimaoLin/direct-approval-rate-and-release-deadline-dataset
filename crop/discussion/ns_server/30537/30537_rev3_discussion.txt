please see inline

Line:1074, src/menelaus_web.erl -> all is good except this.

Name is imperfect and too general.

And most importantly I don't want this to be in pool details. It's already too big. Please have a separate url (hardcoded) that's fetched once with "UI look" settings.

Line:1710, src/menelaus_web.erl -> similarly, please move this to separate endpoint
