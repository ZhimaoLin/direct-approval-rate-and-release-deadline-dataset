DESCRIPTION

added HTML5 specified regexp for valid email addresses

See
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#e-mail-state

That's same regexp that html5 implementations are required to use for
type=email inputs validation.

Note: HTML5 explicitly and willfully violates some RFCs, but that
still seems reasonable.
