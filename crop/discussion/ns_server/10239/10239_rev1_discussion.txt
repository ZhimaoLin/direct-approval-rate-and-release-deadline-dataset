DESCRIPTION

do initial couch config sync before continuing initialization

We're restarting couch when setting some directories. On first start
we do that config synchronization. Without this commit it happens
asynchronously with respect to rest of server
initialization. Effectively making couch disappear at unpredictable
time during init.
