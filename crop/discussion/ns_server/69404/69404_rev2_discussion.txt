Line:352, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Why don't you filter out non-lww buckets right here? Also, be aware that the bucket might be deleted in between the moment when the stats are grabbed and the moment when you do the check. We shouldn't crash in this case.

Line:352, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I wanted to avoid duplicating the code to iterate over the list. Hence I took this approach. Is this ok?

Oh, I didn't think of the deletion case. Will check the return value.

Line:352, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> The number of buckets we support is very low, so practically, there's no reason to worry about iterating over a list one extra time, if it makes code shorter/clearer.
