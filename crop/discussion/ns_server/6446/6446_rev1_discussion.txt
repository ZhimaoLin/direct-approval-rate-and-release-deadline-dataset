DESCRIPTION

run poor man's alerts checks in separate child process

Under heavy load even disk_sup access may be very slow. So in order to
make menelaus_web_alerts_srv always responsive, I separated
potentially expensive alerts checking logic into it's own process.

This should fix numerous 500 errors from pool details caused by
timeouts accessing alerts server.
