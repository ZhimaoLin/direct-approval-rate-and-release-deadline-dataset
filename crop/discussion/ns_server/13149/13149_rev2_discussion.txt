Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Name is better now but error callbacks usually get (from jquery docs):

error (Function): A function to be called if the request fails. The function is passed three arguments: The XMLHttpRequest object, a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object, if one occurred. Possible values for the second argument (besides null) are "timeout", "error", "notmodified" and "parsererror". This is an Ajax Event.

And your wrapper breaks that.
