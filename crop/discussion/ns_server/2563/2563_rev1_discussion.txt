DESCRIPTION

Bug 2390/2382: track memory and evictions for memcached buckets

I renamed the ep_num_value_ejects stat to evictions (text is the same)
and added a function to rename bytes to mem_used (memcached) and
ep_num_value_ejects to evictions (membase). I updated the javascript
to use evictions.

The text still needs to be updated for memcached buckets, and the
disk-related stuff removed.
