DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Init script changes to pass IPV6 param.

The static_config file has been chosen as the medium to convey
if IPv6 mode has been enabled by user. The init script invokes
an Erlang helper function to indicate the value of the term
"ipv6" in the static_config file. If the "ipv6" flag has been
set to "true" then the init script would do the following:

[1] Set the "name" parameter to either xxx@xxx.xxx
    or xxx@xxx.xxx

[2] Set the "proto_dist" parameter to either "inet_tcp" or "inet6_tcp".

The terms in static_config file are provided as application env
variables. The application environment variable "ipv6" will be
used internally by the ns_server components to handle the mode
appropriately.
