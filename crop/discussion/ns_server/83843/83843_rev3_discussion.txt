DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Init script changes to pass IPV6 param.

The static_config file has been chosen as the medium to convey
if IPv6 mode has been enabled by user. The init script invokes
an Erlang helper function to indicate the value of the term
"ipv6" in the static_config file. If the "ipv6" flag has been
set to "true" then the init script would do the following:

[1] Set an environment variable called IPV6 to true or false based
    on the value set in the config file. This environment variable
    is used internally by the ns_server components to handle the
    mode appropriately.

[2] Set the "name" parameter to either xxx@xxx.xxx
    or xxx@xxx.xxx

[3] Set the "proto_dist" parameter to either "inet_tcp" or "inet6_tcp".

Patch Set 3:

static config keys automatically become erlang environment variables. It might make sense to use ipv6 erlang env variable instead of IPV6 os env variable

Patch Set 3:

or even better: inet:get_rc/0 should return you {inet6, true} if ipv6 is enabled. so we might just rely on -proto_dist babysitter vm option, without looking into env variables.

Patch Set 3:

I think that using the ipv6 application environment variable instead of the OS env variable is better.

I tried the inet:get_rc() and it doesn't return anything specific to inet6. The following is what I got:
[{domain,"localdomain"},
 {search,["localdomain"]},
 {resolv_conf,"/etc/resolv.conf"},
 {hosts_file,"/etc/hosts"},
 {lookup,[native]}]

Another possibility is to use the "init:get_argument(proto_dist)" API to determine if IPv6 is being used. But I prefer the "ipv6" env approach over this.

Patch Set 3:

Did you try inet:get_rc() with ipv6 enabled. According to doc it doesn't return anything for keys which value equals to default which is false for inet6.

Patch Set 3:

I tried it with proto_dist parameter set to inet6_tcp which starts the distribution in IPv6 mode explicitly.

The reason why inet:get_rc() doesn't return about inet6 parameter is that the parameters referred to in the doc about get_rc() are the ones found in the inet configuration database which can be overridden using an inet configuration file. We currently don't supply one which is good in the sense that the user does not get to meddle with Erlang's IP configuration.
