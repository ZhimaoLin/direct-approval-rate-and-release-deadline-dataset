DESCRIPTION

MB-10409: Init script changes to pass IPV6 param.

The static_config file has been chosen as the medium to convey
if IPv6 mode has been enabled by user. The init script invokes
an Erlang helper function to indicate the value of the term
"ipv6" in the static_config file. If the "ipv6" flag has been
set to "true" then the init script would do the following:

[1] Set the "name" parameter to either xxx@xxx.xxx
    or xxx@xxx.xxx

[2] Set the "proto_dist" parameter to either "inet_tcp" or "inet6_tcp".

The terms in static_config file are provided as application env
variables. The application environment variable "ipv6" will be
used internally by the ns_server components to handle the mode
appropriately.

Patch Set 5:

Then the question is: why do we display ipv6 status for each node individually?

Patch Set 5:

Now that you mention it, that seems to be of no use. Initially I had thought that information could be consumed by other components. But now it seems like it's redundant/useless as they would have used the right interface to issue the REST API in the first place. I think we should abandon those changes.

Patch Set 5:

But we would probably need a way to display in the UI to signify a cluster is configured in IPv6 mode. I am not sure where in the UI that can be displayed. This can be taken up separately.
