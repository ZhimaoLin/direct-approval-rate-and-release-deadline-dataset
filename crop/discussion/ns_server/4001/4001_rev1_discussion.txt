DESCRIPTION

MB-3119 - avoid blacklisting a restored server

moxi's configured with downstream_conn_max of 16.  When moxi's holding
onto 16 stale downstream conns for a "host:port:bucket" in its conn
pool, and that node is restored (added back after a removal), the 17th
attempt to either 'reuse a conn from the conn pool or create a new
conn' will succeed, avoiding a blacklisting.
