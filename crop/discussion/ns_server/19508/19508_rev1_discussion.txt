DESCRIPTION

MB-6115: fix packing order issue in memcached binary protocol

Today during XDCR, CAPI creates a packet using binary protocol and
sends it to ep_engine. The order CAPI packs the item metadata in the
extension part is expiration time followed by flags, which is however
inconsistent with ep_engine protocol since it puts flags ahead of
the expiration time. This change-set will fix the order issue.

I think we need clear documentation somewhere clearly stating what revid is composed of.
