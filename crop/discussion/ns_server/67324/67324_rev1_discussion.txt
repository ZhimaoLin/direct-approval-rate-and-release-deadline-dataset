DESCRIPTION

MB-4114 provide local only REST api for cbcollect_info to get

...memcached_password

I'm not exactly very comfortable with giving away this password
via passwordless API, so in future we can create temporary diag
user. But it's out of scope of 4.6

Line:416, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I don't like that. I think that cbcollect_info needs to ask for master password. And some way to pass master key when ns_server spawns it. That's where having gosecrets work in cli mode would be handy.
