DESCRIPTION

Compact vbuckets by their ID in ascending order

When updating an index, the updater opens all the vbucket
databases, reads all changes from each, starting with the
vbucket with lowest ID, and then closes each before reading
the changes from the next one.
Compacting the vbucket databases in order decreases the
amount of time pre-compaction database files are kept open.
