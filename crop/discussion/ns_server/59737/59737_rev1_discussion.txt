Line:145, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> Don't understand what's going on here. What are you injecting? The setDefaultBucketName from mnHelper? At any rate, all I could see was that it was undefined all the time in the UI. Can you explain?

Line:145, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> in configuration of app.admin.analytics you can see 
resolve: {setDefaultBucketName: ...
it is undefined because it is resolved with undefined e.g defer.resolve()

Using injection here we say that we wait  when setDefaultBucketName will be resolved, we are not interested in value of setDefaultBucketName because if setDefaultBucketName resolved $stateParams has value analyticsBucket, so that's what we need

Line:145, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_admin_config.js -> That's how resolves work in ui-router. You can inject resolve from parent state

also pay attention, mnHelperProvider.setDefaultBucketName("analyticsBucket", 'app.admin.analytics.list.graph', true) returns function

Got it. The resolve documentation for ui-router isn't very clear on parent-child states. Looks good.
