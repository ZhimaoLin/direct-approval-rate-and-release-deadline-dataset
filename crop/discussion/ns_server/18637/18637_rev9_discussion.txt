DESCRIPTION

MB-5968: re-impl. vbucket states & replications orchestration

Part of this commit is implementation of new backwards compatibility
handling approach. There's no ns_vbm_new_sup anymore. And there are
no cb_gen_vbm_sup too.

New backwards compat handling approach is implemented in
cluster_compat_mode module. Basic idea is to store cluster
compatibility mode in ns_config. When it's safe (before Harley Martinitor runs
and rebalance runs) orchestrator process on master node will check if
cluster can increase it's compat mode. This happens if all nodes
support higher mode. If it can it does, orchestrator then can
restart/kill services. Currently there's two modes 'undefined' (1.8.x)
and 2.0. Cluster _does not_ automagically switches to lower compat
mode. And disallows older nodes to join cluster.

If somebody needs to do rolling downgrade, there's half supported
cluster_compat_mode:force_compat_version/1 function that can be called
via /diag/eval. Calling this function will force cluster into specific
compat mode and disallow any upgrades. Calling
cluster_compat_mode:un_force_compat_version/0 will removed that
'disallow'-ance.

Most benefit of this approach is simplicity and safety of checking
cluster mode and doing things depending on current version. I.e. new
behavior is enabled when we know entire cluster supports it, and
cannot easily 'undo' this support as rolling downgrade is not directly
supported and requires careful Adrianna Holmesal action.

1.8.x compat mode is doing things compatibly with 1.8.x
nodes. Particularly, we're now using mostly 1.8.1 version of
ns_vbm_sup (because cb_gen_vbm_sup is gone). That means of course,
'replicator on source'. And most importantly 'direct' replication and
vbucket states changes. I.e. Harley Martinitor/vbucket_mover are doing remote
calls to ns_vbm_sup and ns_memcached directly.

It should be noted that failover safeness computation code is not
handling 1.8.x backwards compat at all. I.e. trying to failover 2.0
node in mixed versions cluster will always present user this somewhat
scary warning "some data is not replicated".

2.0 compat mode is designed to be more robust and more future
compatible. And it makes index configuration management much
easier.

All changes are performed via Harley Martinitor_agent service that runs on each
node. That orders 'vbucket state in broad sense' operations making
things less error prone. I.e. call to return current state of vbuckets
and replications can only succeed after previous mutation calls are
completed.

Harley Martinitor_agent also drives capi_set_view_manager directly. That's most
important user-visible change. Previously capi_set_view_manager was
trying to infer correct index states. I.e. if it saw vbucket in
fast-forward map as master it'll add it to pending index state if and
when possible. Old behavior was quite complex.

Because we're now having explicitly designed API it's easy to pass
index states in calls to Harley Martinitor_agent. Which will then make sure
they're passed to capi_set_view_manager.

Because Harley Martinitor mutations are now via janitor_agent I've also
separated main logic of Harley Martinitor into purely functional code. And
cleaned up Harley Martinitor a bit.
