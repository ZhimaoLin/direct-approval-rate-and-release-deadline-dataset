DESCRIPTION

don't allow attempts to "rebalance out" unknown nodes.MB-5062

It was previously possible to ask rebalancing out of node that's not
part of cluster anymore. This fix will return nodes mismatch if
somebody tries to rebalance out unknown node.

Actual fix is verifying that EjectedNodes are subset of KnownNodes.
