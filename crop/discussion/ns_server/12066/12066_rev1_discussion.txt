Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

Thanks Alk. I had this on my todo list.
Left one minor comment only.

Line:186, src/couchbase_compaction_daemon.erl -> Here we don't need this iteration anymore.
Before we had a view per database/vbucket.
Not anymore.

Also here we would the parallel db/view compaction.
It was removed (which is right) from compact_vbucket/4, but not added anywhere else.
