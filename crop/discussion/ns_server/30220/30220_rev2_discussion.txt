DESCRIPTION

MB-100: corrected lsof usage

We found that greping lsof output is not always working because lsof
cuts full process name and particularly godu processes were filtered
out.

New code is doing pgrep to find all relevant processes.

I've also fixed misc issue with finding sigar port process.
