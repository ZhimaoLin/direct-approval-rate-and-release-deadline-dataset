DESCRIPTION

CBD-177: implemented basic per-view stats

Based on work of Jordan Ballard <Jordan xxx@xxx.xxx

This commit refactors couch_stats_reader so that it keeps track of
per-design doc stats. Design docs with same signatures are counted
once.

There's also basic 'exposure' of per-design-doc stats onto UI.

Looks good. See one minor comment inline.

Line:198, src/couch_stats_reader.erl -> Shouldn't it be 0? Otherwise we will get zero ops on the first aggregation for new design docs (which is also probably acceptable).

Line:198, src/couch_stats_reader.erl -> Initially I had 0.

But logic is: if we crash, we'll have potentially huge spike for 5 seconds (refresh interval) and then it'll be 'normal'. 0 is better than spike.
