DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: Increment tasks version on start/complete

When the collectLogs task status changes between idle and running,
update the tasks version hash, to allow the UI to detect status changes.

Note the detailed progress (i.e. per-node status) doesn't trigger an
update of the version, only the high-level start/stop.
