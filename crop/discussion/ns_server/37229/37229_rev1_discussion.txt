DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: navigate to result page every time when

... the task timestamp changes.

before: if the cbcollect_info fails quickly and the task status goes from
idle to idle (bypassing running stage) then the UI was not switching to
result screen after the collection was started.

Line:93, priv/public/js/logs.js -> StringHashFragmentCell is used for back button support and for keeping state of UI between refreshes. Maybe you want to use a plain Cell in this case.

Line:289, priv/public/js/logs.js -> First, we already have subscription that controls collectInfoViewNameCell. Second, I do not think that we need lastKnownTSCell to be a Cell at all, it can be just a variable.
