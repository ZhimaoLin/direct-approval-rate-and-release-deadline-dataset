DESCRIPTION

MB-24531 Ability to Copy Long Sever Names

- removed the Angular truncation (mnLimitTo) from the server name
  (it was hiding the text completely from the triple-click)
- removed the CSS ellision from the group name (so a short name
  remains fully visible); left the Angular truncation for longer
  ones.
- added ng-click="$event.stopPropagation();" to eliminate visual
  weirdness when triple-clicking node name
- also added this last item to the indexes node name field
- removed “&nbsp;” character from node name value and replaced
  with CSS padding style
