Patch Set 3:

This is pretty far from an ideal setup, I still plan on / have half written a proper erlang api for setting up and tearing down clusters but this is the quickest way to get up and running.

    make common_tests 

will run the test suite, will output a path to the results, 3 should pass and one should skip currently

Patch Set 3:

oh yeh and common_tests will wipe your data (make data clean) and shouldnt be run with another currently running system.

I still don't like doing that from erlang. For example, what happens if wait for node going up times out ? But it's a start and I prefer to merge it and work that out later.
