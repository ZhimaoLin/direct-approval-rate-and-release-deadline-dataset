DESCRIPTION

Do not try to force lists passed to logging calls. MB-4505

The ale_utils:force function used to be called only to force arguments
passed to various logging calls. But this function mistakenly tried to
apply itself recursively to the lists contained in the argument list.
So now we have ale_utils:force function to force a value and a
ale_utils:force_args which forces all the values in a list.

Patch Set 2: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

It was a mistake to try to force lists passed by a user recursively. So I updated the patch accordingly. Mark it -1 because bug number in the commit message is incorrect. Can you specify the correct one?
