DESCRIPTION

Rebalance continues even with vbucket in dead->pending state

ns_vbucket_mover was double-checking the state of the vbucket
after a vbucketmigrator process finishes, and stopping a Rebalance
prematurely.

When a vbucketmigrator process exits, the vbucket may legitimately be
in dead state on the original server and in either active or pending
on the destination server.

An alternative to this fix may be to instead (or additionally) have
vbucketmigrator block until it receives a successful response to a
vbucket state change request on the destination server, but that's
more involved at this point.

Patch Set 1:

Update: this wasn't a complete fix.  During more testing of this, I run into...

  Rebalance exited with reason {mover_lied, {ok,dead}, {memcached_error,not_my_vbucket,[]}}

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Can the vbucket really be in pending or missing state after vbucketmigrator exits? Shouldn't vbucketmigrator not exit until all messages have been received and acknowledged? It seems to me that if the vbucket is in pending state on the destination, there's no way for vbucketmigrator to know that the transfer has completed successfully.

Unless vbucketmigrator is known not to ever exit with a success code if the transfer hasn't really succeeded, we shouldn't submit this.

Line:215, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> This is the exact state this code was meant to catch, so we might as well revert the change if this is an acceptable state.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Sean's revert obsoletes this change, and probably also handles the case when the mover_lied due to...

  {mover_lied, {ok,dead}, {memcached_error,not_my_vbucket,[]}}
