Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I want to see how this handles replication manager updating of replicator documents. Like when we actually start replication we update document status and status mtime fields.

Patch Set 1:

Verified that new replicator db  docs created on one node are being replicated to other nodes. However, deletes of existing docs are not being replicated/propagated.

Sounds strange that this should happen. Any ideas?
