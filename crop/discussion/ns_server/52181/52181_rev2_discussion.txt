Line:197, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> ns_server should not supply defaults for indexer settings here because this conflicts and overrides the default supplied by indexing/secondary/common/config.go - this is already causing problems, I'll create a bug for it.

Line:197, src/index_settings_manager.erl -> Then ns_server would have to get the values from indexer /settings endpoint. This *) complicates the code, *) doesn't work on non-index nodes. So I don't see how to get what you want easily.
