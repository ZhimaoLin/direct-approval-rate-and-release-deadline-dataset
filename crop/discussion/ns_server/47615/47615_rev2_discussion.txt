Patch Set 2:

Patch set 1 works exactly like Don have described, but also has flaw.
Server expects integer from UI at the same time UI allows entering of a float number in field. That float number will be converted to the seconds during saving. 

e.g. 1) 15.1 min -> 906 seconds. So 906 is integer therefore response has no errors but UI keep it like 15.1 mins.
e.g. 2) 15.01 min -> 900.6 seconds. 900.6 is float, response has error 'The value of rotate_interval must be integer'.

User have entered float value in both examples but only the first contains error.

IMHO easiest and clearest way to avoid such problems is to display exactly the same value on UI as on the server.

Patch set 2 contains work around for js fractional numbers
