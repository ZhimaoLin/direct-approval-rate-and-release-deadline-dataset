Patch Set 1:

It does display fractional numbers if for example you enter 903 sec and then switch to minutes. So -1.

Though I still not sure that I completely understand how this control should work so, Dave, feel free to override my -1 with your +2 if you think that the behavior is correct. Otherwise I think there should be better explanation of how this control should work in a bug description.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Hi Pavel - based on Artem's comments, looks like this is not working as I spec'ed. Here's how I would like it to work:
* when the form is populated choose the biggest unit that divides evenly into the value returned from the REST API. The rest API will be returned in seconds. So "1" will be shown as 1 with unit of seconds, 60 will show as 1 minute, 900 will show as 15 minutes, 3600 will show as 1 hour, 86400 will show as 1 day
* when the user changes the units or the value, don't recompute. So say it shows as 15 minutes initially and the user changes "minute" -> "hour" don't recompute to show 0.25 hours. Just leave it show 15 hours. The user will then have to Adrianna Holmesally go change the 15 hours to get whatever value he wants.

If this isn't clear let me know. Thanks!

Dave, let's say I entered 86401 sec and saved.
Next time when I get to this screen what should the position of combobox be?

Same question for 86400 seconds and 1 day.

Patch Set 1:

Don:

"If it were 34 seconds ...save as seconds 34. Start dividing by the largest among (1,60,3600, 86400) (i.e 1, if less than= 60, populate as seconds, if between 61 and =3600, populate as minutes, and so forth)"

This implies displaying the fractional numbers. 61 sec = 1.0166666666666666 min
