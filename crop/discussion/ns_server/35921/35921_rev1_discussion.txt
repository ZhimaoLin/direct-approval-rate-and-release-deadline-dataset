Patch Set 1:

Not necessary but nice to have. Here's why:
Login to UI in one tab and execute http://127.0.0.1:9000/pools/default in another tab.
Works

Logout from UI
Refresh tab with http://127.0.0.1:9000/pools/default and you'll get 401 because it still tries to get in with the deleted cookie. 

This change fixes it.
