DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: don't block UI during initialization of section

We should try to show something to the user asap, so it's
a bad idea to use resolves for sections

Line:4, priv/public/angular/app/mn_wizard/step2/mn_wizard_step2_controller.js -> How is this related to this commit?

Line:12, priv/public/angular/app/mn_wizard/step2/mn_wizard_step2.html -> How is this related to this commit?

Line:51, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_poll.js -> I think this deserves separate commit with explanation of when and how it should be used.

And how it is better than subscribe(keeper, key) ?

Line:51, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_poll.js -> And how subscribe(keeper, key) is better than (subscriber, keeper)? Subscriber can be either function or name (key) and I believe the word "subscriber" suitable for both cases. So you propose to give the name "key" for the function? And I don't think that it should be in separate commit.
