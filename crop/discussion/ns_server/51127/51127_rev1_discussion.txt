DESCRIPTION

serialize starting/stopping dcp_replicators with get_actual_replications

to prevent potential race when the replicator get's killed during
dcp_replicator:get_partitions execution

also care taken to make sure that get_actual_replications won't get
blocked if one of the replicators is blocked due to the absense of
the correct response from ep-engine
