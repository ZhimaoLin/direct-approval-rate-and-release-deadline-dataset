Patch Set 2:

Not sure it's a real problem, but please bear with me. Is there a possibility that there would be a user with no permission to know the list of buckets? If yes, then it seems that if such a user tries accessing any of the {bucket, any} URLs, they will get the list in the response. So it can be considered a data leak.

Patch Set 2:

thanks for noticing. currently there's no role that doesn't allow to get list of buckets, but there could be such roles in future. so this hole should be covered.

plus there are possible users with no roles: for example anonymous if there's no noauth buckets. but for such users I guess we need to return 401

Patch Set 2:

Btw, irrespective of the previous discussion, I'm not sure that having the response size depend on the number of buckets is a good idea. Yes, these days we don't recommend people to have more than ten buckets. But discussions about multi-tenancy keep popping up. One day we might have hundreds or maybe thousands of buckets.
