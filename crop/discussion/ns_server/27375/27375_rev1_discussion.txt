Patch Set 1: Fails

This implementation breaks the functionality.

1. Check one or two sample buckets
2. Go to the next page
3. Observe that "Other buckets" occupy 0 MB

Patch Set 1:

my guess is because it is marked as Work In Progress.

Anyways we've all agreed that we will not use cells in this place of code. Which makes this change irrelevant
