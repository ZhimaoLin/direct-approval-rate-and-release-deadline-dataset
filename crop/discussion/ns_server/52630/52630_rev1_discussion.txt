DESCRIPTION

Stop checking ram quota differently when joining clusters.

This code was needed because in 1.6.0 we used different default,
specifically, 512MiBs of free ram was considered ok. Then this was
changed to 1024MiBs. But for new versions of the couchbase server to
be able to join 1.6.0 clusters, this special logic was introduced.

I'm removing this for the following reasons:

  - for anybody to be hit by this, they need to have a cluster that
    was upgraded all the way from 1.6.0

  - as far as I know even leaving just 1024MiBs is not recommended

  - 512MiBs is clearly not enough for a zoo of processes we currently
    have; so it's legitimate to say that the user should indeed add
    more nodes to a cluster and lower the quota before upgrading to
    sherlock

  - I left the knob to tweak it for those who know what they are doing
