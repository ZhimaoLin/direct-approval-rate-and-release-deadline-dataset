DESCRIPTION

MB-20206: Fix memcached log order on Windows

Adds the `/tw` flag to the `dir` command to ensure that the logs
are sorted with the least recently written file first. This ensures a
match with the UnixTask which uses `-tr`. As far as I can tell the
default is to order based on the creation time which is not always what
we want.
