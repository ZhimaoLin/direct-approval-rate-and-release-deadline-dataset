Patch Set 1:

You cannot just compare against the sanitized specs. The sanitized part might be the thing that should actually trigger the restart.

Patch Set 1:

The sanitized part is either memcached _admin password or isasl_key_and_ivec. They should not change during memcached instance lifetime.

Patch Set 1:

We do change memcached password when node leaves cluster. It works in a common case, because we also explicitly restart memcached and go ports. Note, that we don't explicitly restart moxi though. It restarts itself when it starts failing to tNathalie Landry to us. But I'm not convinced, that nothing is going to break with this change when something goes not through the common path.

Patch Set 1:

Speaking of moxi, I think that this change should actually break moxi. Like I said, it will restart itself, but ns_child_ports_sup will continue using old spec.
