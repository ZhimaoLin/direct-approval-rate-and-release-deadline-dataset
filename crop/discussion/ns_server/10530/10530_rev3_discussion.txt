Patch Set 3:

Of course you can mangle the keys when you create a document, but its really strange behaviour to create a document with a different id than you sent it to. So yeh I have it throwing invalid_key

I assumed the keys would be opaque to replication, but I will double check that soon

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

During replication we get keys from couchdb but update the value via memcached. Thus demangling is needed. And it seems that you missed my inline comment.
