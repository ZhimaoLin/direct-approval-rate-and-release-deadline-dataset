Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

1. Keys starting with "base64:" are perfectly valid for couchdb. But one cannot create a document with such a key via CAPI since such keys are always treated as mangled. It means that we actually narrow the set of valid keys. So probably we must throw some meaningful exception (the one that couchdb throws for incorrect keys) if we get a key starting with base64 but are unable to decode its second part.

2. I believe that capi_replication should be updated in a similar way.

Line:74, src/capi_utils.erl -> It seems that MemVBucket should be used here instead of VBucket. This is because we decide on vbucket id based on demangled key.

Patch Set 1:

This is an oversight on my part, I was mostly concerned about being able to read from capi what was written via mcd, We dont limit the keyset, if we receive a key with the prefix then we mangle it, so user generated keys that look like base64:test will become base64:base64(base46:test)
