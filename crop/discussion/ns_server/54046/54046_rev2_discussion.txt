Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

(2 comments)

Couple of minor comments but approving.

Line:564, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> The two function names differ only by  "s" at the end. To improve code readability, it will be good to rename "check_service_quota" to something like "check_per_service_quota".

Line:584, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> It will be good to define a macro for this, say MIN_INDEX_QUOTA.
