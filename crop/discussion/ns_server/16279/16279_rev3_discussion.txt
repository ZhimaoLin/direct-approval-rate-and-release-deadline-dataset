DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: made vbucket filter change txn key unique

Just in case. To avoid any possibility of things going totally bad if
for some reason {Bucket, NewChildId} is reused by some ebucketmigrator
as we in fact could see in MB-5346. Where we allowed 2 instances of
ebucketmigrator with different list of vbuckets between pair of nodes.
