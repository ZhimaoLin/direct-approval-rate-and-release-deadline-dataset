DESCRIPTION

MB-18282 Fix deadlock in supervisor_cushion:terminate.

The sequence of events that caused the deadlock in the referred
ticket:

  - system reached a limit on the number of open files, so everything
    is in a bad shape

  - memcached terminated, corresponding ns_port_server saw this and
    also terminated

  - supervisor_cushion receives the EXIT message from ns_port_server;
    in corresponding handle_info clause it tries to log some
    information about it, but it also fails

  - gen_server catches the exception caused by the failure to log and
    calls supervisor_cushion:terminate

  - terminate function does erlang:exit on the ns_port_server that is
    already dead and obviously doesn't receive any new EXIT messages,
    so it waits forever in the receive
