DESCRIPTION

MB-21800: improved lost_connection module behavior

    - reset repeatAt value and reload the application
      as soon as user gets success response. The logic
      works only in mn_admin section. We need something
      else in order to update mn_auth and mn_wizard in
      the similar situation.

    - block navigation while lost_connection is active
