Patch Set 1: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Fails the following test:

two_down_at_same_time_test() ->
    State0 = init_state(3),
    State1 = process_frame_no_action(2, [a,b,c,d], [b,c], State0),
    process_frame([a,b,c,d], [b,c], State1).

It makes sense to move logic of handling reaching max nodes to failover into auto_failover_logic and covering it with some unit tests.
