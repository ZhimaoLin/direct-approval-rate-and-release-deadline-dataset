Continuing looking. So far spotted one race.

Line:38, src/set_view_update_daemon.erl -> there's a tiny race here as well as in original code

Patch Set 1:

One potential problem here is some coupling to couch API.

We have dialyzer in ns_server that we can use to check if we're speaking to no-more-existant APIs, but AFAIK couchdb doesn't have any tools to verify stuff is not used by ns_server.

Would like to hear Filipe's thoughts here.

Patch Set 1:

Filipe, I think equivalent of 

set_view_update_daemon:trigger_update_by_signature/3

deserves to be converted to some official couch api. I feel we're getting a bit too deep into guts of set views there.
