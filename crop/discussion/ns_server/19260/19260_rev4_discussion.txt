DESCRIPTION

CBD-423 Resurrect set_view_update_daemon in ns_server.

Configuration parameters were moved to ns_server config. Update
interval can only be specified globally for all design
documents. Minimum number of changes to update the index can be
specified globally and on per design document basis. For the latter
one should set "updateMinChanges" integer field in "viewParameters"
design document body. This value will override a global value.

updateMinChanges value of 0 (either global or per ddoc) means that
update won't be triggered for this ddoc (or for all ddocs). But the
daemon will still periodically try to trigger updates.

To disable daemon completely updateInterval should be set to 0.

For simplicity the code behaves as if there were no design
documents with the same signature. In reality if there happen to be
several design documents with the same signature, then update will be
triggered whenever at least one design document's updateMinChanges
value is less than the number of changes.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Discussed with Filipe. I'm going to exclude "options" from design document signature calculation and use it to store updateMinChanges there. Thus -1 for now.
