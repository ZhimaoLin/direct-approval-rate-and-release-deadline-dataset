DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: create new entry in stat table before creating replicators

Today we insert an entry into stat table after we create a replicator
process, which may subject to race condition that replicator process
is trying to query and update the stat table before its entry is
inserted into that table. This change-set fixes this issue by creating
an entry in stat table before creating the corresponding replicator
process.
