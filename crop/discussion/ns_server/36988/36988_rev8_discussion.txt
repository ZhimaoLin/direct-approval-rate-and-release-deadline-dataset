DESCRIPTION

removed unnecessary table style

Logs section is going to change therefore
current style of logs list became deprecated
together with style of keys list in analitics
section. I believe that current table styles
are mistake because they are completely out of
general style.

Patch Set 8:

not sure if it's this commit or not but I don't like how it looks: http://i.imgur.com/5Wnx9EO.png

"don't like" is usually irrelevant but at least thats a change from area that looked at least half-decent in past and was designed by professional (and I was told expensive) folks
