Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Per the spec, the blue arrow needs to open a menu on mouseover/click instead of loading specific stats.

Unless we're planning/discussing a major change to this layout (which would remove the need for a menu in a future version), loading a menu now (instead of a click to open specific stats) is needed to avoid frustrating and confusing users later.

Thanks.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Additional comments in code. I'm altering my review to -1, so Dale or someone else can +2 it to get it in before the demo (I'll be out until then).

Line:150, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> Can you rename this? "plain" doesn't state clearly that these are the "cross bucket" statistics.

Line:489, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> small typo "iff"

Line:500, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> This is similar to the earlier "plain" name given earlier. Maybe "crossBucketStatGraphsConfigCell" or "clusterWideStatGraphsConfigCell"?

Line:1082, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> Not sure why this is commented out, but it'll break if uncommented. Might want to kill it or fix it.

Line:489, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iff

Line:500, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> they are all cross-bucket (if I understand correctly) and all cluster wide in some sense.

We can argue about names infinitely I we want. Having said that I'm ok with any name (unless it's confusing) and you're native speaker.

Line:1082, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> yeah. forgot to remove this

Line:489, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> Ah. :)

Line:500, priv/public/js/analytics.js -> Something better than "plain" or "normal"...my "crossBucket" idea is incorrect, though, as you noticed.

How about "aggregateGraphsConfigCell?"

In the Erlang, the functions are handle_bucket_stats and handle_bucket_node_stats vs. handle_specific_stat_for_buckets, so aggregate (meaning an aggregate of all bucket stats) seems to make the most sense to me.
