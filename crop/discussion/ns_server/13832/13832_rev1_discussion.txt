DESCRIPTION

fire node_disco event when nodes_wanted is updated

It was previously possible to see some node in nodes() first and only
then on nodes_wanted(). In such case ns_node_disco_events event won't
be fired. This commit fixes it by forcing notify_clients check on
each update of nodes_wanted.
