Patch Set 1:

I noticed the alert isn't checked by default in the UI. Can you let me know if I'm missing something? Otherwise this should be checked by default.

Patch Set 1:

It is enabled by default on fresh cluster setup.

Did you by chance restart an older cluster with this change? That is similar to performing an upgrade and the alert will not be enabled by default. That is the case for any new alert we add.

I see it now. You are correct, you need to re-initialize the cluster for everything to show up properly after adding the change.
