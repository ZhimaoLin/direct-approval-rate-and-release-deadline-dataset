DESCRIPTION

MB-15968 ns_ssl_proxy shouldn't send certain data to memcached twice

if the sender sends 2 batches one after another without waiting for the
ack from memcached for the first batch, ns_ssl_proxy was sending the buffer
to memcached 2 times causing incorrect parsing of messages on memcached side
and memcached closing the connection due to incorrect message magic

we do not expect the sender to behave this way, but we still need to
handle this correctly just in case
