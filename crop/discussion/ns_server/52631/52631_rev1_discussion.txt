DESCRIPTION

Don't get replication from goxdcr in remote_clusters_info.

It's only needed for erlang xdcr. Saw it crash in MB-15479 because of
goxdcr unavailability.

Change looks good but the intent is not clear.  Why should it not get replication from goxdcr for remote_clusters_info?

Patch Set 1:

Because remote_clusters_info is used only for erlang xdcr replications. Once we switch to goxdcr, it's still running but is not used.
