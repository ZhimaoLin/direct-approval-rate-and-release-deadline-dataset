Line:2034, src/misc.erl -> [Host]

Line:2036, src/misc.erl -> [Host, Rest1]

Line:2037, src/misc.erl -> I guess the match pattern should be ":" ++ Port here, with string:tokens "[host]port:" will also be accepted.

Line:2055, src/misc.erl -> [Host]

Line:2067, src/misc.erl -> brackets won't be added to "::1". use lists:member

Line:2034, src/misc.erl -> Missed them. Will fix.

Line:2036, src/misc.erl -> Done

Line:2037, src/misc.erl -> Done

Line:2055, src/misc.erl -> Done

Line:2067, src/misc.erl -> It works because the resulting list for "::1" will be ["1"] which matches the second case. But I'll change it to use lists:member.
