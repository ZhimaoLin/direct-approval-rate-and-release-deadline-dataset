DESCRIPTION

MB-26257: Support usage of raw IPv6 addresses.

This enables the user to supply raw IPv6 addresses while
adding nodes to the cluster. When the intent is to use
raw IPv6 addresses then the user will have to provide one
that is enclosed in brackets.

Like so: [FC00::11]:8091

Line:2049, src/misc.erl -> You don't need item_count function here, since item_count(H, $:) =:= string:tokens(H, ":") - 1

Line:2049, src/misc.erl -> I had thought of that. Where it breaks is when the IPv6 address is supplied in compressed notation. For ex - ::1. That's the reason I implemented item_count.

Line:2053, src/misc.erl -> Will fix!

Line:2049, src/misc.erl -> true. string:tokens is more tricky than I thought.
I would check count in separate case prior to string:tokens then and rename item_count to char_count

Line:2053, src/misc.erl -> After a second thought. I had retained the original implementation as is here. I think the intention behind that implementation was to error out input like the following = "127.0.0.1:9000:123". So I think we should just retain as it was earlier.

Line:2049, src/misc.erl -> Will split it into separate case statements.

The reason why I chose item_count was that the API can be run against any list of terms. For instance: item_count(["abc", "def", "abc"], "abc") would also work.
