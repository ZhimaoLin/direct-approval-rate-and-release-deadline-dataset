DESCRIPTION

WIP: apply collections manifest to bucket when bucket is started or

...when collection manifest changes. keep copy of old collection
manifest in ns_memcached state since memcached doesn't provide an
api to get collection manifest from the bucket

restart bucket if collections are enabled/disabled
