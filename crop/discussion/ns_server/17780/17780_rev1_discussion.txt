DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: retire unused table and functions in couch replicator

This change-set will retire ets table REP_TO_STATE used by couch
replicator to record replication state. In XDCR manager, we now
have ets table CSTORE to monitor all replication processes, and
thus REP_TO_STATE will never be used in XDCR. Also remove all
dependent functions which reply on REP_TO_STATE.
