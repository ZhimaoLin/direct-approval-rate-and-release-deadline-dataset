DESCRIPTION

MB-22122 dedicated server for sending audit messages

- if the audit message is malformed, the caller will fail, this is
  intentional, because otherwise it will be difficult to catch such
  errors
- if the memcached call fails, it will be retried in 1 second
- the order of audit messages is preserved
