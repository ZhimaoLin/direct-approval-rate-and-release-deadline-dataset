DESCRIPTION

MB-5264: instance_start_time and ensure_full_commit hack

Add support for instance_start_time to properly support XDCR
and also a hack to always return success immediately on
ensure_full_commit. The hack will be replaced with real code that
ensure all queued items are persisted to disk before returning,
this hack is make the tests pass. If there is a crash after issuing
this call, items XDCR thought were successfully persisted might
be lost, and XDCR will never recopy them correctly.
