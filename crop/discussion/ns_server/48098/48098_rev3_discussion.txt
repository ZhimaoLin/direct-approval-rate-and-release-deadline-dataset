DESCRIPTION

MB-13867 Always recreate master vbucket after flush.

As part of bucket flush we delete the master vbucket. So we need to
create it back afterwards. In case when there are design documents, it
happens automagically inside save_doc. But if there are no design
documents, save_doc will never be called.
