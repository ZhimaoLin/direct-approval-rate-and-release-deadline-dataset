Line:133, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/details/mn_buckets_details_service.js -> imho that getStartedCompactions()[url] check is best refactored into mnCompaction method. I.e. something like: isRecentlyDone(url)

It will make this code more readable.

Line:3, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/details/mn_buckets_details_controller.js -> typo here
