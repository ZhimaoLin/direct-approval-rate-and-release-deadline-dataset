DESCRIPTION

Adaptions for spawning processes on windows

Spawning epmd failed due to the 2>&1 /dev/null, and trying
to use the windows > NUL seemed to fail. It doesn't print
out anyting so I just removed it.

In addition Python complained that the redirecting of the
pipes wasn't supported on windows. Just disabled that
piece for Windows.

it's not clear enough why noinput thing is disabled on windows

Line:172, cluster_run -> what isn't supported on windows?

Line:172, cluster_run -> Then it looks like we should simply avoid close_fds on windows and not pipe thing.

Line:206, cluster_run -> I'd do it without redirection on all platforms then.
