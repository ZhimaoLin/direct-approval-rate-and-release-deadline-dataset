Line:18, include/menelaus_web.hrl -> how about log_access which looks more english description of what is actually done ?

See inline. Also agree about ale change.

Line:19, src/menelaus_access_log_formatter.erl -> No need to do join and ++ since format_msg just supposed to return iolist.

Line:51, src/menelaus_access_log_formatter.erl -> Again, no need to concat. Just return iolist.
