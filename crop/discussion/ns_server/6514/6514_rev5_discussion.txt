DESCRIPTION

get rid of null sample values in collector

This fixes badarith in menelaus_stats:basic_stats.

We're converting them to 0 anyways so it makes little sense.

The only place in stats that still produces null values is
samples_to_proplists which is final data transformation before sending
it to client. And 'null' is used to mark missing values, which may
happen after membase upgrade.
