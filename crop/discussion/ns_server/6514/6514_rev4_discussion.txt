DESCRIPTION

get rid of null sample values in collector

This fixes badarith in menelaus_stats:basic_stats.

We're converting them to 0 anyways so it makes little sense.

The only place in stats that still produces null values is
samples_to_proplists which is final data transformation before sending
it to client. And 'null' is used to mark missing values, which may
happen after membase upgrade.

This also removes stats badarith diagnostics that fulfulled it's
purpose.
