DESCRIPTION

MB-13384: ensure that prebuilt go binaries are statically linked

Previously when host arch and os match one of 3 prebuild targets, we
could generate dynamically linked executable. Specifically on
i386-linux host we generated executables that needed i386 libc to
run. Which few hosts have.

This commit ensures that CGO_ENABLED=0 is set and really taken into
account when linking to "net" via -a flag to go build.

This worked correctly on my box. But I'd like somebody to double check my findings.
