DESCRIPTION

CBD-177 Access counters for aggregate view read ops

Adds a stat for aggregate view reads per second.

This patch lays the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.
The actual rendering of the stats in JSON is in the next patch here:
