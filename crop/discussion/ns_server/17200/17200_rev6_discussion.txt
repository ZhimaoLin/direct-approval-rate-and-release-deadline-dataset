DESCRIPTION

CBD-177 Access counters for aggregate view read ops

This depends on a small
change in CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17199

I think it is better to make this change in CouchDB, than to
access the ETS table directly, just based on the number of
private APIs I'd end up exposing in order to find the lookup
key into that ETS table. If there is some bigger-picture plan
for moving the accessing of this stats table, then we should
discuss it. Otherwise I think this patch alone is best done
by having the stats look up be done by the set-view process.

This patch lays the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.
The actual rendering of the stats in JSON is in the next path here:

Patch Set 6:

I was pointing out that right now in stats_collector we're trying to "massage" couch stats just like some memcached stats . We don't have to. And it'll most likely make this code simpler and readable.

Patch Set 6:

I'm not sure which part of stats_collector you mean. I tried removing some type conversion stuff and couldn't get things to work. I agree it could use some cleanup. I've been trying to confine my patches to be small amounts of change. If we can also delete code while doing that, I'm happy to, but I'm not confident enough in my understanding of the codebase to start deleting big chunks.

I'd like to keep refactoring out of the feature patches (except for the obvious stuff).

Maybe we should get this in, and then we can tNathalie Landry about any refactors that should happen before I start coding the XDCR stuff.

Or maybe the stats_collector change is super-simple and I'm just not seeing it.
