DESCRIPTION

CBD-177 Access counters for aggregate view read ops

Adds a stat for aggregate view reads per second.

This patch lays the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.
The actual rendering of the stats in JSON is in the next patch here:

Patch Set 9: Verified

I think this is ready to go in. It's not perfect, but it's give the ability to see which views are getting traffic, and that's the main point.

Patch Set 9:

this code bends limits of what's acceptable quite a bit.

It's not your code that introduced that questionable massaging and parsing of couch stats, but it makes it larger.

I'm ok with fixing this initial mess myself, but if I accept this code it'll be larger mess to fix. Up to the point of asking: isn't that future fix nearly entire rewrite of this commit? If so what's the point of merging it in first place.

Also there's a problem of turning design doc names into atoms, that's potentially troublesome.

I don't think it's entirely fair to say no. But I cannot say yes either. At least I need some additional thinking.

Patch Set 9:

I went through and tried to remove the various string / binary / atom conversions, to make the whole thing simpler, but it just started to lead to a bunch of changes, stuff that felt like it should be in a different patch.

The goal here is to provide the functionality we need (view stats) while making minimal changes to the other nearby code. If we want to do big changes to the system that pulls stats from couch, I think that should be a different patch.

Chris,

How far are these commits from being merged? I am now working on XDCR stats on UI which is probably similar to your view stats. 

It is better for me to wait until you merge these stats and then I can steal some code from your commits. :-)

Thanks,

Junyi

I am not spending any time on this patch right now. It should probably be rebased and merged as soon as my CDB-456 work is done.
