DESCRIPTION

CBD-177 Provide view stats for design documents.

Adds a stat for aggregate view reads per second.

This patch lays the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.
The actual rendering of the stats in JSON is in the next patch here:

Some code squashed from http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17384

Excludes dev mode views. Depends on earlier patch to add
per-design doc stats to the stats collector.

View stats appear in the main bucket screen, in "closed"
style, with a click to toggle open each view group's stats.

If two views have the same signature (on a set_view_group basis)
they will be shown as the same row of stats.

Chris, I've reworked your code to be like I wanted it to be. Particularly to avoid messing up with 'plain' memcached stats.

It was just merged: http://review.couchbase.org/19064
