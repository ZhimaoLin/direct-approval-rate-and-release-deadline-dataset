DESCRIPTION

CBD-177 access counters for aggregate view reads

This depends on a small
change in CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17199

I think it is better to make this change in CouchDB, than to
access the ETS table directly, just based on the number of
private APIs I'd end up exposing in order to find the lookup
key into that ETS table. If there is some bigger-picture plan
for moving the accessing of this stats table, then we should
discuss it. Otherwise I think this patch alone is best done
by having the stats look up be done by the set-view process.

This patch lays the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.
The actual rendering of the stats in JSON is in the next path here:
