DESCRIPTION

WIP CBD-177 ddoc stats and access counts aggregate

What do you think of the approach? This depends on a small
change in CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17199

Before merge I still need to work on the UI component, but want
to get feedback on the backend started.

Also this is laying the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.
