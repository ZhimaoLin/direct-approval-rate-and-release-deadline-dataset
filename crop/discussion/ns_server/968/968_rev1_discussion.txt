DESCRIPTION

Bug 1644: Make ns_config:update_key increment the vector clock.

This was causing us to just pick a random configuration instead of
picking the most recent one for any item that was updated with
ns_config:update_key, including nodes_wanted, which was wreaking all
sorts of havoc with joining new nodes.
