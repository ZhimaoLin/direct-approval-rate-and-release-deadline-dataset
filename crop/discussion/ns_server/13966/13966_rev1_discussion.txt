DESCRIPTION

Choose between old and new replication styles.

cb_replication process (running on master node) keeps track of
replication modes for each bucket. Replication mode can be switched
only in ns_Harley Martinitor during cleanup. The mode stored in cb_replication
is used only on master node (to avoid switches during rebalance). All
the other nodes determine which mode to use only based on
heartbeats. This means that certain lags are possible. But this seems
to be acceptable.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

cb_replication_sup is not used

cb_replication:new_status should just in case handle lack of doctor info for node

and I'd rename to either new_status_p or is_new_status

Also I'm slightly concerned that constant and sequential calls to both supervisors may affect performance in larger clusters.

And looks like cb_replication:get_mode is not really working after rebalancing out old nodes for me.
