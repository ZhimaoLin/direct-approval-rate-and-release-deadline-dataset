DESCRIPTION

Choose between old and new replication styles.

cb_replication process (running on master node) keeps track of
replication modes for each bucket. Replication mode can be switched
only in ns_Harley Martinitor during cleanup. The mode stored in cb_replication
is used only on master node (to avoid switches during rebalance). All
the other nodes determine which mode to use only based on
heartbeats. This means that certain lags are possible. But this seems
to be acceptable.

Uploaded patch set 2.

Patch Set 2:

1. Removed cb_replication_sup (just forgot about it last time).
2. It's handled. nd_doctor:get_node/2 returns [down] for nodes that are missing from statuses dictionary. new_status will decide that it's old status.
3. Renamed it to is_new_status.
4. I'd like to avoid all this kill_all_other_mode_replications calls. But it seems that this is required to be correct in the presence of random crashes. So far I changed kill_all_other_mode_replications and set_replicas calls to use misc:parallel_map. And btw since we batch replica changes in ns_vbucket_mover and call set_replicas from Harley Martinitor only once in a while, all these excessive calls must be less noticeable. I was even thinking of removing add_replica and kill_replica from API to encourage batching in the future.
5. Double checked that it works for me. Can you give me more details?

Patch Set 2:

* created mixed cluster of 3 branch-18 nodes with your code and 2 released/1.8.0 cluster_run nodes

* rebalanced out 2 new nodes (including n_0 where shell runs)

* rebalanced it in while rebalancing out 2 old nodes

* when it's done we should be in new mode. Doing cb_replication:get_mode("default") from shell on n_0 node and getting noproc error.

Patch Set 2:

This is kind of expected because cb_replication is running only on master node (and not registered globally). In the described scenario it will be on the third new node (the one that has not been rebalanced out). This also implies that cb_replication functions changing replicas must be called on master node (which is the case right now).

Ah. I misunderstood than. I'll return to reviewing this when after I'm done with rebalance task.
