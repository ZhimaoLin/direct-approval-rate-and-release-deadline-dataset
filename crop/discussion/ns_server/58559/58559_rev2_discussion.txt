Line:157, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> This is another variant of is_allowed, but it has a completely different name. I think roles is a list of atoms, and Identity a string so You could use guards to determine which case it is.
If You think having guards this like, on lines 147 and 152
is_allowed(..., [Role|_]) when is_atom(Role) ->

is to ugly, could You at least rename it to something like is_user_allowed?
