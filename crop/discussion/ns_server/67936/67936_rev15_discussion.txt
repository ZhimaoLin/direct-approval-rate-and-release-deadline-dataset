Patch Set 15: Verified+1

Main changes in the latest patches:

1. dcp_traffic and kv monitors use the common health_monitor gen_server.

2. Earlier {Node, Bucket} entries in the dcp_traffic monitor were explicitly removed by dcp_consumer_conn and dcp_replicator when the connection closed/terminated. 
Aliaksey suggested a better approach of having the dcp traffic monitor the (dcp _proxy) processes that are actively updating the  the traffic monitor and remove the entries when the dcp_proxy processes went away.

3. Some other comments from Aliaksey related to making the code more compact etc.
