Patch Set 4: Verified+1

windows: according to Bin if the script is delivered to the bin directory and contains the word python in the first line, the py2exe will automatically pick it up

python 2.4: I checked that the packages that I use are compatible

I also added a snippet of the python code that will add erlang to the path the same way as it happens in cbcollect_info
