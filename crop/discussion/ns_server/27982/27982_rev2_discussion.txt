DESCRIPTION

MB-8748 script to reset admin password

- /couchbase/install/bin/cbreset_password

- assumes that erlang is in path the same way as cbcollect_info
  does. this should be addressed separately as a bug

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

looks good. I was thinking escript is better alternative than python.

Particularly because it's harder for us to test python 2.4 (which is what rhel 5 ships). And particularly because on windows we have py2exe all python scripts.

Notifying Bin about this new python script that we'll have to install on windows
