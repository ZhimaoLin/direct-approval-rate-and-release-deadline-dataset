DESCRIPTION

MB-8748 script to reset admin password

- /couchbase/install/bin/cbreset_password
- doesn't work on the server started by cluster_run
  because dump_guts script doesn't work on it
- assumes that erlang is in path the same way as cbcollect_info
  does. this should be addressed separately as a bug

Didn't look throughly yet. But noticed one issue.

Line:62, cbreset_password -> Python (mostly) follows this_naming_convention for functions.

And this function does not seem to be used at all.
