DESCRIPTION

MB-9620: don't signal mccouch things to couchdb unless necessary

The idea behind this patch is to short-cut mccouch notifications for
vbuckets that are not opened in couchdb. Which should be 100% of the
time.

It allows us to avoid opening those vbuckets in couchdb and saves tons
of memory in erlang. And yet another step on the road of killing
mccouch.
