DESCRIPTION

Get Karma unit tests working again

Upgrade to angular 1.4.8 and changes in mn_http broke the
tests. Plus the karma.conf.js is out of date with respect to
the current set of javascripts, so I'm updating that too.
At some point I'll write something small to autogenerate
that file so it's always in sync.
