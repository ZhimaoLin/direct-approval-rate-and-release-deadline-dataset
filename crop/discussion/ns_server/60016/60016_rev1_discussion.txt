Patch Set 1:

Pavel - I want to get the SHA to the build team tonight & I've pretty carefully tested it, so I'm going to commit. Please rework as you see fit. There remains one minor problem that if you add a data node and the Review Specific Settings dialog shows then it presents you with the Data RAM quota for review, but that's not too bad.
