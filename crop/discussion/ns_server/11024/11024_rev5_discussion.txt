Patch Set 5:

Alk, can you either elaborate on dirty or what you say it equals "out-of-band?" Neither are informative, helpful, nor do they move the code forward in anyway.

Please provide reasonably informative feedback going forward.

Patch Set 5:

Out-of-band means outside of cells.

You attach this thing to buckets list cell, assuming subscribing to changes of this information is via buckets list cell. But then building and using it totally outside of cells.

_Anything_ in cell formula that changes state of the world instead of just building and returning value is suspicious. It often works, but it makes code less readable, maintainable and is just asking for trouble.

This particular task (partitioning of buckets list by bucket type) is easily solved by using cells, instead of going around it.

Patch Set 5:

So I should make a cell that filters the bucketsListCell?

My thought had been to make "sub-values" (pre-filtered lists of the bucketsList) attached to the full bucketsListCell. Thought that'd save some unnecessary re-running of filters.

I realize this is "unorthodox" in the world of Cells, but if you think it's worth re-filtering, I'm happy to rewrite it (or just do it "inline" as needed as was being done before).

Just let me know.

Patch Set 5:

Yes, making new Cells is more maintainable. You can name them like DAL.cells.bucketsList.memcachedType. Or DAL.cells.bucketsList.byType (that'll hold {"membase": <list of membase buckets>, "memcached": <list of memcached buckets>})

And while (and if) refactoring, please, make sure new cells are used everywhere when custom partitioning/filtration is currently done.
