DESCRIPTION

MB-9096: killed ns_online_config_upgrader

Which is not needed anymore.

I.e. majority of this code is handling upgrade from pre-2.0 to 2.0.

A bit more controversial piece is removal of xdcr settings which were
meant to be upgraded as part of upgrade to 2.2. But apparently it was
never working.

If we ever need similar code, then returning this module is going to
be easy
