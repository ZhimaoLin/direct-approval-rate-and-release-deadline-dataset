DESCRIPTION

WIP Manage backfill phase of replications during rebalance.

All the replications are grouped with corresponding takeovers
according to the vbucket id. We call each such group "vbucket move".

During rebalance we schedule replication backfills in the same way we
do it with takeovers. Though there are several additional
constraints. It does not make any sense to start replication from some
node if the vbucket has not yet been transferred to this node. This
means that we need to add some notion of dependent moves. To simplify
this we do the following:

  1. if replication source node was not in the old replication chain
     then we do a backfill from new master node; for such replications
     we need to wait for master move completion;
  2. if replication source node was in the old replication chain then
     we do a backfill from this node;

After backfill is completed, ordinary replication is started. As
described above the source node here can be different from the
backfill source.
