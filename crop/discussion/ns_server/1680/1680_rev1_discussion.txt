Patch Set 1:

I like the idea of doing that at UI side very much. How about stripping port only if it's not default (8080) ? That would be even greater.

Patch Set 1:

I thought about doing that, but I was not sure if port settings will be clusterwide or per server.  I think they SHOULD be clusterwide like other ports, in which case it would be visible under settings in the UI.

Oh, and the reason James filed the bug in the first place is that he was looking at this list as the thing to point memcachetest to.  From that perspective, there are multiple ports.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

our gen_cluster_scripts thing does different ports per node. Anyway, we can do it in different commit.
