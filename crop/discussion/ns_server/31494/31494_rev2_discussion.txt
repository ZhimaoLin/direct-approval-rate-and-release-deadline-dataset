Patch Set 2:

This is a backdoor. I'm not sure that this is a right thing to do. If we want this for testing-development purposes my be we should do it via build system. So you will need to set the env variable and rebuild ns_server in order to get enterprise edition

Patch Set 2:

Please define backdoor.

In my understanding backdoor allows you to bypass auth. In this case we give folks ability to bypass enterprise-ness limits. Which they _already_ can bypass easily. For example by simply downloading enterprise version.
