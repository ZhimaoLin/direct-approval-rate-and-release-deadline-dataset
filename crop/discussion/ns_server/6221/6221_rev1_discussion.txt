Patch Set 1: Verified

Tested in IE 7, 8, 9, Firefox 4, Safari 5, and Chrome 11. 

Chrome 11 does have an nth-child with sub-selector issue that can cause the wrong td's to get the background color, but it corrects the selection on click. I attempted some workarounds, but didn't find one to remove the issue. Chrome updates frequently enough, that I'm not sure it's worth hunting down.
