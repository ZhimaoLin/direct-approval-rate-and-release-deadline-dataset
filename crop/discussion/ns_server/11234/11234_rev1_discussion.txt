DESCRIPTION

fixed data path validation and made it 1.7-compatible. MB-4465

First problem was broken validation where it was possible to screw
things up by POSTing nothing.

Second problem was that changing data path parameter from path to
db_path was not backwards-compatible, so we revert that and make
index_path be equal to data path if index_path is not in POST
parameters.
