DESCRIPTION

don't access mnesia directly in menelaus alerts service.MB-3866

We've seen some issues where archiver is stuck inside mnesia. In one
of such cases I've seen error from alerts service trying to access
stats table too early. My guess is that it might affect this case. By
accessing stats through stats reader we make sure that we don't try
accessing those tables too early.

Positive side effect of this change is that we fetch all stats once
without continuously re-fetching them in alerts checking code.
