Patch Set 1:

To keep folks aware. We discovered that mlockall makes nearly any mapped page, be actually present. By looking at smaps file  in proc filesystem Aliaksey found that apparently thread stacks and unused .text pages of libs are all present in memory.

So memory usage of just started up node was 200 megs more than usual.

Which is why we're not sure anymore we want this in it's exact form

comment on patch itself:

We know it won't work on Windows. And we don't care about BSDs and OSX. So some sort of #if needs to be added to Makefile to avoid trying to build this stuff on uninteresting oses.
