DESCRIPTION

MB-14264 Filter out unsafe response headers from goxdcr.

Sometimes goxdcr uses chunked encoding for its responses. So we would
pass "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" to the client while not actually
sending the response in chunked encoding. With this change we just let
mochiweb itself decide what the content length and transfer encoding of
the response are.
