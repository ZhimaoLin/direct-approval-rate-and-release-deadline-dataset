DESCRIPTION

MB-18775, MB-17571: default index and fts mem quota to 512 MB

Fixing both of these issues with the following strategy:
1) KV mem quota is unchanged (60% of max avail memory on the machine
   of 256 MB whichever is higher)
2) Index quota is suggested at 512 MB by default (min of 256 MB)
3) FTS quota is suggested at 512 if there's space left after the
   allocation to KV (min of 256)
