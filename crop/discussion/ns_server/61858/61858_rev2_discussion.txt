DESCRIPTION

MB-18775, MB-17571: default index and fts mem quota to 512 MB

Fixing both of these issues with the following strategy:
1) KV mem quota is unchanged (60% of max avail memory on the machine
   of 256 MB whichever is higher)
2) Index quota is suggested at 512 MB by default (min of 256 MB)
3) FTS quota default limits at 512 MB but it otherwise calculated
   as it is today (20% of the available after the KV quota is
   subtracted maxing out at 512.) For reference, in deployments
   where the max available memory is > 7 GB the 512 limit for
   default FTS quota will be hit.

Of course these are just defaults and the user is free to adjust
them as he or she sees fit. The problem remains that in deployments
with very little available memory (< 2 GB) the suggested defaults
will sum to greater than available memory. But because this is
an unusual situation these days, I figure it's easiest to simply
let this be.

Patch Set 2:

Somebody mentioned to me that docker defaults to 1GiB of RAM. Since it's the current *cool thing*, it might not be so unusual. But the change is fine with me.

Thanks Aliaksey.

Let hold on the merge. I'll send a note to PM and try and get final confirmation that they're OK with this approach. I'll explicitly bring up the docker thing.
