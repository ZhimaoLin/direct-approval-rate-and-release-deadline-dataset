DESCRIPTION

make sure autocompaction form validation is enabled at right time

Previously it was possible to enable it before form is actually
set. Because inside AutoCompactionSection#fillSettingsForm we have
call to Cell#getValue that may be satisfy it's body later.

So as a treatment we do it in continuation passing style where
formValidationEnabled cell is set in function that's called when
fillSettingsForm is done.
