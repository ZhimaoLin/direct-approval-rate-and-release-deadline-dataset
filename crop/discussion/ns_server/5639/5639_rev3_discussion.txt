I wouldn't normally upload without fixing. But in _this_ case I don't know what to fix.

Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I dont think there is an elegant solution to dynamically disabling links, if they dont link anywhere then they shouldnt be links, so ultimately this needs to be fixed in the renderer, but this is a quick solution that works, so putting it through for now
