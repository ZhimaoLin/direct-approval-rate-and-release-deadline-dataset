DESCRIPTION

MB-10953 Fix certificate validation with R16.

There used to be a bug in both R14 and R15 that effectively made our
verify_fun behave in the same way default verify_fun behaves. See
https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/25b2354cc9bcf09c87dc65526936e976fe95d3fd
for details.

When this got fixed in R16, our certificate validation stopped
working. This is because apparently {bad_cert, selfsigned_peer} is
never returned to us because we add the certificate to cacerts. So
basically erlang is able to perform the validation itself without any
additional tweaks.

I left a custom verify_fun in place just for the sake of logging.
