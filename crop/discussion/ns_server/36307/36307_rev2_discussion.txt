DESCRIPTION

MB-10953 Fix certificate validation with R16.

There used to be a bug in both R14 and R15 that resulted in valid and
valid_peer events not being passed to verification function. See
https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/25b2354cc9bcf09c87dc65526936e976fe95d3fd
for details.

When this got fixed in R16, our certificate validation stopped
working. So I added handling of valid and valid_peer.
