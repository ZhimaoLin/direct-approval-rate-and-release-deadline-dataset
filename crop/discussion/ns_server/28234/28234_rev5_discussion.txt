DESCRIPTION

MB-8828: better error handling in XMem mode XDCR

Today if XMem replicator received some error msgs which
it did not expect to see, it would crash. This behavior is
inherited from CAPI mode XDCR. For XMem mode, we should be
able to do better than that since now we send requests
to remote on a per-mutation basis. Instead of crashing
replicator, this commit will absorb and dump error msgs
from remote memacached into logs.

It looks like step into right direction, but doesn't really fix anything.

This is just part of fix, and is not meant to fix any ENOMEM errors from memcached (Mike is working on that)

Patch Set 5:

Note that I am fixing the problem that xdcr should not have received enomem when it did. You may still want to find a way to handle enomem more gracefully since if the server really is out of memory then you will see this error code.
