DESCRIPTION

MB-8828: better error handling in XMem mode XDCR

Today if XMem received some error msgs which it does not
expect to see, it would simply crash. This behavior is
inherited from CAPI mode XDCR. For XMem mode, we should be
able to do better than that since now we send requests
to remote on a per-mutation basis. Instead of crashing
replicator, this commit will absorb and dump error msgs
from remote memacached into logs.
