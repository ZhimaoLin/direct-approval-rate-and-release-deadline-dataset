DESCRIPTION

MB-5307 Rename subtype to original_target.

It seems to make more sense. The value of this status field indicates
the original target of compactions. For instance, database compaction
can be triggered directly (by user) of as a result of bucket
compaction (schedule or triggered by user as well). So the value
allows to distinguish these cases.
