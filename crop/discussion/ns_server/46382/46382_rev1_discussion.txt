DESCRIPTION

MB-13247: Search in /usr/lib before our shipped libs

There was a problem with libsqlite3.dylib that is installed
by default on macosx with an incompatible version with the
libsqlite3.dylib being built from the sqlite homepage.
libsqlite3.dylib is referenced from:
otool -L /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreData.framework/Versions/A/CoreData
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreData.framework/Versions/A/CoreData:
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreData.framework/Versions/A/CoreData (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 526.1.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 57031.10.6)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation (compatibility version 300.0.0, current version 1152.12.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1152.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libsqlite3.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current version 168.0.0)
By searching /usr/lib _before_ our shipped version we'll avoid such
problems in the future.
