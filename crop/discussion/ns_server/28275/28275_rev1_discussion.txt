DESCRIPTION

MB-8495 Increase docs_total estimate when docs_left increases.

It does not fix the root cause of the referenced bug. There we just
happened to see CHECKPOINT_START/CHECKPOINT_END messages. But since
it still seems to be possible to hit the same issue when there're
mutations going on during rebalance, I decided to make this fix.
