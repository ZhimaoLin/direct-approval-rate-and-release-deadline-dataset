DESCRIPTION

MB-10254 Use latest timestamp to pick the value that looks newer.

vclock:likely_newer considers only common part of vclocks to decide if
one of them is newer than the other one. Hence, instance vclock has no
effect. Which can cause newer value to be overwritten by the older
one (when node is first removed and then added back to cluster).
