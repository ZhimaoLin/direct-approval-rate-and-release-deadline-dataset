DESCRIPTION

clean up cbui-components.css

* Revised code formatting, comments.
* Removed vendor prefixes.
* Removed unused styles.
* Re-named “currentNav” style (tried to use “current-nav” to fit the
css convention, but that threw JS errors for the “-“).
* Moved ellipsis to base.css & also removed vendor prefixes from
responsive.css.
