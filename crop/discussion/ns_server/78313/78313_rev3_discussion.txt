DESCRIPTION

clean up cbui-components.css

Revised code formatting, comments.
Removed vendor prefixes.
Removed unused styles.
Re-named “currentNav” style (tried to use “current-nav” to fit the css convention, but that threw JS errors for the “-“).
Moved ellipsis to base.css & also removed vendor prefixes from responsive.css.
