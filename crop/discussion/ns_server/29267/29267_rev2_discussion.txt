DESCRIPTION

MB-3186 use server time zone for timestamps of log entries

backward compatibility story :

- after the ns_log file is unzipped all entries will
  be upgraded to the new format
- if the pre 3.0 node will send do_log to 3.0 node
  the log entry will be upgraded and time zone
  of the receiving node will be used
- 3.0 node will strip server_time from the log
  entries when it sends do_log to pre 3.0 nodes
