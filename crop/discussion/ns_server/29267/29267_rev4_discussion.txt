DESCRIPTION

MB-3186 use server time zone for timestamps of log entries

backward compatibility story :

- after the ns_log file is unzipped all entries will
  be upgraded to the new format
- if the pre 3.0 node will send do_log or sync to 3.0 node
  the log entries will be upgraded and time zone
  of the receiving node will be used
- 3.0 node will strip server_time from the log
  entries when it sends do_log or sync to pre 3.0 nodes

Patch Set 4:

I'm somewhat concerned by complexity of this w.r.t. benefit. But looks correct. Will check backwards compat together with my stuff

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

two minor things:

* we strongly prefer camelCase for field names. Not underscored_fields

* hooks.js needs to be updated for new expected field
