Patch Set 1:

I'd prefer != 'unhealthy'. Because warmup is kind of bug for nodes that are simply not part of cluster and are not doing any warmup at all.

And there are lots of places around the code that are treating != 'healthy' as down. There's related bug about node counts (and badges color) on overview.
