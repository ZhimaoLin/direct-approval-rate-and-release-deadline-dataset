Line:230, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Suggest match against anything rather than 'memcached'. 

If the bucket type isn't defined, well, things will blow up badly elsewhere, but I don't think it's the job of this code to assert on it. 

If the bucket type is something else - that's fine - those buckets won't get this stuff until someone adds that type to the case statement.

It you think otherwise let me know.

Line:163, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> same comment here

Line:230, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Since we are reading the type from the bucket config (it has to be present in the bucket config) I thought of checking the type explicitly. When newer types are added this will prompt us to take care of them instead of silently ignoring them.

Line:230, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Yes I understand that. If we add a new bucket type though, we're clearly going to look at all places that call bucket_type() and we'll find this code no problem. Once we've done that, there's a chance that this code will not have to change - if the new bucket type doesn't need the CAPI stuff. With the current implementation, this code will have to change regardless, at which point we'll probably insert an arbitrary match rather than exhaustively check all the possibilities.

It's a minor point, so I won't press it. But I do prefer the arbitrary match. 

And, as I mentioned, if we're going to put an assert in somewhere that all buckets have a valid type, that's fine. I just don't think it's the responsibility of this code that adds the CAPI stuff to the REST API response.
