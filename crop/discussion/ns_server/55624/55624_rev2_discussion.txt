Patch Set 2:

This complexity was there for historical reasons. I don't remember all the details. But basically initially initargs had just the result of init:get_arguments(). The latter returns something like this:

[...
 {ns_server,["enable_mlockall","false","error_logger_mf_dir",
             "\"logs/n_0\"","dont_suppress_stderr_logger","true",
             "path_config_etcdir","\"priv\"","path_config_bindir",
             "\"/home/shaleny/dev/membase/repo30/install/bin\"",
             "path_config_libdir",
             "\"/home/shaleny/dev/membase/repo30/install/lib\"",
             "path_config_datadir",
             "\"/home/shaleny/dev/membase/repo30/ns_server/data/n_0\"",
             "path_config_tmpdir",
             "\"/home/shaleny/dev/membase/repo30/ns_server/tmp\"",
             "path_config_secdir",
             "\"/home/shaleny/dev/membase/repo30/install/etc/security\"",
             "path_audit_log","\"logs/n_0\"","rest_port","9000",
             "query_port","9499","ssl_query_port","19499",
             "projector_port","10000","ssl_rest_port","19000",
             "capi_port","9500","ssl_capi_port","19500","memcached_port",
             "12000","moxi_port","12001","memcached_dedicated_port",
             "11999","ssl_proxy_downstream_port","11998",
             "ssl_proxy_upstream_port","11997","memcached_ssl_port",
             "11996","nodefile",
             "\"/home/shaleny/dev/membase/repo30/ns_server/data/n_0/nodefile\"",
             "short_name","\"n_0\"","xdcr_rest_port","13000",
             "indexer_admin_port","9100","indexer_scan_port","9101",
             "indexer_http_port","9102","indexer_stinit_port","9103",
             "indexer_stcatchup_port","9104","indexer_stmaint_port",
             "9105","rename_ip","\"10.17.0.202\""]}
 ...]


So that's why the parsing of the terms was in dump-guts in the first place. Then we stopped passing all these command line options because there was some escaping bug in erlang on windows. So all these things are passed in environment variable and do not appear in get_arguments() output. That's why I added application environments to initargs. But I wasn't smart enough to realize that with my changes things could be simplified.
