DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Don't use connection timeout in capi_replication.

Connection timeout is a parameter for outgoing
replications. capi_replication handles incoming replications. So I
don't see why it should be used there. Given that only a log message
is emitted when this "timeout" is exceeded, I think it's enough to use
a sufficiently large constant.

Patch Set 2:

Yes, it's impossible to change it at runtime. But it's already impossible to do so without interfering with outgoing replications. This parameter is used completely outside of its scope. And I highly doubt that anyone would want to change at runtime how often we dump messages the user is not even aware of.
