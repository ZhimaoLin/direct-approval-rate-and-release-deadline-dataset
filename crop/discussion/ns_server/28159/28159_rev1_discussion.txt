DESCRIPTION

MB-100 Don't use connection timeout in capi_replication.

Connection timeout is a parameter for outgoing
replications. capi_replication handles incoming replications. So I
don't see why it should be used there. Given that only a log message
is emitted when this "timeout" is exceeded, I think it's enough to use
a sufficiently large constant.

This would basically prohibit users from changing the parameter at runtime, right?
