DESCRIPTION

WIP: Rebalancing TNG

While this currently can produce a valid map that has no more than the
given number of nodes replicating from any given node and a reasonably
small number of moves, the map will be slightly unbalanced because
solutions that are "nearby" the balanced solution we're trying to
reach before we backtrack aren't themselves balanced.
