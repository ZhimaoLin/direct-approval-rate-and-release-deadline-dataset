DESCRIPTION

WIP: Rebalancing TNG

We use backtracking search to find a map that satisfies all
constraints (number of replication relationships among nodes, equal
number of vbuckets replicated per master/slave pair, equal number of
vbuckets at each position in the replication on each node) while
attempting to minimize the number of changes.
