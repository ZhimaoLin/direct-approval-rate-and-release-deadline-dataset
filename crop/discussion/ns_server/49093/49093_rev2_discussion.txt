DESCRIPTION

removed filtering of form fields during the serialization

it was introduced for xdcr create replication UI, because old style
xdcr and goxdcr versions of this API have different set of fields

It appears that both old and new apis tolerate unrecognized parameters,
so we can safely delete this hack

the correct thing to do, though will be to create 2 different forms
for the old and new xdcr
