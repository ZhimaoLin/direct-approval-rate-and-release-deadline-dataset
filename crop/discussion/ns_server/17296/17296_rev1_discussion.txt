DESCRIPTION

wip:MB-5579: made phone home send it's stuff via POST

JSONP cannot be used to deliver large amounts of stuff. Instead we're
POSTing stuff via hidden iframe's form submit, and we're getting
information about new versions by doing short JSONP GET.

Update notifications UI is also refactored a bit to do be more
cellfull. Particularly it now draws nice spinner when it's fetching
updates data.

As can be seen in fake-phone-home script. POSTed data is still json,
that's sent as stats field that's traditional form url-encoding.

It's possible to match POST & GET by looking at query string parameter
launchID that's unique identifier of phone home call. Both GET & POST
will have this query string parameter and it will be same.

GET now only sends launchID as described above and version. I assume
that should be enough to send back something meaningful. In worst case
server-side implementation of GET can wait until POST is received and
extract any additional info it may need from there, then wake up GET
request and make it reply something.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

-1-ing because it needs phone home server-side update (and url update as well).

Dustin & Steve I need your input if proposed change is fine for you.
