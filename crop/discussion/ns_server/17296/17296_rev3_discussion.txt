DESCRIPTION

MB-5579:fp: made phone home send it's stuff via POST

JSONP cannot be used to deliver large amounts of stuff. Instead we're
POSTing stuff via hidden iframe's form submit, and we're getting
information about new versions by doing short JSONP GET.

Update notifications UI is also refactored a bit to do be more
cellfull. Particularly it now draws nice spinner when it's fetching
updates data.

As can be seen in fake-phone-home script. POSTed data is still json,
that's sent as "stats" field that's traditional form
url-encoding. That should be same as before, just uses POST instead of
GET.

It's possible to match POST & GET by looking at query string parameter
launchID that's unique identifier of phone home call. _Both_ GET &
POST will have this query string parameter and it will be
same. launchID as can be seen in code is built as concatenation of
cluster's uuid, current epoch milliseconds and random 16-bit value. So
not only it's unique, but even if we lost POST we can at least count
distinct clusters in the wild (who agreed to send phone home stats).

GET now only sends launchID as described above and version. I assume
that should be enough to send back something meaningful. In worst case
server-side implementation of GET can wait until POST is received and
extract any additional info it may need from there, then wake up GET
request and make it reply something.
