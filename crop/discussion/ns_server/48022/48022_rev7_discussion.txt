DESCRIPTION

MB-13422 upgrade from erlang xdcr to goxdcr

happens automatically when cluster becomes 4.0
if the upgrade fails the cluster will stay 3.0 until rebalance
is done again

open issues:
- need to disable POST/DELETE xdcr rest api's for the duration of
  the upgrade
- need to wait for documants to be synchronized across the cluster
  before starting the upgrade
