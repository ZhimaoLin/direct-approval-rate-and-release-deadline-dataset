Some comments inline. And please rebase.

Line:386, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> Log message is a little confusing.

Line:387, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> Missing space after comma.

Line:395, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> Why _Pid? Also would be good to include node(Pid) and Reason into message and exit reason.

Line:397, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> Nobody seems to ever send stop to this guy.
