Line:586, src/Harley Martinitor_agent.erl -> Since link is symmetrical, this also means that these processes will get killed if rebalancer dies. This is probably harmless, but I'd prefer one-way monitoring: it's easier to reason about.

Line:591, src/Harley Martinitor_agent.erl -> Since we expect only the rebalancer make these calls, let's wrap the call into {if_rebalance...

Line:591, src/Harley Martinitor_agent.erl -> Sorry for the long response. Look at the handle_call({if_rebalance, ...

Line:591, src/Harley Martinitor_agent.erl -> I have tried this and it does not work. I get an error saying that the expected Rebalancer Pid is undefined.
If I understand things right the rebalance pid is only sent to Harley Martinitor_agent by rebalance_topology_aware_service.
Anyway it does not seem very useful to add if_rebalance here since it just returns the terse_bucket_info_uploader pid, so there is no bad effect that we need to protect against.
