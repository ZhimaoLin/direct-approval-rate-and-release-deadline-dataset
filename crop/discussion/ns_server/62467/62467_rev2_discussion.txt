Patch Set 2:

I don't particularly like parsing the payload to extract a revision. But more generally, it should be the rebalancer process itself initiating this behavior. For example, it can link to/monitor uploader processes. The way you wrote it makes it harder to change the behavior in future, if needed.

One more "good to have" thing, since we're touching this area. Would be good to make sure that all nodes uploaded the most up to date config to memcached after rebalance is completed.

Do You think it will be useful to have the revisions logged?
In that case I'll change bucket_info_cache to return the revision separately.

Good idea, I'll look into it.

Yes, that would probably be useful. But this can be done in a separate change.
