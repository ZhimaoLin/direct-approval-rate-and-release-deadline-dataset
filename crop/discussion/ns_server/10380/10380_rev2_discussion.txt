Patch Set 2:

Currently this exposes a bug in CAPI

DELETE /default/test
{"ok":true,"id":"test","rev":"5-0cdbd29bde684be50000000000000000"}

GET /default/_all_docs
{"total_rows":1,"rows":[
{"id":"test","key":"test","value":{"rev":"4-270b890d284168460000002b00000000"}}
]}

however that is a seperate issue (and if I remember correctly already known / fix planned?)

Patch Set 2:

That's a known issue. A delete_with_meta command needed here but it's not implemented yet on ep-engine side.

Patch Set 2: (6 inline comments)

started reviewing. Added some comments inline.

Then tried it. Not happy with how it works at all.


* still no filter in docs list (ok if later)

* broken url escaping. Creating document named asd&asd does not work
   at all. (!)

* saving doc with attachment (non-json value) is losing attachment (!)

* pagination is not integrated with back button. This is inconsistend
   with views

* (shared by views) prev/next buttons disabledness still changes arrow
   collor under mousover. Leading to wrong impression of clickability.

* should we limit page number as we do in views? Because skip=N with large N
   is going to be expensive.

* lacks any indication of loading. Does not handle node going down at all.

* ask: losing unsaved edits when autologout hits (should apply to
   map/reduce editors too)

* ask: edits of special fields are simply ignored and not even reverted

* ask: whats the point of this modal dialog box "Saved Document" ?

* ask: different indentations in JSONified document and new lines by editor

* ask: how do I refresh list of documents ?

* ask: so what we've desided with sections menu and breadcrumbs. Shoud
   documents be visible in that menu ?

* raise issue if actually creating document when pressing create
   button is logical. I'd say it's not.

* do something with excessive use of modal dialog boxes in doc editing

Line:45, priv/public/js/views.js -> non-camel-cased names are forbidden in JS in this project

Line:67, priv/public/js/views.js -> this entire file change is independed commit. Makes sense to separate it and merge independently

Line:67, priv/public/js/documents.js -> this bunch of cut&pasted code with broken escaping is _asking_ us to separate it into it's own semantically named function.

Line:101, priv/public/js/documents.js -> While such out-of-bands passing of cell value to subscribe callback bellow works, it really sticks badly.

Line:117, priv/public/js/documents.js -> implicitly relying in changeable variables inside cell formula is broken. It requires external magic to trigger recomputation when variable is changed externally.

Line:236, priv/public/js/documents.js -> what's the point ?
