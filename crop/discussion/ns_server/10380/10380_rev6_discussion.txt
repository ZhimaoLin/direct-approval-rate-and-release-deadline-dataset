Patch Set 6: Fails

(3 inline comments)

You're breaking cells rules many times. And that back-stubs you.

First rules of cells are:

* never do anything side-effectful (except logging) in cell formulas. Soon or later someobody will get hurt. You're doing it many times. Most ugly is drawing loading indicator. But others are setting of self.bucketName and other similar cases.

* it's ok to depend on 'final' variables. But not fine to depend on non-final (i.e. changeable) variables. You're doing it with page number and it kicks you back in the butt.

Line:125, priv/public/js/documents.js -> why not just make currentPage a cell, so that you don't have to explicitly refresh stuff. That's what Cells for. Just change value, and everything that depends on it will automatically refresh.

Also this code fails to work. typeof cell.value is never a number.

Line:137, priv/public/js/documents.js -> x is not used

Line:143, priv/public/js/documents.js -> Breaks on empty result set?

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Line:259, priv/public/js/documents.js -> won't work very well with slow network and lots of fast clicks to save

Line:277, priv/public/js/documents.js -> I think we should restore all original $ and _ prefixed attributes. That would be fully right and future-proof

Line:279, priv/public/js/documents.js -> Another disappointing broken escaping.

When people will learn that: "you cannot build urls this way" !?!?!?!

hint: we have a nice helper(s)

Line:399, priv/public/js/documents.js -> BTW, I think this code organization makes debugging things harder. Because lots of variables are hidden far away from debugger
