DESCRIPTION

flush all mb_master send_heartbeat messages when handling them

So that if we're not fast enough to consume them at normal rate we
don't overflow our mailbox. And because sending two or more hearbeats
in close succession simply makes no sense.

Line:124, src/mb_master.erl -> If misc:flush() returned counts of flushed msgs, this couldd be an interesting stat to graph to know how backed up things are getting.
