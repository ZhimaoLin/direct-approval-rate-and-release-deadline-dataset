DESCRIPTION

MB-16451: introduce mnPermissions

there is new global property called rbac, it's advertised via
rootScope so anyone can access the property

So the access to the permissions in the template looks like this now:
<div ng-if="rbac.cluster.bucket[bucket.name].settings.write && rbac.cluster.indexes.read === false"></div>

We can use any angular directive in conjunction with the rbac property:
<div ng-class="{dynamic_disabled: rbac.cluster.indexes.read}"></div>
<div ng-show="rbac.cluster.indexes.read"></div>
<div ng-hide="!rbac.cluster.indexes.read"></div>
<button ng-disabled="rbac.cluster.indexes.read"></button>

Folks should use provider in order to add some additiona
property for the check:
mnPermissionsProvider.set("cluster.extra!permission")

There is one important thing, in order to access rbac in isolated
scope we should pass it via directive attribute
<isolated-directive rbac="rbac"></isolated-directive>
var isolatedDirective = {
   scope: {
      rbac: "="
   }
}

Patch Set 6: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

I'm not totally crazy about folks pre-declaring their interest in a given permission. But overall I think it's ok and I'll let it go.

Actually I'm going to hold off approving this until the "all" bucket issue is resolved.

Line:101, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_permissions.js -> This code is a problem actually as there's no way to distinguish between the "all" bucket and a bucket that is actually called "all".

Line:101, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_permissions.js -> Currently we don't have to distinguish between those two cases because
bucket[all] has only one permission "create" and bucket['all'] doesn't have that permission, so they do not intersect.
