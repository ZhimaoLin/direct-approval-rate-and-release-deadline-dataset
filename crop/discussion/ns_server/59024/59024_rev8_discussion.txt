DESCRIPTION

MB-16451: introduce mnPermissions

there is new global property called rbac, it's advertised via
rootScope so anyone can access the property

So the access to the permissions in the template looks like this now:
<div ng-if="rbac.cluster.bucket[bucket.name].settings.write && rbac.cluster.indexes.read === false"></div>

We can use any angular directive in conjunction with the rbac property:
<div ng-class="{dynamic_disabled: rbac.cluster.indexes.read}"></div>
<div ng-show="rbac.cluster.indexes.read"></div>
<div ng-hide="!rbac.cluster.indexes.read"></div>
<button ng-disabled="rbac.cluster.indexes.read"></button>

Folks should use provider in order to add some additiona
property for the check:
mnPermissionsProvider.set("cluster.extra!permission")

There is one important thing, in order to access rbac in isolated
scope we should pass it via directive attribute
<isolated-directive rbac="rbac"></isolated-directive>
var isolatedDirective = {
   scope: {
      rbac: "="
   }
}
