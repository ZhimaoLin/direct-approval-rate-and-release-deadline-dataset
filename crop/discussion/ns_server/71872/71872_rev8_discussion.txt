What is the reason for restricting raw IPv6 addresses?

Line:145, src/ns_cluster.erl -> How "[" might get here?

Patch Set 8:

The reasoning from end user point of view was that IPv6 addresses are cumbersome enough that they are hard to remember. So it's reasonable to use FQDNs instead.

With raw IPv6 addresses, validation/parsing was a lot harder in ns_server. Hence I thought of restricting them in the first cut. As a next step, I am looking at accepting them as this would help our QA folks while testing (they don't have to assign FQDNs to their test machines).

Can you create ticket for allowing raw ipv6, so it doesn't slip through the cracks. Also please address inline comments here and in other commits

Opened a ticket (MB-26257) to track the work needed to accept raw IPv6 addresses.

Line:145, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Typically when the user wants to present the IPv6 address and port number, the address will be enclosed in "[" and "]" brackets. Like so - "[::1]:9000". If not, differentiating the port number from the IP address will be difficult.

This can happen when the user is adding a node and provides an IPv6 address instead of an FQDN.

Line:145, src/ns_cluster.erl -> change_address is called only from 1 place: menelaus_web:handle_node_rename. We do not explicitly rename nodes to ip addresses. 

Adjusting node address when node is added to the cluster triggered from do_engage_cluster_inner_tail which calls do_change_address directly, not change_address

Line:145, src/ns_cluster.erl -> During the cluster initialization via the wizard, if the user supplies an IPv6 address then handle_node_rename will be called. Hence the check in change_address.
