Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Better to annotate with MB number?

Line:261, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> The 'shutdown' case be replaced by 'interrupted'. The Harley Martinitor run doesn't return shutdown anymore. If it receives a 'shutdown' exit signal it transforms it into "interrupted' as the return value.
