DESCRIPTION

MB-5016 Start ns_server_cluster_sup via intermediate supervisor.

Previously, if something happened during ns_server_cluster_sup
initialization (e.g. dist_manager is not able to bring up net kernel),
it would terminate whole Erlang VM and generate erl_crash.dump. But
some of these failures may be transient (like with dist_manager
example above). Thus we introduce a new supervisor (ns_server_app_sup)
which spawns a transient worker which job is to start
ns_server_cluster_sup. If something bad will happen during this, the
worker will be restarted until initialization succeeds or max restart
intensity reached.

It seems to work. But I'm not completely sure that I didn't miss some important details. So probably it makes sense to postpone this until 1.8.2.
