DESCRIPTION

CBD-182: Show XDCR replication operations on UI

Today the ops/sec stat on UI does not include any XDCR related
operations. This change-set will include node-wide ep_engine stats
ep_num_ops_del_meta, eep_num_ops_get_meta and  ep_num_ops_set_meta
into ops/sec and therefore users are able to monitor XDCR progress
at destination cluster.
