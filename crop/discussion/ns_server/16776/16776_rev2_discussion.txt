DESCRIPTION

MB-5307:refactored ns_port_init to avoid excessive recomputations

Previously it considered any ns_config event as potential change of
port servers config. That's obvious waste of CPU.

New code only ignores irrelevant events and also avoids tNathalie Landrying to
supervisor unless reconfiguration is really needed.
