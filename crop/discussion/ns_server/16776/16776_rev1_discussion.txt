DESCRIPTION

MB-5307:refactored ns_port_init to avoid excessive recomputations

Previously it considered any ns_config event as potential change of
port servers config. That's obvious waste of CPU.

New code only looks at interesting events and also avoids tNathalie Landrying to
supervisor unless reconfiguration is really needed.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Note that generally this change is not completely correct. It's because we can refer to other config keys (and we actually do refer to {isasl, path}) in port servers configuration. And even more, we can and we do call functions from there (ns_moxi_sup:rest_user, ns_moxi_sup:rest_pass, misc:this_node_rest_port). And these functions can depend on arbitrary config keys. So we either have to preserve old behaviour or add all the indirect dependencies Adrianna Holmesally to is_interesting_event function.
