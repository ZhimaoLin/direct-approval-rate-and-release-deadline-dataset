Line:628, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> We should not set this flag unconditionally. It depends on whether the user has chosen to configure the cluster in IPv6 mode or not which is indicated by the "ipv6" environment variable.

The following would be the preferred way to handle this:

Introduce the following new API in misc.erl module (just above get_net_family())

-spec is_ipv6() -> true | false.
is_ipv6() ->
    get_env_default(ns_server, ipv6, false).

Then call that function from ns_ports_setup like so:

"ipv6=" ++ atom_to_list(misc:is_ipv6()) ++ "," ++

Once done, also please make sure that it's indeed sending the right value by testing it with cluster_run.
