DESCRIPTION

Set couch_replicator connnection timeout

The default timeout was too small and was causing the xdcr source to
retry requests too frequently. If the destination was already busy
servicing the original request, resending requests frequently would
make it worse.

The new value is 5 mins. Not sure if this is too conservative but if
it turns out to be so, it can be changed later or made an environment
variable.
