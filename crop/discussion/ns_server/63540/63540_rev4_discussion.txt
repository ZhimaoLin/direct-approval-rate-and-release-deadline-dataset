DESCRIPTION

MB-18530: erl: ability to truncate log messages

it could be useful to keep full error messages in database
(maybe for collect logs) but we still need to truncate the errors for UI
because some of those errors could be so big that the logs tab becomes
nearly unresponsive and loses its usability. (e.g. angular 10 digest
iteration error). Additionally we may have some very long errors not
from UI.
