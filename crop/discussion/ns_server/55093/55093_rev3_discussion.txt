DESCRIPTION

MB-12222: refactoring of mnHttp

This change brings possibility to attach each
pending query to the scope or even attach group of queries
which belong to the specific promise like when we doing
$q.all([query1, query2, query3]).

By the logic each query should be marked as either isAttachedToScope
or doesNotBelongToScope. That logic gives us ability to avoid passing
of the scope through stack of calls from controller to mnHttp, but
at the same time it forces us to add those flags to each call using
mnPromiseHelper or mnPoll. Also this change contains code style in
accordance with new style guide.
