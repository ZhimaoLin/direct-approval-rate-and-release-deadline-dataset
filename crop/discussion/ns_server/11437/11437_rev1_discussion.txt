DESCRIPTION

don't crash entire node when replicator docs replication fails

Even though we're creating async couch replications in
xdc_rdoc_replication_srv:start_replication/1 it seems to depend on
being able to reach target node. So start_replication can fail, and
previously it could bring entire node down, because that's failure in
init function.

By signalling supervisor "I'm ready" before starting replication we
solve this problem. Now if/when start_replication fails it's not
treated as init failure anymore and xdc_rdoc_replication_srv is merely
restarted.

Line:42, src/xdc_rdoc_replication_srv.erl -> The gen_server:enter_loop() documentation says the process must have been started using one of the start functions in proc_lib. Here, though, we start the process using gen_server:start_link().

Is this fine?

Superseded by http://review.couchbase.org/#change,11447 change.

Line:42, src/xdc_rdoc_replication_srv.erl -> gen_server:start_link uses proc_lib:start_link internally.
