Patch Set 1: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

See inline comment.

Line:470, priv/public/js/app.js -> I find $i('#secure-password-verify').val(); clearer.
But I'm actually not sure about this commit at all. I don't think we need more speed in here (or was it a problem). I found the old code clearer and easier to understand. IMHO: easier to understand code > micro optimisation where not necessarily needed

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

speed here is definitely not a problem. And I agree that $('#that-id') is clearer and more idiomatic. Debating such a minor detail is not important, though. So I'm approving it.
