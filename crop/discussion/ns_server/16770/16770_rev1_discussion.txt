DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: support slow network simulation for cluster_run

This is quite obviously linux-only. And requires quite recent iproute
tools and reasonably recent kernel.

First part of commit allows ./cluster_run to prepend something to
arglist.

This allows for command lines like this:

./cluster_run -n4 --prepend-extras ./scripts/run_in_ns.rb

Second part is run_in_ns script. Which sets up VDE networking with
round-trip delay around 2.4 milliseconds from host to host and
bandwidth limit of 30 megabytes per second. It spawns nodes inside
newly created network namespaces which makes kernel use "full" routing
between erlang nodes (and memcacheds). netns per node also makes
running per-port-moxi possible as netns-es don't intersect
w.r.t. bound ports even on 0.0.0.0.
