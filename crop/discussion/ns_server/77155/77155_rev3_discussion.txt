DESCRIPTION

Fix tasks menu animation when closing the task menu

The task menu is draggable and if you dragged it somewhere
else and closed it then it would close right where it was.
This change makes the close animation collapse back into
the Activity link.

Also removed old vendor prefixing from this section of styles.
