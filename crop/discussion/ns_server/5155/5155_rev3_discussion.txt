DESCRIPTION

Eliminate silly ns_bucket:config/1.

This was a holdover when I thought it was a good idea to hide the
internals of the bucket config structure from the API, but proplists
are pretty standard in Erlang and most calls ignored one or more of
the items in the tuple anyway, so just using the proplist seems
better.
