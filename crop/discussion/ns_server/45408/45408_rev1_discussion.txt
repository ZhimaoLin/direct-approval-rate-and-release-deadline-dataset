DESCRIPTION

MB-9635 server that updates local audit.json if audit config changes

... and notifies memcached that the file needs to be reloaded

note: we use build generated install/etc/security/audit.json only to grab
default values for initializing cluster config. each node has its own configurable
location for audit.json file that will be given to memcached
