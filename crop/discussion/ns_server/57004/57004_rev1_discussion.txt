Line:182, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Well, actually as it turned out before my change needs_rebalance() would return false in case you don't have any buckets and add a new node. The reason nobody complained about it is because we have a code that basically enables rebalance button any time there's non-active node. With this change we don't actually need this special case anymore. That's why I decided to keep it.
