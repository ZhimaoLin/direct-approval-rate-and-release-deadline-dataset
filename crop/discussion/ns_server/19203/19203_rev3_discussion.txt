DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: refactoring code determining concurrent replications

Today when users set max conconcurrent reps env param greater
than number of actual vbuckets, XDCR manager will ignore the
parameter and use the default value of max concurrent reps.
However it does not check if the default value is smaller than
number of vbuckets, which will cause issues when the number of
vbuckets is small. This change-set fixes the bug and re-writes
function max_concurrent_reps() to make it more readable.
