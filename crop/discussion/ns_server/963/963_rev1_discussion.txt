DESCRIPTION

bug 1630 - recheck streaming changes every 5 secs

Theory on why moxi might not listen on port 11211, or have
an outdated vBucketServerMap...

During a Rebalance, ns_server does pull_plug() on many e-processes,
except for good children like menelaus.  So, streaming REST connections
(such as from clients like moxi) stay up and alive.

But, meanwhile, underlying services like ns_config get bounced,
and perhaps events don't get fired, or get lost along the way
to event listeners like menelaus_event.

As a catch-all fix, every 5 seconds, each streaming REST e-process
will wake up and check for diffs in config.  Nothing happens if
the config is the same.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I like the backstory.

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Confirmed that it compiles and passes tests, and that it doesn't cause /pools/default/bucketsStreaming/default to send updates every five seconds when things aren't changing.
