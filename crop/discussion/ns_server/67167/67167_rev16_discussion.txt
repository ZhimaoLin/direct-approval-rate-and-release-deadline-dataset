DESCRIPTION

spock-ui: update look for initialization wizard

The wizard doesn't have the step 6 screen anymore, where the user had
the opportunity to adjust RAM quotas for the services. Instead of that UI
re-uses the serversMemoryQuotaDialog. It allows us to keep the related
code in one place and to follow the DRY rules without loosing of any
functionality.
