DESCRIPTION

MB-18289: Don't aggressively load all angular templates

In testing I observed (as have others) that aggressively downloading
all (or most) of our templates negatively affects initial UI
performance. It takes a bit longer to render the UI since there are approx
100 template files being downloaded and the first couple of screens (the login
and the overview page) just new a handful of templates.

I experimented adding all the templates to the index.min.html file
directly, but this makes the initial download sluggish since you're
still downloading more than you need. So I settled on adding just
the "bootstrap" templates directly to the index.min.html for the
login page and the overview page and leaving everything else
be downloaded on demand as you wNathalie Landry around the UI.

So in this change
* templates-list.js and the script to build it go away
* angularTemplatesList is removed from the code
* bootstrap-templates.txt is added for templates we want
  eagerly downloaded
* the minification script is updated to add the bootstrap
  templates directly into index.min.html
