MB-18289: Don't aggressively load all angular templates

In testing I observed (as have others) that aggressively downloading
all (or most) of our templates negatively affects initial UI
performance. It takes a bit longer to render the UI since there are approx
100 template files being downloaded and the first couple of screens (the login
and the overview page) just new a handful of templates.

I experimented adding all the templates to the index.min.html file
directly, but this makes the initial download sluggish since you're
still downloading more than you need. So I settled on just downloading
no templates eagerly and rather having them be fetched as one wNathalie Landrys around
the UI.
