DESCRIPTION

MB-16821: support enabling of password autocomplete in UI

Disabling autocomplete is controversial. Some folks feel that
requiring users to enter passwords is actually an anti-security practice.
Others feel that the password managers that ship with browsers by default
are not very secure and folks should copy-and-paste from standalone
password protected password managers. Where I think Couchbase should
be is enabling autocomplete is a reasonable configuration option
but that it should be off by default. In the future we can always
change this default.

This change introduces a new config key: ui_disable_autocomplete
which defaults to an application env var of the same name, and
if that's not set defaults to true.

This allows standard configuration via the static_config and
also via an application env var passed during ns_server start.
cluster_run uses the latter, which means that engineers using this
mechanism to start their clusters get autocomplete by default.

The way that this env var is communicated to the browser is via
a new internal REST API _uiEnv.

Patch Set 4:

@Pavel - actually I wanted mnEnv to support an API that lets clients get the environment variables directly (hence the get() method) and the isLoaded() methods and not using the $cacheFactory didn't bother me. But I don't mind removing this stuff either and I do want to get checked in. Will push another patch.
