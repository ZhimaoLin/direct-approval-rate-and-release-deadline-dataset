DESCRIPTION

MB-16821: support enabling of password autocomplete in UI

Disabling autocomplete is controversial. Some folks feel that
requiring users to enter passwords is actually an anti-security practice.
Others feel that the password managers that ship with browsers by default
are not very secure and folks should copy-and-paste from standalone
password protected password managers. Where I think Couchbase should
be is enabling autocomplete is a reasonable configuration option
but that it should be off by default. In the future we can always
change this default.

This change introduces ui_env a global and per-node config
key. The value stored in ui_env is expected to be an unfolded
proplist of key value pairs which is vended to REST API clients
via a new internal REST API, _uiEnv. Per node ui_env overrides
global ui_env which overrides the ui_env application env var,
functioning as the default.

This allows standard configuration via the static_config and
also via an application env var passed during ns_server start.
cluster_run uses the latter, which means that engineers using this
mechanism to start their clusters get autocomplete by default.
