Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Please follow the 'spec' spreadsheet closely.  That is, it should look like...

  cb<verb>-<noun>

So, like cbdump-config

Not "cbdump_config.escript" (which has an underscore instead of a hypen; and a *.escript suffix)

Also, the commit title could just mention it's a cbdump-config script rename.
