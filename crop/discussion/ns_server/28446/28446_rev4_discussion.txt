DESCRIPTION

MB-8911: CAPI side resolution algorithm change for deletion

Since 2.2, ep_engine changes the resolution algorithm for deletion.
To be consistent, CAPI mode replication should also adopt the same
algorithm.

Actually ep_engine will do their resolution in deleteWithMeta(),
here we put another defense line (the second getMeta before writing
doc locally) in CAPI just for safety and performance reasons.

Patch Set 4:

So we have a situation where is_missing_rev may return false positive _and_ false negative ("no I don't need this revision" when in fact I do). Probably minor but I need some more thought here

Patch Set 4:

Not quite sure. As long as the remote mutation is a deletion, we should not use its exp time since it is already "polluted".  Thus we use new algorithm, otherwise we just use current algorithm.

If incoming is an update but local is deletion, we still use current algorithm. The chance to see CAS collision is extremely rare. Anything missing here?

Patch Set 4:

btw, this is consistent with Chiyoung's fix

http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/28398/2/src/ep.cc

The new algorithm only applies to deleteWithMeta().
