DESCRIPTION

MB-8911: CAPI side resolution algorithm change for deletion

Since 2.2, ep_engine changes the resolution algorithm for deletion.
To be consistent, CAPI mode replication should also adopt the same
algorithm.

Actually ep_engine will do their resolution in deleteWithMeta(),
here we put another defense line (the second getMeta before writing
doc locally) in CAPI just for safety and performance reasons.

Patch Set 5:

Here's the same piece of code without unnecessary copy/paste

            {ok, {OurSeqNo, OurRevId}, LocalCAS} ->
                {RemoteMeta, LocalMeta} =
                    case DocDeleted of
                        false ->
                            %% for non-del mutation, compare full metadata
                            {{DocSeqNo, DocRevId}, {OurSeqNo, OurRevId}};
                        _ ->
                            %% for deletion, just compare seqno and CAS to match
                            %% the resolution algorithm in ep_engine:deleteWithMeta
                            <<DocCAS:64, _DocExp:32, _DocFlg:32>> = DocRevId,
                            <<OurCAS:64, _OurExp:32, _OurFlg:32>> = OurRevId,
                            {{DocSeqNo, DocCAS}, {OurSeqNo, OurCAS}}
                    end,

                case max(LocalMeta, RemoteMeta) of
                    %% if equal, prefer LocalMeta since in this case, no need
                    %% to replicate the remote item, hence put LocalMeta before
                    %% RemoteMeta.
                    LocalMeta ->
                        ok;
                    %% if remoteMeta wins, need to persist the remote item, using
                    %% the same CAS returned from the get_meta() above.
                    RemoteMeta ->
                        update_locally(Bucket, DocId, VBucket, DocValue, DocRev, DocDeleted, LocalCAS)
                end
