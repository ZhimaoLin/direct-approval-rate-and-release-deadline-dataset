DESCRIPTION

MB-8911: CAPI side resolution algorithm change for deletion

Since 2.2, ep_engine changes the resolution algorithm for deletion.
To be consistent, CAPI mode replication should also adopt the same
algorithm.

Actually ep_engine will do their resolution in deleteWithMeta(),
here we put another defense line (the second getMeta before writing
doc locally) in CAPI just for safety and performance reasons.

see inline. Otherwise matches whatever you've done in xmem code

Line:132, src/capi_replication.erl -> might want to do it here as well

Line:132, src/capi_replication.erl -> Seems  we only pass the metadata and key,  we do not know it is a deletion or not (the new resolutions is only for deletion). Passing delete flag from source may involve a lot more change.

The defense line in update_replicated_doc function should be enough IMHO.

Line:193, src/capi_replication.erl -> This gives you local metadata, right? We need to know if the remote (from source) one is a deletion or not. Do I miss anything here?
