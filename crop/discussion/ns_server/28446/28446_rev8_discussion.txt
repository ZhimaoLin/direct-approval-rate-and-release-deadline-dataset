DESCRIPTION

MB-8911: CAPI side resolution algorithm change for deletion

Since 2.2, ep_engine changes the resolution algorithm for deletion.
To be consistent, CAPI mode replication should also adopt the same
algorithm.

Actually ep_engine will do their resolution in deleteWithMeta(),
here we put another defense line (the second getMeta before writing
doc locally) in CAPI just for safety and performance reasons.
