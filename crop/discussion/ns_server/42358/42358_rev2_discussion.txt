DESCRIPTION

[ale] added api to batch logger config compilations

It's now possible to call freeze_compilations, do a bunch of
(re)configurations, and then thaw_compilations will compile all
loggers and sinks attachments in one go. Instead of recompiling logger
on every ale:add_sink and ale:set_loglevel.
