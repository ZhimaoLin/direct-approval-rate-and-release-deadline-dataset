DESCRIPTION

[ale] added api to batch logger config compilations

It's now possible to wrap ale (re)configurations with call to
ale:with_configuration_batching/1. Within "body" of that call all ale
compilation is delayed and at the end of that call all loggers are
recompiled.

Using that API allows setup of complex ale log topologies without
overhead of recompilation on every call to ale:add_sink and
ale:set_loglevel.
