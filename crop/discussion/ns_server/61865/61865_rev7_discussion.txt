MB-17962: don't alert on indexer RAM with forestdb storage mode

Simply add a check to only fire the alert if the storage mode is
memory optimized. I couldn't bring myself to add another binary
literal so I added an is_memory_optimized() function and defined
macros for both memory optimized and forestdb storage modes.
