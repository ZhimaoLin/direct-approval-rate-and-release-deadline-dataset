DESCRIPTION

MB-17962: don't alert on indexer RAM with forestdb storage mode

Simply add a check to only fire the alert if the storage mode is
memory optimized. I couldn't bring myself to add another binary
literal so I added an is_memory_optimized() function and defined
macros for both memory optimized and forestdb storage modes.

Line:202, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Indentation should be correct now. indent-region works great for me interactively, but having all sorts of problems getting the emacs script to work. Not to worry, though, I'll check with the other Mac users.
