Patch Set 4:

One comment (which I also made on the Erlang bug report -- https://bugs.erlang.org/browse/ERL-461 for convenience) was that if they decide to keep limiting filesystems in disksup by type, they should probably switch to -T. The df man page says about using -t:
    "If used with an argument, it acts like -T,
      but this usage is deprecated and should not be relied upon."
