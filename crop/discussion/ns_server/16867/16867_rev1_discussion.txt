DESCRIPTION

MB-5449 Avoid intermittent no_db_file crashes.

We tend to create vbucket databases slowly. Thus to prevent loads of
{not_found,no_db_file} crashes we'll first check that all databases
exist. If not then we'll skip compaction of this bucket. We don't
expect such a state to last long thus such approach looks acceptable.
