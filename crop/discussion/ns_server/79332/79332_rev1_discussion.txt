DESCRIPTION

MB-24543 allow to start dedicated moxi for "default" bucket

default moxi anymote, the user needs to be able to start dedicated
moxi for "default" bucket

Patch Set 1:

I guess there's a possibility that a customer will have a config that defines a moxi port for the default bucket (through some legacy config or diag/eval) and it conflicts with some other port and the customer will experience issues when upgrading. Comments on this?

I would ignore such possibility as improbable, but if you think it is important to cover it, we can cleanup the port during upgrade.

Patch Set 1:

We can ignore the diag/eval case. If diag/eval is involved the customer could have screwed up their config in myriad ways and we shouldn't single this out.

But I guess it's possible that folks would have used the REST API to create a default bucket with a proxy port. I'm a little bit ambivalent (so push back if you feel strongly) but overall I'd prefer to clean the port up as part of upgrade. That can be done separately.

Patch Set 1:

It is not possible in pre Spock to create default bucket with moxi port. Both create and update api's silently ignore such option.

Thanks for checking. That's perfect and for me obviates any need to clean up the configs.
