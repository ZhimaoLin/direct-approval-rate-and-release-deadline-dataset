DESCRIPTION

Don't announce changes from replace cas_config as local.

Replace is only used on ns_couchdb node which doesn't replicate its
config to any other nodes. And the whole purpose of "local" changes
announcements is to let the replicator know that there's new stuff to
push to other nodes.

Patch Set 2:

Looks like after this change there will be no difference between remote and replace codes.

Unfortunately the commit that introduced replace doesn't explain why these changes needed to be announced locally: http://review.couchbase.org/44631

Patch Set 2:

Yes, you're right that replace and remote are the same now. I'll get rid of replace, I don't see any reason to announce its changes locally.

Patch Set 2:

I also couldn't figure out why we did it in a first place and even invented special code for it.
