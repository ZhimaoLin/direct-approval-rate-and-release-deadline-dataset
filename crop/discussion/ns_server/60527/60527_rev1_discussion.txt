Patch Set 1:

The ticket is marked for 4.1.1, so you need to base your work on sherlock branch.

More generally, I would suggest that instead of just fixing it for nodedown, we also fix it for (almost) all other possible cases. Specifically, the errors we should expect are:

* noproc (if bucket supervisor hasn't processed config update)
* warming_up (if warm-up has not completed)

Rest of the cases is an error.


In addition, I would add an extra function instead of changing query_states, just to avoid changing all the other places that use query_states.

In these cases it will keep waiting. Is that not what we want?

Patch Set 1:

Yes, but there are also infinite number of errors where we actually don't want to wait.

ok, I think I misunderstood Your first comment.
So we what You are saying is wait if the error is noproc or warming_up, and fail for all others?
