DESCRIPTION

WIP Limit the number of concurrent vbucket moves during rebalance.

To ensure that replications do not drop far behind corresponding
takeovers we limit number of vbucket moves at a time. This lessens the
probability of the case when some replications are constantly blocked
by other vbucket's moves.
