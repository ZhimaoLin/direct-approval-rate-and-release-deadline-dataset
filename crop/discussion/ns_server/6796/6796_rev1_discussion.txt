DESCRIPTION

TAP_CONNECT using checkpointId's of 0 rather than silence.

Before this change, ebucketmigrator would TAP_CONNECT with a
vbucketId-to-checkpointId pairs list whose length might be less than
the vbucketId's list.

Instead, this change has the ebucketmigrator TAP_CONNECT with 0's for
checkpointId's for those vbucket's where it cannot determine the right
last closed checkpointId for a vbucket.
