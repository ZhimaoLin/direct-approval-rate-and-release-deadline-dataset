DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: XDCR code polishing

This change-set migrates the per vbucket replication supervisor from
couchdb to ns_server. It is renamed to xdc_rep_sup and will be started
by ns_server_sup. xdc_rep_sup will be responsible for creating child
process required by XDCR manager to start replication between local
vbucket and the destination vbucket in remote cluster.

Patch Set 1:

my understanding is we need this started _before_ replication manager. No ?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

In CouchDB context yes. On server startup we can trigger replications described in docs inside _replicator database.
I think here the same can happen, but unsure as I haven't followed xdcr closely.

Patch Set 1:

It will be only used by rep manager.

Is there other particular reason this should start before replication manager?

because it _will_ be used by replication manager.

Patch Set 1:

The replication manager supervisor starts right before xdc_rep_sup when instance starts up.  

But the real replication can happen much later.

Patch Set 1:

my understanding is that xdc_rep_manager will start all it's replications right in it's init function. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding but those seemingly require this new supervisor to be operational.

Patch Set 1:

replication starts way later after both rep manager and xdc_rep_sup start. 

For safety we can start xdc_rep_sup before rep manager. Will upload the patchset soon.
