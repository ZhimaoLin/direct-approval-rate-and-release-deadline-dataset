DESCRIPTION

[bp] Adapt ns_log_sink to the messages without a code.

This allows us to send usual log messages to this sink so that the
user can see them too. Such messages are logged with a fake 0 code. On
the other hand they are still announced locally with undefined code
for subscribers to know for sure that there are no code attached to
the message.
