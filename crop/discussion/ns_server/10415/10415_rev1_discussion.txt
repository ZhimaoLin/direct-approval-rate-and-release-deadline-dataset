Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please change this to use an Event instead of the "action hash" for deleting. I doubt we need back-button handling here, and I can't think of any reason why we should use the URL hash space for actions rather than using JS/DOM Events.

This has nothing to do with back button BTW. It's about handling middle-click (open in new tab).

Will still do, though. To lessen confusion.

Patch Set 1:

After additional thinking I don't think changing it is good.

#-based links is simplest and most concise way to implement delete buttons.

Any other way would have to do that via data- attributes, which is extra code.
