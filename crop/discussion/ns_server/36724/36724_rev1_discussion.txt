DESCRIPTION

MB-10953 Clear ssl PEM cache after saving certificates.

Previously we restarted entire ssl application when certificates
changed to achieve the same. The important difference is that it
didn't happen when certificates was generated during
ns_ssl_services_setup initialization. So when the key is regenerated
after node was ejected from the cluster, ssl application might still
use cached values. Though for reasons I don't understand, it happens
quite rarely.
