DESCRIPTION

don't use best_effort option of Harley Martinitor

Because it can try replicating to/from not ready node. It's much safer
to expect all nodes to be healthy.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

At a surface level, it's a simple change of a flag.  What other code does with the (lack of the) best_effort flag, though, is another story...
