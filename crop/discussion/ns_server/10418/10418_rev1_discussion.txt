Patch Set 1:

Should we "$" prefix any additions we make to a CouchDB originating document type like replication or user docs? If we don't, I suppose we're cluttering the user-space additions and making it unclear what keys are reserved and originate from Couchbase vs. which ones a developer or app may have added.

Patch Set 1:

we don't prefix source and target. And other fields. This is system database. I think prefixes are not needed.
