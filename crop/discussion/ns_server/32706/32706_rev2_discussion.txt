DESCRIPTION

MB-9969: correctly compute nodes field of remote cluster

I.e. it looks like I've left some code that was accidently first
computing RemoteNodes and then matching it against different
computation of same value. When remote cluster is rebalanced it's
possible for this two computations to give different results causing
badmatch.
