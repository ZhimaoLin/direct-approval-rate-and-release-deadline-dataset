Patch Set 5:

Manik - basically looks good, but as I mentioned before I want to wait until the memcached change is in before merging.

Spoke to Trond today on the configuration and he has a pretty straightforward idea to change the configuration a little bit - basically allowing the path to be optional - which would indicate to the server that the client is only looking for client cert verification, not client cert auth. In the verification case, the user would still have to auth post connection-establishment. Trond will let you know the details.
