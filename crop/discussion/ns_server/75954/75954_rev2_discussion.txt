Obviously this can't get checked in at all until the memcached work is done -- as it completely breaks the server. And of course the memcached stuff can't get checked in without this change as that breaks the server too. Ideally, we change the memcached side to be able to accept an object *or* a string for client_cert_auth allowing it to go first and the ns_server change to go later.

Line:158, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> would prefer if this is an atom such as: any

Line:159, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Should be a function.

Also: wondering if you should use strings as keys, rather than atoms. If you do this you can avoid the list_to_existing_atom() conversion below and if you get a hit, you can then safely convert to atom with no catching badarg.

Line:172, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Values == any orelse lists:member(...)
