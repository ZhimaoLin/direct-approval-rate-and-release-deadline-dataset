(4 comments)

This patch allows client_cert_auth to be mandatory with no path specified. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense in memcached. (i.e. where would memcached look for the identity.) It might be ok, but it seems like we should validate that if mandatory is set the path is set.

Secondarily, please format the code according to emacs Erlang mode indent-region. (I tried it myself and it didn't appear to be formatted that way.

Otherwise a few nits. See the inline comments.

Line:172, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> use =/=

Line:180, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> please don't have literal strings go across multiple lines. If you need to split the strings across more than one line, do it like so:

Foo = "foo "
           "bar",

Line:184, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Factor this function out and give it a name. Go with something generic like "Fun" or something accurate like "AccumulateChanges".

E.g. 
    AccumulateChanges = fun(...)
                                          ...
                                          end,
    KeyChanged = lists:foldl(AccumulateChanges, [], Params),

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> should be path

Hi Dave. Trond and I had decided to treat these two settings as two different knobs. 

1. Is sslCert is set to mandatory and path is not specified then we will only try and validate the certificate and not attempt to extract the username from the cert. In this case the client should do the SASL auth after the cert is accepted. 
2. We look for the username in the cert iff the path is specified.
