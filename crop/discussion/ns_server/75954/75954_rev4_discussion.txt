Overall getting there. Just a few comments. 

The memcached change has to go in first of course. I will wait to verify until that change is done and ready to go.

Line:151, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Can you change this to "path". Type is the wrong word. Perhaps "identity_path" would be most accurate, but it's long and the context is relatively clear, so I think path works best.

Line:167, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Can you switch to something like the following:

  [{error, {400, io_lib:format("Invalid key: '~s'", [Key])}}];

Reason is that this will allow you generate better error messages. Later when you reply with the error you'll need to do:

            menelaus_util:reply_json(Req, list_to_binary(Error), Code);

Line:179, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Write an error message that says: "Invalid value '~s' for key '~s'"
