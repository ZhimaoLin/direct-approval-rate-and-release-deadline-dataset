DESCRIPTION

MB-13615 Retry starting ns_server after leaving the cluster.

In the referred ticket I found that because of some problem with
ns_couchdb (which occurs on windows quite regularly, but seems to be
intermittent) we failed to start ns_server back. But since we do this
after removing leave marker, next time ns_cluster starts up it won't
try doing anything. So most of ns_server services will not be
running. This commit addresses the issue. I introduced one more marker
file that indicates that node left the old cluster but hasn't started
ns_server back. I use one more marker instead of just reusing leave
marker because theoretically there's a possibility that someone would
initialize the cluster right after we start ns_server. So if
ns_cluster failed after that but before completing the restart, these
changes would be lost.
