I think this code need to wait until post returns. And then refresh tasks. And while it's waiting it needs to disable button.

Also when bucket is being compacted it needs to disable compact button as well

Also we really need to change type from link to button. Edit is middle-clickable. But for compact there's no point in supporting middle click
