DESCRIPTION

MB-5505: Make sure we do not over-split the VB list

Today when XDCR is scheduling replication, it splits the vbucket list
into two [list1, list2] where length of list1 is number of concurrent
replication streams defined in an env parameter. But there could
be a case that the parameter value is greater than the length of
vbucket list. This changeset will fix this issue by determing the
right position to split the vbucket list.
