DESCRIPTION

MB-4180 Fix grabbing diag.

Before Erlang R14B02 it was possible to call restart_child on
processes with temporary restart type though it was not something
anyone supposed to do. R14B02 stopped saving initial arguments for
temporary processes to save some memory. Though child specifications
of such processes were still saved. Thus an attempt to restart_child
temporary process would cause an error. This must be fixed in R14B03
where child specifications of temporary processes are cleaned up
properly and no one should see {error, already_present}.
