Patch Set 8: Verified+1

(1 comment)

I verified with a pluggable config as follows:

{
  "service": "n1ql",
  "proxy-strategy": "any",
  "rest-api-prefix": "query",
  "doc-root": "."
}

and curled as follows:
curl -u Administrator:asdasd -i -d statement="select count(*) from \`beer-sample\`;" http://localhost:9000/query/query/service

Line:49, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Seems like we need also validate that all pluggable specs are unique here by REST API prefix.
