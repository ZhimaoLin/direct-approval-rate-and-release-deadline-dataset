Patch Set 11: -Code-Review

Aliaksey reviewed the code (at least part of it) and stopped by my desk to chat. He has one serious concern (and some other more implementation level details, which I imagine he'll add comments for in gerrit.)

The serious concern is how do we handle the case of the "any" proxy strategy in the situation where we're upgrading from one release to the next and some of the nodes have a Watson version and some have a Watson.Next version. As the code currently stands you could have Watson javascript try to work with Watson.Next REST APIs on such a service, and of course, vice-versa. This problem isn't insurmountable but I think it needs some think time. 

Suggest remove "any" as a valid proxy strategy for now so we can get this review checked in and to give us time to figure out how we'd like to move forward on this.

Line:2, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> It's 2016 soon :)

Line:99, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I guess that's a matter of taste, but I don't like overloaded functions like this. I'd rather have a function with a different name indicating that the function takes a service as parameter. Another argument in support of such separation is that you actually don't call proxy_req with a service from anywhere outside this module.

Line:104, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Similar comment to the one about nth_path_tail below. I'd make it responsibility of the caller to pass the path (that is already parsed there anyway).

Line:203, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> You probably also need to remove Transfer-Encoding. Transfer-Encodnig can be chunked, but you always send entire request to the service. So mochiweb would add Content-Length to your request. Having both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding is incorrect.

Line:212, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Token are per node. So it also won't work with non-local proxy strategy.

Line:234, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> You probably need to remove content-length and transfer-encoding from the headers here too (see goxdcr_rest:is_safe_response_header and corresponding commit).

Line:269, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I find nth_path_tail somewhat confusing given that you already have tokenized path where you call maybe_serve_file (and also your implementation doesn't handle two slashes without anything in between). I suggest passing string:join(RestPath, "/") from menelaus_web instead.

Also, I don't particularly like the assumption that Path has exactly two unneeded segments. I think it should be up to the caller to compute a correct path.

Line:269, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Yes, You are right that there are some problems here.
The reason I did it this way was that the tokenized path in menelaus_web has
1, discarded any query and fragment parts
2, done mochiweb_util:unquote.
So I thought it would be safer/easier this way.

But You are correct about not handling //.

And related to this when serving static files, is there any logic somewhere that sanitizes the path to make sure we don't escape from the doc root, i.e. http://address:port/../../etc/password

Line:197, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Should I use rest_utils:request/6 here instead, so that system_stats_collector gets invoked?
If so what "Type" should I use?

Line:197, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I don't think there's a need for this. But if change our mind, we can always add it later.
