Patch Set 1:

This is a work in progress. I have only verified that static files and GET requests work.
I my knowledge of HTTP and REST is pretty limited so I would appreciate comments on things I may have missed with adding/removing/modifying headers when proxying requests. Also what logging/statistics is missing?
