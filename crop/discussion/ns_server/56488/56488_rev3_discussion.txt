Haven't finished reviewing but what I've gone through looks good & very clean. Will continue tomorrow.

Line:18, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> export_all doesn't seem right - there's actually just a handful of functions exported. Is this just for testing?

Line:24, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> We should use the "standard etc" directory (I think.) 

It's defined in the static_config and defaults on Unix systems to /opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase (and it's where the static_config file lives by default, actually.
{path_config_etcdir, xxx@xxx.xxx

You can get it via: path_config:component_path(etc).

Line:26, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> It's going to depend of course. I'd say be a bit more generous and do 60s. Ultimately we may need to give the browser client control of this via some custom header or something so that query UI can allow more time for queries to run at which point we can reduce the default timeout.

Line:60, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> we should log at the info level whether we load the configs or not

one more comment that occurred to me.

Line:93, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> this is racy I think.
a node with a given service can be added when find_plugins() is called and on timing the plugin will be activated or not.

I think we are going to have to lookup whether the service is present dynamically (i.e. at web request time.) It's "just" a ns_config lookup which I imagine is fast. If not we can look up and cache the result and listen to ns_config events (which can be done in a separate checkin.)

Line:93, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> This is dead code and should be removed.
The real lookup of active nodes supporting the requested service is done at request time.

OK. Can you remove all of the dead code and submit a new patch for me to review?
