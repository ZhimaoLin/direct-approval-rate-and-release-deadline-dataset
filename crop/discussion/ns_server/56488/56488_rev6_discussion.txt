Patch Set 6:

Line:26, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Changed my mind. I would like the extension to be .json -- much nicer for folks editing these files since with this extension you'll often get editor support for well-formattedness.

Line:95, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Here what we actually need to do is to remove the service name from the beginning of the request path for the forwarded request.  E.g. 
            Path = Req:get(raw_path),
            PathToUse = string:right(Path, string:len(Path) - string:len(Service) - 1)

And then pass PathToUse to proxy_req as a 3rd parameter. Reason is best given by example. Say we're proxying the n1ql service and we find a host:8093 to forward the request to. The request will come into us as:
http://hosta:8091/n1ql/query/service
and we will forward it as:
http://hostb:8093/query/service

i.e. we strip out the "/n1ql" from the path that we get. Actually I tested this with pluggable-ui-n1ql.json as follows and it worked well:
{
  "service": "n1ql",
  "proxy-strategy": "any",
  "rest-api-prefix": "query",
  "doc-root": "."
}

Though of course you'll need to add a port_for() function as follows:

port_for("n1ql", Node) ->
   {value, Port} = ns_config:search(ns_config:latest(),
                                     {node, Node, query_port}),

Line:133, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> You have a bug here that you'd have found with a type spec. :-) Just kidding. Anyway, Service comes in as a string but service_active_nodes() only works if Service is an atom. So you'll need a list_to_atom() in here.

Line:200, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> can you log the reason?
