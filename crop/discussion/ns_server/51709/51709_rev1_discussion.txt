see inline

Line:538, src/ns_config.erl -> search_node already returns a global proplist if the per-node one does not exist. So you don't need to do anything here.

Line:538, src/ns_config.erl -> this covers a case when the key is found on the node but it doesn't contain the needed subkey. but subkey is available for the global key.
