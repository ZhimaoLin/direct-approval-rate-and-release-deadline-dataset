DESCRIPTION

Prototype: Process possible data loss while onlining Ephemeral ...

... and persistent buckets.

This prototype has two parts:

1. Ephemeral buckets: Check if bringing the bucket online on a node can cause
loss of data in the vBuckets that were active on that node. If yes, then
try auto-failover of the node. But, auto-failover may not be possible for various
reasons. In that case, bring the bucket online on the node.

2. Persistent buckets: Check if bringing the bucket online on a node can cause
loss of data in the vBuckets that were active on that node. If yes, then
notify the user. User can then either perform hard failover of the node or
select the option to force the online of the bucket on the node.

This prototype is meant to check feasibility of these options and
decide whether the approach is robust enough to be productized.

Aliaksey has background of this feature but all are welcome to review.

Needless to say, this being a prototype, it does not strictly adhere to
all the standards we usually follow and has several TODOs - e.g.:

1. Instead of multiple small patches, it was more convenient for me
to have one single patch.
2. Some TODOS:
    - Consider various race conditions
    - Optimal get/set of the newly added ns_config entry - "bucket_online_suspended.
    - Upgrades
    - UI & REST API changes.
    - fix failure in make test - auto_failover_logic.
    - fix indentation in ns_Harley Martinitor.erl. indent_erl.el says "Unbalanced parenthesis"
3. I have conducted some basic unit tests but if we do decide to productize this
then a more thourough testing is required.
The testing should consider various race conditions, test with multiple buckets,
multiple down nodes, upgrades etc.
