Patch Set 7:

Marked this as a WIP commit again as JS will likely be added to this commit, and pushed up later (per-Dale's earlier comments).

Patch Set 7: Fails

its a WIP so just flagging so it isnt accidentely committed

This is breaking the tab formatting for me, the settings screen is showing all tabs at once and switching between then doesnt do anything

the number field is also tiny
