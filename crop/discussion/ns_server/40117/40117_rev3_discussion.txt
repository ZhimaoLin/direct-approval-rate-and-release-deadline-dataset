DESCRIPTION

MB-8746: Use the set view based spatial index

With this commit we switch to using the set view based spatial index.

The configuration file for it now lives in the GeoCouch project instead
of in ns_server/etc/geocouch.ini. This is also where the hooks to
`capi_spatial` are defined (in case you wonder why there's no direct
trace of it when grepping for it in ns_server.

Patch Set 3: -Code-Review

I rebased it.

Alk, in order to make this change fully work, i also need to merge a lot of changes into the geocouch project. I'd like to do that mostly at the same time.

So I guess the easiest process is that you give a +2 whenever you think it can be merged. I will then merge my geocouch changes and afterwards merge this change. Afterwards everything should just work as expected.

Does that sounds like a plan?

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

there's small chance of perf regression caused by rebalance-related calls to spatial code even when there are no spatial indexes. But there's reason to think that it should be small.

Going forward I'd prefer single point of entry for design document that if needed calls down to plain and spatial views. I.e. we're not doing anything to spatial views that we are not doing to plain views. So there's no need to expose details of spatial views.

So is it OK if I merge this now and then I'll work on the single point of entry?

Sure. Single call is just a relatively minor convenience. And is certainly not a requirement for 3.0.x. IMO.

I'd postpone this refactoring for next most convenient time. I.e. next major bug fix or major feature in this area.
