DESCRIPTION

Refactor handling down messages.

 - do not reset token if pending process dies
 - if process is both caller and registered, handle one thing at a
   time; such a process will be monitored twice, so use monitor
   references to figure out what to do
 - don't ignore unexpected down messages
