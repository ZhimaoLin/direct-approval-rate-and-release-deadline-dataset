DESCRIPTION

MB-10199 add admin auth sharing process for view engine

Couchbase view engine needs to know admin auth information for
opening a connection to couchbase bucket and start UPR streams
for password protected buckets. Added a registered process with
an API `cb_auth_info:get` to obtain admin user and password for
couchbase server.

looks largely right. My only concern so far is that it'll crash hard when ns_config is not yet started. Those hard crashes may even lead to supervisor restarts. Not sure about how bad it'll be however.

Line:39, src/cb_auth_info.erl -> Is it a good idea to add a retry loop with whereis(ns_config) check ?

I think retry somewhere in consumer of this call is better approach.

So this service will return error instead of crashing. And result will either crash consumer or cause consumer to wait and retry and any policy that consumer of this service desires.

Also it might be wiser to start this service _before_ couchdb. I.e. so that your code can get this error always.
