DESCRIPTION

MB-10199 add admin auth sharing process for view engine

Couchbase view engine needs to know admin auth information for
opening a connection to couchbase bucket and start UPR streams
for password protected buckets. Added a registered process with
an API `cb_auth_info:get` to obtain admin user and password for
couchbase server.

Line:26, src/cb_auth_info.erl -> is `couch_db.hrl` only needed for the `l2b/1` macro? If yes I personally would get rid of it and change the `l2b/1` calls to `list_to_binary/1`. But feel free to leave it like that.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

I'd prefer to limit area under try, but that's relatively minor. Feel free to +V and merge at will.
