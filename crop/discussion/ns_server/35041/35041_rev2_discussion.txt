DESCRIPTION

MB-10199 add admin auth sharing process for view engine

Couchbase view engine needs to know admin auth information for
opening a connection to couchbase bucket and start UPR streams
for password protected buckets. Added a registered process with
an API `cb_auth_info:get` to obtain admin user and password for
couchbase server.

Patch Set 2:

There's tiny race with whereis call. I'd just do (catch ns_config:get()).

Other than that it's LGTM.
