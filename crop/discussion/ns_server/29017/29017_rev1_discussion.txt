DESCRIPTION

MB-4345 Use unique admin memcached password on each node.

New user/password pair is generated every time config is
upgraded. That is, for fresh nodes and whenever node is ejected from
cluster.

I specifically chose to update both admin_user and admin_pass with
random value. This is because I want memcached to be restarted
whenever they are updated. And since admin_user is part of memcached
port configuration, I get this automatically.

Also, since isasl.pw is written from a different process I needed to
add explicit synchronization before every change in port servers
configuration.
