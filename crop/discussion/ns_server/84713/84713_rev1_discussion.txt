DESCRIPTION

[cut] Allow numbered placeholders in ?cut.

This gives more expressiveness:

 - the order of parameters can be different from the order in which
   they are used
 - some parameters can be left unused
 - you can use the same parameter more than once

This obviously shouldn't be abused, but occasionally one needs to
write an anonymous function where there's no meaningful way to assign
names to the parameters.

Numbered placeholders are of the form _[1-9]. Mixing numbered and
simple placeholders is disallowed.

Example (find the length of the list):

  Length = lists:foldl(?cut(_2 + 1), 0, List)
