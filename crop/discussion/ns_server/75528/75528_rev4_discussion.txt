Patch Set 4:

I had the same problem in Query Workbench. The way I solved the problem in the Query Workbench was to use 'tranformResponse' in the HTTP request to intercept the response coming back from the server, and to save the raw bytes of the response before they are parsed into a javascript object. That would solve MB-22928.
