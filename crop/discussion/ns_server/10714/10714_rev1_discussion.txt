DESCRIPTION

Simplify Logic to Adjust Vbucket Replications

The maybe_adjust_xdc_replication() function gets called to adjust
ongoing vbucket replications whenever the source vbucket map changes.
Previously, upon triggering Couch replications for the newly acquired
vbuckets, the list of triggered vbuckets was being tracked in a
slightly roundabout manner. This changeset simplifies this handling.

A related issue is that we currently do not retry replications that
fail when triggered. A subsequent changeset will fix this issue.

Line:491, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> Generally this is not very good idea to add elements to the end of the list one by one.

Line:525, src/xdc_rep_manager.erl -> If I'm not mistaken only newly triggered vbuckets will be stored here.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

On second thoughts, this code is probably fine. So, no need to change.
