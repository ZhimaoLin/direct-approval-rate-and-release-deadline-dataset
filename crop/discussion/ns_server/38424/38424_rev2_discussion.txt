DESCRIPTION

MB-11473: handle nops while handshaking upr streams in xdcr

Note that it fixes nop handling only in handshaking, but not in exit
loops of consumer process or socket process. I have agreement with
Mike that we'll be able to disable nop handling completely. With that
I decided not to bother with those two other places that are less
critical in enabling testing of xdcr.

it looks like it's best to simply reverts nop patch in ep-engine. I've already got ack for that from Mike.
