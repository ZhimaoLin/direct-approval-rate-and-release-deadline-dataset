DESCRIPTION

Bug 2736: Set servers to correct list of nodes before rebalancing

I've actually changed the order of operations so we only loop through
the list of buckets once. This prevents us from loading all the
buckets at once right at the beginning, which causes poor performance
when there are a lot of buckets. The tradeoff is that now instead of a
pause right at the beginning you'll see a pause every nth of the way
through, where n is the number of buckets.

Line:116, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> we seem to be setting incorrect list here after setting correct list in the caller
