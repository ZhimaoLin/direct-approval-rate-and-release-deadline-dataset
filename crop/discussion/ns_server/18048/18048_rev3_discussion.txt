DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: (WIP) simplify replicator worker

Since XDCR is always from local node  to remote, I feel we should
not see any Source db other than the #db{}. Say, we should not see
anything like Souce#httpdb{}. Not sure if any exception.

If this is the case, we do not have to code replicator worker
as a gen_server and a lot of existent code will never be called.
Remoing such code will simplify the replicator workera lot.

Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)

Just some typos in the commit message, and be sure to be more precise there, just say pull style replications are not used in Couchbase Server (but are in Apache CouchDB).

Line:54, src/xdc_replicator_worker.erl -> please remove this later when ready
