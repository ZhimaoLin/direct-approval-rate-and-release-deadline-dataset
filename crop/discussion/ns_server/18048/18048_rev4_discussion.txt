DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: Remove pull replication from replicator worker

Today pulling style replications are no longer used in Couchbase
Server (but they are still used in Apache CouchDB). In XDCR, any
replication is between a local bucket and a remote one, therefore
we no longer need any code in replicator worker handling CouchDB-
style replication from a remote bucket, and the replication worker
is no longer using gen-server behavior either.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

Just minor note, title message would be more meaningful as "Remove pull replication support from replicator worker".

Everything else looks ok (there's still code related to pull-style replications in other modules as well).
