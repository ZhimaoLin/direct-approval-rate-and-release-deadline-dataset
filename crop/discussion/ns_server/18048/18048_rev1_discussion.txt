DESCRIPTION

CBD-399: (WIP) simplify replicator worker

Since XDCR is always from local node  to remote, I feel we should
not see any Source db other than the #db{}. Say, we should see
anything like Souce#httpdb{}. Not sure if any exception.

If this is the case, we do not have to code replicator worker
as a gen_server and a lot of existent code will never be called.
Remoing such code will simplify the replicator workera lot.
