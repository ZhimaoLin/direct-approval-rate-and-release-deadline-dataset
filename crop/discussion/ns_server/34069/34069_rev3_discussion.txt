Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

what if Harley Martinitor_agent dies/crashes ? You'll lose rebalance_finished state then.

You can achieve similar effect by playing with supervision and order of supervisor childs. single_bucket_sup childs are ordered in a way where crash of important child will cause childs that might depend on it to be restarted too.
