DESCRIPTION

MB-5943: Maintain and collect XDCR vb stats

We now collect and maintain individual XDCR vb replicator stats inside
the bucket's xdc_replication process, and we provide a way to collect all
replicator stats for a bucket.

For each replication, we can get:
 - the amount of work (changes to examine) remaining for replicator
 - the total number of docs checked on target (stat survives restarts)
 - the total number of docs written to target (stat survives restarts)
 - the list of vbuckets actively replicating

Next step is to report them in ns_server's stats collection.
