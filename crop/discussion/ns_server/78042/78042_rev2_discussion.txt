Patch Set 2:

Can we just pass the isEnterprise flag instead? So we don't need to touch this code every single time.

Patch Set 2:

FTS can be run standalone and these options are something that we may want to be tunable (in the future), so just passing in an isEnterprise flag wouldn't suffice.

Patch Set 2:

Feel free to keep them tunable. That's orthogonal to passing isEnterprise.

Patch Set 2:

It's an explicit design decision.  We don't want the cbft process to know about EE.  We run cbft outside of Couchbase.  The ns_server process already has this logic, so its reasonable place to own it.

Patch Set 2:

I don't want enterprise version to exist at all. But given the sad reality, I don't see why we should keep track of what cbft considers enterprise feature and what it doesn't. -allowedBuckets=membase (or whatever) is not that different from -isEnterprise=false.

Patch Set 2:

This is your project, if that's the final say, -2 and force us to do something else.

Patch Set 2:

@marty - this integration code on how to spawn cbft is not the purview of ns-server alone.

On the FTS side, I want to stick to the policy of avoiding isEnterprise checks in the cbft codebase.  ns-server already has isEnterprise checks, so it's no worse than before.
