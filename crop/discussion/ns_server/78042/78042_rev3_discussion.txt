Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

At this point, cbft and other codebases (cbgt, etc) don't have any If-isEnterprise-Then-Else type of code, and I strongly want to keep it that way.

For ns-server codebase, it's too late -- it already has isEnterprise checks.  (Not that it can't be refactored away another day, but that won't be attempted here).

As for what's CE vs EE, at least for FTS, it's all contained to this one "glue/integration" port sup file.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

@Steve - agreed. 
@Abhinav - have you verified that your change works as intended? The way we do things in ns_server is that the author of the changes states that his or her change works by marking +V. Other folks will +2 and merge. If you mark this +V we can merge it.
