DESCRIPTION

Revert "MB-9096: killed ns_online_config_upgrader"

This reverts commit 6c13b6f64379b21e83429c149d4399b7c486fcea.

It turns out 2.5 needs this back. In order to simplify merge it looks
worth reviving that guy.

In addition to simply reverting it, I've removed "on-join" config
upgrade and made it handle "upgrade" to 3.0.
