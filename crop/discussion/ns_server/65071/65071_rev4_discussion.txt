DESCRIPTION

cluster_run's allocation of ports is deficient.

The biggest issue is that it puts the indexer on the same ports (9100
- 9105) as a regular download of Couchbase, preventing you from running
a downloaded version and cluster_run at the same time.

Another issue is that port assignments happen in arbitrary ways that
make it difficult to figure out what port a given service might be on
a given node. The management service is easy, 9000, 9001, 9002,
etc. But the indexer ports go up by 6: 9100, 9106, 9112, etc. Query
engine ports go down: 9499, 9498, 9497.

Finally, there is a bug where starting 20 instances will cause the
indexer ports to overlap with fts ports.

This change fixes all the above problems by making every cluster_run
port be the port number of a downloaded version, plus 1000, plus the
node number times 100. E.g.:

              node 0    node 1   node 2  node 3
mgmt service   9091      9191     9291    9391
capi service   9092      9192     9292    9392
n1ql service   9093      9193     9293    9393
fts service    9094      9194     9294    9394

and so on with all the other ports.

The biggest advantage is that the port numbers under cluster_run no
longer overlap with those of the downloaded version for the indexer,
allowing you to run both at the same time.

Another advantage is that the port numbers under cluster_run are
similar to those of a downloaded version, the last two digits are
identical. You don't have to remember whether a port number is
incremented or decremented versus the base version, and by what
constant.

Finally, you need to have more than 160 nodes before port collission
occurs, and improvement over the limit of 20 in the current version.

Patch Set 4:

I don't mind changing the indexer port, so that it doesn't conflict with the standalone install. I don't want the ns_server and other ports changed though.
