DESCRIPTION

MB-10400: initial xdcr-over-upr implementation

Note that I've decided to keep old xdcr path alive for some
time. Particularly bacause make simple-test is failing. And because
upr implementation has some known bugs (like upr stream getting stuck).

There's ns_config switch which value is picked based on environment
variable. If XDCR_USE_NEW_PATH environment variable is set, then new,
upr-based code path is selected. Otherwise old path is picked.

Note that xdc_vbucket_rep_worker for old path was merely copied from
prior revision of this file. There is no attempt to keep shared code
shared in this place of code. That is because old path is expected to
die reasonably soon. And to make killing it easier.

This commit implements both upr-based mutations consumption as well as
upr-based checkpointing.

Remote end of upr-based xdcr is using seqno + vbucket uuid in order to
represent commitopaque. And vbucket uuid is used as vbopaque.

Local end is saving seqno, last snapshot seqno and (local) vbucket
uuid to represent it "consumer coordinates". On resumption, those
local coordinates are used to establish upr stream. And upr rollback
is used to handle partial or full data loss. I.e. there is no notion
of "checking local end of checkpoint for validness" because local end
is always valid. UPR handles proper resumption for us.
