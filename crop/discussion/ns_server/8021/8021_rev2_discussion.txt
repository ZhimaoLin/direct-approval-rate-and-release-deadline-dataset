DESCRIPTION

Handle '-k' option in membase-server.

Call to membase-server with -k option now shuts down running instance of the
server. Since the script now parses arguments using getopt to supply
additional arguments to erlang shell one must delimit those using --, e.g.:
./membase-server -- -noinput -detached.
