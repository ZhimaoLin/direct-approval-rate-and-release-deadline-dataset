DESCRIPTION

Work around dialyzer bug in R14B01

It seems to think the success typing for file:write_file/2 is (name(),
binary()) when it accepts an iolist. No matter, I just added
list_to_binary to the calls.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

This turns out not to be necessary - removing my .plt file made the problem go away.
