storing extra hash

One question inline. Also somewhat weird that they generate sha1 mac, given some customers already requested that we get rid of it.

Line:127, src/menelaus_users.erl -> Can you explain why this is needed?

Line:127, src/menelaus_users.erl -> During the 4.5 -> 4.6 upgrade ro_admin will be upgraded to builtin user. The upgrade won't be able to generate SCRAM-SHA hashes since the password is not known. So until you retype the password only PLAIN will be available for such user. We do want to generate SCRAM-SHA hashes on password set even if password matches the old one.
