Why are we doing this change?

Now we wait for both the stats and the config to come back before we stop the spinners so the user waits longer?

Line:10, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_overview/mn_overview_service.js -> these are not used, please remove.

Initially I thought it could be more comfortable for us to reload that state, e.g. during implementation of sync between tabs. But eventually I'm agree with you.
