DESCRIPTION

MB-21814: actually add request params to settings/alerts post

We weren't actually ever adding just_validate to the post, so essentially
we were wiping out the password whenever the user visits the page. This
change fixes the bug to actually add the request params we thought
we were adding to the post.
