DESCRIPTION

wip: MB-7965: implement faster bucket flush option via FLUSH command

It is off by default for now. Particularly because it will not
actually work even if ep-engine config is changed to enable flushall
implementation.

The reason is that bucket flush disables traffic and ep-engine doesn't
allow flushall when traffic is disabled.

not needed. It looks like there is some agreement to proceed with new special purpose flush command.
