DESCRIPTION

Move singletons to mb_master_sup.

They still use global, but there should no longer be races. These will
be updated to use mb_master:master_node/0 in a future change.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Doesn't work yet - initial config requires ns_orchestrator to be started, but it won't start until after the administrator password is set with this change.
