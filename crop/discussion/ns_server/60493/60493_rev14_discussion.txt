Patch Set 14: -Code-Review

Sorry, Pavel, there was some discussion outside the ticket on this one and the Rob updated the ticket with the proposal. Summary is that we keep the clusterName in community and just add a label next to the cluster name saying "Community Edition" or "Enterprise Edition" as appropriate. Can you check Rob's mockup that he attached to the ticket and see his comment?
