Line:20, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/list/item/mn_buckets_list_item.html -> Shouldn't this be ((itemCount - nonResident)*100)/itemCount?

When I look at the UI it always reports 0% resident when all item in the cache are resident.

Line:20, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/list/item/mn_buckets_list_item.html -> Yes, you right but something wrong with this formula. In this particular case, itemCount is 0 and nonResident is higher than zero, so 

(0 - 2) * 100 / 0 == -Infinity
