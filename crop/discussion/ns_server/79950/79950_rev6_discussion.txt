Line:20, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/list/item/mn_buckets_list_item.html -> The arguments in the function call don't match the ones in the funciton definition. We either need to explicitly pass the item count and non resident items here or we need or we need to modify the getResidentRatio function to receive a bucket.
