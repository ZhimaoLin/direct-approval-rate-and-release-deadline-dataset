Patch Set 3: Verified

fixes MB-4611 case. But there's still some weirdness. I.e. curl -X PUT http://localhost:9500/default/_design/link3 -d '{"_id": "_design/link3", a"views": 1, "aviews":{"all":{"map":"function(doc){if(doc.type == \"link\"){emit(doc.created_at, doc);}}"}}}'

But I'm going to take a look myself.
