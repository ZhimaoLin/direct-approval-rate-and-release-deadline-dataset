Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(2 inline comments)

Left just some minor comments

Line:514, src/capi_frontend.erl -> I woud just:
not lists:member(att_reason, Meta)

Line:520, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Here I would validate that each member inside views is an object and that:

1) if it has a "map" property, it must be a binary
2) if it has a "reduce" property, it must be a binary

Also lets leave a todo about adding validation of the map and reduce function strings. This is future work convenient to have for user-friendliness.
