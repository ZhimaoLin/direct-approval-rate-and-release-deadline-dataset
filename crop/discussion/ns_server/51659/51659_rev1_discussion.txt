Patch Set 1:

I actually convinced myself that messages might be useful. One of the reasons, ns_log is rotated much less frequently than rest of the logs. Also the argument about rebalance failure message doesn't apply, because the actual message that appears on the log tab includes the reason, which might contain backtrace in it.
