Pavel, we don't want to remove this field. We just want to make sure that when you go to edit a bucket that the radio box is checked appropriately for bucket priority. The person who filed the bug incorrectly stated that the field should be removed, but the issue is really just that the radio box isn't checked when you go to edit the bucket.
