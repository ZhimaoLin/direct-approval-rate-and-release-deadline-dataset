Patch Set 1:

I  unit tested the change in following way. There was no actual break pad crash dump to collect or bypass so verified using log messages.

Verified cbcollect info from web console works fine. 
Issued the cbcollect_info using CLI and the bypass option. Verified it displays "Bypassing Sensitive Data: Breakpad crash dumps‚Äù.
When I issue  cbcollect_info using CLI, for some reason it cannot find debug.log and other ns_server* log files. I issued the command exactly it is done by web console but did not work. I do not think this is related to my change. May be need to set some env variable.
