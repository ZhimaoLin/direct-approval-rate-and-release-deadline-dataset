Line:1957, priv/public/index.html -> I assume the text has already been approved by someone, but personally I think this could be clearer - something like:

"This option controls the relative priority of buckets for disk I/O. High priority buckets will be prioritised over low priority buckets."

Dave, the text is from Anil. So work with Anil on what's best way to explain this setting. I tend to agree that new text is still not very clear, but that's Anil's "realm".

Pavel B - Lets change the text to 

"This option controls the relative priority of buckets for disk I/O. High priority buckets will be prioritized over low priority buckets." 

Thank you!
