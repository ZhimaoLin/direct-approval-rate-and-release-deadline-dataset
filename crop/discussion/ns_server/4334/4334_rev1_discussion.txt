Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'd like to be applied in generic way if possible.

If it's easy to replace implementation of our high-level dialogs API with jQuery UI dialogs, then we should do it.

If it's larger change, I think we should start parallel API in first commit. Then series of commits will convert all users of 'old' API to new. And last commit would kill old API, possibly renaming parallel API.

And I'd like to avoid specifying (and cut-and-pasting across project) dialog width in high-level ("business logic") code.

Also I'd prefer non-minified version of libraries if possible. That makes debugging easier.
