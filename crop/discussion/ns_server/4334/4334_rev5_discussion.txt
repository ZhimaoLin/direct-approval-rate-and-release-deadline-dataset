Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

still contains non-semantical change. And can you please document new API of genericDialog & friends, so that I can figure out why so many API users are changed?

Line:143, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/manage-buckets.js -> this is non-semantical change
