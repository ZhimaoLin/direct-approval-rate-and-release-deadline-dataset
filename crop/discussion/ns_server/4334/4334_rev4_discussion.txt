Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)



Line:419, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/app.js -> Why? It's a change to make the About form work with the new dialog system--otherwise it looks all wrong.

I'm wanting to make the change more general/set some patterns for headers with images, but right now we only have this one dialog (afaik) that needs an image in it--so that's why it's in this commit and written this way.
