Patch Set 9:

unfortunately this stuff breaks IE8. And I've noticed some similar artifacts in Chrome too.

Patch Set 9:

Was that screenshot taken in IE8? It looks like a CSS failure--which should be easy fix.

Can we push this through without that?

Patch Set 9:

I don't think we can accept major breakage in IE. And if we cannot fix it in few days, then due to lack of time we'll have to abandon this work.

Patch Set 9:

Did you confirm that this problem was introduced by the dialog stuff? Also, does it only effect that dialog?

Could you also upload screens for the "similar artifacts" that appear in Chrome (and let me know version and platform information).

Thanks.

Yes. IE8 is not broken before that patch. But is broken after.
