DESCRIPTION

MB-5307: implemented semi-official API for resetting node's state

Posting otpNode=zzzForce to /controller/ejectNode is going to cause
node to leave cluster, completely resetting it's state as if it was
rebalanced out.

Call will return _after_ eject completes and ejected node is ready to
process further requests.
