Collect HLC stats that are used in the UI to draw graphs.

A subset of the available HLC stats are being fetched so we can
graph them in the UI. These stats are provided to the UI only for
the LWW buckets.

Patch Set 1:

You need to change aggregate method for ep_hlc_{active,replica}_drift. Also I don't understand what {active,replica}_timestamp_drift stats are showing.

Patch Set 1:

Apologies for not explaining what the stats are doing. The {active,replica}_timestamp_drift are showing the average drift (node current time - the timestamp in the mutation) seen for each mutation.

So the ep_hlc_{active,replica}_drift and ep_hlc_{active,replica}_drift_count stats are being considered as "counters" and we compute the {active,replica}_timestamp_drift stats by dividing the above 2 stats.

I am testing the patch on master and hence I have not marked it as verified.

Patch Set 1:

The change looks good under the assumption that ep-engine changes ep_*_hlc_drift* stats be accumulated over all vbuckets.
