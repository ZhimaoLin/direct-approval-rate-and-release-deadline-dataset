Patch Set 12: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I am getting 404 for the previous spinners, might be just the preloader

Patch Set 12:

Yeah, it's the all_images.js file. If you kill that, you'll be back in business. Not sure how that'll effect upgrades and such. ./cluser_run will replace it if it's missing.

I'd prefer we drop it and/or replace it with sprites where possible.

Patch Set 12:

I like rest of the changes. But don't like constant chewing of CPU.

We quite possibly create bigger problem by doing this, than we solve.

Let's keep this out of tree for now.
