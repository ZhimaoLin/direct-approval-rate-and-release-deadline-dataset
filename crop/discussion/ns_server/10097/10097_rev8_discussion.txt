Patch Set 8: Verified

I tried the CSSOM-based approach again using the .style.property setup you described, but it chewed threw far more CPU than this DOM-based approach. This code bumps the CPU (for my machine) to 0.7-1.2% vs. 16-18% using the CSSOM .style.property update options.

I've also removed the .data('spinner') stuff as it's actually been superfluous (as it turns out) ever since I switched to the DOM-based app-wide spinner updating. Prior to that the .remove() function killed off the setTimeout connected animation function. Now .remove() is actually jQuery's .remove() for the spinner DOM element--which is what's returned now vs. a custom object.
