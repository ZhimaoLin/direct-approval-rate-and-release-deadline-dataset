DESCRIPTION

new spinner system using JS-driven CSS sliding doors

Transparent PNG sprite sheets are used to avoid the
overhead of creating animated GIFs and the ability
to apply spinners on any background color.

CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is used to update the
stylesheet rules rather than the individual DOM
element styles to avoid memory leaks and the
overhead of juggling (re)appearing DOM elements.

Patch Set 5: Do not submit

burns CPU like mad! can't allow that.

My guess is that more targeted rule manipulation will likely work better. Also we should find some way to avoid doing this at all when no spinners are shown.

Also using setTimeout each time is wrong. This way your periods will be longer then intended and jitter is larger. Use setInterval.

Patch Set 5:

Odd. Didn't burn any excessive CPU here. I'll switch to setInterval and see what I can do about toggling it based on visibility--which seems unlikely...but here's hoping.

Patch Set 5:

I'd try to find some way to count active spinners.

But most important IMHO is to find more proper way to edit only right property of right css rule.
