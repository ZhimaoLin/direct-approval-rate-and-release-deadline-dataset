DESCRIPTION

new spinner system using JS-driven CSS sliding doors

Transparent PNG sprite sheets are used to avoid the
overhead of creating animated GIFs and the ability
to apply spinners on any background color.

CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is used to update the
stylesheet rules rather than the individual DOM
element styles to avoid memory leaks and the
overhead of juggling (re)appearing DOM elements.
