Patch Set 6: Verified

There wasn't away to edit only a single rule via the CSSOM stuff. cssText seems to be writable, but only in IE and/or the W3C spec. Attempts to edit it in Firefox and Chrome were unsuccessful.

I've sense come full circle and am doing element updates, but basing the updates off of the visibility of the spinners.

I also tried setInterval, but that chewed through massive amounts of CPU (100% in IE 8, nearly that in Firefox 7, and 60-70% or more in Chrome). It was also shockingly jumpy compared with the same code using setTimeout. Maybe I missed something, though.

The final version animates smoothly in IE8, IE9, Firefox 7, and Chrome 15. It also doesn't modify the DOM unless a spinner is visible.
