Patch Set 3: Fails

I like your braveness about getting rid of prepareAreaUpdate. And in general it seems to work and looks nearly great. The only issue with look I found is that it's not properly vertically centered. But that should be fixable.

Most issue is that remove doesn't seem to stop animation (leaves code running in background adjusting style of deam DOM node).

I think easiest way to do that is by having only one loop that changes stylesheet rule and thus is not applied to any single DOM node, and thus cannot leak. Not sure if that's possible with jquery and easily portable without jquery.

and another minor thing. If possible set up your editor to avoid chopping EOL in last line.
