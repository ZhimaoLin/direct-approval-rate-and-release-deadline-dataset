unfortunately still not ready. Let's put this off for a bit and think what we can do.

Options I can think of right now:

a) automate animated gif building. We have power of rmagick and maybe some other things.

b) find a way to change stylesheet. I'm 100% confident that modern browsers handle changing stylesheet easily. Just tried that in Chrome. The following works in IE8 easily: document.styleSheets[0].rules[1].style.minWidth = "900px"

Line:301, priv/public/js/misc.js -> that's not saving us in all cases. Particularly we sometimes draw spinners inside container. Like for 'drawers' widget.

We may have list of servers/buckets with spinner(s) for server/bucket detail(s).
