Patch Set 2: Verified+1

[1] Unit tested the changes by instrumenting the ep-engine code to increment the stat once in a while (Aliaksey's suggestion).

[2] I am not sure if I have handled the upgrade path correctly. But the upgrade tests (swap rebalance and offline upgrade) that I ran all worked.

[3] The simple-test suite passes. Tested the patch on branch-master as well.

Line:440, src/ns_config_default.erl -> This is also, strictly speaking, is not required, since we are not upgrading the config.

Line:83, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> This will override user's alerts configuration. I think it's totally fine not to upgrade config. The new alert just won't be enabled.

Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)

Line:440, src/ns_config_default.erl -> We can just add the alert to the list and not bump up the version too right?

Line:83, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> Sure. I thought it might be better to set everything rather than miss some. But it probably will be more annoying to the user. Also for existing buckets LWW won't be enabled anyway. If the user creates an LWW bucket then he/she will have to enable the new alert.
