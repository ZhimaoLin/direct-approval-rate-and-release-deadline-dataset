Line:48, cbcollect_info -> I don't understand this part.

If you want to kill program just do sys.exit() or something like this. Why is it so complicated?

Line:49, cbcollect_info -> Just "import ctypes"?

Line:48, cbcollect_info -> We want to send a signal  to kill the spawned subprocess instead of collectinfo process itself.

Line:49, cbcollect_info -> Since we only need it on windows platform and i want to avoid the ctypes module issules on python 2.4, it is logical to put it over here.

Line:48, cbcollect_info -> Ok.

Line:49, cbcollect_info -> Oh, I didn't notice that it's only for windows. This is absolutely fine.

Line:56, cbcollect_info -> probably SIGTERM is more failsafe?

Patch Set 1:

I think Pavel had one more question about SIGTERM?

Also, any V for this?
