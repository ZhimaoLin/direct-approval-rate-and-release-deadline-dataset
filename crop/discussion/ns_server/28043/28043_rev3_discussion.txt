DESCRIPTION

MB-5904 remove passwords from XDCR logs

this removes only explicit logging of passwords

if you will start doing funny stuff during the
replication (like deleting buckets),
xdcr will start crashing a lot dumping
the state of different processes to the log files
with a lot of passwords in it. I don't see any solution
for this which doesn't require xdcr code rewriting
