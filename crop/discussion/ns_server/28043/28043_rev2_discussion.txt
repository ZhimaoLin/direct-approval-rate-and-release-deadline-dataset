DESCRIPTION

MB-5904 remove passwords from XDCR logs

this removes only explicit logging of passwords

if you will start doing funny stuff during the
replication (like deleting buckets),
xdcr will start crashing a lot dumping
the state of different processes to the log files
with a lot of passwords in it. I don't see any solution
for this which doesn't require xdcr code rewriting

(3 comments)

Please see my comments inline.

Line:120, src/xdc_vbucket_rep_xmem_srv.erl -> Please also dump bucket name in log

?xdcr_error("Error! Worker ~p (pid: ~p, vb: ~p) "
"failed to connect remote (ip: ~p, port: ~p, bucket: ~p)",
[Id, 
Worker, 
Vb,
Remote#xdc_rep_xmem_remote.ip, 
Remote#xdc_rep_xmem_remote.port,
Remote#xdc_rep_xmem_remote.bucket]),

Line:158, src/xdc_vbucket_rep_xmem_srv.erl -> Same as above comment. Please dump bucket in log.

Line:300, src/xdc_vbucket_rep_ckpt.erl -> This will omit the source information in trace.

Please change it to something like

?xdcr_debug("unknown source ~p in replicator state", [State#rep_state.source]),
