DESCRIPTION

merge all configs to dynamic when starting ns_config. Bug 1603

This is needed because ns_config:update processes only dynamic
config. The bug wasn't noticed earlier, because ns_config:set used
ns_config:merge_configs which merged all configs to single
dynamic.

Recent ns_config implements 'set' in more efficient way and it made
the bug visible. Adding node to cluster was broken badly.
