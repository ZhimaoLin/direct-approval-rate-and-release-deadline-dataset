Patch Set 1:

The wifi where I'm at to day is terrible, so someone else will need to do the IE 7 & 8 verification--VPN + Remote Desktop would certainly bring down the house...

I've set the styles so that the old IE's should get border and color styles while the new browsers get those + drop shadows and rounded corners.
