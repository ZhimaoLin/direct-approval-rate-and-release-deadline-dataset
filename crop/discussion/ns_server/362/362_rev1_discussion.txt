DESCRIPTION

use test/orphaner.rb to run local dev. cluster in 'foreground'

Nodes are still started in background, but orphaner puts each of them
in own process group with extra stopped process. This ensures that
when main process dies all of those (now orphaned) process groups will
be sent SIGCONT & SIGHUP, effectively killing them. Main process
(script) is suspended running cat.
