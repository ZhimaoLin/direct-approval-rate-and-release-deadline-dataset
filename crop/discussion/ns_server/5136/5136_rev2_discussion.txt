Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

See inline comments again. I should have pointed them out the first time.

Line:308, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> You don't need lists:append here. This could just be [<<NumPairs:16>> | [<<VBucket:16, Checkpoint:64>> || {VBucket, Checkpoint> <- Pairs]]

Line:310, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> list_to_binary handles deep lists, so you don't need lists:append here either.
