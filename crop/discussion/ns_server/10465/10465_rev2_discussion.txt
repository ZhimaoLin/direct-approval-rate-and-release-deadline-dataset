DESCRIPTION

Make XDC Replication Manager ETS Tables Public

We use a separate timer process to trigger the retries of failed couch
replications. This process needs privileges to update the replication
manager's ets tables. However, ETS doesn't allow a sharing scheme
where all the involved processes have update privileges. For this
reason, this change set makes these tables publicly updatable.

Also made the inital wait period 2 secs instead of 2.5 secs as the
timer module seems to throw a timeout_value exception for non-integer
values.
