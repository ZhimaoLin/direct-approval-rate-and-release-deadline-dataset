DESCRIPTION

MB-9745: delay second restart as little as possible

Rather than full configured restart delay. Otherwise with default
setting of 30 seconds we will only attempt restarts at intervals that
are multiple of 30 seconds.

This is achieved via supervisor2 feature of restart delay 0. Which is
implemented to wait until oldest restart expires.

This is then used to pass 0 as delay for second restart attempt.
