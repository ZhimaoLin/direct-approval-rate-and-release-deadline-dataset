Line:156, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Please change the REST API to be parsed as a form post. Use Req:parse_post() as is done in a bunch of places in menelaus_web. Let's have the form value key be "client_cert_auth", as in "client_cert_auth=disabled".

You should error if you receive form values with keys other than client_cert_auth.

Line:156, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> This is a problem as atoms are permanent in the Erlang VM. You should only convert to atoms once you're sure it's a valid binary. So compare first, then convert just before you call ns_config:set().

Line:160, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Can you change to "enabled" and "disabled"? It reads better.

Line:255, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> Can you put this part of this change and all the rest of the changes in this file below here in a separate patch?

Reason is that this is logically separate - adding client cert auth support for the CAPI and regular REST APIs. And secondly and more importantly - by checking this in we allow customers to immediately break XDCR by setting client cert auth to mandatory. 

We need to tNathalie Landry about when & how the XDCR work gets done and I think this is best done over a separate patch.

Line:273, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> should be: ssl_auth_options() ++ [{keyfile, ...}]

Line:409, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> change to client_cert_auth_changed

Line:465, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> remove these spaces

Line:160, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> client_cert_auth is passed to memcached as enable/disable. I think we can change it later and that time, it will be changed in memcached also.
