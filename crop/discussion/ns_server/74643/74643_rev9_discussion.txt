Patch Set 9: Code-Review-2

(2 comments)

Line:753, src/ns_config_default.erl -> This needs to be in your other change. 

Please also amend the existing 4.5.1 -> unit test for this as is normally done in ns_server and you should verify the actual upgrade too.

Line:546, src/ns_audit.erl -> Looks like you didn't try to compile before submitting.

Just to be clear on the ns_server process. We generally don't review until changes are marked as verified. Verification means that it's compiled, tested, has unit tests as appropriate.

Line:546, src/ns_audit.erl -> Sorry about this, this seems to some sort of foobar . We would normally compile and test with the unit tests before submitting the change. 

However, I wonder why these review requests didn't trigger a build. If it had then we would have caught this sooner.  It looks like we may not have the necessary permissions ?? 

The changes that Trond submitted on our behalf did trigger a build

Line:546, src/ns_audit.erl -> You should +V yourself after checking that it works and writing & running any unit tests as needed. Not all the teams have CV infrastructure in place.

Line:546, src/ns_audit.erl -> "+V" is informal usage for "mark verified +1".
