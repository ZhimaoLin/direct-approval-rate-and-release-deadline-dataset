Thanks Manik. In terms of going through the code review comments, can you start with the comments on ns_config_default?

Line:28, src/menelaus_web_mcd_settings.erl -> aren't needed with the change to base the memcached config off the single config key

Line:152, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> should use the function you have in ns_ssl_services_setup

Line:157, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> ditto

Line:158, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> binary to atom

Line:162, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> change to atoms

Line:165, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> remote these lines

Line:239, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Can you remove this? You don't need it.

Line:311, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Manik - I spoke to Artem and he had a good suggestion. We should change the client_cert_auth to wok along the lines of the ssl_minimum_protocol key. That is, the entry here in the memcached config template should be:

        {client_cert_auth, {memcached_config_mgr, client_cert_auth, []}},

Artem suggested that the value associated with the client_cert_auth key should be an atom, not a string. (So you don't need a format string here)

To make this work you need to add a client_cert_auth() function in memcached_cfg_mgr. Should be like this:

client_cert_auth([], _Params) ->
    ns_ssl_services_setup:client_cert_auth().

Line:204, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> needs to be an atom

Line:204, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> should be just the atom 'disable'
