DESCRIPTION

MB-2958: Make doubly sure mnesia is shut down before deleting schema

Occasionally ns_mnesia takes too long to shut down and gets
killed. Since it's harmless to re-stop mnesia, we just call
mnesia:stop again.

Also increased the shutdown timeout to reduce the chance that
ns_mnesia will get killed on shutdown.
