DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: Add REST endpoints & param validation

Add two new REST API endpoints and initial parsing / validation of
parameters:

* POST /collectLogs/start - Starts a log collection (if one isn't
  already collecting).
* POST /collectLogs/cancel - Stop an existing, already running log
  collection.

The status of log collection will be exposed via the existing tasks
API (/pools/default/tasks).

Abandoned

Alternative implementation went in. Again, please accept my apology for not working with you closely enough.

If you want to have exact list of issues that caused me to change my mind, just let me know.

Notably, I've changed API as well to better match our general style (form params versus json and camelCase versus under_score)
