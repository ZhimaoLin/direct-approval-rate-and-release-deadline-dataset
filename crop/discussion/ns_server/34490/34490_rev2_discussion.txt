decent start.

Not sure why you need DELETE. Also see inline for minor things

Line:318, src/menelaus_web.erl -> auth. not auth_ro. collectinfos might have sensitive information

Line:96, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> you can just move get_Value to case above and then match for undefined or not undefined

Line:146, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> I'm not sure we need this option at all. URL we have them might encode customer. And even encode it in secure way (like hash of customer or something else that's hard to guess externally)

Line:165, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> note that we usually do ?log_debug for debug logging.

Line:180, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> no need to pack false in tuple of arity 1

Line:221, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> struct like {struct. [{<<"from">>, <<"allnodes">>}]} is more comfortable for UI

Line:225, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> and therefore {struct, [{<<"from">>, <<"nodes">>}, {<<"nodes">>, [ xxx@xxx.xxx ]}]}

Addressed Alk's comments. 

Re: DELETE - As discussed in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPHNNIonFT33IfS5ae4_jsknjazP-gCEK69-qr9E4k8/edit# there needs to be a way for the user to cancel a log collection - if they decide they don't need the logs, or we hit some issue with cbcollect_info which hangs there needs to be a way out. I had mapped cancel to DELETE, but if you prefer a different REST endpoint or similar let me know.

Line:318, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Done

Line:96, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> Done

Line:146, src/menelaus_collect_logs.erl -> So the idea was to have the interface have the components separate, so if there were other upload methods / destinations in future we would still have the customer identifier.

re: hashing - I don't see why we want / need this - it's quite useful to be able to browse the S3 space based on the specified customer name; and to let the customer know the full URL of where the file(s) were uploaded to include in tickets etc.
