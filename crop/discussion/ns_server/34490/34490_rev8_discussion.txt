DESCRIPTION

WIP MB-10086 [auto_collect]: Add REST endpoints & param validation

Add three new REST API endpoints and initial parsing / validation of
parameters:

* GET /collectLogs - Returns the status of log collection.
* POST /collectLogs/start - Starts a log collection (if one isn't
                          already collecting).
* POST /collectLogs/cancel - Stop an existing, already running log
  collection.

Patch Set 8:

Addressed comments from Alk from Patch 6:

> There's no need to start ns_config in your tests.

Fixed.

> we often implement just_validate path for our POSTS. 

Added.

> Also make dialyzer fails.

Fixed - There's still a failure in `make dialyzer` at it's current branch point but it's unrelated to my changes:

```
couch_db_set.erl:99: Call to missing or unexported function couch_set_view_util:open_db/2
```

make test T_WILDCARD=menelaus_collect* also passes
