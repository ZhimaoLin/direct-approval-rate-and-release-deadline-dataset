DESCRIPTION

MB-10086 [auto_collect]: Add REST endpoints & param validation

Add two new REST API endpoints and initial parsing / validation of
parameters:

* POST /collectLogs/start - Starts a log collection (if one isn't
  already collecting).
* POST /collectLogs/cancel - Stop an existing, already running log
  collection.

The status of log collection will be exposed via the existing tasks
API (/pools/default/tasks).
