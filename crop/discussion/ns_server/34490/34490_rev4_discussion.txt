>> Re: DELETE - As discussed in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPHNNIonFT33IfS5ae4_jsknjazP-gCEK69-qr9E4k8/edit# there needs to be a way for the user to cancel a log collection - if they decide they don't need the logs, or we hit some issue with cbcollect_info which hangs there needs to be a way out. I had mapped cancel to DELETE, but if you prefer a different REST endpoint or similar let me know.

In that I case I strongly advise you to start with designing REST API. Describing all cases and all options. That will allow you to answer all kinds of questions like for example:

* what happens if you want to cancel log gathering using different host than host that initiated log gather

* can you expose the fact that logs are gathered on UI/cli? Including from any node in cluster?

* what happens if multiple nodes start cluster-wide gathering? Is that possible at all? If not how that's prevented.

I was assuming I could do something similar to how other cluster-wide activities (e.g. rebalance) are handled and have a single process across the cluster (on the orchestrator node?) which would supervise the log process on all nodes, using a per-node process to actually invoke cbcollect_info. If this is a vaguely correct direction I'll research how we handle rebalance currently and write up more details tomorrow; if not let me know.

> - can you expose the fact that logs are gathered on UI/cli? Including from any node in cluster?

Yes, this is the intent of the GET method on /collectLogs - see the functional spec [1] - I expanded it somewhat and perhaps you haven't seen those changes since you last looked.

> - what happens if multiple nodes start cluster-wide gathering? Is that possible at all? If not how that's prevented.

Again, my intent was to have the single supervisor process look after this.

Patch Set 4:

In that case you may want to use tasks API to expose cancellation endpoint. Which will be same as other long running tasks that are cancellable (e.g. compaction).
