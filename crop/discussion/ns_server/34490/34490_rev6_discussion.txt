Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Few comments:

* I see no value in committing stubs into code base. WIP in gerrit is fine in order to get feedback, but merging this stuff makes no sense until it has real business value

* Our cancel endpoints usually receive some identifier of cancelled task. In order to make POSTs idempotent.

* There's no need to start ns_config in your tests. We usually avoid that by having functions that are tested pure. Only thing that's needed for that is to make them receive config rather than have them do ns_config:get

* we often implement just_validate path for our POSTS. So that UI can nicely do continuous validation of whatever is currently inputted into form. But that's not a must.

* perfect REST API would check all fields and return all error conditions, and not just first error. But that's not a must.

Patch Set 6:

Also {ok, ConfigPid} is causing compiler warning. {ok, _ConfigPid} would work, but note that as I've pointed above I think it's better to just avoid starting ns_config in test.

Patch Set 6:

@Alk Thanks for the feedback - I wasn't sure if the general practice was to push partial things in or not, so I'll hold this back until more is complete. 

I think most of the issues you raised are self-explanatory; I've not used dialyzer yet so I'll see how I get on with that :)
