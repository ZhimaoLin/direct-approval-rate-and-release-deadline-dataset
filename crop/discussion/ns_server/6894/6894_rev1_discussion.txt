Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I'm assuming the name observing is done to handle a case where the "default" bucket is being recreated after an earlier deletion. Otherwise, I'm not sure the event observation is really necessary--could just check it on dialog load, perhaps.

Since (or while) we're wrapping "magic" around the name "default" this seems fine.
