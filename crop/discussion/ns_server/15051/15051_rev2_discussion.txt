DESCRIPTION

delete all node's unused bucket db files before rebalance.MB-5115

As noted in MB-5115 we were not treating partially failed over node as
'new' when rebalancing back in, which could lead to failure to delete
old bucket's db files.

Correct fix seems to be to get rid of _any_ unused db files on all
nodes at the beginning of rebalance.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

See inline. Otherwise looks good.

Line:376, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> delete_all_db_files must be changed to delete_unused_bucket_db_files here as well.

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)



Line:376, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> And from one of your later commits I see that these undef errors are reported differently on different OTP versions. I wasn't aware of this and since I developed it on r15, its format is the only one that handled. It should be changed.
