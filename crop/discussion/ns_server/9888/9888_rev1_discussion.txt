DESCRIPTION

don't load stats directory when not needed

Because we have a number of subscribers to derived cells (drawing
stuff in analytics) this cell gets computed, which results into
loading stats directory.

To prevent that we forcefully turn statsDirectoryURLCell (main source
of directory cell) be undefined when section is not analytics.
