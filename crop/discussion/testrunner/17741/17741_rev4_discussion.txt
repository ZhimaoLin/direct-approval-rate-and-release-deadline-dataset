DESCRIPTION

CBQE-280: full verification tasks for queries

Verification is done by first using the GenerateExpectedViewResultsTask.
This will run the query against provided doc_generator and return
array of expected rows.  This task can be run async while test is performing
other tasks.

Expected rows are passed to ViewQueryVerificationTask where the following
checks are perofomed:

-check for duplicate/extra ids
-check for missing ids
   + debug memory, disk
-check for key/value integrity if requested

(as seen in current viewquery.py)
