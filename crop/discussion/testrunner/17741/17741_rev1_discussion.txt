Verification is done by first using the GenerateExpectedViewResultsTask.
This will run the query against provided doc_generator and return
array of expected rows.  This task can be run async at start of test.

Expected rows are passed to ViewQueryVerificationTask where the following
checks are perofomed:

-check for duplicate/extra ids
-check for missing ids
   + debug memory, disk
-check for key/value integrity if requested

(as seen in current viewquery.py)
