Line:49, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> If we have a failed over node, will this wait_for_replication complete properly (instead of waiting 5 minutes and asserting)?

I will upload the new patch with more tests

Line:49, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> yes "if len(nodes) / (1.0 + replica) >= 1:"
in case of failover we want to skip verifying the active item count
