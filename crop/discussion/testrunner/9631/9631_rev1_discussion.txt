DESCRIPTION

Allow testrunner to have wildcard -t foo.bar.Test.* syntax

By using the optional ".*" suffix in the -t parameter, the user no
longer has to write a conf file during test development.

For example, to list the tests that would be run for a given test
class, but not actually run them (using the additional -n or NO-OP
flag)...

$ ./testrunner -t performance.perf.ViewPerformance.* -n
start logging to console.log
  cat console.log
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_100view_1node_10client
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_100view_2node_10client
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_1view_1node
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_1view_2node
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_autocompaction
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_mutation
performance.perf.ViewPerformance.test_rebalance
