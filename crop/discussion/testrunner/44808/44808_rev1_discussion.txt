Thanks Ritam!  Some comments here, also be sure to remove the whitespace created by your editor

Line:2, conf/security/py-ldap.conf -> for brevity, if skip-cleanup and rebalance are always true, set them true in base class as default and just provide here if you need them to be false

Line:10, conf/security/py-ldap.conf -> minor - remove tab

Line:2388, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> cleanup whitespace throughout modules
 
vim: %s/ \+$//g

Line:2392, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Recommend breaking this into different method per operation.  i.e.:

   enableLdapAuth
   clearLdapAuth
   addLdapUsers

Line:2409, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> If there can be multiple admins this should be a list:

self.currAdmins.append(user.userName)

Also in RestConnection class we can initialize this as an empty list incase someone tries to access it before it's been its been declared:

class RestConnection(object)
 ...
 self.ldapAdmins = []
