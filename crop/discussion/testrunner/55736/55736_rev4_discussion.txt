DESCRIPTION

CBQE:0 Introducing a light-weight cpu-memory monitor for testrunner - GuardRail

    GuardRail is a lightweight cpu-memory monitor that uses Couchbase rest API
    to know system health of all its nodes. Hence is platform independent
    and handles rebalance-in/out automatically. It produces a plot of cpu and
    mem usage for all nodes involved in a test in a multi-page pdf.

    * requires matplotlib v 1.4.1 or greater

   xxx@xxx.xxx cpu_threshold : cpu utilization % beyond which test will be failed
   xxx@xxx.xxx mem_threshold : mem utilization % beyond which test will be failed
   xxx@xxx.xxx plot_interval : time-gap in secs between 2 readings

    Note: lesser the timegap, more accurate the usage. Stat_logger is an in-mem
        data structure hence small values are advised for small tests.

    Usage: ./testrunner -i <.ini> -p guard_rail=True,cpu_threshold=80,
    mem_threshold=80 -t <any test>
