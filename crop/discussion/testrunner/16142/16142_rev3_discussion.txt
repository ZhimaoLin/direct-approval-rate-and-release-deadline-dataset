Line:197, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> I think this method would get reused at other places as well... 
we should move it to a common place

Line:199, pytests/checkpoint.py -> Saw it seperately..
re is not imported

Line:197, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> In another commit it gets moved to a rebalance base test case. If it has more general uses outside of the rebalance tests the we can move it higher up the abstraction layers. I want to wait until we need to do that though.

Line:199, pytests/checkpoint.py -> I'l fix this in another commit.

Line:197, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> I would strongly suggest we move this to some helper method.

All tests, wait for some stats before performing the action. 

Like wait_for_queue to drain.. etc.
Its better to move now, before it becomes too late.

Line:197, pytests/newrebalancetests.py -> There is no risk. It would move into the base test case if it is used everywhere. This wouldn't affect any test case that used it. I can do that now.
