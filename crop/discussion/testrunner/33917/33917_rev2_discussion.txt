DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2076: POC: public sdk in testrunner

demonstrating the basic adoptability of memcached ops from public sdk in place of in-house implementation.
Here I have done the set/delete method.

This is sort of a hack: public sdk is embedded inside of VBucketAwareClient.  Long term we want to replace that all together

Line:873, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> note sdk internally handles vbucket mapping. if we get NOT_MY_VBUCKET it's a real error

Line:873, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> The sdk version looks so much better and cleaner than the old version.

forgot to mention this implies libcouchbase and public python is installed.  will need to build in some backward compatibility before this is ready to be pushed - or all things break.

Line:874, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> indeed.  also realizing i probably don't need the try/except since default is to raise, but we may want to do something in the handling...ie maybe it's a timeout
