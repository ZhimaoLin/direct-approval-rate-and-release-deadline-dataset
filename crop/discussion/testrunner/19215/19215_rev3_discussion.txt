Line:723, lib/perf_engines/mcsoda.py -> The logic in the next code subtlely changed.  In the old code, we'd only override the input vbucketId parameter if a "vbuckets" was in the cfg.

In the new logic, it seems to always override the input vbucketId parameter, no matter what.  Perhaps the vbucketId needs to be passed as an optional parameter to the new get_vbucketId() helper function?

Line:723, lib/perf_engines/mcsoda.py -> It might be confusing passing in vbucketId or vbuckets into get_vbucketId().

Perhaps replace the caller with the following?

if not vbucketId:
    vbucketId = self.get_vbucketId()

It slightly changes the original logic, but may be easier to understand when passing vbucketId into header() from outside?
