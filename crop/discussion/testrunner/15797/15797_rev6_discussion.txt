DESCRIPTION

CBD-128 - perf: hot_load_phase uses GET's, not SET's

The idea is that GET's, while slower, will lead to more understandable
memory impact.  SET's, in contrast, will increase the disk write
queue, possibly ejecting other items that we wanted.

Line:39, pytests/performance/perf.py -> Does "1" stand for set?

Line:39, pytests/performance/perf.py -> Yes, it does.  But I was too lazy to fix up all the places that were already passing in "1" and changing them to "set".  So for backwards compatibility...
