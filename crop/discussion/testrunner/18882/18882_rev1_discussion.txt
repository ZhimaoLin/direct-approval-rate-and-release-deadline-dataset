DESCRIPTION

CBQA-25: Make couchdb pre commit tests nicer to run

There's a new make target for testrunner, that will run
the tests that should be run before every change to couchdb.
Run it with `make test-views-pre-merge`

The number of design docs was reduced in one test to make it
run faster (it runs twice as fast now).

I'd like to get a +2 (perhaps even a +v) from QE as it's their component. If someone additional should be added, please do so.
