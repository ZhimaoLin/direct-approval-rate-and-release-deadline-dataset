DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3622 : Add new nserver test cases to handle rebalance cancellation scenarios.
Added new tests for stoping the rebalance while in progress. Following test scenarios are added in the current patch:
1. Add nodes or remove nodes and start Rebalance. Stop the rebalance at various stages and validate the data and cluster stats. Finally rebalance till the rebalance is complete and validate the data again
2. Add nodes or remove nodes and start Rebalance while data mutation is in progress. Stop the rebalance at various stages and validate the data and cluster stats. Finally rebalance till the rebalance is complete and validate the data again
3. Add nodes or remove nodes and start Rebalance. Stop the rebalance at various stages and then start data mutations. Validate the data and cluster stats after mutations. Finally rebalance till the rebalance is complete and validate the data again.
4. Stop the rebalance after we failover nodes and rebalance. Validate data and cluster stats.

Incorporated review changes. Moved common variables into the setup to reduce number of code lines. Also removed accidental comment of the tests in the conf file in the last patch.
