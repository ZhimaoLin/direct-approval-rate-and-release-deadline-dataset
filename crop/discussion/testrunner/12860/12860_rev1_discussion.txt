Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This surely fixes the problem with cluster_run. The question is, do we need whole shell.start*()? Or could we get rid of the whole part? I prefer if tests run the same code on all variations when possible.

Patch Set 1:

We need the shell stuff  for  the Failovertests, with views..  the issue is that we call tearDown during setUp, this is to make sure we reset the cluster from the previous run.

Patch Set 1:

Running teardown on setup is also something I'd like to see removed. The point of setup and teardown is to have a clean state after the test was run. An additional teardown shouldn't be needed.

The solution for the failover test might look like this:
