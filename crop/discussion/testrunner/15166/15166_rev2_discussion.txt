Patch Set 2: Do not submit

(5 inline comments)

Some minor nitpicks in regards to PEP 8.

Line:333, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> This wasn't changed in this commit, but it's worth noting anyway: I wouldn't hard-code the bucket name.

Line:450, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> "...and don't have a reduce function"

Line:454, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> `== None` => `is None`

Line:755, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Python PEP-8's convention is to append and underscore to names that clash with reserved keywords, not to prepend it. Hence, replace all occurences of `_type` with `type_`.

Line:465, pytests/viewtests.py -> Rename `_type` to `type_` (also see other file).
