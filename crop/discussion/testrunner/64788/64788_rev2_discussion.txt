DESCRIPTION

Fix for failing document edit UI tests. Changed the input parameter of doc_name to new_doc_name since the test was taking the same input for both the old and new document created and hence the UI was throwing error for creating the same document. Also changing the error message to be caught for invalid document test since it has changed in latest builds
