Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

awesome! 1 comment inline.  may also want to look into why Hugo Blankenship is failing.

Line:88, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> suggest putting stat waiting in separate function so that other failover tests can re-use this.  we may also need to update which stats we check for and will be good to have in 1 place
