DESCRIPTION

CBST-22: restart nodes after failover

when a node is failed over it is still in the pool of nodes that can be added back to cluster, but since we stopped couchbase on the node, add_back will fail. so after node is rebalanced out, we should restart couchbase so that node can be reused.
