Patch Set 1:

Delete + recreating vhost and trying to establish connection to vhost, 7/10 times results in "Connection reset by peer" error. Also in some times, vhost doesn't get added. This is sporadic. So modified code to not add vhost if already present and to retry connection 5 times before aborting run.

Another minor change was to kill all celery processes which weren't getting killed when we did a screen kill.
