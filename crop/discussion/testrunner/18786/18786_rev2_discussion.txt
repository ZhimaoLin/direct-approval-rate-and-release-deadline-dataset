Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)

Please see inline question.

Line:221, lib/perf_engines/mcsoda.py -> This reminds me of the ctl['run_ok'] flag.

What is the difference?

Also, originally, I had intended for cfg to be static throughout the test and only cur and ctl had mutable info.

Line:221, lib/perf_engines/mcsoda.py -> it's special Event object shared between multiple clients.

and I don't mutate it, I just call its methods set/is_set.

I can use crl, for me it doesn't matter.
