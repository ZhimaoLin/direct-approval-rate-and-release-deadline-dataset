Patch Set 1: (3 inline comments)



Line:568, pytests/viewtests.py -> why do we  need check for membase for view tests?

Line:967, pytests/viewtests.py -> this is being reused from failovertests 
def replication_verification 

its better if we move to some place common as lib

Line:980, pytests/viewtests.py -> same as above... this api is defined at many places.. would be great to have them at one place defined..
