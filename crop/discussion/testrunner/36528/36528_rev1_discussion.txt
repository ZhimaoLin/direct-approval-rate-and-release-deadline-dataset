1. Deletes are optimistically replicated. So it would be good to test with just updates. Also, are 300, 400, 128 random values? What is the avg size of items we load? We can test with 0, <avgsize, >avgsize as optimistic_xdcr_threshold.

2. Also expect compressed value size and not the actual size to be compared with optimistic_xdcr_threshold. So unless you know what the snappy compressed value size for an item is, it's hard to say what should be optimistically replicated and what shouldn't.

3. In 3.0 we expect uncompression of docs by ns_server. Refer MB-10205. I recommend holding your changes before a decision is made on that.

Line:6, conf/py-xdcr-unidirectional.conf -> I think we can add more tests, once we have MB-10205 onboard. These implemented tests are specially for optimistic threshold, since we don't have test to check that.
