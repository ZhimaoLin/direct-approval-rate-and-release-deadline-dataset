DESCRIPTION

Added the Server-Analytics DP3 Cluster Management testcases into framework.
Made sure that all the DP2 test cases should work fine for DP3 build

Also addressed the CamelCase comment from the previous commit "80992".
Thats the reason there are changes in most of the files other than CBAS test files.
