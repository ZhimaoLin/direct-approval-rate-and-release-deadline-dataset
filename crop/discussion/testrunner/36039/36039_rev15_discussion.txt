Patch Set 15: Code-Review+1

in general, the structure change was much simpler than with the patch 11. your changes inconvenient: you have a lot of commits(it's okay), and a lot of changes(not okay). if you keep track of your changes, it takes a very long time (they can be divided into several: rebalance, failover, common verification, etc..). Unfortunately now I don't have enough time to check thoroughly everything. and in the next few days I will be unavailable. so I put +1( read as "0").
