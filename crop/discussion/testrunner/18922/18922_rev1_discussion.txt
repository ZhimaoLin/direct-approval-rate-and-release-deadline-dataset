Patch Set 1: Do not submit

i dont really like this conf file 
1- having more than 2-3 tests with 0 items is not a good idea
2- we need to exercise checkpoints > 1 ( at least 500k items in the cluster)
3- we have to have some tests that do dgm

having tests which insert 5000 items is good but really dont help us find bugs related to timings or memcached.

plus we tNathalie Landryed about cherry picking only few tests and running those as part of our current regressions.
for instance we dont have to run the test with all replicas now , or all sort of mutations.
