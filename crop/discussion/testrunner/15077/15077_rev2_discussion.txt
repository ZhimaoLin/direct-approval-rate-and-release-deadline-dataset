DESCRIPTION

Added three checkpoint test cases

This commit adds test cases that test to see if a checkpoint is
properly created after inserting a certain number of items, to
see if a new checkpoint is created after a checkpoint timeout,
and to make sure that checkpoint deduplication is properly working.

This commit also includes a new stats helper file and the
configuration file for running checkpoint tests.
