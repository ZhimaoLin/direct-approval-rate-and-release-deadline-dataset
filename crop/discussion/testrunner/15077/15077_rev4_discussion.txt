DESCRIPTION

Added three checkpoint test cases

This commit adds test cases that test to see if a checkpoint is
properly created after inserting a certain number of items, to
see if a new checkpoint is created after a checkpoint timeout,
and to make sure that checkpoint deduplication is properly working.

This commit also includes a new stats helper file and the
configuration file for running checkpoint tests.

Patch Set 4: (1 inline comment)



Line:146, pytests/checkpoint.py -> instead  of using servers let's get the list of nodes in the cluster and do flush ctl on those nodes.

for node in rest.get_nodes():
...

this applies to all other set_* methods as well
