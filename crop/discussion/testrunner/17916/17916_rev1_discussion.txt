Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(8 inline comments)

I will have a look at other classes after your rename

Line:1299, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> use /tmp

Line:1306, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> this is different for windows and linux so i would suggest having this as a constant and then have different values for linux and windows

Line:1322, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> do not add sudo here , remote_util detects whether you are running thee commands as root or non-root

Line:1325, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> lot of extra white spaces

Line:8, pytests/backup/OpsBeforeBackup.py -> rename the file to opsbeforebackup.py

Line:23, pytests/backup/OpsBeforeBackup.py -> remove mike or Roland Charles from this file . please use other names , you can use database names or names of cars :)

Line:72, pytests/backup/OpsBeforeBackup.py -> instead of using self.servers[0] please have a local varaible master or first_node and use that instead

Line:114, pytests/backup/OpsBeforeBackup.py -> didn't understand this part . please add comments to the code for verify results
