Patch Set 3:

Fixed the log message.

About the comment of crashing. I thought I leave it there, so you know why it is only 10 design docs. It restarted my X instance. It happens more often these days (since a Kernel upgrade). Hence I don't think it's a Couchbase bug, but a problem on my machine. The comment should be read as "feel free to increase the number in case you think it makes sense, but it won't work on my machine anymore".
