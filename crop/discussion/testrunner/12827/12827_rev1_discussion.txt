Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

(1 inline comment)



Line:71, pytests/viewtests.py -> One thing with parameterization being the next step - How about also having this _input var as a property of the BaseClass?  This way if we add new properties we could retrieve values with a helper function ...ie)

def get_test_param(self, key, default=None):
   return self._input.get(key, default)

can save for next revision
