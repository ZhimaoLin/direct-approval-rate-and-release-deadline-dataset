Line:280, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> the block for is not needed here

Line:248, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> in general, I don't think that this test should be modified

Line:253, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> you don't need failover_factor here, it exists in ViewBaseTests.common_setUp

Line:1249, pytests/viewtests.py -> I don't think that the test method should be modified. fix in stop_server will have to solve this problem

Line:2, conf/2_0_failover.conf -> conf should be as separate commit

Line:1491, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> why break?

Line:182, pytests/failovertests.py -> you don't need add failed_nodes here, you have 'chosen' that contain all faildover nodes.

Line:222, pytests/failovertests.py -> why break?
