Line:214, pytests/failovertests.py -> the main issue is in this func. We tries to create RestConnection to all servers that were set in ini file. But if any node was stoped before we get error - connection reset... So, the solution can be more simpler here:
create only connection to node that was passed in func( to verify is_ns_server_running) and don't check all other nodes statuses. 
func stop_server with param 'node' should perform operations/verifications/manipulation only with this node and shouldn't have any dependences with the state of other nodes.
