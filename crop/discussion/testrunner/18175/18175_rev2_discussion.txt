Line:648, pytests/xdcr.py -> Something really tirvial... 
We can all agree to follow the python commenting style for adding description to test methods ... 
3 single quotes ''' blah blah ''', instead of ###

Line:648, pytests/xdcr.py -> Karan, thanks so much for comment. This test is just for current use to test XDCR with rebalance and failover,  and Luca Rhodes will refactor the complete XDCR unit tests using new test framework. 


I feel it is ok to merge it as it is, since Luca Rhodes will rewrite them soon and correct all formating issues.

Once verified, I will add this conf file on regular Jenkins run[ will run until we get a new Advanced tests delivered]

Line:8, conf/xdcr-adv.conf -> initRebalance=False, is the temp fix for 1:1 cluster?

Line:648, pytests/xdcr.py -> I think, it should be ok, since we are going to anyways update these tests w/ QE test this week.

Line:8, conf/xdcr-adv.conf -> No, it is false because for all rebalance-in test,  we cannot do initial rebalance at the beginning to build the cluster. Otherwise, we have no node to rebalance in (all nodes are already in cluster).
This is requirement for rebalance-in test.

For skipping rebalance in for 1:1 cluster, that is optimization for all 1-1 test to save some test time. It is a difference issue.

Line:864, pytests/xdcr.py -> this should compare with replica_count+1 and not 1. 
On source side you should at least have replica_count +1 nodes. 

Otherwise, you are going to loose all replica items.

Line:864, pytests/xdcr.py -> For 2-2 replication, we can fail over 1 node from source cluster, right?

Line:864, pytests/xdcr.py -> Yes. thats right... 

I see.. ur are testing with replica=1... then it should be fine.. 
but with replica=2.. you should see data loss..

Karan, thanks a lot for bringing up the replica issue.

Current code is ok for functional testing. Luca Rhodes, when you refactor the xdcr test, please keep Karan's comment in mind. 
Thanks.
