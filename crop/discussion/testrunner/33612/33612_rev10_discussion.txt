Patch Set 10: Code-Review+2

Looks fine,  I can see the motivation to cleanup expiry lookups.  Still there is overhead of setting expiration state which behaves more like side-effect of getting valid or deleted keys.  That is - we don't expire keys unless asked to do so.  would be cool if we could inherit thread and have bg loop to set expiration states, tho perhaps involves more complex locking, and i just wanted to have an opinion :)
