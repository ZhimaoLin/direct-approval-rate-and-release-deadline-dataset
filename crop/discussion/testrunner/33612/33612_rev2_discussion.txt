we don't need Partition class to be thread safe. kvstore has n partitions that are thread safe. please see "class LoadDocumentsTask" as example: partition = self.kv_store.acquire_partition(key). 
You should have good reasons for such changes, and further proof that there is no worsening performance or dead locks, etc
