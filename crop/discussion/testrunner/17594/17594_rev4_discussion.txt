Line:99, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> invalid_view_name_list = ["", "#","{"",'V'*2000]

Instead of append.  Also, this should be defined in view_base.py for use in other invalid tests.

Line:103, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> If this doesn't throw exception test should be set to fail:

self.fail("server allowed creation of invalid view")

Line:117, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> ws

Line:198, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> for task in create_tasks + tasks:
    task.result()

Line:209, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> this test can be consolidated with previous test that does parameterized ops in parallelâ€¦except this time passing in 2 ops:
ddoc_ops = ["update", "delete"]

for op in ddoc_ops:
   task = self._async_execute_ddoc_ops('default', op, ...)
