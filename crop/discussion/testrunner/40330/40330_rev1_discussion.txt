Line:1169, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> This line was the main culprit. Random partition shouldn't be used. Evenif key is not present acquire_partition could be used. Verified from _unlocked_created() data load function.

Line:1187, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Return were not needed as changes are done in the KVStore itself.
