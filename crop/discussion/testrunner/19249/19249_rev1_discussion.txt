Line:45, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> How does merge_buckets apply on uniXDCR?

Line:186, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> self.expires on creates to be zero everywhere.

Line:210, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> self.verify_results() used here?

Line:243, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> this should also be self.verify_results?

Line:174, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Nice!

Line:429, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> create should be with "0" as self.expires as well.
