Emerson Duke, here are my comments - are you planning to update a new patch set?

Line:237, lib/sdk_client.py -> why do we need these changes?

Line:261, lib/tasks/task.py -> create_bucket function in rest_client.py takes lww = True/False as param. There is no conflict_resolution param.

Line:261, lib/tasks/task.py -> I originally did it this way and converted to boolean downstream, but good point, I will fix this in the next commit.
