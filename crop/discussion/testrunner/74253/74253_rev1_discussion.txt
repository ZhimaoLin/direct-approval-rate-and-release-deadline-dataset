Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Hi Emerson Duke, we should add all the new tests for Spock to the following files - 
py-multi-node-sanity-new-feat.conf
conf/py-4node-sanity-new-feat.conf

Let us first ensure these new tests work properly on QE sanity rather than running them directly with Build sanity too.
