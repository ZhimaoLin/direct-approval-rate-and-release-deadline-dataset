Please don't touch code that are not related to new implementation

it's difficult to track the changes and history lost

Patch Set 3:

It is now necessary to re-structure the code (Nothing is removed from the function, nor function definition is changed), only function is moved because of below reasons:

1. There is no logical grouping of similar functions so its become difficult to read the flow of the code. E.g. verify_results() in the xdcrbasetests class but verify_all_buckets are present in XDCRReplicationBaseTest class.

2. Functions related to replication should be moved XDCRReplicationBaseTest from its Base class e.g. merge_buckets etc. and vice-versa e.g. async_failover. 

3. Currently there is lot of redundant code managed within XDCR tests, which is causing issues in implement new test cases for new features. E.g. Mix of pause and resume with rebalance scenarios.

4. Miscellaneous scenarios is hard to implement in the current scenario. 

There are more such points. I agree with you that history might get lost but no major changes are done.
