Thanks Parag!  I have a few requests before submission.  Also I want to chat with you about the original plan we had to send emails from a service that runs outside of system testâ€¦.

Line:169, pysystests/app/systest_manager.py -> also send mail if phase completes

Line:186, pysystests/app/systest_manager.py -> ws

Line:202, pysystests/app/systest_manager.py -> put into SMTP client and call from sendEmail.

Line:5, pysystests/testcfg.py -> lets remove EmailFrom and use only EmailTo

Line:11, pysystests/app/smtp_client.py -> formatting:  whitespace, no tabs

Line:5, pysystests/tests/simple_email_set.js -> remove these and use only testcfg.py
