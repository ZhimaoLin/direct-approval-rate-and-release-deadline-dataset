DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3879: use storageTotal Ram for containers

When running testrunner inside of a container the memory returned
by ns_server reflects the total memory of the docker host which
is often greater than the container itself.  This change looks
at the storageTotal['ram']['totals'] value to get the actual
limit of ns_server which more accurately reflects the environment
variable MEMBASE_RAM_MEGS.

This feature is only enabled when the 'is_container' param is supplied
