some minor comments

Line:21, conf/sg/sginstalltests.conf -> we don't need to comment tests  if they failed due to known issue

Line:52, pytests/sg/sginstalltests.py -> in this case you should use finally block( so that the user always has been added):

try:

  finally
           self.add_user(shell,"sync_gateway")

Line:75, pytests/sg/sginstalltests.py -> If you don't need 'output, errot' then you should not do the assignment

Line:89, pytests/sg/sginstalltests.py -> can we add _for loop here as well?

Line:124, pytests/sg/sginstalltests.py -> it's better to use loop here

Line:91, pytests/sg/sg_base.py -> not needed to return anything

Line:350, pytests/sg/sg_base.py -> if in some places function returns something then it should return always something

Line:388, pytests/sg/sg_base.py -> if in some places function returns something then it should return always something
