DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0:add support for indexStatus

This logic uses the rest api which displays index status in UI
To be used in sherlock and post sherlock releases.

The verification logic uses select * from system:indexes, buckets
and compares to <ip>:<port>/indexStatus

The main tests have been altered to use the verification logic.

Anyone who wants to use this can do so by following the implementation
