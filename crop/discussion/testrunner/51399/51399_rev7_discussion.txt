DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0:add support for indexStatus

This logic uses the rest api which displays index status in UI
To be used in sherlock and post sherlock releases.

The verification logic uses select * from system:indexes, buckets
and compares to <ip>:<port>/indexStatus

The main tests have been altered to use the verification logic.

Anyone who wants to use this can do so by following the implementation

The current implementation for 2i uses a flag :: 
verify_using_index_status=False (by default)/True
