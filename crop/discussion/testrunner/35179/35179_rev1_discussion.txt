Line:114, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> do we need to set recovery type for all nodes that were failovered? or we can set type on master?

Line:33, conf/py-failover.conf -> please put GROUP at the end of the lines

Line:980, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> it shouldn't be FailoverFailedException?
