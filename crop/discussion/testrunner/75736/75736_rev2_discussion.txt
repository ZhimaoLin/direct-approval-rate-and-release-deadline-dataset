DESCRIPTION

always auth as an Administrator when doing bucket operations

this is a temporary measure to make tests pass after buckets security
will be tightened.

the real thing will be: when creating bucket, create bunch of users
with permissions for certain operations and use these users depending
of which operation is being performed. I'll get back to it later on
