DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: _get_bucket_size without ratio

we twice underestimate memory for buckets:
1) in NodeInitializeTask  self.quota = int(info.mcdMemoryReserved * 2 / 3)
https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/lib/tasks/task.py#L121
2) when we create bucket (_get_bucket_size)

for example: if we are able to initialize cluster/node with 1000M then bucket will be created only with 444MB
1000*2/3*2/3
