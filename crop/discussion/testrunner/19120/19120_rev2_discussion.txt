Patch Set 2:

Also, please see the email from Zackery Barr, regarding "improving commit message"


All,

noticed that recently the commit messages and descriptions of reviews are too minimal and hard for anyone to understand
1- what each commit does
2- what is it fixing
3- what are the side effects of this commit

this does not include commits around *.conf or *.ini files but anything else needs to be well documented and describes.

for instance the last 10 commit messages to test runner don't seem too helpful.  please note that almost all of these changes lack the description and they only contain a one line subject.
