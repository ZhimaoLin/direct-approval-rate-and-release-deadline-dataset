DESCRIPTION

CBQE-379 Create new test cases for CAS functional test

CAS value manipulation by update, delete, expire test.
We need to verify whether the memchached client operations
set, get, and delete works properly and retun a valid CAS value.

For delete(), after it is called, the item cas is always reset to zero.
So we need to figure out a way to do verification about delete

OVerall looks good.. minor comments.

Line:19, pytests/castest/cas_base.py -> Do client close in tearDown.. to avoid any memory leak..

Line:58, pytests/castest/opschangecas.py -> dont raise exepcetion here.. .. catch all the errors. and then fail the test
