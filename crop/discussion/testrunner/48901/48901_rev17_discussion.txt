DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2725: Improvement for concurrency in 2i tests

Improvement for concurrency in 2i tests

Add parameters for query verification
- verify_explain_result
- verify_query_result

The recovery tests have different phases
- before is now initial
- in_between is not initial

So phases are as follows:
initial -> before
           -> event to be tested (e.g. rebalance) + in_between
             -> after

For querying we can not choose to verify results or not

parameters that control this pick:
do_not_verify_query_result, verify_query_result,
 verify_explain_result, do_not_verify_explain_result
