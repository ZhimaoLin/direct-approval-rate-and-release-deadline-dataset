Patch Set 1:

(2 comments)

Line:2100, lib/tasks/task.py -> 50 sec is enough. I guess if compaction is not started after 1 min, it should be a bug

Line:34, conf/py-xdcr-rebalance.conf -> are you sure that to create views in swap_rebalance_replication_with_view_queries_and_ops we need waits 6 mins?
