Is it correct implementation?

Patch Set 6:

Pavel:
1)see http://review.couchbase.org/#change,19384
2) fixed

Farshid:
localhost( or 127.0.0.1) is changed in pool/defaul everywhere on network IP address when we use cluster_run and rebalance in some nodes.

and vice versa for the case when in case of non cluster_run: nodes will have diff ips and the same ports.

 So, to find needed node I use the port and use separate logic.
