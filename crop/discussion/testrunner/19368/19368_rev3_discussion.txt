Patch Set 3:

Andrei,

as we discussed its better to not distinguish between cluster_run or non cluster_run evnironment based on localhost or 127.0.0.1 .

we sometimes run testrunner against cluster run that is running remotely.

please make those minor changes as we discuss to discover the capi port by visiting pools/details.
