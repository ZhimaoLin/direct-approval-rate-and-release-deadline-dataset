Line:360, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> I think timeout needs to be passed here in result as the check function logic in ViewQueryTask depends on this

Patch Set 1:

I agree here with Maliyah Fischer, but I think we should do this in another commit since we really need to add timeout parameters to all of the synchronous functions in the Cluster class. I propose making the default None for no timeout.
