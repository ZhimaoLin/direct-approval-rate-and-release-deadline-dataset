Patch Set 3: Fails

Patchset 3 doesn't work for me on Linux at least, still same issue:

Did a repo sync of whole couchbase, and then cherry picked patchset 3 from here.

Patchset 2 worked on my macbook however, but patchset 2 doesn't work either on Linux for me, same issue as patchset 3.

Let me know if you want new logs.

Patch Set 3: No score

Forget about the failure, I confused this change with the one that fixes the crash by using the smart client instead.
