Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved

(2 inline comments)



Line:849, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> can you also add some python style comments to this method

Line:850, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> it will be too slow to invoke rest api for each get_doc_metadata check
let's pass num_vbuckets as input to this function
