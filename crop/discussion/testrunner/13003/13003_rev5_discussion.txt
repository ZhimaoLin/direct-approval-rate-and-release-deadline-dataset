Patch Set 5:

uh, next time I shouldn't try this on a Saturday morning.  I should have just used the -1 feature rather than freaking out at my mistakes.  The last patch set is hopefully good.

Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

thanks Steve.
looking at the code seems like we are setting the backoff to true in case of any failure now and then reset the awareness

if reset awareness also throws an exception we simply return and next batch will try again

based on my understanding the change seems right. i will monitor the run as well
