DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2558:: Support for mutations+queries with expected result change dynamically

We can define parameters for kv operations
- doc_ops=True/False
- create_ops_per = percentage of total items we will add more
- delete_ops_per = percentage of current items that will be deleted
- updated_ops_per = percentage of current items that will be updated
- expiry_ops_per = percentage of current items that will be expired
- expiry=<time for expiry>

We will be changing recovery tests and index scans for the same

For updates, we will shuffle key, value pair mapping
