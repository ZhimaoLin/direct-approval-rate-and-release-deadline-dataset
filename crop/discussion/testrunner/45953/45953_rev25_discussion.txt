DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2558:: Support for mutations+queries with expected result change dynamically

We can define parameters for kv operations
- doc_ops=True/False
- create_ops_per = percentage of total items we will add more
- delete_ops_per = percentage of current items that will be deleted
- updated_ops_per = percentage of current items that will be updated
- expiry_ops_per = percentage of current items that will be expired
- expiry=<time for expiry>

We will be changing recovery tests and index scans for the same

For updates, we will shuffle key, value pair mapping. This is added to document generators for data :: sales, employee, sabre, and simple. All previous scenarios (without using isShuffle) are supported. 

We will later add changes to tasks.py which can support ops where we do not use generators but read data from files. And mutate them and add back.
