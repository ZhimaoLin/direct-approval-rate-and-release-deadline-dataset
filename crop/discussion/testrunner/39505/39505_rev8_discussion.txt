Patch Set 8: -Code-Review

Works now

This patch covers a logic that checks the distribution of vbuckets (active and replica) after failover and rebalance.

We have made changes to rebalance and failover tests.

It is important we pass parameter:: total_vbuckets in the test case and this is used to validate the total count of vbuckets during

We also check if the distribution of vbuckets stays almost the same across different nodes

Here are the runs done with the implementation
