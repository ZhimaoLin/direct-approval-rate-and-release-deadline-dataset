Line:20, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> we already have self.vbuckets in basetestcase

Line:12, pytests/rebalance/rebalance_base.py -> the same

Line:1125, pytests/basetestcase.py -> there is only one difference vb_distribution_analysis_after_failover V vb_distribution_analysis_after_rebalance: replica_result["total"] ==(<) total_vbuckets?

vbuckets will force the cluster to a particular total vbuckets and bounce each server. However, we do not want this always. So I have given a separate param: total_vbuckets.

Line:1125, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Are you recommending to have one method?
