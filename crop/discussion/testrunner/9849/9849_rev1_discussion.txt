Patch Set 1:

looks good.
but it will significantly add to the execution time.
we should either randomly verify 10k keys to parallelize this verification

whichever you think its easier for now

also you will make the same change to failover tests ? :)

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I will add that as a separate checkin. 
do we need failovertests to have keys_count, replica tags in the conf files or just the verification part?
