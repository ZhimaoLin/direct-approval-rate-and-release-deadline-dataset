DESCRIPTION

MB-100: add checking seqno=0 in revision verification

The seqno should never be 0 in anycase, today the verification code
jsut compares the seqno on source and destination side but does not
check if it is 0 or not. This change-set will fix that and also add
logs on the progress of verification, which may take quite long for
large number items.
