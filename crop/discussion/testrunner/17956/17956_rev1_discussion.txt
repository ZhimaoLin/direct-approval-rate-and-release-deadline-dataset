Line:7, pytests/backup/backup_base.py -> here you can create self.master = self.servers[0]

Line:1299, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Can we not hardcode this... 

default it to backup_location='/tmp/backup'

allow user to specify the backup location from the conf file

Line:1303, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> more this to testconstants.py

Line:1307, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> I dont think the windows path is correct here.

Line:1318, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Same as backup function

Line:1320, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> testconstants.py

Line:18, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Dont use self.master... the previous implementation is alright.
