DESCRIPTION

MB-5861: XDCR unit test with rebalance at destination cluster

This change-set introduces a few new XDCR unit tests in testrunner.
They will test XDCR with rebalance-in, rebalance-out, and failover at
destination cluster. Please note in the test of rebalance-out as
well as the failover test, we only kick out non-master nodes due to
limitation of XDCR at this time. We will add more tests covering
rebalancing out and failover master node of destination cluster later.
