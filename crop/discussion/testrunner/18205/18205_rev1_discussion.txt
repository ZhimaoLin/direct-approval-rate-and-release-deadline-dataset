DESCRIPTION

MB-5861: XDCR unit test with rebalance at destination cluster

This change-set will check in two new XDCR unit tests in testrunner.
They will test XDCR with rebalance in and out at destination cluster.
Please note in the test of rebalance-out, we only kick out non-master
nodes due to limitation of XDCR at this time. We will add more tests
covering rebalancing out master node of destination cluster later.
