DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2338: MemcachedError: Memcached error #7 'Not my vbucket' wrongly raised by testrunner code

async_load_all_buckets for some reason had default batch_size as 1 which caused Set() to be invoked instead of SetMulti(). Data helper's Set() is designed to throw an exception if NOT_MY_VBUCKET is encountered more than 5 times per vbucket. When the server is rebalancing,this is common. SetMulti() handles this correctly. Therefore changing batch size to 1000 to allow batch loading and correct handling of
this memcached error.

Patch Set 3:

why can we not change batch_size in xdcrbase tests for async_load_all? pause-resume also uses same method and now I'm getting not_my_vbucket from pause-resume code. Future implementations will run into same issue if batch size is not specified. Moreover there's no point in keeping batch_size as 1 in baseclass. Like other loading methods, we should maintain a batch_size of 1000.

Patch Set 3:

Please refer to this review task: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/37118/  -> Changing in base class will require additional testing of XDCR test code then as all updation/deletion code also used same path.
