Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Also, it's more pythonic.  :)

I've noticed things like this, too:

   if len(something) > 0:

as opposed to

    if something

That also makes a huge difference in some cases. len(x) can be O(n) where bool(x) is O(1) (I've built data structures in python where this is true).

(all these things are covered in pep 8, and everyone who touches python should at least skim over pep 8)

Patch Set 2:

We  have been trying to make sure that pep8 is followed before checkin in the code.. needs to be enforced even more..
