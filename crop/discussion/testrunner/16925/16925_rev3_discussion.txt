A few minor comments. Also, please fix whitespace.

Line:33, lib/couchbase/document.py -> This is good for now, but we might want to think about holding Views as a set instead of a list. That's for a future commit though.

Line:570, lib/tasks/task.py -> Can we combine these two try statements? Ex.

I might be wrong here on the python syntax.

Line:575, lib/tasks/task.py -> if not status

Line:602, lib/tasks/task.py -> Are you sure we only want to try once? Maybe we should reschedule to see if the deletion just takes a second.
