Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)

looks good.

few comments regarding the changes to direct_client and mcsoda but the test logic seems right to me

Line:475, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> looks good.

Line:644, pytests/performance/mcsoda.py -> let's not hardcode these values here.
the caller needs to pass user and password

Line:268, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> didn't understand this part ?

Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments)



Line:644, pytests/performance/mcsoda.py -> Done

removing administrator/password. i seems to make sense to still allow automatic assumption of the default bucket though.

Line:268, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> nodes/self does not return if it is called with the bucket name/password (as opposed to the cluster username/password)

however, default/pools does respond to those credentials

i believe smartclients need to use the bucketname/password
