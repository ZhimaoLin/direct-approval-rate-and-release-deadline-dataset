Line:91, pytests/2i/offset_distinct_2i.py -> This method uses a similar code as the test_with_offset_0_and_limit_0. It would be good if you can have a common method and then parameterize the limit and offset value so that we can minimize duplication of code. Pls consider other methods also which uses the common code

Line:117, pytests/2i/offset_distinct_2i.py -> I think this code is common to a lot of methods maybe with some variations. If this could be in a separate helper method, that would avoid code duplication.

Line:665, pytests/2i/offset_distinct_2i.py -> If this code is common to other Distinct testcases, pls consider moving it to a helper method and reuse the code to avoid duplication

Line:911, pytests/2i/offset_distinct_2i.py -> Is this intentionally commented out?
