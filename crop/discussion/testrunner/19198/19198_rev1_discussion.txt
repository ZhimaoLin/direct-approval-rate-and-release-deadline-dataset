Line:52, pytests/rebalance/rebalanceinout.py -> What is the difference between verify all buckets and verify stats all buckets?

we can't create bucket with size less then 100 MB. Tested on nodes with 2 GB, 12 buckets were created and test passed without crashing

yes i think this test should not be run on any node less than 8  GB , the purposes of this test is to do EVERYTHING
load data , do some views , 1 ddoc , 1 view , and then query all buckets on maybe 4 node cluster and see if it actually works

test will be expanded with the addition of ddoc, view + view queries?

Line:52, pytests/rebalance/rebalanceinout.py -> _verify_all_buckets - verifies data key/value
_verify_stats_all_buckets - verifies stats: curr_items, vb_active_curr_items, vb_replica_curr_items, curr_items_tot
