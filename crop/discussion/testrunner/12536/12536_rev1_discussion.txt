DESCRIPTION

Make non-blocking rebalancing possible.

Currently the helper methods to create or destroy a cluster
block the function until the rebalancing is finished. This
commit adds an optional parameter, to make the call non-blocking,
i.e. the call returns immediately, which might be before the
rebalancing is finished.
