DESCRIPTION

CBQE-4004 : Fix the way we find the time when a failure was injected to a node in the Autofailover Tests.
Added new task that will calculate the exact time when a failure is injected to the node independently of the AutoFailoverNodeFailureTask. Now using the new task to find the exact time when the failure was injected and using it in the AutoFailoverNodeFailureTask to calculate the timeout period for the tests.
Also changed the way we stop memcached process in the Autofailover tests (instead of just killing the process, we are stopping the process and restarting it after the test is done).

Line:77, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverBaseTest.py -> Catch a particular exception instead of keeping it open ended since nothing has been done after catching any kind of exception

Line:4659, lib/tasks/task.py -> method parameter should not have empty list as default value

Line:77, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverBaseTest.py -> Not fixing this one since I am expecting this to fail for a wide range of reasons. Hence catching this in a generic exception. Also this is expected to fail for most of the time and hence not doing much other than continue with next operation.

Line:4659, lib/tasks/task.py -> Done

-------------------------------------
