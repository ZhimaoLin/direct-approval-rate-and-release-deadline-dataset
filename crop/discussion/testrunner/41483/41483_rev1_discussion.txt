Patch Set 1:

Aruna, this is very initial design.

1. We will create a new xdcrnewbasetests.py at first and go ahead with changes in other uniXDCR, biXDCR.py respectively.
2. Till xdcrbasetests.py will remain there as other components are using it.
3. I am sure initial design is not perfect.
4. Once design will be fix, implementation will not take much time, as it will be mostly logical copy paste from xdcrbasetests.py.

Left some comments. Since this is a skeleton, pls merge.

Line:40, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> Add methods for killing erlang and memc?

Line:103, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> to inherit Cluster class?

Line:126, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> some other name maybe? The current base class is called XDCRBaseTest()

Line:141, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> let's have classes for these topologies as opposed to having a method. The setup() in these classes could take care of initializing the clusters as per topology.
