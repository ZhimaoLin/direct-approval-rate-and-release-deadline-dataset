Line:22, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> remove whitespaces

Line:25, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> unnecessary, BaseTestCase have such attribute

Line:26, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> same as above

Line:56, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> may be we can just put it in setup?

Line:62, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> self.master is already available in basetestcase

Line:64, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> what is var? i mean we don't use it, so can we just delete it?

Line:74, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> see above

Line:76, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> why there are two same rows

Line:83, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> and one more shell

Line:85, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> why exactly one?

Line:89, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> in the log is good to point exact ip

Line:103, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> remove whitespaces

Line:105, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> can we just raise exception in rename_node function? and then catch it here

Line:107, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> you can do it in cycle, or use hostname and errors as parameters of test

Line:118, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> add shell disconnect

Line:120, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> this one is not the right way, you should get domain part from for example nslookup, not hardcode it

Line:129, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> do we really need to run setup after renaming each of the servers and not all of them?

Line:139, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> delete whitespaces

Line:718, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> why we cannot just do get_nodes_self().hostname?
