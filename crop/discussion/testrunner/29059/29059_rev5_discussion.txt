(9 comments)

Line:5, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> remove this import, all variables that you need has BaseTestCase

Line:26, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> input variable already exists in BaseTestCase

Line:60, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> do we need declare empty hostnames? next row is enough

Line:67, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> may be just to use boolean instead of strings will be better?

Line:68, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> It is usefull to add to log which spesifically ip is not converted, I mean for which node

Line:85, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> add to log the error expected and the error appeared

Line:106, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> same as above

Line:110, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> disconnect should go in finally statement. In case if test will fail it should be disconnected also

Line:118, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> we should not hardcode domain part
