Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

Line:40, pysystests/testcfg.py -> see below. how different is COUCHBASE_SSH_USER from SSH_USER? Same for pwd. If you prefer to keep couchbase as prefix, make that change instead. There is no need to maintain 2 sets of credentials to ssh.

Line:11, pysystests/runsystest.py -> when did this get renamed to python2.7 on centOS? 

Do we run 
# python2.7 runsystest.py?

Line:13, pysystests/runsystest.py -> explain the need for passing username and password. Once set for linux and windows in testcfg, it is going to remain unchanged.

Line:36, pysystests/runsystest.py -> does adding 0 make any difference? Even if many params are passed, the flower braces are populated with args in the same order passed. More of a programming style not needed to add '0' while passing just one arg.

Line:253, pysystests/runsystest.py -> pls see comment on testcfg.py. This segment is not needed.

Line:40, pysystests/testcfg.py -> SSH_USER/PASSWORD is used for workers, seriesly, rabbitmq and couchbase VMs all. While for Windows Couchbase VMs user name and password is different i.e. Administrator/Membase123.

Line:11, pysystests/runsystest.py -> It is always python2.7 installed on the system, while python27 is link of python2.7, link may or may not present while python2.7 will always be there if installed.

Line:13, pysystests/runsystest.py -> commented on testcfg.py. If any better solution. Please suggest. One could be read ini file of couchbase vms.

Line:36, pysystests/runsystest.py -> Did you try it. I think only Python2.7 or later support this syntax. Not all Vms are upgraded to use Python2.7.

Line:253, pysystests/runsystest.py -> commented on testcfg.py.
