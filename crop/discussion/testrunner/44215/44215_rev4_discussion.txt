DESCRIPTION

CBQE-2515: Automation Framework for 2i integration tests and basic tests for recovery and index ops

- Basic API for automation of 2i tests
- Basic tests for scan, recovery, index-create, index-drop
- Tests defined for employee dataset
- Place holder classes for Bootstrap and cluster ops tests

Implementation Notes

Base_2i and Tuq: We have reused QueryTests defined by N1QL team since they have an infrastructure that works.
Base_2i is our base class for testing which extends from QueryTests.

QueryDefinitions: Define a query template, index used, groups for defining a query.
Once defined, we can define queries for index create/drop and related queries.

Advantages:
1) Groups help us tag the query definitions such as (using simple/composite indexes, range scan in indexes, type of data set used
i.e. whether we have group by/order by etc within the query.
This helps grouping a set of query definitions when running via test case.
2) We do not need to write explicit tests per query type - leading to code reduction, plus giving structure to our testing.
3) Query definitions are designed to work against any particular bucket, depends on their usability.
4) Can define query definitions for different data sets (employee as an example for this review)

Example: See basicindexops and recovery tests

Before, In_between, After: We have defined a set of query-based-events such as {Create index, Run Query based on index, Drop Index}
and subsets of these can be occur before, in_between and after a target-event.
This target-event can be an recovery operation in 2i, rebalance in cluster, bucket operation such as upserts.
By giving the ability to alter these basic operations of querying during our target events,
we can define different scenarios for testing per event.
This helps in code reduction and giving more structure to our tests where events occur during same time-interval.

Example: See Recovery tests

Line:1, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> not used

Line:3, pytests/2i/bootstrap_2i.py -> i think we need an import

Line:3, pytests/2i/cluster_ops_2i.py -> I think we need an import

Line:1, pytests/2i/indexcreatedrop_2i.py -> useless import

Line:6, pytests/2i/indexcreatedrop_2i.py -> those 3 import are not used

Line:24, pytests/2i/indexcreatedrop_2i.py -> self.query_definitions are not defined

Line:28, pytests/2i/indexcreatedrop_2i.py -> self.query_definitions are not defined
expected result won't be {}, it will be almost same, because primary index exists

Line:34, pytests/2i/indexcreatedrop_2i.py -> self.query_definitions are not defined expected result won't be {}, it will be almost same, because primary index exists

Line:1, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> useless import

Line:4, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> doesn't exist yet

Line:5, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> not used

Line:6, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> also is not used

Line:7, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> useless import

Line:18, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> what for do we use it, i see setup but don't see usage

Line:32, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> is it run_cbq_query?

Line:40, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> we iterate definitions but don't use query_definition? we do same operation several times

Line:45, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> we iterate definitions but don't use  query_definition? we do same operation several times

Line:49, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> is it run_cbq_query?

Line:52, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> should be under verifydrop also, otherwise will fail

Line:57, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> will not gonna work for all indexes, structure of explain is dynamic

Line:73, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> actual_results['results']

Line:85, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> self.query_using_index_run_with_explain ? instead of two rows

Line:100, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> this method seems to be almost equal to previous, may be it will be better just to have a param like with_explain=True

Line:107, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> same as above, we can use just a list of ops

Line:111, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> same as above, we can use just a list of ops

Line:151, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> already have this method for n1ql, it is a duplicate

Line:1480, pytests/basetestcase.py -> is it moxi also? usually it is kv only

Line:1480, pytests/basetestcase.py -> This is default node service allocation per sherlock release. Since servers[0] is not allocated as we begin  1 node cluster, we need to assume this
