DESCRIPTION

small fixes to view queries

One thing, I forgot to rebase in my last commit
and pick up Filipe's patch to descending queries.

Another is there is a bug in using inclusive_end
with reduce views that cause failures and so many
retries that I would like disable these until a
fix is ready - which i'm told is complex.
