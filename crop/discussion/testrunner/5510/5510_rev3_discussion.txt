DESCRIPTION

added logger to qa tests

logger object to create separate log file per test case

standard logging messages that prints out the time,
thread-id,class-name and other useful information for
debugging.right now we are using two handlers , consolehandler
and filehandler
consolehandler will print out the log messages into the console
filehandler will redirect the same log messages into the file
we can modify this file later to change log verbose level to
info for console and debug for files.
