Patch Set 2:

does it run ?
if you look at jira and search for 1.7.0-release-notes you will find out that upgrade from couple of 1.6.x version is broken . we need to take those out of the upgrade tests conf files

I see only 1.6.0 upgrades not supported in the release notes on membase wiki under 1.7.0 section

I am basically adding it to be in sync with the upgrade test plan. 
Let me know we can remove it from there as well.
