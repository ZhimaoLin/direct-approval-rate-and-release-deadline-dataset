Line:513, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Here it is actually not the best place to sleep. We do not need sleep 30 sec for each bucket we create.

Line:513, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> But you have told that buckets needs 10-30 second time to be ready for replication. Here each bucket is created for replication only. Yes, it is true that this code will be executed for Source cluster also.
