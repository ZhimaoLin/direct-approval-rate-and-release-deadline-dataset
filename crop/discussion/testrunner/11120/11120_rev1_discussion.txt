Patch Set 1: Verified

This was earlier done, so that if a build is not found, it will not uninstall the existing product. 

But this does not catch, issues in SSH/ or input params. 

We should ideally have a validation function, instead. 

This check would exit with error message that ' build not found', which is infact incorrect because of incorrect ssh params or soemthing else.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

So this fix basically unmasks other errors that may exist? This should be fine because if the build actually doesn't exist then we will get a failure later in the code.
