DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3675: wait until nodes total memory is initialized

before initializing nodes in tests.

This commit adds a simple function that repeatedly calls a
function until the function's return value satisfies an
arbitrary condition. This is then used in the node initialization
routine to wait until the node is ready to be set up.
