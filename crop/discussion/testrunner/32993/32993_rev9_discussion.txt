Line:2, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> do you need the import?

Line:889, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> what means "error_expected" = "create". It's means there are nor error? then it's better to use None by default for self.input.param("error-expected", None)

and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean. python allows it but it's not good to change the type of variable

Line:898, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> could you specify the subject of the ticket as well?

Line:979, pytests/clitest/couchbase_clitest.py -> are you sure that we remove certificate in 'default' folder?

Line:798, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> My suggestion is not modify common method to check rare negative tests. For example, new param uri is not  informative here at all. or the same can be done for "get_remote_clusters" and their requests will be the same
