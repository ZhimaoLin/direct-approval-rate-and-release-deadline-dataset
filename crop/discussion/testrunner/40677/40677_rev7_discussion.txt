DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: fix failure in tests :: rebalance and failover

1) Fix Query Failures when active resident ratio < 100 is used
2) Fix Data Loss failures since we do not check for replication before we start replication
3) cluster password change test case works for 1024 since rebalance happens slower for more vbuckets, meanwhile we can change the password. Doesn't work for 128 vbuckets
4) Removed active resident ratio tests where they duplicate per condition
