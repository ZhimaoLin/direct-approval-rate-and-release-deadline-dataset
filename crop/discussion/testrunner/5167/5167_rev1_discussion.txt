DESCRIPTION

test case to fill the default data bucket

logging + added a test case which fills the default data bucket

1- the test case will fill the data bucket with 10000 key,values
each key size is equal to bucket-empty-space/10000
in the tearDown() part we delete all the inserted keys to
bring the bucket state back to its original state
2- Added a simple logging class to use from now on in
test cases to print out messages with more logging info
examples :
each log message will have timestamp,thread_id,modulename
standard logging messages
in order to get a logger the test case can do
log = logger.get_logger('abc') to get an instance
