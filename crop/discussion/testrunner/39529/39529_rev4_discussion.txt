Line:32, pytests/autocompaction.py -> https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/basetestcase.py#L73

Line:172, pytests/autocompaction.py -> I think that self.nodes_init is correct, becase with your code we cover only one case: rebalance 1+self.nodes_in ( instead of self.nodes_init+self.nodes_in)

Line:256, pytests/autocompaction.py -> it's beter to use structure:
if true:
..
else:

Line:319, pytests/autocompaction.py -> the same

Line:450, pytests/autocompaction.py -> the same

Line:2303, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> please remove print or add log...

Line:3200, lib/tasks/task.py -> we can be embarrassing if we try to get nodes at the end of rebalance out. in this case self.statuses will still contain removed nodes. does it make sense to update self.statuses based on nodes in 'self.rest.get_nodes()' before next check's steps?

Line:3209, lib/tasks/task.py -> please use log

Line:3222, lib/tasks/task.py -> it's better to print message that we are not able to stop compaction
