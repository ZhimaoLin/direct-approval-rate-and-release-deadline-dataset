Patch Set 6:

(5 comments)

Line:289, pytests/autocompaction.py -> add shell disconnect at the end of test

Line:2299, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> extra whitespaces are still there

Line:2301, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> we probably have to follow same logic in all functions of rest_client
so probably we have to add here also possibility of having bucket instance, like:
 if isinstance(bucket, Bucket):
	api = '%ssomeapi/%s' % (self.baseUrl, bucket.name)

Line:3183, lib/tasks/task.py -> try:
            self.rest = RestConnection(server)
        except ServerUnavailableException, e:
            self.log.error(e)
            self.state = FINISHED
            self.set_exception(e)
if we don't try to catch exception here in case of server unavalability our test will hang

Line:3203, lib/tasks/task.py -> same as above
