DESCRIPTION

Add spatial tests that validate full docs

There was a bug where the spatial indexes didn't return
the correct geometry. This test prevents future regression.

If you could review/merge this today (your day) it would be great. Then I can rebase my WIP parametrized tests tomorrow (my day).

I forgot got mention, you need http://review.couchbase.org/13055 for it. The good thing is that you can verify both commits then :)

Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Ran some of the tests. 

spatialviewtests.SpatialViewTests.test_insert_100_docs_full_verification resulted in some server side errors.

Patch Set 1:

I can't see any spatial index related errors. and the spatialviewtests.SpatialViewTests.test_insert_100_docs_full_verification test passed.

I guess Karan neither saw spatial index related errors, else +v wouldn't make sense.
