Can you just make the changes I mentioned below.... small nitpicks..

Line:961, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> This is rebalance out

Line:1019, pytests/rebalancetests.py -> space between params (server, to_remove).
Python standard

Line:19, conf/py-181-kv-rebalance-tests.conf -> Does it do rebalance out as well?
