DESCRIPTION

mcsoda has separate doc-cache and doc-gen options

* doc-cache - cache generated docs for speed, but at a cost of memory.

* doc-gen - pre-generated docs at the start, before the main loop; and
  only if doc-cache is used.

If you're just doing pure data loading (ratio-sets=1 ratio-creates=1
exit-after-creates=1), then you'll want to specify doc-cache=0 because
cache would just waste memory.

If you're just doing GET's, the above options are effectively ignored.
