fixed couchbase-single-server linux installation

as part of the post-install step we also need to replace 127.0.0.1
with 0.0.0.0 so that we can connect to this instance remotely

Line:116, scripts/install.py -> This does not work if 
version is 2.0.0r-320 or 2.0.0r-320-g2c2cf61,
 python scripts/install.py -i ../junk/temp.ini -p product=css,version={version}

Also if version=2.0.0 it picks up 2.0.0r-176 which is not  the latest.
