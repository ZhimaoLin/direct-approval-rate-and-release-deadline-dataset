DESCRIPTION

Don't flood the console with not my vbucket msgs

messages (in my small test I received 80+ lines with the
following text).

[bucket_helper.wait_for_vbuckets_ready_state] : Memcached error #7 'Not my

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

I'd like to get someone from QE to approve it. For me less logging sounds good (given that testrunner really logs a lot).
