Line:302, pytests/performance/perf.py -> I think you'll need to product version here too.

db files, for example, from mixed-4-5 conf for 1.8 will be different than for 2.0dp4, and for 2.0dp5.

Line:354, pytests/performance/perf.py -> recommend you don't use too many aliases...

like snapshot or backup or cached files.  just pick one?
