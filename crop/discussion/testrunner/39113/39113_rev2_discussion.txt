Patch Set 2:

Test cases fail in current and previous couchbase builds.

There are two bugs associated with it. I had assigned them in your name

http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-11644

http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-11495

Also, the test cases related to mutation time out. We need to fix them before we start using them again. 

Thanks for your concenrn
