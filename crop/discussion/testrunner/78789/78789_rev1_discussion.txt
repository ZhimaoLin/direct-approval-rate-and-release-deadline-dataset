Line:23, pytests/xdcr/nwusageXDCR.py -> Why have node=None in the declaration? If default value is not mentioned and if calling function does not pass a value for node, python will fail the test anyways.

Line:327, pytests/xdcr/nwusageXDCR.py -> Use the already developed api in RemoteMachineShellConnection to stop/start couchbase server. This way, we should be able to run the tests on other platform too without much change since the API already takes care of stopping on different platform
