Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

Other reviewers, please have a look at my comments. Some code isn't very clear and I'd like your input if mine is clearer.

Line:88, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Please keep the line length < 80 characters. This comment is of course valid for all long lines.

Line:92, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> This is really hard to understand. Is it the same as?

    q.expected_num_docs = self.num_docs / 2
    if self.limit is not None and self.limit < self.expectes_num_docs:
        q.expected_num_docs = self.limit

I think my version is easier to understand, but I'd like to see if other reviewers see it the same way, please comment!
