Line:44, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> You should also check for the count of panics in logs in setup, and then match the count in teardown. If the count goes up, the test fails. If checking only in tearDown, all testcases would fail if even only 1 test causes panic.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:44, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> I have made the changes.  Some things to be noted
1) We don't fail when we find panics, its just FYI
2) Each test uses different host or number of hosts  of eventing nodes. Some might also be rebalanced out. We grep only the current eventing nodes in the cluster. So count values is not
