DESCRIPTION

Allow timeout to be set before multi ops

There has been frequent cases where async load ops fail with client side
timeout exceeded errors. Changes include increasing the default
timeout for multi ops to 5 seconds, however it could also be changed to a
custom value and using lock mode wait to support multithreading. Further
changes will follow to allow full multithreading support.
