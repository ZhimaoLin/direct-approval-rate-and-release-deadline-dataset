DESCRIPTION

Make view-engine test less fragile

The `test_stale_update_after_alternated_docs` test was using a sleep
to wait until the updater is finished. That's the wrong approach as
it may take longer than the sleep. Increasing the sleep also isn't
a proper solution as it would make the test run longer than needed.

The proper solution is to poll the result in a certain interval until
the expected result is returned. If not, the test fails after too many
retries.
