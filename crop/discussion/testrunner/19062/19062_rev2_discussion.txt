Line:17, pytests/xdcr-mod/xdcrbasetests.py -> This is the rebalance-modified xdcrbasetest class. Does this reflect any of warmup/conflict resolution changes that you ve made? If not, please upload the one, which has only your changes.

Line:218, pytests/xdcr-mod/biXDCR.py -> If this function is exactly same for both uni and biXDCR, can you move it to XDCRREplication class instead?
