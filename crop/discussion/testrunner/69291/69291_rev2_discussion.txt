DESCRIPTION

Revert "Merge branch 'testrunner-ng'"

This reverts commit 73fcc64ea1088ad9952bca4832f644ff0150f56d.

Reverting because of CBQE-3690 : To identify jobs and put in this param in the affected jobs is going to be time consuming. For now, I am reverting the change, so that we are unblocked on the build sanity part.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I've stated in CBQE-3690 that any job with this issue should set environment variable to use python_sdk.  
export testrunner_client=python_sdk 
I personally will not approve this change unless  we've shown that hanging persists even with python_sdk.  Nevertheless, if build team finds that unacceptable then go ahead.
