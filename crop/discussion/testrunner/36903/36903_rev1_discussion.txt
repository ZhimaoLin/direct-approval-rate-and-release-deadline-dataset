DESCRIPTION

CBQE-0: symlink testrunner.py from testrunner

testrunner cannot be imported in some cases,
particually when multiprocess creates a child
process in windows and tries to reimport the parents source.
so this creates a symlink

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This didn't work very well on my windows box. It ended up with a file called testrunner.py with the content "testrunner".

I guess it would be better to just rename testrunner to testrunner.py
