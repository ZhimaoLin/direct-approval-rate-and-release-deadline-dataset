Patch Set 2:

got it.  and is there any reason why the priority integer itself is avoided?  high instead of 8.  it's good for readability, but i'm thinking of case where i have 4 buckets with priority 4,5,6,7, is that valid?

Patch Set 2:

Per Dev folks, it looks like any number  <=4 is treated as low and  >4 is treated as high, the numbers is only for mapping during upgrades. So bucket with threadsNumber =1 is considered to have priority as a bucket with threadsNumber =4.
