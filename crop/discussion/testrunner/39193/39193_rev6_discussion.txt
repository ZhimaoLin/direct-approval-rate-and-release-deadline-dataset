Line:277, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> as I understand through all the code that if self.mixed_priority=False then for all buckets(default + others) we set( with force) low priority(threads=3) and we never cover default bucket's settings. I mean we can never create  bucket with default settings in our tests?

Line:135, lib/tasks/task.py -> should be also None. it's a bad practise drag behind itself all parameters for all calls

Line:37, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> I think bucket_priority in async_/create_**_bucket should be None. such methods should have default values as cluster components have & We need to be able to call it from any place with a minimum required number of parameters(default)
