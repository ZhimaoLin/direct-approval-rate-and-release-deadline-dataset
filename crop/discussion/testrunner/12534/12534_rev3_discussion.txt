Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved

Looks good Volker.  I spoke with Zackery Barr about sharing code with view tests as well, or possibly encapsulating the TestCase class with a common setup/teardown and data creation methods that can be used in both.  Not sure what your plans are, but thanks for adding these!

Patch Set 3:

Yes sharing code would be a good idea. Once these changes are in, I'd be more than happy to hand it over to you QE guys. There would be probably one base class for Views and than a subclass for Spatial Views and one for the MapReduce Views.
