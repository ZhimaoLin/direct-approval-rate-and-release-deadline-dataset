Patch Set 2: (22 inline comments)

The spacing is really inconsistent throughout (and it's kind of hard to make out some of the code with the bright red whitespace markers in Jasmin Rangel.

Line:8, resources/R/eperf_sys_helper.R -> Weirdly indented here.

Line:14, resources/R/eperf_sys_helper.R -> and here.

Line:100, resources/R/eperf.R -> This line's kind of long.

Line:51, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> The average 90th percentile?  That doesn't make much sense.

Line:74, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> This entire function looks identical to the one above.

Line:105, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> And another copy.

Line:144, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> Why is there not a space between the assignment operator and the c call, but there is a space between c and its arguments?

Line:157, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> This looks identical to the one above.

Line:179, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> Looks identical again.

Line:198, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> Another one?

Line:219, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> Another?

Line:278, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> Between these two, I like the spacing of the one above quite a bit more, except there's no need to crowd the comma.

Line:310, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> This is a hand-unrolled loop that looks identical to the hand unrolled loop above.  Why not use a regular loop twice?

Line:313, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> This is a really, really long line and has crowded commas.

Line:317, resources/R/eperf_summary_plotter.R -> This one has two spaces after one comma and none after another.  I'd suggest breaking it up into more than one line and being consistent with the commas.

Line:16, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> tab/space mix

Also, I'd suggest not shoving all the characters together and trying to get it on one line.  It's more readable if you put a space after the commas and let it wrap.

This is done many times throughout the file.  it seems that getting this right once would be a good idea.

Line:29, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> I find the space after ns_server_data and $field to be readability problem.  In general, this whole thing could be more easily expressed as a loop instead of just having the same var name twice on every line.

Or if you're going to do transform anyway, you can do it all in one single transform op.

Line:112, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> Why does finally print that there was an error?

Line:155, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> Why does finally print that there was an error?

Line:198, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> Why does finally print that there was an error?

Line:245, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> Why does finally print that there was an error?

Line:274, resources/R/eperf_data_helper.R -> Why does finally print that there was an error?
