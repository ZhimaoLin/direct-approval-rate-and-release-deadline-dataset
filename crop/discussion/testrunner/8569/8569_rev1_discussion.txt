Ketih,

i noticed that after this change the older rpms don't get removed from /tmp folder anymore and this will cause out of disk space on our test machines.
can you push in a fix which removes everything else except that specific rpm if it exists ?

Patch Set 1:

i would like the files only removed if we are actually running out of disk space. having to redownload the package over and over when there is plenty of disk space just increases the time the test takes to run

Patch Set 1:

makes sense but we need at least 3-4 GB in each machine to make sure regression runs fine because some tests ( dgm stuff ) add lot of data.

so let's make a change to remove the file if free space is less than 4 GB ?

i think right now i'll just remove all but the file that is about to be downloaded. in the future i may make this configurable.

when making the change can you add a TODO there so that we can have Karan fix it next week ?
