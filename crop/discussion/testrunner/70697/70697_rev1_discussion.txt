DESCRIPTION

CBQE-3727: A script which populates the test repo

This script will query the qe test suite couchbase cluster for conf files.
It then reads the tests within each conf file from the local filesystem which
may contain any changes made by a recent git commit.  Changes are detected by
comparing the tests from local git repo with tests stored in remote couchbase
bucket.  Changes are recorded and stored into a history bucket and then the
remote couchbase server is updated.
