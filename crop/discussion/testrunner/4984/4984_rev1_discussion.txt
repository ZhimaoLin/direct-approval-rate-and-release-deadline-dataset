DESCRIPTION

testrunner changes.this commit will not be checked in

adding a simple add-remove-rebalance test with memcachetest running
in parallel

-wrapper class for using memcachetest
-modified testrunner to allow directly loading a python test
module from pytests folder
-added __init__.py to lib and pytests folder to make them a module
(i read it on python docs to make a folder as module its okay to have
__init__.py under that folder)
-sample test case which adds nodes and rebalances the cluster while
memacachtest is runnign
-wrote a thin curl wrapper around membase rest api ( will convert these later
into python rest)
