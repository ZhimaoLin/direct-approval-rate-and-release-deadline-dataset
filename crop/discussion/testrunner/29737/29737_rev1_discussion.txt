Line:11, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> Why same build is specified three times?

Line:126, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> Why we are creating bucket here? Function name is to covert_to_hostname()? We should not change the behaviour of the function. If needed we can create wrapper function covert_to_hostname_create_bucket()

Line:137, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> test function name should be as per the objective of the test. e.g. test_verify_host_names() etc.

Line:142, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> covert_to_hostname function return hostnames of the server?

Line:167, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> No need of self in satic method. Ideally it should not self statement. Function name couldbe verify_hostnames(servers).

Line:171, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> Verifying condition should be improve, why find is used here? node_name != node.ip should be fine.

Line:11, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> I think that's ok, if we don't specify same builds we should specify number of nodes of build X and then number of nodes of build Y, so on. These tests can be run for mixed cluster

Line:126, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> create bucket in the test itself if you need it, also you can just run self._bucket_creation(), all necessary buckets will be created

Line:138, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> num_servers is len(self.servers) so
you can pass just self.servers

Line:144, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> i don't get the logic again, why we cannot here just put servrs_in = self.servers[:nodes_init]?

Line:148, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> per previous comment, second iteration will be with self.servers[self.nodes_init:self.nodes_init+self.nodes_in]

Line:151, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> what will happen with [self.servers[self.nu
m_servers-1] if i have nodes_init = 3, nodes_in =1, but in my conf file there are only 4 nodes?

Line:161, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> i think better to have restart_servers methos, I saw restarts  here at least twice

Line:171, pytests/hostnameTests.py -> this is fine, hostname can be 10.10.10.10:8091 (with port)
