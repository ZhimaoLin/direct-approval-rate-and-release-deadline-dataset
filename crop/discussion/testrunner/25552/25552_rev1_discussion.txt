DESCRIPTION

CBQE-1183 make cluster setup as celery command option

Due to this change http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/25405/,
user may restart and continue the system test with -I app.init
But we only want to setup the cluster just once, at the beginning
of the test. So we make cluster setup true or false option as celery
command option.
