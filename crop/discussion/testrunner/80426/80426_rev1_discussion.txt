Line:40, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> No users created in pre-upgrade, Need to have users pre-upgrade and then queries run through the old users. Also change permission for the per-upgrade users specially for spock roles

Line:59, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> Please create secondary index here.

Line:80, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> Why only admin and cluster admin, is this test case specific only to system admin.

Line:99, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> Same comments are first test case. have users create pre-upgrade and then have them tested post-upgrade

Line:151, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> Missing users pre-upgrade.  Please grant/change permission for pre-upgrade user as well during the test case. 
Missing secondary index

Line:377, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> Same comments as above.

Line:414, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> This test case will fail since the function you are calling are checking for assertTrue (), and in mixed more none of the rbac will be available.

Line:480, pytests/2i/upgrade_n1qlrbac.py -> Change permission for pre-ugrade users
