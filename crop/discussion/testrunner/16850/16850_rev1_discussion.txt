looks good. let's parametrize compaction ( true/false ) before checking in the code

Line:283, pytests/xdcr.py -> i think we should have enable/disable compaction by passing true/false in the conf instead of hardcoding these values in the test case

Line:283, pytests/xdcr.py -> That is a good idea. Usually the compactor should always on. We temporarily disable it just to make the test pass. Once Damien merges his fix, we shall remove this code.
