Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)

Line:17, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> self.n1ql_node is already defined in newtuq.py. instead of duplicating, we can use self.n1ql_node.

Line:22, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> we can use a dictionary here instead of if statements where key is info and value is bin directory.

Line:2680, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> We can use asserts here instead of failing the test. 
Fail represent something wrong with testcase. Assert output is a right way to validate the results in Unittest based freamework in python

Line:2684, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> log is a singleton object which doestn't belong to any method/class. It remains unchanged throughout the run. So, we don't associate self with log. We just get the current log object using getLogger method at the beginning.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:22, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> Agree. But it gets a little complicated with Windows since we need value for cmd_ext and cli_command_location. Also, retrieval of values will become complicated. Since, we do not expect more platforms than these 3, I think its okay for now.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2684, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> self.log is initialized from basetestcase.py. There is no need to declare it again in every inheriting class.
